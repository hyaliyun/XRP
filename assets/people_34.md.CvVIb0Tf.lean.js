In his duties as Rabbi of the Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, Rabbi Rabinovich maintains the historic traditional Jewish practices of the Wall as a site of orthodox Jewish prayer and ensures that notes placed in the Wall are removed and treated consistent with tradition and halakhah. He escorts visiting heads of state and foreign dignitaries during visits to the Wall, and has published on the Jewish laws and customs of the Western Wall. Rabbinic career Rabinovitch was appointed to the position of Rabbi of the Western Wall in 1995 by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the chief rabbis of Israel following the death of Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz, his predecessor as Rabbi of the Wall. Rabinovitch is the fourth occupant of the office; the first was Rabbi Yitzchak Avigdor Orenstein, who was installed by the British during Mandatory Palestine, the second was Rabbi Schechter, and the third was Getz.Eilen, Shia. \\"Interview with Harav Shmuel Rabinowitz, Rav of the Kosel\\". Hamodia Features, September 28, 2017, p. 10. Rabinovitch is responsible for maintaining the site as a sacred religious prayer space in the Jewish tradition. The Western Wall is visited by individuals of diverse backgrounds. Rabbi Rabinovitch navigates the Wall's use a religious prayer site with the interests of the civic programs of the secular Israeli state, visits by state dignitaries, religious leaders of other faiths, and diaspora liberal Jewish groups. Twice a year, Rabinovitch and his staff collect the thousands of prayer notes placed in the Wall, which they consider and treat as sacred writing that may not be disposed of with common trash, and bury them in the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. Rabinovitch has maintained the historic and traditional gender separation at the Wall, conforming to orthodox Jewish practice. In 2009, he authorized the arrest of a female political activist praying with a tallit, the Jewish prayer shawl considered men's clothing in Judaism, and holding a Sefer Torah. Rabbi Rabinowitz described this as \\"...an act of provocation that seeks to turn the Western Wall into disputed territory... A prayer that causes contention and desecration of the sanctity of the Western Wall has no value. It is an act of protest\\". Rabinovitch requests that visiting Christian clergy cover their crucifixes when visiting the Wall, and clergy of other faiths cover their symbols. In May 2008, Rabinovitch requested that a delegation of Roman Catholic clergy not visit the Wall so long as they wore visible crosses. In 2009, Rabinovitch declined the request of Pope Benedict XVI to clear the area of Jewish worshippers upon the pontiff's visit to the Western Wall. Rabinovich requested that the pope cover the cross he wears around his neck but the state Israeli diplomatic office overruled the rabbi. He escorted US First Lady Laura Bush, together with Gila Katsav, wife of President of Israel Moshe Katsav, on a visit in 2005, and Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska, in 2011. In July 2008, Rabinovitch accompanied U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama on a pre-dawn visit to the Wall. During this visit, Obama placed a prayer note in the Wall. After Senator Obama and his entourage departed, his note was removed from the Wall by a seminary student who sold it to the Maariv newspaper which published the note. Rabinovitch condemned the action of the seminary student for violating the privacy inherent in notes placed in the Wall. Rabinovitch is the chairman of The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, a government-mandated organization which preserves and develops the Western Wall site and Western Wall Tunnel, as well as promotes the value of the site through education. Rabinovitch has also headed a public commission for environmental quality, and supervision and licensing of burials in Israel. He is a former vice president of the Aleh Children's Home in Jerusalem. Published works Rabinovitch wrote the two-volume Sheilos u'Teshuvos Shaarei Tzion, describing the many halakhic questions that have arisen at the Western Wall and other holy sites.\\"Book Review: Sefer Shaarei Tzion, Volume 2\\". Hamodia, June 21, 2012, p. C2. One chapter in Volume 1 deals exclusively with the question of disposing of the prayer notes inserted in the stones of the Wall. Rabinovitch rules that burning is a \\"pure\\" way to deal with the notes, but burying them is more honorable. He is also the author of Minhagei HaKotel, a book on the history and customs of the Western Wall.

It was first performed in Haymarket theater 3 April 1764. It was supposed to have a second performance, but that performance was postponed and eventually cancelled over a lack of singers. A libretto was published for its run and a libretto with full score was published later that year. Hannah tells the story of Hannah and of her devotion to God which resulted in her being blessed with fertility by God. It was the first of two oratorio librettos written by Smart, the second being Abimelech. Background In 1763, Christopher Smart was released from Mr. Potter's madhouse.Sherbo p. 164 While working on a translation of the Psalms and of Horace's writings, Smart needed to earn money to support himself.Mounsey p. 264 He was encouraged to write a libretto in order to find employment by many of his friends who were involved with the theater and musical circles of London.Smart (1983) p. 156 The field of Oratorio appealed to Smart because of its financial benefits and its being grounded in the \\"sacred\\". Smart defined an oratorio as: > \\"a sacred opera; deducing its fable from scripture, as the opera itself > does, from profane history. This species (if rightly executed) is most > admirably calculated to fulfill the great end of drama, to make men more > virtuous; as it takes for its subject the actions of holy men, and > consequently deals much in praises and addresses to the deity. I believe our > oratorios at present in vogue, tho' not very remarkable for poetical > composition, have their good effect on the more rational and sober part of > the audience. Yet what more universal and useful effects would this species > of the drama produce, if it was to join true poetry, with true piety, and > the sacred characters introduced, were taught to speak from the head as well > as the heart? Add to this, a regularity of plan might be maintained (which > hitherto has been utterly neglected) as well as in any other dramatic piece. > In short, no subject more naturally affords the true sublime, than that of > which the oratorio consists; and consequently, an exalted genius can no > where find a more suitable or ample field, for the exercise and exertion of > his most magnificent conceptions.\\"Smart, Christopher. \\"Observations > occasioned by the Masque of Alfred\\", Student iio (March 1751), p. 223 In order to help produce his first oratorio, Smart turned to John Worgan to compose the score.Smart (1983) p. 157 Smart previous worked with Worgan when Worgan composed the score for Smart's Solemn Dirge, a poem written on the death of Frederic Prince of Wales. After the two finished, they advertised in the Public Advertiser on 21 February 1764 that Hannah would run three days at the end of March. The show was supposed to be performed on 30 March and 31 March, but it was cancelled because it was Lent and they were unable to find singers. Eventually, Hannah was performed for only one night, 3 April 1764. Hannah was supposed to run a second night and sold tickets, but the show was unable to be performed.Mounsey p. 265 An advertisement in the Public Advertiser on 1 May 1764 read: > \\"The Favourable RECEPTION of the ORATORIO of HANNAH, found from the Nobility > and Gentry who honoured it with their Presence at this Theatre, had > determined the Author to perform it again according to his first Intention, > After the Passion Week (as no Night could be found before that Time, on > which many of the principle Performers were not otherwise engaged) but on > Account of the advanced Season, and that several who had taken their Tickets > have left the Town for the Summer, he is advised by his Friends to defer the > Performance until next Winter. As several are desirous of knowing when the > Songs in this Oratorio will be published, the Author takes this Opportunity > of Acquainting the Public, that they are now Printing, and will be ready for > Sale in a few Weeks of which Notice will be given in this Paper.\\" However, there are no records of Hannah being performed during the following winter. The libretto was published by Tonson April 1764 with the score printed later that year.Smart (1983) p. 161 The text of the libretto is written in copperplate by a professional copyist and a note on the final page says, \\"This Oratorio is intended to be perform'd at the Kings Theatre in the Haymarket with the Permission of the Lord Chamberlain. Dr. Worgan for Mr Giardini [missing] the said Theatre.\\" Hannah First page of Hannah libretto The libretto begins with an \\"argument\\" that gives a summary of the story of Hannah who, through her devotion to God, was allowed to give birth to Samuel.Smart (1983) p. 164 Immediately following, there is a disclaimer that reads: > \\"The only Liberty Mr. Smart has taken with the sacred Story is that he has > introduced the Song of Hannah as a Thanksgiving immediate upon her > acceptance in Shiloh, whereas it was not composed till after the Birth of > Samuel. This Liberty he humbly hopes is more pardonable than the total > Omission of so pious and beautiful a Piece.\\"Smart (1983) p. 165 However, rearranging the timing of biblical events was not the only liberty taken with the story; the libretto emphasizes Peninnah's fertility and jealousy along with Elkanah's benevolent treatment of Hannah.Dearnley p. 219 The oratorio begins with Peninnah singing: :When Abraham threw himself upon his Face :To worship God Almight, in return :Came Blessing down for Blessing ‚Äì On his Loins :It came, from whence a Matron of her House :Stands forth, Peninnah; whose unnumber'd Progeny :Are known to him which calculates the Stars, :And tells the Total of the golden Grain :That borders boundless Ocean ‚Äì O for Musick, :And every Form of Joy to bless and praise. ::(Hannah 1‚Äì9) The character of Peninnah uses her fertility as an excuse to mock Hannah in a manner more \\"earthly\\" than sacred.Dearnley p. 214 The earthly mannerisms of Peninnah and her maids were emphasized in the oratorio for \\"theatrical effect\\".Dearnley p. 218 However, the themes of fertility and barrenness are also important aspects for Smart's poetic theme. The Handmaid to Peninnah emphasizes these themes when she sings: :Far other is the Lot of her, that shares :A nobler Portion of her Husband's Bounty, :The highly-favour'd Hannah; for her Honour :Is not hereafter in the sweet Idea :Of Self continued in a genuine Race. ::(Hannah 16‚Äì20) =Roles= * Elkanah * Eli * Levite of Elkanah's household * Hannah * Peninnah * Handmaid to Peninnah *Chorus of Priest and Damsels, and other Attendants Critical response A review in the St. James's Magazine claimed for the libretto \\"some poetical merit\\"St. James's Magazine, Vol IV (1764) p. 285 but William Kenrick, a rival of Smart's, could not hold the poem as high.Kenrick, William. \\"Reviews of Nabal and Hannah\\" Monthly Review Vol. XXX (1764) p. 325 A biographer of Worgan claimed that the play lasted only one night because of Handel's popularity in London at the time, and \\"It is owing to this iniquitous idolatry that the oratorio of Hannah struggled into light, and soon disappeared. The adorers of Handel would not hear of oratorios composed by Arne, Worgan, and Arnold\\".\\"Memoir of the Life of John Worgan\\", Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review Vol V (1823) pp. 118‚Äì119 However, the biographer didn't just blame Handel, but followed Kenrick's assessment when he said, \\"Hannah teems with resplendent beauties, but is enfeebled by the doggrel of poor Kit Smart.\\" NotesReferences * Dearnley, Moira.

Abimelech was the second of two oratorio librettos written by Smart, the first being Hannah written in 1764. Just like Hannah, Abimelech ran for only one night, each time. It was to be Smart's last work dedicated to an adult audience. Abimelech retells the biblical story of Abraham and Sarah when they met the King of Gerar, Abimelech, and he tries to take Sarah as his wife. After God intervenes in a dream, Sarah, who was previously barren, is restored to Abraham and made fertile. The oratorio emphasizes the sexual jealousy and the sexual fidelity of spouses. Background Years before, Smart wrote a libretto for an oratorio called Hannah.Sherbo p. 245 Like Hannah, Smart most likely wrote the work out of a need to earn money.Anderson p. 49 However, his previous oratorio only lasted a few nights, and Smart hoped that his second could succeed where the other failed. This would be the last work in Smart's final years that was written completely for adults.Anderson p. 109 An advertisement for Abimelech ran in the \\"Musical Intelligencer\\" section, of the Public Advertiser, on 16 March which said: > \\"YOUNG Abimilech will be exercised on Foote's Theatrical Heath on Wednesday > next, when he will run three Trial-heats. He was bred by the celebrated Kit > Crazy, who rode flying Pegasus the great Match round the Hop-Garden and who > is universally allowed to be a SMART Fellow, and a tolerable Psalmodist. > Abimilech is half Brothers to Saul, which beat Sampson on Friday 19th of > February, tho' the Odds in the upper half of the Scaffold were Three and a > Half to One. Abimilech has been a long while in Training under little > Arnold, a Man of sound-Knowledge, who tho' of a diminutive Size, hath such > amazing Strength in his Composition, that, when he gets with his Airs, he > will seize on any Man alive, and take him by the Ears.\\"Mounsey p. 270 Abimelech was performed once at the Theatre Royal on 18 March 1768 and once, after Smart's death, at Covent Garden on 25 March 1772.Smart (1983) p. 160 There are no surviving scores for Abimelech, but the libretto was sold during its run at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, in 1768 and the run of the revised version of the oratorio at the Covent-Garden in 1772.Smart (1983) p. 161 These works were published anonymously but Charles Burney, Smart's friend, attributes the libretto to Smart and pasticcios from Handel in his General History of Music.Burney, Charles. General History of Music. Vol IV, London: 1789. p. 666 The \\"pasticcios\\" were musical selections from Handel used by the composer Samuel Arnold. Abimelech First page of Abimelech libretto Abimelech tells the story of Abraham and Sarah at Gerar (Genesis 20) in three acts.Smart (1983) p. 158 Although there are multiple versions of the story with different characters, Smart relies on the version in which Abraham pretends that Sarah is his sister, and the king of Gerar, Abimilech, wishes to marry her.Smart (1983) p. 159 God intervenes by telling Abimelech that Sarah is married and should be returned to Abraham; Abimelech returns Sarah to Abraham but criticizes Abraham for lying. The oratorio leaves out the final portion of Abimelech's biblical story in which Sarah is made fertile by God along with Abimelech's women. There is an emphasis on the sexual jealousy of Abraham over Abimelech's treatment of Sarah.Dearnley p. 215 This was partly done for \\"theatrical effect\\".Dearnley p. 218 However, there is also an emphasis on the impious actions of the Gentiles of Gerar and of their inability to love properly,Dearnley p. 223 especially when Hagar sings: :Lo, her ears :Have suffer'd profanation from the lips :Of an enamour'd Gentile - Couldst think, :That men remoter from the truth of God, :And more of brutal nature, should controul :Their appetite from such a form as Sarah's? ::(Abimelech 94-99) As the oratorio continues, there is emphasis that only those who follow the true God are capable of understanding the proper ways to act.Dearnley p. 224 =Roles= * Abraham * King Abimelech * Phichol Chief Captain * Sarah * Hagar * Queen of Gerar * Officers, Soldiers, and other Attendants Critical response After the second version of Abimelech ran at the Covent-Garden, a reviewer in The Theatrical Review claimed that the oratorio was changed \\"greatly for the better\\".The Theatrical Review, Vol. II (1772) p. 219 Another review in The Theatrical Review claimed that Abimelech was \\"a very pleasing Oratorio, though there is great sameness in the songs, but the chorusses are masterly and grand\\".Stone Jr., G. (editor). The London Stage 1660-1800: Part 4, 1747-1776. Carbondale, 1962. p. 1619 Later, Thomas Busby claimed that \\"the applause obtained by this his second oratorical production [Abimelech], established the reputation of its composer [Arnold]\\".Busby, Thomas. A General History of Music. Vol II, London: 1819. p. 468 The Monthly Review and Critical Review ignored Abimelech, which prompted Arthur Sherbo, a later critic, to claim that they \\"were kind to Smart and Arnold\\" for their silence.Sherbo p. 246 Another later critic, Moira Dearnley, said, \\"devotion and human relationships is uneasy, not to say ridiculous.\\"Dearnley p. 217 Another critic, Frances Anderson, puts it bluntly: \\"it was not reprinted and seemed of mediocre quality\\". However, this turned out to be untrue. NotesReferences * Anderson, Frances E. Christopher Smart. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1974. 139 pp. * Dearnley, Moira. The Poetry of Christopher Smart.

This has nothing to do with the concept of the will to survive used in psychology, which is being discussed further below in this article, since Schopenhauer was talking about the basic unit behind doing or thinking anything at all, not the basic drive behind running or fighting under life- threatening conditions (which in his terms would be a dissimulation of the mere blind striving for existence without goal, that is, a theatrical performance of Nature in its ever changing forms of matter). There are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of distress.\\"Understanding the Will to Live in Patients Nearing Death\\".

Concept In psychology, the will to live is the drive for self-preservation, usually coupled with expectations for future improvement in one's state in life.\\"Will to Live.\\" McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. 28 Nov. 2017 https://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/will+to+live The will to live is an important concept when attempting to understand and comprehend why we do what we do in order to stay alive, and for as long as we can. This can be related to either one's push for survival on the brink of death, or someone who is just trying to find a meaning to continuing their life. Some researchers say that people who have a reason or purpose in life during such dreadful and horrific experiences will often appear to fare better than those that may find such experiences overwhelming.Frankl, V. E. (1963). In Man's search for meaning. Boston: Beacon Press. Everyday, people undergo countless types of negative experiences, some of which may be demoralizing, hurtful, or tragic. An ongoing question continues to be what keeps the will to live in these situations. Some people that claim to have experienced instances of the will to live, have many different explanations behind it.Grohol, J. (2009). The Power of the Will to Live. Psych Central. Retrieved on November 21, 2012, from http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/12/28/the-power-of-the-will-to-live Background The will to live is considered to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud termed the pleasure principle, which is the seeking of pleasure and avoiding of pain. Viktor Frankl, after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called logotherapy, or the \\"will to meaning\\". Maslow's hierarchy of needs highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live. Psychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges.  Similarity to self-preservation  Self-preservation is a behavior that ensures the survival of an organism. Pain and fear are integral parts of this mechanism. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. Fear causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of adrenaline, which has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see: defence mechanism.) Even the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat. An example is the dodo, which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them. Correlations ‚ÄúExistential, psychiatric, social, and, to a lesser degree, physical variables are highly correlated with the will to live‚Äù. Existential issues found to correlate significantly include hopelessness, the desire for death, sense of dignity, and burden to others. Psychiatric issues found to be strongly associated are such as depression, anxiety, and lack of concentration. Physical issues that showed the strongest associations were appetite and appearance which did not show the same consistent degree of correlation. The four main predictor variables of the will to live changing over time are anxiety, shortness of breath, depression, and sense of well-being which correlate with the other variable predictors as well. Social variables and quality of life measures are shown to correlate significantly with the will to live such as support and satisfaction with support from family, friends, and health care providers. Findings on the will to live have suggested that psychological variables are replaced by physical mediators of variation as death draws nearer. The will to live has also proven to be highly unstable. Research Many studies have been conducted on the theory of the will to live. Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one‚Äôs will to live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger will to live and strengthened or stable will to live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak will to live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication. The second study presented the idea of the will to live in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained will to live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the will to live, lived the longest while high will to live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of will to live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories. Other accounts of the will to live exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and is a good example of this as well.Goldenberg, J. Retrieved from http://www.councilforrelationships.org/resources/goldenberg-survival.pdf A proposed mechanism for the will to live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one‚Äôs risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.Goode, E.

Their purpose was to transport soldiers to overseas service. History There were only two Stratford class vessels, both built by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. They were both apparently built for commercial service on the Great Lakes as freighters in about 1918, and operated as commercial vessels between the wars. Shortly before America's entry into World War II, two ships were requisitioned by the US Navy. The first ship, USS Stratford, was commissioned in August 1941 and the second, USS Gemini, in August 1942. Initially designated as cargo ships (AK), they were both converted to transports (AP) shortly after commission and hence became the Stratford class transports. Both ships were initially assigned to convoy duty to Iceland in 1942, and then later took part in operations against the Japanese in the Pacific until the end of the war. Both were decommissioned in 1946. Gemini subsequently returned to commercial service, in Norway. Stratford was scrapped in 1956.

The reagent is named after Manfred Schlosser, although he uses the term LICKOR superbase (LIC denoting the alkyllithium, and KOR denoting the potassium alkoxide). The superbasic nature of the reagent is a consequence of the in situ formation of the corresponding organopotassium compound, as well as changes to the aggregation state of the alkyllithium species. Preparation and reactivity Commonly, the mixture called Schlosser's base is produced by combining n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide in a one-to-one ratio. The high reactivity of Schlosser's base is exploited in synthetic organic chemistry for the preparation of organometallic reagents. For example, potassium benzyl can be prepared from toluene using this reagent. Benzene and cis/trans-2-butene are also readily metalated by Schlosser's base. Toluene, benzene, and butenes react only slowly with alkyllithium reagents and not at all with potassium alkoxides, yet they react rapidly with a mixture of the two. Although there are similarities, the reactivities of Schlosser's base and the isolated alkylpotassium reagent are not identical. Structure The structure of Schlosser's base is complex. A study of the base prepared from neopentyllithium (neo-C5H11Li) and potassium t-butoxide (t-BuOK) has led to the spectroscopic and crystallographic identification of a series of constituent bimetallic clusters: > LixKy(neo-C5H11)z(t-BuO)w, x + y = z + w = 7 or 8, in equilibrium with neopentylpotassium (neo-C5H11K) and lithium t-butoxide (t-BuOLi).

Commonly, this involves verbally counting the beats in each measure as they occur, whether there be 2 beats, 3 beats, 4 beats, or even 5 beats. In addition to helping to normalize the time taken up by each beat, counting allows easier identification of the beats that are stressed. Counting is most commonly used with rhythm (often to decipher a difficult rhythm) and form and often involves subdivision (elaborated on in later passages). Introduction to Systems - Numbers and Syllables The method involving numbers may be termed count chant, \\"to identify it as a unique instructional process.\\"Improving Rhythm Reading in Middle School Band, p. 36, Lewis H Strouse, Teaching Music; Apr 2007; 14, 5; ProQuest Direct Complete, pg. 35. Example of \\"count chant\\" method In lieu of simply counting the beats of a measure, other systems can be used which may be more appropriate to the particular piece of music. Depending on the tempo, the divisions of a beat may be vocalized as well (for slower times), or skipping numbers altogether (for faster times). As an alternative to counting, a metronome can be used to accomplish the same function. Triple meter, such as , is often counted 1 2 3, while compound meter, such as , is often counted in two and subdivided \\"One-and-ah-Two-and-ah\\"Blatter, Alfred (2007). Revisiting music theory: a guide to the practice, p.26. . but may be articulated as \\"One- la-lee-Two-la-lee\\". For each subdivision employed a new syllable is used. For example, sixteenth notes in are counted 1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a, using numbers for the quarter note, \\"&\\" for the eighth note, and \\"e\\" and \\"a\\" for the sixteenth note level. Triplets may be counted \\"1 tri ple 2 tri ple 3 tri ple 4 tri ple\\" and sixteenth note triplets \\"1 la li + la li 2 la li + la li\\".Harnum, Jonathan (2004). Basic Music Theory, p.68-70. . Quarter note triplets, due to their different rhythmic feel, may be articulated differently as \\"1 dra git 3 dra git\\". Rather than numbers or nonsense syllables, a random word may be assigned to a rhythm to clearly count each beat. An example is with a triplet, so that a triplet subdivision is often counted \\"tri-pl-et\\".Nokes, Mark (2009). However, when voiced \\"tri-pl-et\\" sounds as \\"tri-plet\\"; ergo, an extra sound added to the word triplet can be more effective and truly a three syllable word -- \\"tri-pa-let\\". Modern Guitar Method: A Practical Approach, p.35. . The Kod√°ly Method uses \\"Ta\\" for quarter notes and \\"Ti-Ti\\" for eighth notes.

Downbeats within a measure are called 1, 2, 3‚Ä¶ Upbeats are represented with a plus sign and are called ‚Äúand‚Äù (i.e. 1 + 2 +), and further subdivisions receive the sounds ‚Äúee‚Äù and ‚Äúuh‚Äù (i.e. 1 e + a 2 e + a). Musicians do not agree on what to call triplets: some simply say the word triplet (‚Äútrip-a-let‚Äù), or another three-syllable word (like pineapple or elephant) with an antepenultimate accent. Some use numbers along with the word triplet (i.e. ‚Äú1-trip-let‚Äù). Still others have devised sounds like ‚Äúah-lee‚Äù or ‚Äúla-li‚Äù added after the number (i.e. 1-la-li, 2-la-li or 1-tee-duh, 2-tee- duh). _Example_ The folk song lyric \\"This Old Man, he played one, he played knick-knack on my thumb, with a knick-knack paddy whack, give my dog a bone, this old man came rolling home\\" in time would be said, \\"one and two one and two one and two and one and two and uh one and two ee and one ee and uh two one and two and one and two.\\" = Traditional American system = Counts the beat number on the tactus, & on the half beat, and n-e-&-a for four sixteenth notes, n-&-a for a triplet or three eighth notes in compound meter, where n is the beat number. = Eastman System = The beat numbers are used for the tactus, te for the half beat, and n-ti-te-ta for four sixteenths. Triplets or three eighth notes in compound meter are n-la-li and six sixteenth notes in compound meter is n-ta-la-ta-li-ta. = Froseth System = Counting system using n-ne, n-ta-ne-ta, n-na-ni, and n-ta-na-ta-ni-ta. All three systems have internal consistency for all divisions of the beat except the tactus, which changes according to the beat number.  Syllables Systems  Syllables systems are categorized as \\"Beat Function Systems\\" - when the tactus (pulse) has certain syllable A, and the half-beat is always certain syllable B, regardless of how the rest of the measure is filled out. = French System = The French \\"Time-Names system\\", also called the \\"Galin-Paris-Cheve system\\", originally used French words. Toward the middle of the nineteenth century the American musician Lowell Mason (affectionately named the \\"Father of Music Education\\") adapted the French Time-Names system for use in the United States, and instead of using the French names of the notes, he replaced these with a system that identified the value of each note within a meter and the measure. * Whole Note: Ta-a-a-a *Half Note: Ta-a *Quarter Note: Ta *2 Eighth Note: Ta Te *4 Sixteenth Notes: Tafa Tefe See also: Rhythm - French Times Names = Kod√°ly Method = *Whole Note: Ta-a-a-a or ta-o-o-o *Half Note: Ta-a or ta-o *Quarter Note: Ta *1 Eighth Note: Ti *2 Eighth Notes: Ti-Ti *4 Sixteenth Notes: Ti-ri-ti-ri *Eighth Note Triplet: Tri-o-la *Eighth Note followed by a Quarter Note and another Eighth Note: Syn-co-pa = Ward Method = * Whole Note: Lang-ng-ng-ng *Half Note: Lang-ng *Quarter Note: La *2 Eighth Notes: Lira *Dotted Quarter followed by Eighth: La-ira = Edwin Gordon System = Usual Duple Meter *Whole Note: Du-u-u-u *Half Note: Du-u *Quarter Note: Du *2 Eighth Notes: Du-De *4 Sixteenth Notes: Du-Ta-De-Ta Usual Triple Meter *Dotted Quarter Note: Du *3 Eighth Notes: Du-Da-Di *6 Sixteenth Notes: Du-Ta-Da-Ta-Di- Ta Unusual meters pair the duple and triple meter syllables, and employ the \\"b\\" consonant. = Takadimi = The beat is always called ta. In simple meters, the division and subdivision are always ta-di and ta-ka-di-mi. Any note value can be the beat, depending on the time signature. In compound meters (wherein the beat is generally notated with dotted notes), the division and subdivision are always ta-ki-da and ta-va-ki-di-da-ma. The note value does not receive a particular name; the note‚Äôs position within the beat gets the name. This system allows children to internalize a steady beat and to naturally discover the subdivisions of beat, similar to the down-ee-up-ee system. _Example_ The folk song lyric \\"This Old Man, he played one, he played knick-knack on my thumb, with a knick-knack paddy whack, give my dog a bone, this old man came rolling home\\" would be said, \\"tadi ta tadi ta tadi tadi tadi tadimi tadi takadi takadimi ta tadi tadi tadi ta.\\"  Examples of Simple Meter Rhythms (Takadimi)  File:Whole note.gifWhole Note = ta-a-a-a File:Half note.gifHalf Note = Ta-a File:Quarter note.gifQuarter Note = Ta File:Figure rythmique deux croches lien bas.svgTwo Eighth Notes = Ta-Di File:Sixteenth note run.pngFour Sixteenth Notes = Ta-Ka-Di-Mi File:Eighth rest.gif File:Eighth note (crop).gif Eighth Rest + Eighth Note = X-Di File:Eighth note (crop).gif File:Sixteenth note.gif Eighth Note + Two Sixteenth Notes = Taaa-Di-Mi File:Sixteenth note.gif File:Eighth note (crop).gif Two Sixteenth Notes + Eighth Note = Ta-Ka-Diii  Examples of Compound Meter Rhythms (Takadimi)  File:Dotted whole note.svgDotted Whole Note = Ta-a-a-a File:Dotted half note with upwards stem.svgDotted Half Note = Ta-a File:Dotted quarter note with upwards stem.svgDotted Quarter Note = Ta File:Eighth note (crop).gif Three Eighth Notes Beamed Together = Ta-Ki- Da File:Eighth note (crop).gif File:Eighth rest.gif Eighth Note + Eighth Rest + Eighth Note = Ta-X-Da File:Sixteenth note.gif Six Sixteenth Notes = Ta-Va-Ki-Di-Da-Ma File:Eighth note (crop).gif File:Sixteenth note run.png Eighth Note + Four Sixteenth Notes = Ta-aa-Ki-Di-Da-Ma File:Sixteenth note run.png File:Eighth note (crop).gif Four Sixteenth Notes + Eighth Note = Ta-Va-Ki-Di-Da-aa File:Sixteenth note.gif File:Eighth note (crop).gif Two Sixteenth Notes + Eighth Note + Two Sixteenth Notes = Ta-Va-Ki-ii-Da-Ma = Takatiki = This is a beat-function system used by some Kod√°ly teachers that was developed by Laurdella Foulkes-Levy, and was designed to be easier to say than Gordon's system or the Takadimi system while still honoring the beat- function. The beat is said as \\"Ta\\" in both duple and triple meters, but the beat divisions are performed differently between the two meters. The \\"t\\" consonant always falls on the main beat and beat division, and the \\"k\\" consonant is always when the beat divides again. Alternating \\"t\\" and \\"k\\" in quick succession is easy to say, as they fall on two different parts of the tongue, making it very easy to say these syllables at a fast tempo (much like tonguing on recorder or flute). It is also a logical system since it always alternates between the same two consonants. _Duple Meter_ *Whole Note: Ta-a- a-a (no added accent on each beat) *Half Note: Ta-a (no added accent on each beat) *Quarter Note: Ta *2 Eighth Notes: Ta-Ti *4 Sixteenth Notes: Ta-Ka-Ti-Ki *Sixteenth Note Combinations: Ta---Ti-Ki, Ta-Ka-Ti---, Ta-Ka---Ki *Eighth Note followed by a Quarter Note and another Eighth Note: Ta-Ti---Ti *Eighth Note Triplet: Ta-Tu-Te *Rests: (silent) _Triple Meter_ *Dotted Half Note: Ta-a-a- (no added accent on each beat) *Dotted Quarter Note : Ta- *3 Eighth Notes: Ta- Tu-Te *Eighth Note Combinations: Ta----Te, Ta-Tu----- *6 Sixteenth Notes: Ta- Ka-Tu-Ku-Te-Ke *Sixteenth Note Combinations: Ta--Tu-Ku-Te, Ta-Ka-Tu---Te, Ta-- Tu--Te-Ke *Rests: (silent) = Ta Titi = *Whole Note: Toe / ta-ah-ah-ah *Dotted Half Note: Toom / ta-ah-ah *Half Note: Too / ta-ah *Dotted Quarter Note: Tom / ta-a *Quarter Note: Ta *1 Eighth Note: Ti *2 Eighth Notes: Ti-Ti *Eighth Note Triplet: Tri-o-la *2 Sixteenth Notes: Tika / Tiri *4 Sixteenth Notes: TikaTika / Tiritiri *2 Sixteenth Notes and 1 Eighth Note: Tika-Ti / Tiri-Ti *1 Eighth Note and 2 Sixteenths: Ti-Tika / Ti-Tiri This system allows the value of each note to be clearly represented no matter its placement within the beat/measure _Example_ The folk song lyric \\"This Old Man, he played one, he played knick-knack on my thumb, with a knick-knack paddy whack, give my dog a bone, this old man came rolling home\\" would be said, \\"titi ta titi ta titi titi titi ti-tiri titi tiriti tiritiri ta titi titi titi ta\\" = Down-ee up-ee = Beats are down, up-beats are up, subdivisions are ‚Äúee‚Äù but‚Ä¶ need more info! _Example_ The folk song lyric \\"This Old Man, he played one, he played knick-knack on my thumb, with a knick-knack paddy whack, give my dog a bone, this old man came rolling home\\" would be said, \\"down up down down up down down up down up down up down up-ee down up down-ee-up down-ee-up-ee down down up down up down up down.\\"  Mixed Numbers and Syllables Systems = McHose/Tibbs = 1 2 3 4, 1 te, 1 ta te ta  Other systems = Orff system = Using words See also *Count off *Half-time (music) *Bol - a Hindustani (north indian) system of rhythm syllables. *Konnakol - a Carnatic (south Indian) system of rhythm syllables. *√âmile-Joseph-Maurice Chev√© *Poll - \\"Elementary General Music Educators: Which system do you use to teach rhythm ?\\" SourcesExternal links * http://www.takadimi.net Ear training Rhythm and meter ","title":"Counting (music)"},{"id":"18606629","text":"Virginia Capital Trail The Virginia Capital Trail (VCT) is a dedicated, paved bicycle and pedestrian trail crossing four counties and between Jamestown and Richmond, Virginia -- that is, between the Colony of Virginia's first capital and Virginia's current capital. Construction on the trail, informally called the Cap Trail, or simply the Cap, began in 2006 and completed in October 2015.http://virginiacapitaltrail.org/trail/map/ Its zero mile marker at Jamestown is directly adjacent to Jamestown Settlement and near the foot of the Colonial Parkway -- a scenic road linking Jamestown, Williamsburg and Yorktown. At Richmond, the trailhead is next to the James River at the downtown flood gates of Great Shiplock Park. The VCT largely parallels Virginia Route 5, a Virginia Scenic Byway, with its own physically separated, asphalt-paved lane -- including its own lane on the Dresser Bridge over the Chickahominy River. The trail, which crosses Route 5 at marked intersections, ranges in width from eight to ten feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) and is dedicated exclusively to non-motorized pedestrian and bicycle use. In many locations it is surrounded by deep woods and separated from the road by a vegetation barrier -- crossing about 30 wood bridges and varying from mostly flat toward Jamestown and mostly rolling toward Richmond. At Varina, near Richmond, the trail passes through Four Mile Creek Park and makes a 3.5-mile horseshoe- shaped diversion around the Route 5 and I295 interchange. Amenities along the largely rural, wheelchair-accessible path include parking areas, restrooms, shelters, fix-it stations with tethered tools and air pumps -- as well as private restaurants, gas stations, food vendors, bike rental and tour companies. Points of interest include parks and wildlife habitats as well as numerous prominent historic monuments, buildings (including former homes of Presidents John Tyler, William Henry Harrison, and Benjamin Harrison) and plantations (including Shirley and Berkeley Plantations). 44 historical markers along the route describe 400 years of political, social, military, and economic history. Near Richmond the trail passes through an area of riverfront adaptive reuse developments where former industrial factories have been converted to loft apartments and offices. Before ending under flyovers of Interstate 95 near Richmond's Shockoe Bottom area, the trail passes through The Low Line, a landscaped linear park under an active, elevated CSX rail trestle. A private shuttle services partial or one-way users. The Virginia Capital Trail Foundation hosts an annual fund raiser bike ride, marketed as The Cap2Cap. As of early 2019, more than 50 trained volunteers serve as Capital Trail Ambassadors -- identifying hazards (gravel, poor signage, etc) and providing information, directions, mechanical assistance and minor medical attention. The trail is part of the 4,228-mile TransAmerica Trail as well as the Historic Coastal Route of the East Coast Greenway. The VCT is a working partnershiphttp://www.virginiadot.org/projects/newcaptrail_welcome.asp of the Virginia Capital Trail Foundation (VCTF), a tax exempt organization which promotes the path, and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), which built and maintains it. The VCT was largely purpose-built over 12 years as a multi-use trail, with a small portion near downtown Richmond converted from a previous rail bed. The trail cost approximately $75 million to construct -- with approximately $70 million from federal funding and $5 million from state and local funding. VDOT maintains a system of seven realtime trail counters, which received 550,000 counts its first completed year and more than 1,4 million counts as of mid-2018 -- with a daily average of 300. In 2016, the VCT won the Urban Land Institute's Lingerfelt Award for Best Overall Project and the ULI's award for Best Community Impact -- as well as Virginia Commonwealth University's Excellence in Virginia Government Public-Private Partnership Award. In 2017, the trail received the Scenic Virginia Scenic Tourism Award. Development In 2003, Virginia's Secretary of Transportation (now former state delegate), Whitt Clement, a Danville, Virginia native, had witnessed the positive impact of the Danville Riverwalk Trail. Clement developed financial support for the VCT, an idea that been developing for more than a dozen years, and developed bipartison support to have an area adjacent to Route 5 surveyed. He subsequently founded Virginia Capital Trail Foundation, a nonpartisan advocacy partner to provide expertise, raise public awareness, seek funding and contributions as well as to promote the trail. The project received the support of the state's four successive Virginia governors. * 1975: The Commonwealth Transportation Board designates Route 5 as the Commonwealth‚Äôs second Virginia Byway. * 1991: Formal legislation recommends including bicycle lanes on Route 5 and preserving the scenic character of Route 5. * 1996: VDOT requests proposals to study a bicycle path between Williamsburg and Richmond. * 1997: VDOT initiates feasibility study. * 1999: Feasibility study completed, with a preferred trail alignment along Route 5. * 2003: Whitt Clement obtains initial funding. VDOT begins a survey of the proposed trail. * 2004: Federal enhancement funds are received for the first two segments of the trail in James City County.

Sections Mileage is signaled in single mile markers along the trail in seven groups, color coded to sections which roughly reflect construction phases, here listed from Jamestown to Richmond: *Greensprings (2.4 miles - open 2006) *Chickahominy (4.8 miles - open 2007) *Sherwood Forest (13 miles ‚Äì open 2014) *Charles City Courthouse (7.3 miles ‚Äì open 2009) *New Market Heights (10.3 miles ‚Äì open 2015) *Varina (11.3 miles ‚Äì open 2015) *Richmond Riverfront (.8 miles and 1.5 miles, open 2010 and 2015) Williamsburg and expansion Despite the mission of the VCTF being to connect Richmond and Williamsburg, the VCT currently has its eastern terminus in Jamestown, and does not extend to Williamsburg. Users can reach Williamsburg by the Colonial Parkway or other routes without a dedicated pedestrian or bike lane. A dedicated trail connecting mile marker zero of the VCT and Williamsburg is under study as the Birthplace of America Trail (BoAT) -- envisioned as two, thirty mile trails connecting the VTC with both a proposed South Hampton Roads Trail and a trail to Fort Monroe. The VCT is proposed to the currently planned Appomattox River Trail, a 9.9 mile moderately trafficked pedestrian, bicycle and pet-friendly trail near Petersburg, Virginia.

Its status has, however, been challenged, and (as of 2008) remains uncertain. It is believed to date from 1770, and may have been written in Milan or Bologna, if it is a genuine Mozart work. An early manuscript from Vienna attributes the work to Wolfgang, but nineteenth-century copies of the score attribute it respectively to Leopold Mozart and to Carl Dittersdorf. Neal Zaslaw writes: \\"A comparison of the results of two stylistic analyses of the work's first movement with analyses of unquestionably genuine first movements of the period by the three composers suggests that Wolfgang is the most likely of the three to have been the composer of K73q\\".Zaslaw, pp. 175‚Äì77Dearling, p. 71 The symphony is in three movements, lacking a minuet and trio.

Records show him also as the author of a technical report and a census on the tobacco industry in Colombia for Instituto Nacional de Fomento Tabacalero (INTABACO).Censo tabacalero de Colombia, 1961 - WorldCat Castellanos was a member of the conservative party and occupied several provincial and national positions, among them Secretary of Government (Departmental Interior Secretary) under Santander Governor Rafael Ortiz Gonzales during the period leading to the political crisis of April 1948. From his governmental positions Castellanos Tapias was instrumental, together with other Santander leaders, in promoting the founding of the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), a prominent Colombian university, of which he was the third rector from November 1949 to March 1951. Historia de la UIS After studying industrial statistics with an ONU scholarship in the United States and Canada, he intervened in the founding and was the leading executive of the Departamento Nacional de Estad√≠stica (National Department of Statistics), the forerunner of today's DANE (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad√≠sticas). Castellanos was also leading assistant to the minister of Agriculture and on occasion, acting Minister of Agriculture. Later, he was the leading executive (Gerente General) of the Instituto Nacional de Fomento Tabacalero (INTABACO). Castellanos was founder and publisher of the short-lived \\"La Naci√≥n Agr√≠cola\\" magazine. Towards the end of his life, he was also a notary, judge and the president of the Directorio Conservador in Barrancabermeja, Santander. While living in Barrancabermeja, Castellanos Tapias was made a full member (\\"Miembro de N√∫mero\\") of the Academy of History of Santander and was chosen to preside over the founding of the Centro de Historia de Barrancabermeja, the local chapter of the Academy of History of Santander.  El Alzamiento  The 1962 novel El Alzamiento shows the influences of the French Annales school of historiography, that came to Castellanos Tapias through his history teacher at Colegio de Santander, Jos√© Fulgencio Guti√©rrez. The epic 1781 uprising of the peasants from Santander and Boyac√° against Spanish abuses is depicted through the lives of a family of humble tobacco growers. When they run afoul of the Spanish taxation agents, the crop is destroyed, their home is planted with salt and burned to the ground, and the head of the family is thrown in jail. Destitute, the wife descends into madness and goes around town chanting the local couplets that by then foretell the coming insurrection. With an eye to the social forces bubbling up to threaten Spanish colonial power and faithful to historical detail, the novel fleshes out the characters of the women and men that led the insurrection and suffered the ensuing repression afterwards. The priests preach humility while averting their eyes away from the authorities' crimes. The \\"criollo\\" middle classes, the future \\"heroes\\" of the national independence from Spain, take advantage of the triumphant movement to help themselves, later on turning their backs and delivering the peasant leaders to be executed. Amid despair and hopelessness, the novel ends with the peasant youngsters on the verge of a guerrilla attack on incoming Spanish forces, a clear reference to the political dynamics of Colombia which by the time the novel was written had taken the form of insurgent guerrilla movements.

Appleton and his wife, the former Martha O'Driscoll bought land in the Ocala area during the mid-1970s and established Bridlewood Farm, a thoroughbred breeding and training facility. Construction of the Appleton Museum of Art began in 1984 on 44 acres of forested land on East Silver Springs Boulevard in 1984. Under the guidance of Mr. Appleton and Museum Director, Moussa Domit, who brought a more cultured and experienced perspective, the building eventually opened to the public in 1987 as the Appleton Museum of Art.

History  Kempston & Elstow was one of three halts opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1905 between Stewartby and Bedford. Their opening coincided with the introduction of a steam railmotor on the Varsity Line, and each was conveniently sited alongside a level crossing. Kempston Halt, as it was known until 1908, was constructed close to \\"Cow Bridge\\", an old road bridge which carried the present A421 over a tributary of the River Great Ouse. All three halts were opened on the same day and all were simultaneously temporarily closed as a First World War economy measure in 1917, reopening two years later only to close again in 1941 during the Second World War. This time, however, only one - Kempston Hardwick - was to reopen, the others officially closing as from February 1949. The crossing near the station was manned by a crossing keeper from 1846 to 1868 when the diversion of the road by the Midland Railway led to the removal of the crossing.

It was the main staging area for the Boston Port of Embarkation, with about a million U.S. and Allied soldiers passing through the camp on their way overseas or returning for demobilization after the war. It was also a prisoner-of-war camp. Immediately after the war, it was considered as a candidate site for the United Nations Headquarters. History The city of Taunton was notified in June 1942 by the War Department that would be taken for use as a military staging area. The design of the layout for the camp was made by the J.F. Worcester Company. The Matthew Cummings Company of Boston received the contract to construct the buildings. The camp opened on October 8, 1942 and was named in honor of Myles Standish who was the first military commander of the Plymouth Colony region. Camp Myles Standish was the main staging area for the Boston Port of Embarkation where American soldiers as well as soldiers from Canada, Great Britain and Australia processed before moving to the European Theater of World War II, or after returning to the US for demobilization. The camp covered and could accommodate 1,298 officers and 23,100 enlisted personnel. As such, a quartermaster was set up so an entire division could be prepared for deployment within a day. Often, divisions would go to Africa or Iceland. This made train traffic understandably chaotic, with trains regularly coming into town from Providence, Rhode Island, Springfield, Massachusetts and Boston.http://www.lodico.org/mike/html/mansfield- emigration-2.html The yard itself, run by the New Haven Railroad, contained about ten miles of track.http://www.kinglyheirs.com/NewYorkStateRailroads/TroopTrain1.html German soldiers who were captured during the war were detained at this camp. Also, Italian soldiers were detained there as well although they were considered 'co-belligerents' because Italy had surrendered by the time the Italian soldiers arrived at Camp Myles Standish. The camp closed in January 1946 following World War II. The site of Camp Myles Standish was briefly considered as a possible site for the United Nations. There are several buildings that were once part of Camp Myles Standish that still remain standing as of 2009. Redevelopment Massachusetts took it over from the federal government to create the Myles Standish State School for the Mentally Retarded. The patients of the institution were housed in the former hospital area for the former army camp. In 1951, Governor Paul A. Dever was instrumental in providing for over two dozen new brick buildings on the south part of the former army camp site as the new campus for the metally retarded patients of the Myles Standish State School. Following the death of former Governor Paul A. Dever, the Myles Standish State School was dedicated in memory of Paul A. Dever. The City of Taunton acquired over of the former army camp in 1973 for the purpose of constructing a modern industrial park. The Myles Standish Industrial Park has continued to expand and has become one of the most successful industrial parks in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

History  A Corima Puma road bike Corima was founded in 1973 by Pierre Martin and Jean-Marie Riffard in Loriol-sur-Dr√¥me. Corima is taken from COoperation RIffard MArtin. Its initial activities were making moulds and models for the foundry, automobile and aeronautics sectors. In 1988, Corima diversified into carbon composite parts and its first product for cycling : the disc wheel. This was followed by the 4-spoke wheel, the Puma monocoque frame, the Aero wheel, the Ellipse seatpost and others to create a range of carbon products. In 1994, Corima expanded to frames, achieving success with the Puma, an aerodynamic carbon monocoque road frame with a steeply sloping top tube, based on the custom track frame ridden by Chris Boardman in 1993. However, production was discontinued in 1999, due to revised UCI rules that rendered the Puma's geometry inconsistent with racing frame guidelines. This banning from competition meant limited exposure and sponsorships. Corima continued making a track frame with similar geometry and sloping top tube - the Cougar - until it was replaced by the VIF frame. The Fox was another carbon frame, primarily for triathlon, time trial and track racing. It too incorporated aerodynamic geometry, though different from the Puma and the Cougar. Two world hour records have been broken on Corima bikes: Chris Boardman in July 1993 and Catherine Marsal in April 1995.  Products  Corima's current product line include: Aero: A deep, aerodynamic profile wheel for triathlon and time trial racing. Winium: A light, shallow profile wheel road racing. Cyclocross: A light and strong wheel for cyclocross racing. 4-Spoke: A carbon racing wheel with four aerodynamic spokes. 3-Spoke: A carbon racing wheel with three aerodynamic spokes.

The Mercury train sets were designed by the noted industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss, and are considered a prime example of Streamline Moderne design. The success of the Mercury led to Dreyfuss getting the commission for the 1938 redesign of the NYC's flagship, the 20th Century Limited, one of the most famous trains in America. The first Mercury, operating on a daily roundtrip between Cleveland and Detroit, was introduced on July 15, 1936. The Chicago Mercury, between Chicago and Detroit, and the Cincinnati Mercury, between Cincinnati and Detroit, followed. The Mercurys lasted until the 1950s, with the final survivor, the original Cleveland Mercury, making its last run on July 11, 1959. A fourth train, the James Whitcomb Riley between Chicago and Cincinnati, used the same design for its train sets and is considered part of the Mercury family, although it did not bear the Mercury name. The Riley debuted in 1941 and lasted into the Amtrak era, though no longer a streamliner. Design In the mid-1930s, the New York Central launched an experiment to enhance its passenger traffic in the midwest. The goal was a new streamlined service focusing on speed and innovation. \\"Mercury,\\" the name of the Roman god of messengers, was chosen for its connotations of speed; the name was announced to the public on May 14, 1936. The new train was marketed as the \\"Train of Tomorrow\\" Reprinted article originally appeared in the Ottawa Citizen. (not to be confused with the General Motors concept train of the same name in the 1940s), reflecting the emphasis on innovation. In 1934, Dreyfuss had gained attention for the New York Central with his streamlined design for the Commodore Vanderbilt locomotive. This was his first railroad design; he was best known for his work on consumer products like telephones, fountain pens and vacuum cleaners. In 1935, the Central asked him to take on the new project. Here is his description of how the plan developed: The train's first cars were rebuilt from surplus suburban commuter coaches like those that Dreyfuss saw unused. =Locomotive and Exterior= One of the Mercury Hudson locomotives Of Dreyfuss's railroad designs, the locomotives got the most notice, so much so that his work on passenger cars is often overlooked entirely. For the Mercury, he achieved a streamlined appearance by covering the exterior pipes, whistles, and other fittings in a smooth \\"bathtub\\" cowl. The sides of the cowl were cut away to show the driving wheels. The lights illuminating the driving wheels was a novel concept and purported to be the first of their kind. The Mercury trains also incorporated roller bearings on their axles, which helped them reach their speed limit of , but also made them harder to stop. Although in service the speed would be restricted to 80 mph, it was reported that the train's top speed was over . It has been said that, \\"As opposed to [some of his] contemporaries, Dreyfuss was not a stylist: he applied common sense and a scientific approach to design problems.\\" However, it can be seen from his treatment of the driving wheels that Dreyfuss was not above paying close attention to merely stylistic, non-functional details. The exterior of locomotive and cars was medium gray with brushed aluminum trim. On each side, the passenger cars displayed the Mercury logo in the form of a silver medallion, showing the god Mercury in traditional representation with winged cap and sandals. =Interior= For the Mercury, Dreyfuss, approached the design of the train as an integrated whole, interior and exterior, from the locomotive to the rear observation car. His goal was to recreate the atmosphere of a private club. His primary concern toward that end was to mitigate the rigid uniformity and long, narrow form of the conventional railroad car. Although each car was functionally separate, Dreyfuss's design minimized the divisions between cars. He did this partly by having interior sections that spanned car boundaries. For instance, the coach section comprised the rear of the first car, the whole of the second, and the forward part of the third. The kitchen was in the rear of the third, while the dining room was in the following car. He also sought to integrate the cars by the design of the vestibules. He made each vestibule semi-circular and widened the passageway between cars to 1.60 meters (5 feet, 3 inches). The intended effect, when cars were coupled together, was of a single circular room, like a miniature rotunda. Fabric and rubber buffers between cars and above bogie springs were also added to reduce vibrations. Within cars, Dreyfuss applied several techniques to break up the space and make it less linear. In the second car, for instance, he interrupted the rows of seating by placing two pairs of seats facing each other across the aisle in the middle of the coach section. Similarly, in the sixth, a parlor car, he broke the seating into two sections with a small private compartment, seating six, in between them. The dining room had three sections. Two of them were conventional seating, but the middle section was made up of tables for two people seated side-by-side, facing the center aisle. The dining car also had a small lounge section, seating six, for people waiting to be seated. Dreyfuss also applied innovation to the round-ended observation car, a common amenity of premier trains of the time. To maximize the view, he lowered the sills in the observation area by 30 cm (12 inches), allowing 1.23 m (four foot) high windows. Instead of having the seating around the walls, facing in, he placed the seating in the center, facing out towards the windows. There were banquettes for three facing each side, and one for two facing the rear. In an extra touch, a speedometer was built into the center banquette, a reminder of how the Central was marketing speed with the Mercury.

For the demonstration runs in early July 1936, the two coaches between the dining and lounge cars were omitted.

The train was displayed and christened in Indianapolis on June 25, then made exhibit stops from Indianapolis to New York City, where it was displayed for two days at Grand Central Terminal on June 28 and 29. In Chicago, it was estimated that about 17,250 people viewed the train in one day when it was on display on July 6 at LaSalle Street Station. Revenue service for the Cleveland Mercury, with only a stop in Toledo between its two end points, began on July 15, 1936. By September 1936, New York Central found that the new Mercury service did not impact the ridership on other trains it operated between those two cities. It proved so popular that another train was built and displayed in Indianapolis in October 1939; it was built for the Chicago Mercury and was introduced in regular service on November 12, 1939. These two train sets serviced both Cleveland Mercury and Chicago Mercury service, but the schedule was such that one train set began the day in Cleveland, ran to Detroit as the Cleveland Mercury, and ran from Detroit to Chicago as the Chicago Mercury, while the other set did the reverse run (the eastbound Chicago Mercury arrived in Detroit after its westbound counterpart had left, so the NYC would have needed an extra train set, if it had not shared sets across trains). The Cleveland run was on a 2:50 hour schedule and the Chicago run took 4:45. The James Whitcomb Riley was introduced on April 28, 1941, running between Cincinnati and Chicago on a 5:15 hour schedule. It was named after the popular poet because of his association with Indiana and Americana. The equipment was basically the same as the other Mercurys, although it was an all-coach train. The Cincinnati Mercury, running between Cincinnati and Detroit on a 6:30 schedule, followed the Riley into service. After World War II, the Mercury trains were re-equipped with new lightweight cars. In February 1950, the westbound Detroit-Chicago Mercury was suspended due to coal shortages while the eastbound counterpart remained in service. The cancellation was the result of an Interstate Commerce Commission order to all railroads still using coal- powered locomotives to reduce services. Service was restored on the westbound route in March 1950. The Mercury was touted as one of six convenient passenger trains between Detroit and Chicago (with the Wolverine, Michigan, Twilight, Motor City Special and North Shore Limited) with \\"departure and arrival times made most convenient for you.\\" The Mercury trains operated at speeds up to throughout their service career. The Cincinnati Mercury was the first to fall as rail service contracted, eliminated in October 1957.October 1957 New York Central timetable, Table 23 http://www.canadasouthern.com/caso/ptt/images/tt-1057.pdf The Chicago Mercury was eliminated in April 1958.April 1958 New York Central timetable, Tables 9, 10 The Cleveland Mercury was discontinued on July 11, 1958. The Riley was retained, although it was no longer a streamliner. In 1971, Amtrak combined the Riley with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway's George Washington. The combined service was renamed Cardinal in 1977, which is still running to this day. = Accidents and incidents = Because the trains regularly operated at speeds of , accidents occurred at level crossings along their routes. The Mercury's inaugural run between Detroit and Cleveland saw a collision that killed the automobile's driver. In another accident in Michigan in 1940, the train hit a car at a level crossing, completely destroying the car and killing the driver; the wreckage was pushed about from the scene of the collision. In another incident in Ohio in 1938, a truck crossing the track in front of a Mercury train was struck and thrown several hundred feet from the collision site. The Mercury was also used in an apparent suicide attempt in Niles, Michigan, in December 1940. Not all level crossing collisions led to death, such as happened in 1958 near Millbury, Ohio, when a car stalled on the track in front of the Mercury; the driver and passenger of the car were able to jump before the car was destroyed with only the passenger's coat getting caught and torn off. The railroad's Commodore Vanderbilt shared part of the route with the Mercury in Ohio. This was a factor in a 1938 collision where the Mercury had hit a car at a crossing, then stopped to investigate; while the Mercury was stopped, the Commodore Vanderbilt, which had been only 5 minutes behind the Mercury by schedule, collided with the rear of the Mercury, resulting in at least 50 people injured, some seriously. Includes a photo of the Vanderbilt locomotive against the Mercury observation car. The engineer of the Vanderbilt had applied the brakes when the signal changed in front of him, but wet rails were attributed as the cause of wheel slipping preventing the Vanderbilt from coming to a stop. This was one of several major passenger rail accidents in the United States in 1938, which followed a period of three years when only 10 fare-paying passengers were killed on major rail systems in the country. The Mercury was also affected by other incidents on the system, such as on July 25, 1957, when a freight train derailed 22 cars at Ceylon in Erie County, Ohio. The derailment scene was severe enough that New York Central rerouted all of its major passenger trains over a lesser-used branch line to bypass the accident. The detour made the Mercury one hour late that day.

History = Spanish conquest and the Dominican friars= On his second visit to Guatemala, in 1537, friar Bartolome de las Casas, O.P. wanted to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cob√°n, reaching as far as Chahal. Through the efforts of Las Casas' missionaries the so-called \\"Land of War\\" came to be called \\"Verapaz\\", \\"True Peace\\". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitl√°n and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Francisco Marroquin who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission. = Franja Transversal del Norte = The first settler project in the Franja Transversal del Norte (FTN) was in Sebol-Chinaj√° in Alta Verapaz. Sebol, then regarded as a strategic point and route through Cancu√©n river, which communicated with Pet√©n through the Usumacinta River on the border with Mexico and the only road that existed was a dirt one built by President L√°zaro Chac√≥n in 1928. In 1958, during the government of General Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financed infrastructure projects in Sebol.Sebol finally adopted the name \\"Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas', municipality created in 1983 in Alta Verapaz. In 1960, then Army captain Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia inherited Saquixquib and Punta de Bolonc√≥ farms in northeastern Sebol. In 1963 he bought the farm \\"San Fernando\\" El Palmar de Sejux and finally bought the \\"Sepur\\" farm near San Fernando. During those years, Lucas was in the Guatemalan legislature and lobbied in Congress to boost investment in that area of the country. In 1962, the DGAA became the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INTA), by Decree 1551 which created the law of Agrarian Transformation. In 1964, INTA defined the geography of the FTN as the northern part of the departments of Huehuetenango, Quich√© , Alta Verapaz and Izabal and that same year priests of the Maryknoll order and the Order of the Sacred Heart began the first process of colonization, along with INTA, carrying settlers from Huehuetenango to the Ixc√°n sector in Quich√©. The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Decree 60-70 in the Congress, for agricultural development. = African oil palm = African oil palm plantation areas in Guatemala as of 2014. There is a large demand within Guatemala and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which would explain how the African oil palm became so prevalent in the country in detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to large capitals in a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of Guatemala. The investors are trying to turn Guatemala into one of the main palm oil exporters, in spite of the decline on its international price. The most active region is found in Chisec and Cob√°n, in Alta Verapaz Department; Ixc√°n in Quich√© Department, and Sayaxch√©, Pet√©n Department, where Palmas del Ixc√°n, S.A. (PALIX) is located, both with its own plantation and those of subcontractors. Another active region is that of Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas and Chahal in Alta Verapaz Department; El Estor and Livingston, Izabal Department; and San Luis, Pet√©n, where Naturaceites operates.

Wood emigrated from Newent Parish in Norwich, Connecticut to Bennington, Vermont. From Bennington he moved to Rutland County in 1761. Wood may have been influenced by the Newent Separates of Norwich, who believed in perfectionist immortalism and spiritual wifery, and the preaching of Rev. Joel Benedict, who taught that Hebrew was the angelic tongue.Brooke, 57-8. See divine language on angelic tongues. Wood was excommunicated from the local Congregationalist church in 1789. Subsequently, he began to preach to small meetings whose attendees were mostly family and relatives. Wood claimed literal descent from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and to possess the powers of revelation. After coming into contact with a treasure seer by the name of Justus Winchell, the New Israelites commenced looking for buried treasure and embarked on the construction of a temple. The group employed the divining rod for both treasure hunting and other forms of revelation. It was suspected that these efforts masked a counterfeiting operation. Wood predicted the arrival of a \\"Destroying Angel\\" that would bring down plagues and earthquakes upon the \\"gentiles.\\" For this reason one might arguably call the New Israelites a Millennarian group. The locals were so alarmed that on the night in question the militia was called out. When this apocalypse failed to occur, Wood and his family moved to Ellisburg, Jefferson County, New York.

Plot summary The plot is set in the post-World War II years with the paranoia of communism and the background of heroism and treachery in Nazi-controlled Europe. John Emmett managed to avoid fighting in the war because he was a chemist in a safe but useful state-side post. However, both of his older brothers fought and died in the war, and he has questions about his untested courage. The novel starts with Emmett stalled out in a small town outside Chicago, his car having died. He is on a cross-country journey to California to a new job. He spots a young woman at the service station and makes a pitch to hitch-hike with her. To his surprise, she agrees. She is Ann Nicholson, and over the course of the novel it is revealed that she is the daughter of a rich industrialist from Chicago, and she was married to a French man before the war, and during the war she fought in the French resistance until she was captured and tortured by the Gestapo. As the car journey continues, Emmett is approached in a diner by a man and woman, who reveal that they are Ann's psychiatrist and his nurse. They were keeping an eye on her in Chicago but Ann suddenly bolted in the car and started driving cross-country. It is revealed that there was a murder in Chicago, an Army Air Force pilot who knew Ann and her husband in Nazi- controlled France, who had accused her of betraying her resistance group and her husband. Confronted with this, Ann claims to have amnesia after a point in her interrogation by the Gestapo, and she is driving to New Mexico where a male scientist who was a prisoner in the same interrogation camp with her can maybe tell her what happened and help her remember if she betrayed her husband. Along the way, Ann reacts badly by an attempt to detain her by a small town sheriff, putting her and Emmett's life at risk. Emmett is resentful of her, attracted to her, pities her, feels admiration for her, and is generally conflicted about his opinion of her. He decides to leave her in a town outside Denver, but changed his mind and returned, only to find her dying of an overdose. She is brought back, and her father and the psychiatrist rally about her, pushing Emmett away. He has more conversations with the nurse and FBI agents and is getting ready to continue on with his journey, but finds that Ann ran away and is hiding out in a fishing camp he had mentioned that he had a reservation for. He goes out to her, and determines that this time he is not leaving her, and he will get her to the scientist in New Mexico to completer her journey. There are people who try to stop them and he brutally attacks one on the road. Emmett realizes that he has no recognizable stakes in the game, so he bullies Ann into marrying him. Part of the reason is that Ann's father has been considering putting her in a mental hospital to sweep her out of the way for a while, because he is under investigation for war profiteering, and because her father believes she did kill the pilot in Chicago, even though the police have reluctantly stated she is in the clear. By marrying her, Emmett can prevent Ann from being tucked away in a quiet corner and forgotten. The couple finally make it to New Mexico, and push the FBI into letting Ann visit with the scientist, Dr. Kissel, the refuge from Europe. The FBI are interested in Dr. Kissel and the people who might be trying to contact him, accusing Ann Nicholson of being a communist agent. The FBI make a show of reluctantly letting Ann meet with Dr. Kissel, where upon he tells her she was brave and did not break, unlike himself. Ann breaks down at that point, and is pulled from the meeting. As they are driving away, Ann tells the FBI agent that Dr. Kissel is a fake. Emmett reasons that she couldn't tell that because of appearance, because a half-tortured prisoner will look markedly different from a healthy but damaged person, so she could only know that he is a fake, a communist agent, because she did break and betray her French husband and the resistance. She had been faking her amnesia to try to buy a little time for herself, to prevent the truth from coming out in an instant in Chicago. The novel ends with Ann shown to be a scared but strong person who broke under torture, Emmett still believing in her and maybe loving her, and her father offering Emmett a job in South America which would get the two out of the country for awhile. The FBI now know Dr. Kissel is a communist agent, and can feed the Soviet Union false information. Film adaptation Filmed as 5 Steps to Danger in 1957 starring Ruth Roman and Sterling Hayden.

Bigeard and his regiment were sent to hunt down the Commando after it had carried out several successful ambushes against French units. They met at Agounennda where the French paratroopers tried to ambush the FLN force, but the FLN discovered the French and instead concentrated their force against an outlying French company. Bigeard managed to redeploy and surround the FLN force; it withdrew successfully albeit with heavy casualties. However, the French were unable to recover large caches of weapons - the FLN having taken them off the field. The battle altered FLN tactics, reminding them that they were unable to meet the French in open battle. Conversely, it gave the French renewed confidence in a military victory. However, sceptics on both sides saw it as evidence that neither faction would ever gain ascendancy in the other's arena. The FLN avoided military combat with the French, relying on guerilla warfare.. Background In early May 1957, Commando 41 (‚ÄòAli Khodja‚Äô) of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) routed a Dragoon unit, killing 60 men while only losing 7 men themselves. Roughly two weeks later, on 21 May, the same unit ambushed a detachment of the 5th Algerian Tirailleur Battalion near M√©d√©a. A captain and 15 tirailleurs were killed in the engagement, while others where persuaded to defect, the FLN only lost 1 killed and 2 wounded. Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Bigeard and his 3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment (3e RPC) - recently returned from successful operations in Algiers - were tasked with hunting down the unit and stopping it. French intelligence suggested that the unit would move west, tasked with escorting commanders of Wilya 4 to a rendezvous with other FLN forces near M√©d√©a. Bigeard decided to ambush Commando 41 on their way and picked Agounenda on the Oued Boulbane, a known FLN route. Bigeard and the 3e RPC was transported by truck from their base at Sidi Ferruch to Hill 895, where they arrived by 01:30 on 23 May. From there Bigeard and his 700 paratroopers made a cold, 4-hour night approach march under strict noise and light discipline. Before dawn the paratroopers was in place and concealed. The Headquarters and mortars were on Hill 1298; the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Companies and the Reconnaissance Squadron on foot were spread over 10 km on four crests overlooking the enemy‚Äôs probable route. The 4th and Support Companies were in reserve, while helicopters and ground-attack aircraft were on stand-by at M√©d√©a. Battle Bigeard, a popular leader and veteran of Dien Bien Phu,. led his men personally on the field having returned from the Battle of Algiers only days before. At 10:30 the most northerly and exposed company, the 3rd ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù Company under Captain Llamby, radioed in that they had sighted a large FLN force approaching his position above the north bank of the Oued Boulbane from the east; the company opened fire at 10:45. The forewarned Si Azzedine, leading a column of at least three companies, was attempting to outflank the 3rd Company from the north. Captain Llamby and his 100 men, outnumbered three to one, came under intense pressure. The helicopters in reserve at M√©d√©a were already on their way, Bigeard ordered the Support Company to be lifted onto the high ground north of 3rd Company. The first sticks jumped from the helicopters at 10:55 and the whole Support Company was in action by 11:30. Meanwhile, 1st and 2nd Companies force-marched on foot to support the 3rd Company, helicopters lifted the unengaged Reconnaissance Squadron and 4th Company to a position slightly northeast of the battle between 3rd Company and the FLN force. The FLN force took the low-lying Oued Boulbane, but was dominated from higher ground by the French paratroopers: 3rd, 4th and Support Companies from the north of it and 1st and 2nd Companies plus the Headquarters from the south. In a series of running battles over an area of some 30 square kilometres that lasted 48 hours, Commando 41 and at least two other katibas made several vigorous counterattacks which came to hand-to-hand fighting. Despite support from tactical aircraft, the paratroopers were too thinly stretched to maintain a tight cordon; around 200 FLN fighters managed to slip away through the cracks. Aftermath The FLN left behind 96 dead and 12 prisoners, but managed to withdraw with most of their wounded, while the French paratroopers lost 8 killed and 29 wounded, they also managed to free 5 prisoners. The French were also unable to recover large caches of weapons - the FLN having taken their guns with them. Despite the high FLN casualties, the French only recovered 45 weapons from the battlefield. The French was encouraged by the success air portability on the battlefield. The FLN on the other hand learned that large- scale engagements in the heart of the country had to be avoided at all costs. Other observers draw more pessimistic conclusions for the French, because if an elite unit like the 3rd Colonial Parachute Regiment with a great commander like Marcel Bigeard failed to score a total victory on their own terms, was there much hope of winning at all?

In 1909, a post office was established at Valley Falls. The office was located near the base of Abert Rim. The first postmaster was Ernest L.H. Meyer. However, Jennings later took over from Meyer. At its peak, the community of Valley Falls had a hotel, livery stable, and a dance hall in addition to the Jennings' store and post office. The area was surveyed for a railroad, but it was never built. In 1942, the post office was moved approximately one mile west to the junction of U.S. Route 395 and Oregon Route 31. The Valley Falls post office was closed in 1943.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

Geography  The unincorporated community of Valley Falls is located at the junction of U.S. Route 395 and Oregon Route 31 in the high desert country of Lake County in south-central Oregon. There are only five structures at the site. The main business is a combined gas station and store, located on the west side of the highway, south of the junction. There is also a recreational vehicle park and a guest ranch nearby.

Geology  Abert Rim seen from Valley Falls Abert Rim is approximately one mile east of Valley Falls. The rim is one of the highest escarpments in the United States, rising above the valley floor. The top is a sheer-cliff. The rim cliff runs over from north to south, making it the longest exposed block fault scarp in North America. The rim is basalt, formed by large lava flows during the Miocene epoch. After the lava flows stopped, large blocks faults broke and tilted the land. Abert Rim is the result of one of those giant faults.\\"Lake Abert and Abert Rim\\", Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 16 July 2014.Brogan, Phil F., \\"Escarpment Reach to Clouds\\", East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 282.

The story follows the relationship between Yuiko, an animal lover, and Leo, a childish young man who has problems adapting because everyone considers him a beast. It was serialized in Shogakukan's Betsucomi magazine from September 2006 to February 2007. Shogakukan later collected the individual chapters into two bound volumes under the Flower Comics imprint. Viz Media licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. Plot Yuiko Kubozuka is a high school student who loves animals, though unfortunately, animals hate her and flee from her whenever possible. When Leo Aoi, a strange student with a terrifying expression, transfers to Yuiko's class, she is surprised to learn that he is actually innocent and sweet-natured and animals are easily drawn to him. However, when attacked, Leo unconsciously becomes as violent as a bloodthirsty animal. Because Yuiko is the first to see beyond his frightening expressions, Leo quickly becomes strongly attached to Yuiko, who is his first friend. They fall in love with one another, but circumstances regarding Leo's family situation threaten to separate them. Characters ; : A 17-year-old girl who loves animals, though they are fearful of her because of her overly-loving approach to them. She is easy-going and well-liked by her peers. One day she meets Leo Aoi when she chases a lost cat up the tree (because of her overly adoring nature) and he saves it. The two almost immediately develop a close relationship, mainly because she is the only person who is not scared of him. She accepts Leo's secret and becomes the only person able to tame him. She soon comes to love him. In school, she is known as the \\"Beast Master\\" for her ability to contain Leo. Her father is a veterinarian and her family runs a veterinary clinic. ; : A 17 going on 18-year-old boy whose sharp eyes resemble those of a beast. Despite his looks, he is cute and childish. He cares deeply for Yuiko as she is his first friend and he soon falls in love with her. When Leo sees blood, his animalistic alter-ego emerges. In these moments, Yuiko is the only person able to stop him without resorting to tranquilizer darts. Leo is clueless about many things because he has been living in remote locations for most of his life. He is forced to move around because of threatening relatives who want the large inheritance of 120 billion yen he is revealed to have later in the series. His father arrives to move him shortly after an attack by one of his relatives, but instead of running, he comes back to Yuiko. ; : Kyle is Leo's caretaker and he loves him greatly. He was originally the secretary of Leo's late grandfather, from whom Leo receives his inheritance. He used to be in the military, which may explain his strength. His character provides a great deal of the manga's humor. Manga Beast Master was written and illustrated by Kyousuke Motomi. It was serialized in Shogakukan's monthly sh≈çjo manga magazine Betsucomi from the October 2006 issue (released in September) to the March 2007 issue (released in February).

It includes a small military airstrip known as Bradshaw Army Airfield. Description The area of is the largest United States Department of Defense installation in the state of Hawaii, or anywhere in the Pacific. The region was used for live fire exercises in 1943 during World War II when Camp Tarawa temporarily held troops on Parker Ranch. About were leased from Richard Smart, owner of the ranch. At that time it was called the Waikoloa Maneuver Area, and located northwest of current base, south of Waimea. In September 1946 the land used for the old maneuver area and camp was returned to the ranch, and a smaller Lalamilo Firing Range used until 1953. Since coastal areas were developed into tourist resorts, military areas were moved inland to more remote locations. Location The name of the current facility comes from puu p≈çhaku loa, which means \\"long rocky cinder cone\\" in the Hawaiian Language, although like many other Hawaiian names, the same name has been used for other places on the island. P≈çhakuloa Training Area lies in a high plateau between lower slopes of Mauna Kea to approximately in elevation and to about on Mauna Loa. The training area is about midway between Hilo, on the east coast and the Army landing site at Kawaihae Harbor.Pahakuloa Training Area page at Marine Corps Base Hawaii web site It is used by both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The only road access is via the Saddle Road (Hawaii Route 200), which is paralleled by a tank trail. Heavy equipment is either flown into Hilo, or else shipped via barge to Kawaihae Harbor, about away on the Saddle Road. Because of this remoteness, the area is used mostly for short training sessions. Facilities The barracks for about 2,000 troops were constructed in April 1955 from prefabricated buildings used in World War II. The support area includes of logistic and administrative facilities. In July 2006 an additional were purchased from Parker Ranch in an area known as Ke ªƒÅmuku, which means \\"cut-off lava\\" in Hawaiian, from to the 19th century lava flows through the area.

Its remoteness allows a wide range of weapons to be used. The 25th Infantry Division and 3rd Marine Regiment often use the base for four to six-week training periods. Environmental problems Weapons such as the Davy Crockett nuclear rifle with dummy warheads and depleted Uranium have been used at PTA. After initial denials, an investigation concluded the spotting rounds used in the 1960s. Measurements detected radiation, but reportedly not above life-threatening levels. Entrance to Bradshaw Army Airfield Two Native Hawaiians were suing the Department of Land and Natural Resources, saying the state has breached its duty to protect ceded lands at the Pohakuloa Training Area. Bradshaw Army Airfield The airstrip was constructed at the area from 1955 to 1956 and dedicated Aug of 1957, by the then Commanding General of the 25th Inf. Div. The runway is only long, which only accommodates small aircraft. Fog often restricts helicopters, which can also fly in from the larger bases on Oahu. Environment Vegetation varies from sparse grassland and low shrubs to open mƒÅmane forest. Despite the volcanic terrain, some of the areas contain protected wildlife. Within the borders of the training area, ten different endangered species can be found. These include the native Hawaiian mint honohono (Haplostachys haplostachya) and the shrub 'kio'ele (Kadua coriacea). This area has more endangered species than any other US Army installation.Pohakuloa Training Area on GlobalSecurity.Org web site The northeastern portion of the site near Mauna Kea provides habitat for the endangered bird Palila (Loxioides bailleui), for example.

Its location on the crossing of some of Leuven's most famous and most touristic spots makes the Grote Markt one of the city's busiest squares. However, it has been pedestrian-friendly for some years; only public transportation buses from De Lijn are allowed to use the square. Buildings View of the Great Market Square in Leuven by Wolfgang de Smet, c. 1667 This location is one of the oldest and most historic in all of Leuven. The square has existed in its present form since the 14th Century, when the Old University of Leuven was established. Most of the square's buildings are built in the Gothic style, of which the town hall is a prime example. Other buildings on the Grote Markt are the Church of St. Peter and several guild houses. As throughout Leuven, there are also many pubs, taverns, and eateries on the Grote Markt. There is a significant contrast between the more formal and traditional style establishments on the Grote Markt and the more trendy, youth-oriented and student entertainment spots on the nearby Oude Markt. Events The Grote Markt is often used for cultural and other events, as is the case for Leuven's other big squares, such as the Oude Markt and the Ladeuzeplein (Ladeuze Square), =Flower Carpet= The Grote Markt with left the Town Hall and right the Church of St.-Peter One yearly event is the transformation of the Grote Markt into one large carpet of flowers. Each year celebrates a particular theme, such as 2007's Bicentennial of the Leuven Fire Department. In 2005, an administrative mistake caused the yearly flower carpet, completely made of begonias that year, to coincide with the opening and start of the local cycling contest, named after Jef Scherens. To avoid having the cyclists start their contest out of the middle of the carpet of flowers, Mayor Louis Tobback proposed a compromise: the cyclists would start their race from the outskirts of the square instead of the center and as compensation the theme of that year's flower carpet would be the Tribute to Cycling. =Summer Events= Being a university town, Leuven undergoes a drastic decrease in its usual population when thousands of students go home for the summer. For the last 20 odd years, the city of Leuven tries to compensate for the lack of students (along with their associated social activities) by organizing a number of summer events. Some of these taking place on the Grote Markt, among other spots in town, are: * Beleuvenissen - weekly concerts on Friday nights in July, with themes such as salsa, tropical, jazz, blues. * Hapje-Tapje (literally: a little snack - a small drink, approximately pronounced in English: hap-yeh, tap-yeh) - a gastronomical market during which participating restaurants set up stalls on the streets and squares of Leuven and offer small plates of their best food for a bargain price. =Planting of the Maypole= One of the oldest events is the planting of the Maypole which, in contrast with the British version, is not a pole as such but an actual tree, in Leuven usually a large birch tree. The origin of the Maypole celebration in Leuven is a century old dispute between the neighboring cities of Leuven and Brussels: The tradition goes back seven centuries and according to the local folklore commemorates a victory of Brussels over Leuven, although others claim the origin was a wedding ceremony during which a nobleman from Leuven married a lower class girl from Brussels. The nobleman gave money to celebrate the patron saint of Lawrence of Rome and plant a Maypole in his honor. Of course, the legend is told slightly differently in Brussels then in Leuven: One day in the year 1213 a wedding was held in a pub in Brussels. During the festivities, the guests noticed a gang of troublemakers from Leuven. A fight broke out and just when the wedding guests from Brussels were losing the fight, some members of the guild of St. Lawrence came to their rescue. The Leuven gang lost and John III, Duke of Brabant gave the guild members permission to plant a Maypole each year on August 9; but this privilege would be lost if ever the people of Leuven managed to capture the tree before 5 PM.

Work on the series started during D√ºrer's first trip to Italy (1494‚Äì95), and the set was published simultaneously in Latin and German at Nuremberg in 1498, at a time when much of Europe anticipated a possible Last Judgment at 1500.

The layout of the cycle with the illustrations on the recto and the text on the verso suggests the privileging of the illustrations over the text. The series brought D√ºrer fame and wealth as well as some freedom from the patronage system, which, in turn, allowed him to choose his own subjects and to devote more time to engraving.

Background The Krein family was steeped in the klezmer tradition; his father Abram (who moved to Russia from Lithuania in 1870) was a noted violinist. All of the seven Krein brothers received their first musical training from him and became musicians; Alexander and Grigori made names for themselves as composers, David gained a strong reputation as a violinist. Of the three Krein family composers, Alexander, his brother Grigori, and Grigori's son Julian, it is Alexander who composed the most music and thus to whom the most attention has been paid. After decades of posthumous neglect, however, his very name seems to have disappeared from international reference books. Studies and career In 1896, at the early age of 14, Alexander Krein entered the Moscow Conservatory where his studies included cello classes with Alexander von Glehn and composition lessons with Sergei Taneyev and Boleslav Yavorsky. His first works were published by P. Jurgenson in 1901. During the years immediately prior to the 1917 Revolution, he was on the faculty of the People's Conservatory in Moscow. In 1917, he was appointed as director of the artistic wing of the Muzo-Narkompros, the music section of a newly formed ministry of arts and education. Throughout the 1920s, Krein was widely regarded as the leader of a Jewish national school in Russia (which included his brother Grigori and his nephew Julian). Among those he influenced were minor composers such as Sinovii Feldman. After the formation of the Soviet Union, he held a variety of official and semi-official music administration posts. He died April 1951 in Staraya Ruza. His son, Alexander Kron, was a Soviet playwright. Style Krein's pioneering spirit had led him to incorporate the intonations and styles of both sacred and secular Jewish music into a relatively advanced idiom that was as influenced by French impressionism as it was by the music of his friend Alexander Scriabin.Jonathan Powell. 2003. Liner notes of the CD Songs from the Ghetto on ASV / Sanctuary Classics DCA1154. Krein's own Jewish heritage was a constant source of inspiration; there are a number of instrumental works whose titles bear quite obvious witness to this, such as the Caprice Hebraique, Op. 24, and the Jewish Sketches for clarinet and string quartet. In 1921, he composed Kaddish for tenor soloist, choir, and orchestra. From the mid-'20s on, he also wrote music for plays given by Moscow's Jewish Drama Theater. There is also a large amount of music that is either purely classical in design or Soviet in nature. In the latter category are works like the revolutionary opera Zagmuk (1930), the Threnody in Memory of Lenin (1925), and the somewhat amusingly titled U.S.S.R., Shock Brigade of the World Proletariat (1925).

Located on the south shore of the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River which serves as the Baltimore Harbor, it was owned by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company, created by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which had operated a major waterfront steel mill outside Baltimore to the southeast at Sparrows Point, Maryland in rural Baltimore County since the 1880s. The yard is now the location to the west of several heavy industrial firms with a focus on petro-chemicals, a later Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which endured into the 1990s, and the underground south entrance of the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, built in 1956-1957, carrying Interstate 895 and the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway through and under the city in the major East Coast thoroughfare. Bethlehem- Fairfield was one of two new emergency shipyards, established by the Maritime Commission under the Emergency Shipbuilding program, in 1941. The other shipyard was the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, Portland, Oregon. Because Baltimore Harbor is so old (dating to 1706) there was not sufficient space to build both the shipways and the fabrication plant in the same waterfront area. The fabricating plant was only less than two miles away further south in adjacent Curtis Bay at a former George Pullman railroad car wheel foundry dating from 1887, greatly expanded in 1916, with massive huge shops before World War I, but now empty during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This proved an advantageous situation though, which was better than other shipyards on the East Coast whose fabricating plants were usually located some further miles away. This allowed for easy transportation by railroad cars of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad through its Curtis Bay Yards of the preassembled components and other sections needed for the assembly of the ship hulls to the storage yard at Fairfield where they would later be moved by cranes to one of the 13 ways used for erecting the ships, this was later expanded to 16 ways. Additional thousands of temporary wood-frame style barracks were constructed plus standardized brick row homes and housing projects soon filled woods and meadows of the neighboring Brooklyn-Curtis Bay-Fairfield-Wagner's Point waterfront communities dating to 1853 / 1887 / 1890s in southern Baltimore city, recently annexed in 1919 from neighboring rural Anne Arundel County On 27 September, 1941, Fairfield hosted Liberty Fleet Day, with the launching of their first Liberty Ship, .

He is also known as Saleh Ibn Fawzan Ibn Abdullah, Saleh Ibn Fawzan al-Fawzan, Saalih Ibn Fowzaan Ibn 'Abdullaah Ibn Fowzaan, Saleh Bin Fauzan Al-Fawzan, and Saleh Al-Fawzan. Biography According to his official biography at fatwa-online.com, Fawzan is from the family of Fawzan from the people/tribe of ash-Shamaasiyyah.

In 1950 he completed his studies at the Faysaliyyah school in Buraydah and subsequently was appointed a teacher at the school. Fawzan joined the Educational Institute in Buraydah when it opened in 1952, and graduated from it in 1956. He was a student at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, where he initially studied at the faculty of Sharia, graduating in 1960, before earning a master's and doctorate in Fiqh. =Career= According to fatwa-online.com, after the completion of his doctorate, he became a teacher at the faculty of Shari'ah at the Imam Muhammad educational institute in Riyadh before being transferred to the Department for Higher Studies within the Faculty of the Principles of the Religion (usool ad-deen). He was later the head of Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court of Justice, where he was appointed the head. He then returned to teaching there after his period of headship came to an end.

Whoever says such things is an infidel.\\" [Source of Q&A;: Cassette Recording dated 4/8/1416 and subsequently verified by the Shaikh himself with a few minor alterations to the wording.] In March 2014, Al-Fawzan denied that he issued a fatwa banning 'all you can eat' open-buffets, claiming he only said that open-buffets should identify the quantity so that people don't end up buying the \\"unknown\\". \\"It is attributed to me that I prohibited the buffet and this is an apparent lie motivated by fantasy and fabrication,\\" Al-Fawzan said in the statement posted on his website. \\"The fact is that I was asked about a phenomenon in some restaurants where owners tell their customers: eat what you like from the displayed food and pay a lump sum.

The sheikh initially appears incredulous, asking: \\"What?! What do you mean pictures with cats?\\" He then declares: \\"Taking pictures is prohibited. The cats don't matter here.\\" When asked again about the \\"new trend\\", he says: \\"Explain this trend to me. Taking pictures is prohibited if not for a necessity - not with cats, not with dogs, not with wolves, not with anything.\\" Arabian scholars Hala Al-Dosari (fellow of Radcliff Institute at Harvard) and Abdullah Alaoudh (senior fellow of Georgetown University and son of Salman al-Awdah) claim Saleh al-Fawzan is treated like a father figure by MbS. A month before the Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, al-Fawzan put out a fatwa calling for killing of critics of the Saudi state. Human Rights Watch has attributed hate speech by Saleh al-Fawzan towards Shia and rafida when he called these groups \\"brothers of Satan\\" and specifically about Shia followers as \\"unbelievers\\" who \\"lie about God, his prophet, and the consensus of Muslim\\". Hala Al-Dosari also claims that al-Fawzan considers Islamic minority sects to be heretics.

In the Second World War he was initially a conscientious objector, joining the Friends Ambulance Unit. However, he later chose to serve as a private in the Welsh Guards, before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps on 19 July 1941. He later attained the rank of captain in the Intelligence Corps; John Hunt wrote that \\"...during a part of the war [Noyce] was employed in training air crews [in mountain techniques] in Kashmir. For a brief period he assisted me in running a similar course for soldiers\\".John Hunt, The Ascent of Everest, Hodder and Stoughton, 1953, p. 29. He was also employed as a code-breaker at the Wireless Experimental Centre, Delhi. With Maurice Allen in spring 1943 they broke the Water Transport Code, an important Japanese Army code and the first high-level army code broken. After the war, Noyce became a schoolmaster. From 1946 until 1950 he taught modern languages at Malvern College. Then, following in the footsteps of George Mallory, he returned as a master to his own old school, Charterhouse, where he remained for ten years. On 12 August 1950, between Malvern and Charterhouse, he married Rosemary Campbell Davies, and they had two sons, Michael and Jeremy. Early climbing Tryfan By the age of eighteen, Noyce was already a fine climber, from 1935 regularly climbing with John Menlove Edwards of Liverpool. Before the Second World War, he helped Edwards to produce rock climbing guides to the crags of Tryfan and Lliwedd in Snowdonia.Noyce, Cuthbert Wilfrid Frank (1917-1962) at mountain-heritage.org. Retrieved 28 July 2008. Like other leading British climbers of the prewar period, such as Mallory, Jack Longland, Ivan Waller and A. B. Hargreaves, Noyce became a prot√©g√© of Geoffrey Winthrop Young, attending his parties at Pen-y-Pass.Alan Hankinson, Geoffrey Winthrop Young: Poet, Educator, Mountaineer, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1995, pp. 5 and 62. In the late 1930s, Noyce was one of a small band of Britons climbing at high standards in the Alps. He was well known for his speed and stamina, and in two early alpine seasons, 1937 and 1938, climbing with Armand Charlet or Hans Brantschen as his guide, he made major climbs in very fast times. In 1942, in North Wales, he achieved a non-stop solo climb of 1,370 metres. During this period Noyce wrote that he suffered three serious accidents: The first fall refers to an incident when he was held on the rope by Edwards after falling, despite damage to the rope. 1953 Everest Expedition=Background and approach= Noyce was a climbing member of the 1953 British Expedition to Mount Everest that made the first ascent of the mountain. According to the expedition's leader John Hunt, in the section of his The Ascent of Everest in which he outlined the qualities of his team members: Edmund Hillary, meeting Noyce for the first time as the expedition assembled in Nepal, echoed Hunt's praise: \\"Wilf Noyce was a tough and experienced mountaineer with an impressive record of difficult and dangerous climbs. In many respects I considered Noyce the most competent British climber I had met.\\"Edmund Hillary, Nothing Venture, Nothing Win, London: Travel Book Club, 1979, p. 147. At the initial meeting of the Everest team at the premises of the Royal Geographical Society on 17 November 1952, Noyce was designated as being charge of writing (meaning the dispatches that were to be sent home from the mountain) and \\"volunteered to help with the packing\\" (he aided Stuart Bain with this).South Col, pp. 2‚Äì3 On the walk-in to the mountain, Noyce, together with Charles Evans, who had been designated as in charge of stores at the RGS meeting, were designated as the \\"baggage party\\", in charge of the clothing and equipment for the approach.The Ascent of Everest, p. 63. Noyce was also in charge of mountaineering equipment on the ascent itself, having been instructed in the repair of high-altitude boots (\\"I had worked for three days with Robert Lawrie's bootmakers, learning chiefly how to stick on micro-cellular rubber soles and heels\\").South Col, p. 30 Noyce's skills in boot repair were in demand on the ascent; according to Charles Wylie, the thin Vibram soles that were used on the boots often peeled off at the toes but Noyce \\"saved the situation with some really professional repair work\\".Charles Wylie, 'Notes on Certain Items of Equipment', Appendix IV in The Ascent of Everest, p. 252. Noyce compiled Appendix 1, 'Diary of the Expedition', in The Ascent of Everest, pp. 235‚Äì40. Together with George Lowe, on 17 May Noyce established Camp VII on the Lhotse face of Everest. On 20 May he radioed to Hunt that many of the oxygen bottles (the training or Utility model, not the type that were to be used on the summit attempt) that had been ferried up to Camp VII were leaking. Hunt noted \\"Wilfrid, though gifted in more ways than one, has not a marked mechanical bent and we hoped his tests were not conclusive. Tom, however, had a lurking fear that these very tests, carried out by a possibly anoxic Wilfrid, might have resulted in the discharging of all nine cylinders\\".The Ascent of Everest, p. 162. Mount Everest. The South Col is the lowest point of the sunny ridge in the right background =South Col= On 21 May Noyce and the Sherpa Annullu (the younger brother of Da Tensing) were the first members of the expedition to reach Everest's South Col, after what Noyce said was \\"one of the most enjoyable days' mountaineering I've ever had\\".The Ascent of Everest, p. 166. They left Camp VII at 9.30 am, both using oxygen; according to Noyce, \\"I had told Anullu that we would not start too early, for fear of frostbite.\\"South Col, p. 153 Several hours later they reached the highest point attained by the British expedition to date: \\"an aluminium piton with a great coil of thick rope\\" left by George Lowe and party.South Col, p. 155 The climbers in the camps below, according to Hunt, were watching their progress on this vital part of the climb; by early afternoon \\"their speed had noticeably increased and our excitement soon grew to amazement when it dawned on us that Noyce and Annullu were heading for the South Col itself\\".The Ascent of Everest, p. 165. Not long after Hunt made that observation, they reached the Col. In a passage in South Col, Noyce's book of the expedition published the following year, he gives an account of the scene that greeted him at the Col: From the remains of the Swiss expedition Noyce \\"picked up some Vita-Weat, a tin of sardines and a box of matches, all in perfect condition after lying exposed to the elements for over six months\\". Noyce and Annullu fixed a 500-ft length of nylon rope to protect the steep slopes leading up to the Col where Camp VIII was to be established (\\"this was to be a moral lifeline for weary Sherpas returning from the long carry\\"), and then descended to Camp VII which they reached at 5.30 pm. From a mountaineering perspective, as Everest veteran Chris Bonington wrote, \\"[Noyce] had fulfilled his role in John Hunt's master plan, had established one vital stepping-stone for others to achieve the final goal.\\"'The Challenge of Everest', p. 284. According to Hunt, the climbing team had been in low spirits before Noyce and Annullu reached the South Col, but the effect of their safe return from the Col to Camp VII \\"had a profound impression on the waiting men. If these two could do it, so could they [...] Morale rose suddenly, inspired by fine example\\".The Ascent of Everest, pp. 166‚Äì7. Noyce climbed up to the South Col a second time during the ascent; on 29 May, the day of the successful first ascent, he set out with three Sherpas from Camp VII, reaching the Col with one of them, Pasang Phutar, later that day; they \\"had each carried a double load‚Äîat least 50 lb.‚Äîfrom the point where the two other Sherpas had given up\\".The Ascent of Everest, p. 215. Hunt noted that \\"Noyce and Wylie were the only two members of the climbing party to reach the South Col without oxygen.\\"The Ascent of Everest, p. 216. Pasang, George Lowe and Noyce met the successful summit team of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay at the Col, giving the tired climbers drinks and congratulations. It was here, 200 metres above the camp, that Hillary told Lowe, who had gone out to greet them, \\"Well, we knocked the bastard off.\\"Nothing Venture, Nothing Win, p. 162. Hillary wrote: \\"Wilf Noyce and Pasang Puta were also in Camp and they looked after us with patience and kindness. I felt a moment of sympathy for Wilf ‚Äì he was the only one left with the strength to try for the summit; but now he wouldn't get the chance. It was another foul night with strong wind and very cold temperatures ...\\" Noyce descended the following day with Hillary, Tenzing, Lowe and Pasang Phutar, reaching Camp IV on 30 May.The Ascent of Everest, p. 237 As well as naming his book of the expedition South Col, Noyce also wrote a poem called 'South Col'. Later years Machapuchare On 20 May 1957, together with A. D. M. Cox, Noyce made the effective first ascent of Machapuchare (6,993 m) in the Annapurna Himal, reaching to within 50 m of the summit before turning back at that point out of respect for local religious beliefs. Noyce and Cox also made the first ascent ‚Äì via the north- east face ‚Äì of Singu Chuli (Fluted Peak) (6,501 m) on 13 June 1957.Machapuchare, at summitpost.org. Retrieved 5 August 2008.

Collomb, Pennine Alps Central, London: Alpine Club, 1975, p. 277. Some days later, on 15‚Äì16 August, the same party made the first British ascent of the north-east face of the Signalkuppe, the longest and most serious route on the east face of Monte Rosa.Pennine Alps Central, p. 187. The north face of the Dent d'H√©rens Noyce made the first ascent of Trivor (7,577 m) in Pakistan's Hispar Muztagh range in 1960 together with Jack Sadler. Noyce died in a mountaineering accident together with the 23-year-old Scot Robin Smith in 1962 after a successful ascent of Mount Garmo (6,595 m), in the Pamirs. On the descent, either Smith or Noyce slipped on a layer of soft snow over ice, pulling the other, and they both fell 4,000 feet. Writings Noyce wrote widely, penning not just books, poems and scholarly articles, but also contributing to climbing guidebooks. His Scholar Mountaineers was a study of twelve writers and thinkers who had an association with mountains; these were Dante, Petrarch, Rousseau, Ferdinand de Saussure, Goethe, Wordsworth, Keats, Ruskin, Leslie Stephen, Nietzsche, Pope Pius XI and Robert Falcon Scott.

He works primarily in painting and drawing and currently resides in Los Angeles, California.  Life and career  Born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 18 January 1958, to an expatriate Bolivian family, Bastos' interest in portraiture was sparked at the age of ten when he posed for a portrait by his aunt, Bolivian artist Yolanda de Aguirre. At the age of eleven, he returned to Bolivia with his family and they settled once again in La Paz where he was exposed to the vast Andean landscape and the Aymaran culture with its myths and legends, which became a major influence on his work. His formal training began at age 13 with de Aguirre, as well as artists Agnes Ovando-Sanz de Franck, Gonzalo Rodriguez, and another aunt, noted artist Maria Esther Ballivian. He was introduced to the masterpieces of the great European artists, copying the works of da Vinci, Michelangelo and C√©zanne. In 1977, Bastos enrolled at Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s in La Paz where he studied architecture. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1979, enrolling first at Georgetown University and then at Montgomery College. In 1982, he was admitted to the Maryland Institute College of Art where he continued his studies in Fine Arts graduating Cum Laude in 1984. He received his Masters of Fine Arts from Towson University in 1986. Bastos' portrait of Gore Vidal From his home in Baltimore Bastos began his career and, in 1988, had his first solo show at gallery Arte Unico in La Paz. It featured portraits of Bolivian society figures, including Ximena S√°nchez de Lozada, the wife of future Bolivian President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada. His first major solo exhibition in the U.S. was held in 1989 at the Knight Gomez Gallery in Baltimore. Entitled Myths & Dreams, it showcased Bastos‚Äô emerging representational style that fused his Catholic roots with Andean mythology and symbolism. Two years later, the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. presented Bastos‚Äô work in a solo show, which also featured additional oils and pastels from this oeuvre. Another one-man exhibition in La Paz in 1993 showcased both traditional portraits and representational works that explored the myth of the Lake Titicaca mermaids. In 1994, Galeria Borkas in Lima, Peru, presented Milagros, Bastos‚Äô one-man exhibition of works depicting the interplay between the Catholic and pagan belief in miracles and the South American tradition of milagros. By the late 1980s, Bastos was accepting an increasing number of portrait commissions. Consequently, by 1999 he had established a high enough profile as a society portraitist to be featured, as one of six portrait painters, in a New York Times article on the reemergence of portraiture. Over a two-year period culminating in 2004, Bastos delivered eight portrait commissions to the University of Southern California‚Äôs Keck School of Medicine that featured Deans and major donors. The University of Southern California‚Äôs Viterbi School of Engineering also commissioned a portrait of its principal donors. Other institutional commissions have included Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Good Samaritan Hospital, George Washington University, and Harvard University. Bastos has also delivered a number of cover portraits to The Gay & Lesbian Review, featuring celebrities such as Charlize Theron, Ian McKellen, Barney Frank, and Gore Vidal, who compared Bastos‚Äô work to that of John Singer Sargent. Bastos has been influenced by the works of Julio Larraz, Odd Nerdrum, and Lucian Freud. Notable private commissions have included portraits of high- profile art collectors, Eugenio L√≥pez, Pamela Joyner, and Philip Niarchos. Hundreds of Bastos portraits hang in private residences, universities, government buildings, and corporate offices in California, and throughout the US, South America, and Europe. He works in oils, pastels, pencil, watercolors, acrylics and collage. His portraits are based on live sittings with photographs used for reference. In 1996, Bastos was featured in the Organization of American States' America Viva television documentary series with the episode, \\"Juan Fernando Bastos: Portrait of an Artist.\\" Juan Bastos: California Portraits, a retrospective of 22 years of 40 of the artist's California portraits was presented by Denenberg Fine Arts in West Hollywood, California, in early November, 2017. Most of the portraits were lent by the portrait subjects, many of whom visited the show during its two-week run. The exhibition was part of the Participating Gallery Program of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, a far-reaching and ambitious exploration of Latin American and Latino art in dialogue with Los Angeles, that ran from September 2017 through January 2018 at more than 70 cultural institutions across Southern California. Pacific Standard Time was an initiative of the Getty. Since 1996, Bastos has lived and worked in Los Angeles, California.

The term originated in the aviation industry but was originally designated as Electrical Interconnection Systems (EIS).http://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/artn06-17.pdf The change from EIS to EWIS was done to emphasize the focus on the actual wires and wiring of the systems throughout aircraft.  Background  Prior to the aviation accidents of TWA Flight 800 and SwissAir 111, the wiring on aircraft was a minor concern. In response to these accidents, the Aging Transport Systems Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ATSRAC) was chartered to gather industry leaders examine the current state of aging aircraft systems; one of the main areas examined included EWIS. ATSRAC committee homepage The committee included a number of key organizations and businesses including ATA, NASA, Northwest Airlines, Boeing, Airbus, FAA, and Lectromechanical Design Company. Many of the results from the ATSRAC committee shaped the FAA's regulatory reaction to the handling and certification of EWIS. The following is an excerpt from the FAA‚Äôs regulations released November 8, 2007 governing aspects of EWIS on aircraft as to the reason for the increased concerns regarding EWIS: > ‚ÄúSafety concerns about wiring systems in airplanes were brought to the > forefront of public attention by a midair explosion in 1996 involving a 747 > airplane. Ignition of flammable vapors in the fuel tank was the probable > cause of that fatal accident, and the most likely source was a wiring > failure that allowed a spark to enter the fuel tank. All 230 people aboard > the airplane were killed. Two years later, an MD‚Äì11 (Swissair Flight 111) > airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 229 people aboard. > Although an exact cause could not be determined, the presence of re- > solidified copper on a portion of a wire of the in-flight entertainment > system cable indicated that wire arcing had occurred in the area where the > fire most likely originated. > > Investigations of those accidents and later examinations of other airplanes > showed a collection of common problems. Deteriorated wiring, corrosion, > improper wire installation and repairs, and contamination of wire bundles > with metal shavings, dust, and fluids (which would provide fuel for fire) > were common conditions in representative examples of the ‚Äò‚Äòaging fleet of > transport airplanes.‚Äô‚Äô \\" FAA Regulations on the certification and > maintenance of aircraft wiring systems The FAA funded a number of studies involving the analysis of the current state of wiring on aircraft, the deterioration processes of wiring systems, Presentation describing the goals of the Wire Degradation Project tools to detect wire failure, and ways of quantifying and mitigating the damage from an electrical arc. Description of FAA project to predict the potential damage caused by wire failure. In 2009 the European Aviation Safety Agency issued 3 \\"Acceptable Means of Compliance\\", AMC 20-21, AMC 20-22 and AMC 20-23 dealing in turn with the maintenance procedures, the training and the documentation that had to be introduced by Maintenance and Repair Organisations to reduce the probability of serious incidents or accidents caused by wiring failure. AMC 20-22 is almost exactly similar to the US FAA Airworthiness Circular 120-94.https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/74311 EWIS Aircraft Electrical Systems Reliability The term electrical system refers to those parts on the aircraft that generate, distribute and use electrical energy, including their supports and attachments. The satisfactory performance of an aircraft is dependent upon the continued reliability of the electrical system. Reliability of the electrical system is proportional to the amount of maintenance received, the correct independent part selection and the supervised installation of each electrical component in the aircraft as explained in the FAA advisory circular 43.13-1B - Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices Chapter 11.http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/list/AC%2043.13-1B/$FILE/Chapter%2011.pdf Electrical component selection is a critical step to ensure the correct operation in any aircraft electrical system. Components need to be selected for their electrical specifications and properties as well as for the extreme conditions these components could be exposed. Inspection and testing of every single component plays a major role in the EWIS regulations to guarantee the safety and reliability of the system. Correct engineering design, planning and coordination with the manufacturers of each electrical component will secure the proper installation of each component. The correct installation of the components in the aircraft and the manufacturing procedures are requirements of the EWIS regulations. Once the aircraft has an airworthiness certificate and has reached an entry into service status, the maintenance of the aircraft‚Äôs electrical systems will play a key role to guarantee the reliability of the systems and the safety of flight.

The attacks occurred at 9:45 p.m. local time, 18:45 UTC, on a pedestrian street closed to traffic. The bombings were the deadliest civilian attacks in Turkey since the 2003 Istanbul bombings, five years earlier.  Details  The first of the two bombs was a sonic bomb which was placed in a telephone cabin and second bomb was placed in a waste container 50 meters away, near a crowded street. The first bomb caused crowds to gather for help and curiosity, and around 10 minutes later, the second and more powerful bomb exploded, causing many of the casualties. The police believe that the bombs were activated remotely. Political analyst Damla Aras said that, \\"there is a possibility they might be A4, C-4 explosives, which were brought from northern Iraq by the PKK and have been used several times in Turkey.\\" Early on, news sources thought the first explosion was caused by a gas leak. Investigation Nobody has claimed responsibility for the bombing as of yet, although Kurdish separatist militants are suspected. The Istanbul Police indicate that the incident bears the hallmarks of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), possibly in revenge for a series of major operations by the Turkish military on its bases days prior to the incident. However a senior member of the PKK, Zubeyir Aydar, denied the implication: \\"The Kurdish liberation movement is not involved in this attack.\\" Based on a tip from residents, three teenagers were taken into custody in connection to the bombings.

Two large flower shows that preceded the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show in northern California were the Oakland Spring Flower Show which was produced by the California Association of Nurserymen from 1930 to 1978 (with a three-year hiatus from 1943 to 1945 because of World War II). In the early 1980s the rock ‚Äòn roll impresario Bill Graham produced two annual flower shows at the Cow Palace. The show as it appears today was started in 1986 as the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show by volunteers for the Friends of Recreation and Parks in San Francisco as a fundraiser for that organization (in 2006 the organization‚Äôs name changed to San Francisco Parks Trust). The first show featured a tribute garden to San Francisco landscape architect, Thomas Dolliver Church (1902-1978), designed by Pam-Anela Messenger. For its first eleven years (1986-1997) the show held at Ft. Mason in San Francisco. In 1997 Salmon Bay Events, the Seattle-based company owned by Duane and Alice Kelly that had started the Northwest Flower & Garden Show, acquired the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show, changed its name to the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show, and moved the show from Ft. Mason to the Cow Palace. For the next eleven years (1998-2008) it was held at the Cow Palace. In 2009, Salmon Bay moved the show to the San Mateo Event Center and announced it was closing the show.

It was created in 1963 after a major landslide which dammed the river and the natural dam was later replaced with a hydroelectric dam \\"Zavoj\\".  Location  Lake Zavoj is located in eastern Serbia, in the northern part of the Visok region, close to the Serbian- Bulgarian border. Lake is in the valley of the Visoƒçica River which is both its major tributary and outflow, between the mountains of Stara Planina on the north and Vidliƒç on the south. Lake is located north of the town of Pirot, close to the Visoƒçica mouth into the Tem≈°tica river and is not well connected with the rest of Serbia. Settlements in the vicinity of the lake, which is among the least populated in the entire Serbia, include Novi Zavoj, Velika Lukanja and Pakle≈°tica.  History  On February 25, 1963 a huge landslide from the sunny side of the Stara Planina rushed into the valley of the Visoƒçica River and dammed a river creating a natural earth dam which was long and high. Reservoir was created behind the dam, flooding the village of Zavoj. This original natural lake was dried, the natural dam was consolidated and the artificial lake was recreated, this time as a reservoir for the hydroelectric power plant \\"Zavoj\\". The village of Novi Zavoj was built on the higher ground instead of the flooded old village of Zavoj. Immediately after the dam was finished, Serbian government began a project of conducting waters from Tem≈°tica's upper course (Toplodolska reka) into the lake. Project was continued in the early 2000s but the local population in the watershed of Tem≈°tica protested claiming that over 80% of the water was already taken out of their river and that further catchment of the water from it would result in an ecological catastrophe, especially in the canyon of Tem≈°tica popularly called \\"Little Colorado\\". As a result of this, municipality of Pirot officially opposed the government's decision in 2004 and 2006, but the government insisted on continuing the project. In protest, population of the village of Temska boycotted the Serbian parliamentary elections in January 2007.  Paleontological site  The lake The site, located at an elevation of , has been discovered in 2004 and the preliminary research began in 2005 with the help of German paleobiologists from Freiburg. In the Upper Triassic, 230 to 200 million years ago, the area was a shallow, ending part of the large tropical sea, the Tethys Ocean. The mud and sediments petrified in the form of plates which are rich in remains of mollusk shells (which have been found on the slopes of the Stara Planina at over ), sea worms, snails and other marine animals (sea crocodiles, sharks, giant mollusks) with indications that fossils of the dinosaurs can be found also.

Androff's record remained unblemished until his fourth fight, a six-round draw in a rematch with Barrett. After two more wins pushed his record to 5-0-1, Androff lost for the first time, to Earl Sather on November 15, 1934. Nevertheless Androff continued to fight, putting together the best stretch of his career when, between January 1935 and June 1938 he went 17-2-2, peaking with a ten-round points defeat of Fred Lenhart at Minneapolis on June 3, 1938. By then the quality of Androff's opponents had improved considerably, and his record thereafter attests to that fact, with Androff traveling to Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Omaha, Houston, Fort Smith, Arkansas to compile a 6-12-4 record from that point to his retirement at the end of 1946. Aside from Lenhart, the most notable of Androff's opponents would be Joey Maxim, to whom he dropped a decision after ten rounds in June 1944.

It was built for William H. Osborn, as part of his nearby Wing & Wing estate, by architect Ralph Adams Cram in the Gothic Revival architectural style. Osborn was a 19th- century railroad tycoon, who became one of the most prominent railroad leaders in the United States. In addition to Wing and Wing and the Birches, Osborn famously constructed Castle Rock, his great summer estate overlooking the Hudson River. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is just across Route 9D from the Garrison Grist Mill Historic District. Building The first story is built of dressed, randomly coursed stone. It gives way to frame and a gambrel roof on the upper stories. A projecting, center-shingled pavilion on the west facade is trimmed in half- timber, coming to a louvered gable peak with its rafters intentionally exposed as decoration. A similarly decorated porch, with open gable, extends from the pavilion. The south profile has a one-story projecting bay supporting a balcony. The windows and doors on the first story have arched openings, echoed by a split rounded transom over the double-doored main entrance. There is one outbuilding on the property: a one-story frame carriage house, later a garage, to the east. Two apartments have since been added to it. History The Birches was designed in 1882 for William H. Osborn, owner of the nearby Wing & Wing estate. Within the Osborn family, it became known as the Honeymoon House, since both William Church and Fairfield Osborn lived there after their weddings while waiting for their own nearby homes to be completed. When not used by them, it was occasionally home to the family's servants. Due to this near-constant use, Osborn and his descendants never followed through on their plans to donate it to the Town of Philipstown (the town in which the hamlet of Garrison is located) for use as a public library (one was eventually built just across Route 403). So, when the family finally sold it in 1976, it remained in use as a house. The house was extensively renovated by new owners during the period from 2009 - 2012; during the renovation, a number of period details were preserved. Aesthetics Cram's design, one of the earlier ones in his career, interpreted the Picturesque Gothic Revival cottages that Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers, following the patterns of their mentor, Andrew Jackson Downing, had built all over the Hudson Valley and, later, the country, three decades earlier, before the Civil War. The result was a late example of the Victorian Gothic style, distinct for a home in the area. The stone coursework on the lower story links the house with other former Osborn properties in Garrison. Its style links it to the nearby Castle Rock, which can be seen over the house when it is viewed from the northwest, in the center of the intersection.

Aleppo soap is classified as a Castile soap as it is a hard soap made from olive oil and lye, from which it is distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil. History The origin of Aleppo soap is unknown. Unverified claims of its great antiquity abound, such as its supposed use by Queen Cleopatra of Egypt and Queen Zenobia of Syria. It is commonly thought that the process of soap-making emanated from the Levant region (of which Aleppo is a main city) and to have moved west from there to Europe after the first Crusades. This is based on the claim that the earliest soap made in Europe was shortly after the Crusades, but soap was known to the Romans in the first century AD and Zosimos of Panopolis described soap and soapmaking in c. 300 AD. Today most Aleppo soap, especially that containing more than 16% of laurel oil, is exported to Europe and East Asia.  Manufacturing process  Soap in a vat Soap cooling Final result Traditional Aleppo soap is made by the \\"hot process\\". First, the olive oil is brought into a large, in-ground vat along with water and lye. Underneath the vat, there is an underground fire which heats the contents to a boil. Boiling lasts three days while the oil reacts with the lye and water to become a thick liquid soap. The laurel oil is added at the end of the process, and after it is mixed in, the mix is taken from the vat and poured over a large sheet of waxed paper on the floor of the factory. At this point the soap is a large, green, flat mass, and it is allowed to cool down and harden for about a day. While the soap is cooling, workers with planks of wood strapped to their feet walk over the soap to try to smooth out the batch and make it an even thickness. The soap is then cut in cubes. The cubes of soap are stacked in staggered cylinders to allow maximum air exposure. Once they have dried sufficiently, they are put into a special subterranean chamber to be aged for six months to a year. While it is aging, the soap goes through several chemical changes. The free alkaline content of the soap (the alkaline which did not react with the oil during saponification) breaks down upon slow reaction with air. The moisture content of the soap is also reduced, making the soap hard and long lasting. And lastly, the color of the outside of the soap turns a pale gold, while the inside remains green. Modern Aleppo soaps are manufactured using a \\"cold process\\" and contain olive and laurel oils, and may contain a variety of herbs and/or essential oils.  Ingredients  Traditional Aleppo soap is made with olive oil, laurel berry oil (zeit ghar), water and lye, while the relative concentration of laurel oil (typically 2‚Äì20%) determines the quality and cost of the soap. Laurus nobilis, from which the berries come, is categorized as an underutilized species. As it is produced only from natural oils, Aleppo soap is also biodegradable. In the 20th century, with the introduction of cold process soap making, Allepian soap artisans began introducing a variety of herbs and essential oils to their soaps. Unlike most soaps, some Aleppo soap will float in water. Some Aleppo soap will float but not all. This will be dependent on the process and the amount of air trapped within the mix when being poured and solidifying. The exception to this; Aleppo soap which uses the higher quality method of first press Virgin Oil processed using cold saponification method. This is the premium of soaps produced in the traditional way and they will generally partly sink or remain on the bottom as it will be a denser bar of soap with less air content.  Skin care properties  Aleppo soap can be used daily as soap for washing and shampooing, as face mask, as shaving cream, and for bathing infants and babies. Laurel oil is an effective cleanser, antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-itching agent.

La Patrouille des Castors (The Beaver Patrol) is a series of Belgian comics drawn by MiTacq and written by Jean-Michel Charlier. 30 albums were published between 1955 and 1993, by Dupuis, all relating the adventures of a Scout patrol. History This series, which was first published in Spirou magazine on November 25, 1954, relates the fictional adventures of a Scout patrol. In the first album, the patrol consisted of six Scouts, although one of them, Lapin (rabbit) disappeared quickly from future stories after the team decided five main characters was a more suitable number for the series. The artist, Michel Tacq (MiTacq), had himself been a Scout during a large part of his life. It was his idea to create a series with Scouts as the main characters, but he needed a script to realise the project, which was provided in 1954 by Charlier, already a very active scriptwriter. The publication in Spirou lasted from 1954 until 1979 although there was a long interruption from the beginning of 1967 until April 1971, after which publication was slower than it had been before 1967, because Charlier was then very busy with the several other series for which he was writing. Charlier was eventually replaced by Marc Wasterlain who wrote the scripts for two albums, and then, MiTacq took over as writer. Several albums only credit MiTacq as writer and artist, whereas in reality he was assisted either by Charlier, Wasterlain or his friend Jacques Stoquart. Background The Beaver Patrol is a group of scouts who are taken on adventurous situations provided, most of the time, by their Scout camp during their holidays in foreign countries. As all Scouts should, they act honourably and charitably, but they face enigmas and puzzles in each region they visit in the best traditions of boys own adventures. Each character of the patrol has a very distinct profile, which makes it possible for them to have all the qualities needed in difficult situations. As the series goes on, the graphic style evolves and the protagonists get older. They replaced their blue shirt (designed for 12- to 17-year-old boys) by a red shirt (made for Pioneers, 15- to 17-year-old scouts), according to the 1964 uniform reform for Belgian Scouts. Although Spirou magazine is Belgian, as well as the two creators of the series, its audience was primarily in France. During the course of the stories the Beavers left their native country often to travel to other countries and continents. Not only did the Beavers travel in various countries but the stories also took place in varied locations, be it underground, on the sea and even underwater. The series was parodied by the author himself in a story written with Yvan Delporte with the series La Patrouille des Zoms. Characters The patrol is a built like an example of a perfect Scout troop, with each member having a totem and specific qualities: * Poulain (foal) : the Patrol leader, courageous but prudent and reasonable. He is 15 at the beginning of the series, he is the perfect hero without any obvious faults, he makes the appropriate decisions in case of difficulties. * Chat (cat) : the patrol second, Poulain's double, as reasonable but more discreet at the beginning of the series, although later his character becomes a bit more varied. * Faucon (hawk): the intellectual, very resourceful in ideas, he is 15, wears glasses and intervenes to solve enigmas thanks to his huge knowledge, and provides cultural or scientific references when needed. His father Mr. Bridoison, is a famous physician and chemist. * Tapir (tapir): a lively 14-year-old boy and MiTacq's favorite character, he provides the series with the gags and the humour. He is very greedy, fat and often moans. Eating is a real obsession, so that he is the Scout in charge of the food and the meals in the patrol. His father, Mr. Lebedon, is a grocer. * Mouche (fly): the youngest member of the patrol (13 years old), introverted and physically and psychologically weak.

It spread outward from Imerina, the Central Highlands region primarily inhabited by the Merina ethnic group with a spiritual capital at Ambohimanga and a political capital west at Antananarivo, currently the seat of government for the modern state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a long line of hereditary Merina royalty originating with Andriamanelo, who is traditionally credited with founding Imerina in 1540. History=Hova-Vazimba conflict= Andriamanelo waged war against the Vazimba in an effort to expel them from the highlands. Madagascar's central highlands were first inhabited between 200 BCE‚Äì300 CE by the island's earliest settlers, the Vazimba, who appear to have arrived by pirogue from southeastern Borneo to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests. By the 15th century the Hova people from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings and queens. The two peoples coexisted peacefully for several generations and are known to have intermarried. In this way, a reigning Vazimba queen (alternately given in the oral histories as Rafohy or Rangita) married a Hova man named Manelobe. Their oldest son, Andriamanelo (1540‚Äì1575), broke this tradition by launching a largely successful war to subjugate the surrounding Vazimba communities and force them to either submit to Hova dominance and assimilate, or flee. Andriamanelo was succeeded by his son Ralambo (1575‚Äì1612), whose many enduring and significant political and cultural achievements earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history. Ralambo was the first to assign the name of Imerina (\\"Land of the Merina people\\") to the central highland territories where he ruled. Ralambo expanded and defended the Kingdom of Imerina through a combination of diplomacy and successful military action aided by the procurement of the first firearms in Imerina by way of trade with kingdoms on the coast. Imposing a capitation tax for the first time (the vadin-aina, or \\"price of secure life\\"), he was able to establish the first standing Merina royal army and established units of blacksmiths and silversmiths to equip them. He famously repelled an attempted invasion by an army of the powerful western coastal Betsimisaraka people. According to oral history, the wild zebu cattle that roamed the Highlands were first domesticated for food in Imerina under the reign of Ralambo, and he introduced the practice and design of cattle pen construction, as well as the traditional ceremony of the fandroana (the \\"Royal Bath\\"), to celebrate his culinary discovery. Upon succeeding his father, Andrianjaka (1612‚Äì1630) led a successful military campaign to capture the final major Vazimba stronghold in the highlands on the hill of Analamanga. There he established the fortified compound (rova) that would form the heart of his new capital city of Antananarivo. Upon his orders, the first structures within this fortified compound (known as the Rova of Antananarivo) were constructed: several traditional royal houses were built, and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed. These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance, ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995. Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder, materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina. =Expansion of sovereignty= Political life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave- hunting incursions into Imerina. By the early 19th century, the Merina were able to overcome rival tribes such as the Bezanozano, the Betsimisaraka, and eventually the Sakalava kingdom and bring them under the Merina crown. It is through this process that the ethnonym \\"Merina\\" began to be commonly used, as it denotes prominence in the Malagasy language. Though some sources describe the Merina expansion as the unification of Madagascar, this period of Merina expansion was seen by neighboring tribes such as the Betsimisaraka as aggressive acts of colonialism. By 1824, the Merina captured the port of Mahajanga situated on the western coast of the island marking a further expansion of power. Under Radama I, the Merina continued to launch military expeditions that both expanded imperial control and enriched military chiefs. The ability of the Merina to overcome neighboring tribes was due to British firepower and military training. The British had an interest in establishing trade with the Merina kingdom due to its central position on the island since 1815. Merina imperial expeditions became more frequent and violent after the renunciation of the second Merina-British treaty. Between 1828 and 1840, more than 100,000 men were killed and more than 200,000 enslaved by Merina forces. Imperial rule was met with resistance from escaped slaves and other refugees from imperial rule numbering in the tens of thousands. These refugees formed raiding brigands that were dealt with by imperial troops who hunted them down in 1835. Notably, the rate of escaping refugees only heightened the demand for slave labor in the Merina kingdom, further fueling campaigns of military expansion. Throughout the middle of the 19th century, continued imperial expansion and increasing control in coastal trade solidified Merina predominance over the island. The Merina kingdom nearly consolidated all of Madagascar into a single nation before French colonization in 1895. =Division and civil war= King Andriamasinavalona quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. He extended the borders of the kingdom to their largest historical extent prior to the kingdom's fragmentation. =Reunification= King Andrianampoinimerina (ca. 1787‚Äì1810) It was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King Andrianjafy of Ambohimanga (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name Andrianampoinimerina. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule. =Kingdom of Madagascar= Ranavalona III was the last monarch of Madagascar. This objective was largely completed under his son, Radama I, who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo. The 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and British. Her son and heir, King Radama II, signed the unpopular Lambert Charter giving French entrepreneur Joseph- Fran√ßois Lambert exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony had the King strangled in a coup d'√©tat. This aristocratic revolution saw Rasoherina, the queen dowager, placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a constitutional monarchy that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, Rainilaiarivony, who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, Ranavalona II, converted the nation to Christianity and had all the sampy (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen Ranavalona III, acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to R√©union Island and later French Algeria following French colonisation of the island in 1896. =French colonisation= Landing of the 40th Battaillon de Chasseur √† Pieds in Majunga, between 5 and 24 May 1895. Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the First Franco-Hova War (Hova referring to the andriana). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Di√©go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats partitioning the African continent worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over Heligoland to the German Empire and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain. In 1895, a French flying-column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city's defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French protection as the Malagasy Protectorate and in 1897 the French Parliament voted to annex the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty. Geography=Spatial organization= Sacred hills of Imerina Andriamanelo established the first fortified rova (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora. This fortified palace bore specific features ‚Äì hadivory (dry moats), hadifetsy (defensive trenches) and vavahady (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier) ‚Äì that rendered the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks. Andrianjaka's policies and tactics highlighted and increased the separation between the king and his subjects. He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. Andrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the twelve sacred hills of Imerina at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka. These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when Andrianampoinimerina redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites. Rova of Antananarivo Under Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (toko): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest. Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people. Imerina is located in the central highlands of Madagascar. It is notable that the word Imerina is derived from the Malagasy word meaning the \\"occupancy of a prominent place.\\" Consistent with the name, much of the documented manipulation of the land in the Merina kingdom involve the building of palaces for royalty or of temples. Andrianampoinimerina (c.1745-1809) was the first to use the toponym of Imerina after conquering Antananarivo. He projected his power by constructing a palace on the site that became the seat of royal power in the Merina kingdom. A significant alteration of the landscape made under the rule of Andrianampoinimerina was the introduction of irrigation systems that allowed for the farming of rice paddies. To the present day rice remains a staple of Malagasy cuisine. The digging of canals and dikes was done by vast numbers of slaves placed under royal servitude, or fanompoana. The landscape of Imerina and its geographical manipulation had significant ritual meaning in Merina culture. The irrigation system introduced to Antananarivo, the central authority of Imerina, represented the unification between the Merina royalty and its people. This infrastructural feat paralleled the ritual sprinkling of water known as tsodrano done to represent the unification of land and people. Merina beliefs held the connection between cultural history and the landscape in high regard. The use of water to represent spiritual connections between people, the land, and ancestors remains common in the present day. By the 1820s, an increased European population had superimposed many Western geographic features onto Imerina. This involved the introduction of non native plants and trees. This proved particularly successful for Europeans as the Malagasy soil and climate were particularly conducive to growing European plants and vegetables. Social organization=Caste system= Before the unification of the Merina kingdom under Andrianampoinimerina, the social structure of the central highlands of Madagascar were distinguished by a class of petty princes and peasant masses. Andriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo. The first sub-divisions of the andriana noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks. Andrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).Piolet (1895), pp. 209‚Äì210 To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a small sacred house on top of his tomb. Future Merina sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century. After the conquests of the 19th century, approximately half of the Merina population consisted of the descendants of slaves. This distinction is calcified in the present day by the classification of the descendants of slaves as \\"blacks\\" and those of freemen as \\"whites\\". The use of color to describe social distinction is further supplemented by the racial distinctions of the Malagasy population tracing back to the original settlement of the island, with Austronesian racial features are contrasted by African racial features. =Religion= Andriamanelo is credited with introducing astrology (sikidy) in Imerina. The Merina rite of circumcision, described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Each sampy was fashioned from diverse components. Under Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the sampy, traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ody had long occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar, but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful sampy called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified‚Äîcomplete with a distinct personality‚Äîand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy‚Äîtwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology‚Äîand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina. Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against Sakalava marauders. The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them. These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the sampin'andriana: the \\"Royal Sampy\\") which were all in the possession of the king. These royal sampy, including Kelimalaza, continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen Ranavalona II upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869. Also beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual fandroana festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time. Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \\"orgy\\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom. On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year. Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as jaka, a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with suet in a decorative clay jar. The confit would then be conserved in a pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana. =Customs= The marriage tradition of the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry‚Äîmeat from the hindquarters of a sheep‚Äîwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts. Andriamanelo's son Ralambo is credited with introducing the tradition of polygamy in Imerina. He also introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups. According to oral history, the institution of lengthy formal mourning periods for deceased sovereigns in Imerina may also have begun with the death of Andrianjaka. He was succeeded by his son, Andriantsitakatrandriana. Despite plenty of religious variation across Imerina and the Malagasy highlands in general, ritual circumcision has remained a constant factor in Merina and Malagasy culture. The permanence of the circumcision ritual continues to the modern day. Indigenous silk clothing (landibe) is especially important in highland cultures, including with the Merina. It was worn during ancestral funerary ceremonies. The Tantaran'ny Andriana or Histories of Kings is the written classic of Merina culture, compiled from oral traditions and stories. The Tantara was collected by the Jesuit priest Fran√ßois Callet in the 1860s. The Tantara and other printed works are held in such high regard that very few can be obtained for any price. Present day Malagasy culture is still tied extensively to the past. Many ceremonies involve reenactments of the past, such as tromba, or the spirit possession ceremony. Generally, the concept of history in Madagascar places a great emphasis on feeling and experiencing rather than knowing. Political organization Besakana, Andrianjaka's residence at the Rova of Antananarivo The line of succession in Imerina used a system called fanjakana arindra (\\"organized government\\"), which was established by the Vazimba noblewomen who raised Andriamanelo, founder of Imerina. While the Vazimba had historically tended to favor rule by queens, the Hova favored male heirs, and the marriage between Andriamanelo's Vazimba and Hova parents had produced two sons and a daughter. To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother. This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child. Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line. The practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo. Imerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora. The capital was shifted by his son Ralambo to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby. Andrianjaka moved his capital from Ambohidrabiby to Ambohimanga upon ascending to the throne around 1610. The Besakana, Masoandrotsiroa and Fitomiandalana houses at the Rova of Antananarivo were preserved and maintained over the centuries by successive generations of Merina sovereigns, imbuing the structures with deep symbolic and spiritual meaning. As Andrianjaka's residence, the Besakana was particularly significant: the original building was torn down and reconstructed in the same design by Andriamasinavalona around 1680, and again by Andrianampoinimerina in 1800, each of whom inhabited the building in turn as their personal residence. King Radama I likewise inhabited the building for much of his time at the Rova, and in 1820 he designated the building as the first site to house what came to be known as the Palace School, the first formal European-style school in Imerina. Sovereigns were enthroned in this building and their mortal remains were displayed here before burial, rendering Besakana \\"the official state room for civil affairs... regarded as the throne of the kingdom.\\" =Defense= The early Merina fighters under the first king of Imerina were equipped with iron-tipped spears, an innovation credited to Andriamanelo himself, who may have been the first among the Hova to use smithed iron in this way. =Justice system= Andrianjaka imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.Kent (1970), p. Economy and trade Andriamanelo was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora. Under Andrianjaka, the plains surrounding Antananarivo were gradually transformed into vast, surplus-producing rice paddies.Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 238 This feat was accomplished by mobilizing large numbers of his able-bodied subjects to construct dikes that enabled the redirection of rainwater for controlled flooding of planted areas. Andrianjaka was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms to aid in the pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 guns and three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army. =Technology= Andriamanelo is traditionally credited with discovering the technique of silversmithing, iron smithing and the construction and use of pirogues. While these technologies were not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of them.  The Slave Trade  Indian Ocean slave catching = Export of Slaves = Captives from tribal raids were made into the Malagasy slave population. Surpluses of these populations were sent to foreign traders on the coast. These traders were initially Arab and Indian, though Europeans began to join those demanding slaves at the start of the 16th century. Malagasy slaves were exported to Arabia, India, R√©union and Mauritius, and the Americas, primarily Brazil.  British Influence  After the British emerged victorious from the Napoleonic wars, they captured the French Mascarene Islands which lie east of Madagascar. These islands facilitated the export of slaves and agricultural products. Some of the first stories of Madagascar to be told in Britain were those told by Robert Drury, a shipwrecked British sailor who wrote about the Malagasy slave trade of in his journal that would be published and widely distributed in England. It was this fixation on the slave trade in Madagascar that initially drew the British to the Merina, giving the Merina the firepower to extend their empire and trading networks across Madagascar. Though the British later returned the island of R√©union to France, they retained Mauritius and included it in the second British-Merina treaty of 1820. This treaty declared an end to the export of slaves in Madagascar under the Merina crown. However, the internal slave market still boomed after 1820 despite British efforts. It is estimated that between 6,000 to 10,000 slaves per year were exported from Antananarivo by 1820. In 1828, Ranavalona I revoked the second British-Merina treaty and expelled most foreigners from Madagascar by 1836. = Domestic Slavery = Due to the thin population density of Madagascar, domestic slavery was a way to broadcast control over resources and manpower. The elite of Imerina relied heavily upon slave labor. Because of this, the Merina king Radama I had little intent to abide by the first British-Merina treaty signed in 1817. Slave ownership became increasingly common in the following decades. As the slave caste expanded, more and more of the Merina population began holding slaves. As imperial conquests continually increased the supply of slaves captured from neighboring tribes, the population of Antananarivo grew from around 10,000 in 1820 to 50,000 in 1833. The demand in slaves matched the rise in supply as a result of fanompoana, or mandatory military service, being established in the Merina kingdom thereby drawing able bodied free men away from agricultural labor and into the army. In the second half of the 19th century, the Merina had begun to import slaves from East Africa. This was driven by an economy that critically relied on slave labor as well as the demands of Merina court officials that had personal financial interests. Emancipation of domestic slaves began in 1877, when an estimated 150,000 slaves were freed. However, these newly freed slaves were made into an imperial labor reserve, a position not far removed from enslavement.

Blackstone's death in late 1916 the business was sold to a new combine, Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) group, but retained its identity and management. Blackstone shareholders were paid with new AGE shares. Their former business continued to prosper but the profits went to support unprofitable members of the new combine. AGE turned out to be a failure from start to finish and had to be liquidated following its financial collapse in 1932. AGE shares proved worthless. Three of E. C.

Only one was built. Design The Koolhoven FK.42 was designed to train civilian pilots and enable them to gain their certificates rapidly on an aircraft similar to those low performance types they were likely to fly later, rather than slowly on specialised aircraft designed to train military pilots. The Farman F.200 was built to the same end. Its one-piece, wooden parasol wing was built around two box spars and was covered in plywood. On each side two parallel, airfoil- section struts braced the wing from the lower fuselage to the spars, each pair only about from the centreline. The FK.42 was powered by an air-cooled, Cirrus Hermes four-cylinder inline engine, mounted upright in the nose. It was enclosed in an alumimium cowling and had a fuel tank in the central wing between the spars. The fuselage, like the wings, was all-wood; spruce longerons and ply skin gave it flat sides and bottom but there was rounded upper decking. When it first appeared it had two open cockpits in tandem but quite soon the two were merged into a single cockpit. The trainer was flown solo from the rear seat; the pupil's forward position had deployable dual controls. The empennage was conventional, with the straight-tapered tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a single strut on each side. The elevators were unbalanced. The fin was triangular and the rudder, again unbalanced and straight-edged, extended down to the keel through an elevator cut-out. The FK.42 had fixed tailskid landing gear with a large track of . The mainwheels were hinged on faired V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons and had long, vertical shock absorber struts to the forward spars at the top of the wing struts, strengthened there by two more short struts per side to the upper fuselage. Operational history The date of the FK.42's first flight is not known but it was registered on 5 June 1929 in the company name. Both the FK.42 and the larger, three-seat FK.41 were at the International Light Plane Meeting held in Rotterdam between 27‚Äì30 June 1929, where Frederick Koolhoven certainly flew the FK.41. Koolhoven, a cautious pilot, found the new trainer reassuring to fly and he took it to several other aircraft meetings. Despite the publicity, no sales were made and only one FK.42 was built. It remained with Koolhoven until February 1932, when it was re-registered to W. de Heer at Rotterdam. It was lost in a crash on 7 July 1932.

Created by Diane English, the series originally starred Susan Dey as Wally Porter, a New York City restaurateur, and Jay Thomas as Jack Stein, a newspaper columnist with whom she had an on- again, off-again romance. After the first season, however, the show was retooled and Dey was fired by the producers of the show, saying that she and Thomas had \\"no chemistry\\" together. She was replaced by Annie Potts as Dana Palladino, who bought Porter's restaurant and also became a love interest for Jack. The first season also featured moments when Jack or Wally would break the fourth wall and address the camera directly, generally using it as an opportunity to discuss an emotional crisis. This technique was dropped in later seasons. One episode featured a guest appearance from Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as themselves; they did this as a \\"thank you\\" to creator Diane English for allowing a brief scene on Murphy Brown in an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer is cast as the titular character's secretary. The show's supporting cast included Suzie Plakson, Joanna Gleason, Joel Murray, Charlie Robinson and Michael Nouri. John Hancock, who had a recurring role as a judge on L.A. Law with Susan Dey previously, portrayed bartender Ike for the first half of season one, until he died of a heart attack in late 1992.

Class 41 Rekolokomotive The term was used for classes of steam locomotive that underwent considerable rebuilding in order to improve performance, rectify design faults and redress wartime austerity features. At the same time, repairs were carried out. The 'reconstruction' included, as a minimum, the installation of a new high performance steam generation system. Consequently, a characteristic feature of these Rekoloks is a combustion chamber boiler with rectangular mixing chamber (Mischkasten) in front of the chimney. On individual classes (Class 58.30), completely new driver's cabs were built, instead of just fitting the new end walls needed after the boiler had been replaced. The worn cast cylinder blocks were sometimes replaced by welded cylinders. Unlike the Deutsche Bundesbahn's conversion programme, the boilers were not matched to the individual locomotive classes, but the locomotives were matched to the new boilers. The price paid for the easy interchangeability of the steam generation system thus achieved, was the extensive changes now required to the locomotive frame. Also reconstructed were selected vehicles of those locomotive classes that could not be done away with and from which a long period of operational life was expected. The first Rekolok, number 50 3501, left Stendal Reichsbahn repair shop (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk or RAW), which had carried out the work, on 12 November 1957. The first Reko 50, from then on designated as Class 50.35, was assigned to G√ºsten locomotive shed (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw). With the delivery of 01 535 by RAW Meiningen on 31 May 1965 the Reko programme was initially declared as finished, but in fact it wasn't. For in 1968 the state and party leadership of the GDR tasked the Reichsbahn, to produce a strategic reserve of 45 Class 03 express train locomotives with an 18-ton average axle load. From 1968 to 1972, not just the required 45, but as many as 52 locomotives of this class were fitted with Reko boilers in RAW Meiningen from the largely retired Class 22 (formerly Class 39, Prussian P 10) engines. The Class 58.30 Rekolokomotives were, due to their age and the very extensive repairs and work required on the donor vehicles, the most expensive conversions of the whole programme. The following normal gauge steam locomotive classes were reconstructed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and regrouped into a new class or sub-class: * 1962-1965: 35 locomotives of DRG Class 01 to DR Class 01.5 * 1969-1972: 52 locomotives of DRG Class 03 * 1959: 16 locomotives of DRG Class 03.10 * 1958-1962: 85 locomotives of DRG Class 39 to DR Class 22 * 1957-1960: 80 locomotives of DRG Class 41 to DR Class 41 (Reko) * 1957-1961: 208 locomotives of DRG Class 50 to DR Class 50.35-37 * 1960-1965: 154 locomotives of DRB Class 52 to DR Class 52.80 * 1958-1962: 56 locomotives of DRG Class 58 (ex Prussian G 12) to DR Class 58.30 and as individual vehicles for experimental testing and, sometimes, trials equipment platforms: * 1961-1965: 5 experimental locomotives: VES-M Halle DR 18 201, 18 314, 19 015, 19 022, 23 001 (DRG) The VES-M Halle in Halle (Saale) was responsible for the reconstruction programme See also * History of rail transport in Germany * Deutsche Reichsbahn Steam locomotives of Germany Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft locomotives ","title":"Rekonstruktionslokomotive"},{"id":"18608735","text":"Dragon Warrior or Dragon Quest is a video game series.

In Croatian, the building is colloquially known under the generic title Neboder (lit. \\"Skyscraper\\") as it was the first business skyscraper in the country. History The building, designed by the trio of Slobodan Joviƒçiƒá, Josip Hitil and Ivan ≈Ωuljeviƒá, was built between 1957 and 1958 and was officially inaugurated on 22 August 1959, when Veƒáeslav Holjevac was mayor of Zagreb. It was the tallest building in Yugoslavia at the time of its completion, and it was the first building in the country which featured an aluminium fa√ßade (aluminium sheets for the building were manufactured at the Utva aircraft factory in Panƒçevo). Other notable high-rises built earlier in Zagreb include the nine-story modernist L√∂wy Building built in 1933 and the so-called Wooden Skyscraper designed by Drago Ibler - but since they were both residential buildings which resembled skyscrapers in design but not in function or size, the sixteen-story 1 Ilica Street is regarded as the first \\"bona fide skyscraper\\" built in Zagreb and Yugoslavia. The principal investors were Konƒçar and Ferimport, two large state-owned companies. The building later housed Ferimport offices, but it also featured an observation deck and a restaurant on its top floor (later converted into a short-lived disco club in the early 1990s) and a small shopping arcade which was built around the base of the building, connecting Ilica, Gajeva, Bogoviƒáeva and Petriƒáeva streets. The observation deck was open to the public for decades, but it was fenced by security railings in 1967 after a man committed suicide by jumping off it and landing on a woman passing by, who was also killed. On 29 November 1970 (former Yugoslav Republic Day), political activists Zvonko and Julienne Bu≈°iƒá used the observation deck to throw leaflets advocating Croatian independence, for which they were arrested. Ferimport later experienced a dramatic downturn in the 1990s after it was privatized in the years following Croatia's independence and the fall of communism, and the building visibly deteriorated in this period. In 2001, three years after Ferimport had entered administration, it was sold for 6 million euros to Peter Doimi de Frankopan, a British real estate investor who claimed lineage to the House of Frankopan, a Croatian aristocratic family thought to be extinct in the 17th century. Frankopan had plans for a large scale reconstruction of the building, but the initial concept (which entailed a complete redesign of the fa√ßade and the addition of panoramic elevators, spiral staircases and a few extra floors), was rejected by the city's institute for the protection of cultural heritage. The project was then delayed for four years until a revised renovation plan was finally approved by city authorities in December 2005. Following the approval, renovation was finally launched in 2006 and was finished in early 2008. The project was designed by the Aukett Fitzroy Robinson interior design practice in collaboration with the Zagreb-based architecture studio Proarh, and the actual work was done by the Strabag construction company. The most significant change in the exterior was the replacement of the originally clear windows with dark gray glass. The building currently has 5,600 m2 of office space, and the observation deck on the top floor was closed to the public in 2007. It was reopened in 2013 as \\"Zagreb Eye\\".

Following an ambush a few days before and in reprisals against activities of the French Resistance, Second Lieutenant Gustav Schl√ºter and his men organized the massacre and burnt the village. Forty-eight children were among the dead. The SS unit believed to be responsible for the massacre is the SS- Feldersatzbataillon 17 of 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen (Lieb, 2007). In contrast to Oradour-sur-Glane, the village was rebuilt after the war to its pre-war state (Delahousse, 2008). Development of events On the evening of August 24, 1944, skirmishes between the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) and German troops took place near a farm in the commune of Maill√©. Gustave Schl√ºter, commander of the German control post at Sainte-Maure-de-Touraine, mobilized his men and two train-mounted artillery pieces (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945; Lieb, 2007). The next morning, Maill√© was closed off by German forces. One artillery piece was destroyed by the attacking RAF. The first farms were then set on fire and their residents killed. About noon, the SS entered the village and the systematic killing began. Some wounded who had pretended to be dead were later shot down when they attempted to escape (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945). About 1:00 pm the artillery bombardment began, demolishing the village and any who might have survived the initial onslaught. The soldiers were also there to ensure that survivors were shot on sight. By late afternoon calm returned, and the few survivors could only look upon the spectacle with sadness. The intervention of abbot Andr√© Payon was needed so that they could leave to take shelter in neighboring villages. In less than four hours, entire families were slaughtered by the Waffen SS, many of whose soldiers were only 16 and 17 years old (Chevereau & Forlivesi, 2005; Delahousse, 2008; Payon, 1945).

The concept first made its appearance in psychology with roots to the holistic perspective of Gestalt theories. It was developed by Kurt Lewin, a Gestalt psychologist, in the 1940s. Lewin's field theory can be expressed by a formula: B = f(p,e), meaning that behavior (B) is a function of the person (p) and their environment (e).Burnes, Bernard; Cooke, Bill (2013). \\"Kurt Lewin's Field Theory: A Review and Re-evaluation\\". International Journal of Management Reviews, 15(4), 408-425. doi:10.1111/j.1468-2370.2012.00348.x. History Early philosophers believed the body to have a rational, inner nature that helped guide our thoughts and bodies. This intuitive force, our soul, was viewed as having supreme control over our entire being. However, this view changed during the intellectual revolution of the 17th century. The mind versus the body was a forever evolving concept that received great attention from the likes of Descartes, Locke and Kant. From once believing that the mind and body interact, to thinking the mind is completely separate from the body, rationalist and empirical views were deeply rooted in the understanding of this phenomenon. Field Theory emerged when Lewin considered a person's behavior to consist of many different interactions. He believed people to have dynamic thoughts, forces, and emotions that shifted their behavior to reflect their present state. Kurt Lewin's influence Kurt Lewin was born in Germany in 1890. He originally wanted to pursue behaviorism, but later found an interest in Gestalt psychology while volunteering in the German army in 1914. His early experiences substantially influenced the development of his field theory. Lewin's field theory emphasized interpersonal conflict, individual personalities and situational variables and he proposed that behavior is the result of the individual and their environment. In viewing a person's social environment and its effect on their dynamic field, Lewin also found that a person's psychological state influences their social field. Wanting to shift the focus of psychology away from Aristotlean views and more towards Galileo's approach, he believed psychology needed to follow physics. Drawing from both mathematics and physics, Lewin took the concept of the field, the focus of one's experiences, needs, and topography to map spatial relationships. Lewin created a field theory rule that says analysis can only start with the situation represented as a whole, so in order for change to take place, the entire situation must be taken into account. There seems to be a repetition of people having the same unsuccessful attempts to grow and develop themselves and field theory draws the conclusion that this repetition comes from forces within our fields. To display this psychological field, Lewin constructed \\"topological maps\\" that showed inter-related areas and indicated the directions of people's goals. Main principles=The life space= The idea that an individual's behavior, at any time, is manifested only within the coexisting factors of the current \\"life space\\" or \\"psychological field.\\" So a life space is the combination of all the factors that influences a person's behavior at any time. Therefore, behavior can be expressed as a function of the life space B=∆í(LS). Furthermore, the interaction of the person (P), and the environment (E) produces this life space. In symbolic expression, B=∆í(LS)=F(P,E). An example of a more complex life-space concept is the idea that two people's experience of a situation can become one when they converse together. This does not happen if the two people do not interact with each other, such as being in the same room but not talking to each other. This combined space can be \\"built\\" up as the two people share more ideas and create a more complex life-space together. Environment The environment as demonstrated in the life space, refers to the objective situation in which the person perceives and acts. The life space environment (E) is completely subjective within each context as it depends not only on the objective situation, but also on the characteristics of the person (P). It is necessary to consider all aspects of a person's conscious and unconscious environment in order to map out the person's life space. The combined state, influenced by the environment as well as the person's perspective, conscious, and unconscious, must be viewed as a whole. While each part can be viewed as a separate entity, to observe the totality of the situation one must take all inputs into consideration. Person Lewin applied the term person in three different ways. # Properties/characteristics of the individual. (needs, beliefs, values, abilities) # A way of representing essentially the same psychological facts of \\"life space\\" itself. #\\"The behaving self\\". \\"The behaving self may be seen as the individual's perception of his relations to the environment he perceives.\\" The development of the person inevitably affects the life space. As a person undergoes changes with their body or their image of themselves changes, this can cause an instability in the region of life space. Additionally, an instability in the psychological environment or life space can lead to the instability of the person. Behavior Any change within the life space subject to psychological laws. Accordingly, an action of the person (P) or a change in the environment (E) resulting from said action, can be considered behavior (B). These behaviors can make large or small influences on the totality of the life space. Regardless, they must be taken into consideration. Field theory holds that behavior must be derived from a totality of coexisting facts. These coexisting facts make up a \\"dynamic field\\", which means that the state of any part of the field depends on every other part of it. This not only includes both mental and physical fields, but also unseen forces such as magnetism and gravity. This can be elaborated by imagining the difference that a force can make by acting from a distance. When considering something such as the Moon's influence on the Earth, it is clear that there is an effect even though it acts from a large distance away. Behavior depends on the present field rather than on the past or the future. Development also plays a major role in life space behavior. From the beginning of one's life behavior is molded in all respects to his or her social situation. This of course brings up the sociological discussion of nature versus nurture. Experimental psychology studies have shown the formation of aspiration, the driving factor of actions and expressions (behavior), is directly influenced by the presence or absence of certain individuals within one's life space. A child's development naturally leads to an opening up of new unknown life space regions. Transitional periods such as adolescence are characterized by a greater effect of these new regions. Therefore, an adolescent entering a new social group or life space can be seen psychologically as entering a cognitively unstructured field. This new field makes it difficult for the individual to know what behavior is appropriate within the field. This is believed to be a possibility for changes in child and adolescent behavior. Theory and experimental evidence Field Theory Image 1 Field Theory Image 2 According to field theory, a person's life is made up of multiple distinct spaces. Image 1 is an example of the total field, or environment. Image 2 is showing a person, and a goal they have. This image shows that there are forces pushing a person toward their goal. The dotted line is everything one must go through to reach their goal, and how one must go through many different spaces. Individuals may have the same goal, but the field to get there may be different. One's field may be adjusted in order to gain the most in life. Some fields may be deleted, and some added, all depending on certain events that occur in a persons lifetime. Field theory also includes the idea that every person holds a different experience for a situation. This is not to say that two people's experience of an event will not be similar, but that there will be some difference. This leads to the idea that no two experiences are the same for a person either, as the dynamic field is constantly changing.Parlet, Malcolm (1991). \\"Reflections on Field Theory\\". The British Gestalt Journal 1: 68-91. Retrieved 31 October 2014 This is to say that the dynamic field is like a stream, constantly flowing while changing slightly. Another piece of field theory is the idea that no part of a person's field can be viewed as being pointless. Every part of a total field must be viewed as having possible meaning and importance. This must be done regardless of how pointless or non-important the part of the field may seem, it should still be accounted for. The totality of an individual's field seems to have no bounds, as research has shown that even an infant's experience of World War II could possibly affect life later on, due to the change in field. This is a good example of how broad field theory can span, as a person's preconsciousness may be altered due to field changes that occurred before any major development. Reception and implications Field theory is important aspect of Gestalt theory, a doctrine that includes many important methods and discoveries. It is a crucial building block to the foundation of Gestalt psychologists' concepts and applications. The field theory is also corner stone of Gestalt therapy together with phenomenology and existencialist dialog.

The arms were recorded again at the visitation of 1623, but neither visitation noted the colours of the arms.Visitation of Dorsetshire, p.6, (UK Genealogy), accessed November 3, 2007 The design originated in a seal of the late 14th century and therefore predated the setting up of the College of Heralds in 1484 and also the order of King Henry V in 1417, which disallowed the bearing of arms without authority from the Crown. The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and the dolphin \\"the king of the sea\\", just as the lion represents \\"the king of beasts\\". The dolphin was a sign of Poole's maritime interests. The three scallop shells are the symbol of St James, apostle of Jesus Christ, and are associated with the shrine of Santiago de Compostela, St James's reputed burial place. Santiago de Compostela was a popular destination for Christian pilgrims departing from Poole Harbour in the Middle Ages. St James is also the patron saint of the parish church of Poole. The arms were confirmed by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, with the colours officially recorded for the first time. At the same time the crest was granted, a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball, although it had been in use since the 18th century.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1971W. H. Fox Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London, 1915 Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to the present Poole Borough Council.The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) Order 1974 (1974 No. 869) In 1976 the borough council received the grant of supporters, the figures on either side of the shield, a gift from Oscar Murton, the then Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons to commemorate his period of service as a Councillor and MP for Poole. The supporters refer to Poole's main charters. To the left is a gold lion holding a long sword. This represents William Longespee, who as Lord of the Manor in 1248 granted the town's first charter.

Extracellular The following naturally- produced substances block sodium channels by binding to and occluding the extracellular pore opening of the channel: * Alkaloids: ** Saxitoxin (STX) ** Neosaxitoxin (NSTX) ** Tetrodotoxin (TTX) Intracellular Drugs which block sodium channels by blocking from the intracellular side of the channel include: * Local anesthetics: lidocaine * Class I antiarrhythmic agents * Various anticonvulsants: phenytoin, oxcarbazepine (derivative of carbamazepine) Unknown mechanism * Calcium has been shown to block sodium channels which explains the effects of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia. * Lamotrigine is known to block sodium channels but it is not known whether it is extracellular or intracellular. * Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to cause inhibitory effects on sodium currents. This voltage-dependent inhibition is non-selective in nature. The current literature suggests that cannabidiol inhibits sodium currents primarily through altering the biophysical properties of cell membrane, promoting the inactivated conformation of * sodium channels. Antiarrhythmic Sodium channel blockers are used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia. They are classified as \\"Type I\\" in the Vaughan Williams classification. Class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the (Na+) channel. Class I agents are grouped by their effect on the Na+ channel, and by their effect on cardiac action potentials. Class I agents are called Membrane Stabilizing Agents. 'Stabilizing' refers to the decrease of excitogenicity of the plasma membrane affected by these agents. A few class II agents, propranolol for example, also have a membrane stabilizing effect. =Class Ia agents= Class Ia agent decreasing Vmax, thereby increasing action potential duration. Class Ia agents block the fast sodium channel, which depresses the phase 0 depolarization (i.e. reduces Vmax), which prolongs the action potential duration by slowing conduction. Agents in this class also cause decreased conductivity and increased refractoriness. Indications for Class Ia agents are supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, symptomatic ventricular premature beats, and prevention of ventricular fibrillation. Procainamide can be used to treat atrial fibrillation in the setting of Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome, and to treat wide complex hemodynamically stable tachycardias. Oral procainamide is no longer being manufactured in the US, but intravenous formulations are still available. While procainamide and quinidine may be used in the conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, they should only be used in conjunction with an AV node blocking agent such as digoxin or verapamil, or a beta blocker), because procainamide and quinidine can increase the conduction through the AV node and may cause 1:1 conduction of atrial fibrillation, causing an increase in the ventricular rate. Class Ia agents include quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide. =Class Ib agents= Effect of class Ib antiarrhythmic agents on the cardiac action potential. Class Ib antiarrhythmic agents are sodium channel blockers. They have fast onset and offset kinetics, meaning that they have little or no effect at slower heart rates, and more effects at faster heart rates. Class Ib agents shorten the action potential duration and reduce refractoriness. These agents will decrease Vmax in partially depolarized cells with fast response action potentials. They either do not change the action potential duration, or they may decrease the action potential duration. Class Ib drugs tend to be more specific for voltage gated Na channels than Ia. Lidocaine in particular is highly frequency dependent, in that it has more activity with increasing heart rates. This is because lidocaine selectively blocks Na channels in their open and inactive states and has little binding capability in the resting state. Class Ib agents are indicated for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and symptomatic premature ventricular beats, and prevention of ventricular fibrillation. Class Ib agents include lidocaine, mexiletine, tocainide, and phenytoin. =Class Ic agents= Effect of class Ic antiarrhythmic agent on cardiac action potential. Class Ic antiarrhythmic agents markedly depress the phase 0 depolarization (decreasing Vmax). They decrease conductivity, but have a minimal effect on the action potential duration. Of the sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic agents (the class I antiarrhythmic agents), the class Ic agents have the most potent sodium channel blocking effects. Class Ic agents are indicated for supraventricular arrhythmias (i.e. atrial fibrillation) and as a last line treatment for refractory life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. These agents are potentially pro-arrhythmic, especially in settings of structural heart disease (e.g. post-myocardial infarction), and are contraindicated in such settings. Class Ic agents include encainide, flecainide, moricizine, and propafenone. Encainide is not available in the United States. Other uses Sodium channel blockers are also used as local anesthetics and anticonvulsants. Sodium channel blockers have been proposed for use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, but current evidence is mixed. It has been suggested that the analgesic effects of some antidepressants may be mediated in part via sodium channel blockade. Future prospects Selective blockers of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 voltage-gated sodium channels, such as CNV1014802 and Funapide, are being investigated as novel analgesics.

Medical uses = Arrhythmia = Effect of class III antiarrhythmic agent on cardiac action potential. Potassium channel blockers used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia are classified as class III antiarrhythmic agents. Mechanism Class III agents predominantly block the potassium channels, thereby prolonging repolarization. More specifically, their primary effect is on IKr. Since these agents do not affect the sodium channel, conduction velocity is not decreased. The prolongation of the action potential duration and refractory period, combined with the maintenance of normal conduction velocity, prevent re-entrant arrhythmias. (The re-entrant rhythm is less likely to interact with tissue that has become refractory). Examples and uses *Amiodarone is indicated for the treatment of refractory VT or VF, particularly in the setting of acute ischemia. Amiodarone is also safe to use in individuals with cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, to maintain normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone prolongation of the action potential is uniform over a wide range of heart rates, so this drug does not have reverse use-dependent action. Amiodarone was the first agent described in this class. Amiodarone should only be used to treat adults with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when other treatments are ineffective or have not been tolerated. * Dofetilide blocks only the rapid K channels; this means that at higher heart rates, when there is increased involvement of the slow K channels, dofetilide has less of an action potential-prolonging effect. * Sotalol is indicated for the treatment of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and AV re-entrant arrhythmias. * Ibutilide is the only antiarrhythmic agent currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. * Azimilide * Bretylium * Clofilium * E-4031 * Nifekalant * Tedisamil * Sematilide Side effects These agents include a risk of torsades de pointes. =Anti- diabetics= Sulfonylureas, such as gliclazide, are ATP-sensitive potassium channel blockers. =Other uses= Dalfampridine, A potassium channel blocker has also been approved for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  Reverse use dependence  Potassium channel blockers exhibit reverse use- dependent prolongation of the action potential duration. Reverse use dependence is the effect where the efficacy of the drug is reduced after repeated use of the tissue. This contrasts with (ordinary) use dependence, where the efficacy of the drug is increased after repeated use of the tissue. Reverse use dependence is relevant for potassium channel blockers used as class III antiarrhythmics. Reverse use dependent drugs that slow heart rate (such as quinidine) can be less effective at high heart rates. The refractoriness of the ventricular myocyte increases at lower heart rates. This increases the susceptibility of the myocardium to early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) at low heart rates. Antiarrhythmic agents that exhibit reverse use- dependence (such as quinidine) are more efficacious at preventing a tachyarrhythmia than converting someone into normal sinus rhythm. Because of the reverse use-dependence of class III agents, at low heart rates class III antiarrhythmic agents may paradoxically be more arrhythmogenic. Drugs such as quinidine may be both reverse use dependent and use dependent.

Steamship Co., also called Lykes Lines, was a cargo shipping company acting from the beginning of the 20th century to 2005 having its main business in the trade to and from the United States. History In 1898 the sons of Dr. Howell Tyson Lykes started a shipping business on the Gulf Coast of Florida. They used a 109-foot, 75 ton three-masted schooner to ship cattle to Cuba as a replacement for herds which were wiped out in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The tradition of naming their ships after family members dates back to that time, when this schooner was named Doctor Lykes after their father. Three years later, an office was opened in Galveston, Texas, and Lykes began offering general cargo transportation between the US Gulf and Caribbean ports. In 1922 the Lykes Bros. Steamship Co. was set up as a separate company, owned by the Lykes Brothers. The seven brothers had been trading cotton, lumber and grain for years so owning their own ships was a natural extension of their operations.The Story of Lykes, a publication of the Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. During the 1920s Lykes began to range beyond the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Offices were opened in Europe, and routes were extended to the Mediterranean and Far East. The 1930s saw Lykes acquiring 52 ships from Dixie and Southern States Lines, giving them a fleet of 67 ships. After passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, they committed themselves to the replacement of their fleet with modern freighters. Sixteen had been delivered by December 1941, when the US entered World War II. During the war, Lykes carried 60 million tons of cargo and operated a maximum of 125 cargo ships for the government. 22 ships were lost along with 272 lives. During the postwar years, Lykes returned to commercial activity. By the 1950s, it had a fleet of 54 ships totaling 568,978 deadweight tons. That fleet underwent a complete replacement between 1960 and 1973, when 41 new ships were built. By then, Lykes steamship had become a subsidiary of Lykes Corp., which in 1978 merged with LTV Corp. In 1983 Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. was purchased by Interocean Steamship Corp., a Florida corporation whose stockholders included descendants of the original seven Lykes brothers. With the start of containerization, Lykes was soon participating, becoming a container carrier in the trade lanes of the United States East and Gulf coasts, North Europe, the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean region, Mexico and Africa. Being registered in the U.S., the company had the privilege of being allowed to transport cargo for the U.S. Army. In December 1994 the company moved its headquarters from New Orleans, LA to Tampa, FL (to the former First Florida Tower (currently the Park Tower) at 400 North Tampa Street). The general offices were later moved to the SunTrust Tower at 401 East Jackson Street in Tampa. In October 1995, the company filed for chapter 11 reorganization. On February 24, 1997, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Alexander Paskay approved a bid by CP Ships, Ltd. to buy Lykes Brothers Steamship Co. In the following years, CP Ships integrated the services of Ivaran Lines which they bought up in May 1998 and Christensen Canadian African Lines (CCAL) which was acquired in August 2000 into the Lykes Lines brand. In late 2005 the Lykes Lines brand was replaced by the CP Ships brand following CP's one brand strategy promoted by the \\"One brand ‚Äì One team\\" project. CP Ships itself was bought up by TUI AG and merged in mid-2006 in the Hapag-Lloyd organization.

It was built in 1888 to replace a wooden structure and carried automobile traffic until 1986. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History A number of bridges were built across the South Platte River beginning in 1859, and by 1875, there was interest in a bridge to span the river at the 19th Street location. In 1876, a wooden bridge was constructed at the site. This previous bridge was closed to traffic in 1884 after it was damaged in a flood. Because of repeated floods destroying numerous wooden bridges, the city of Denver sought to replace them with metal structures. By 1887, because of their ready availability and low expense, the city began building metal bridges to replace the wooden spans. On August 26, 1887, the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Works was contracted to build the 19th Street Bridge. The structure cost $25,000, including $8,250 for of iron. Construction on the new span was complete in 1888. Around 1898, a plan surfaced to rebuild the bridge as a viaduct so that it would not cross only the river, but also the rail switching yard. However, the plan was defeated in June 1904. The bridge has remained mostly unmodified since construction. Timber decking was replaced with corrugated steel following a 1961 flood and some bent hinges were replaced as a result of a 1965 flood. The 19th Street Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 4, 1985. Because of repeated wear and deterioration caused by salt for melting ice, the bridge was restricted to pedestrians and bicycles beginning on December 16, 1986. Following the closure, a new vehicular bridge was planned downstream (to the northeast), tentatively referred to as the \\"Nineteen and A-Half Street Bridge\\"; it was built in 1992. Aside from serving as a pedestrian bridge, the structure has hosted the annual \\"Gala on the Bridge\\", a fundraiser for The Greenway Foundation. It began in 2011, and was described in The Denver Post as the \\"first time the bridge has been used for anything other than a way for people to cross the South Platte River\\". In the state of Colorado, at the time of its NRHP nomination, the 19th Street Bridge was described as the oldest surviving wrought iron bridge, oldest vehicular bridge at its original location, and oldest vehicular bridge still in public use. Design Detail of one end of the bridge, showing the ornamental crests and finials (in 2008) The bridge's two spans have a through Pratt truss design, each with five panels. The structure is about long with a roadway about wide. The roadbed is concrete on corrugated metal, replacing the original wood decking.

Biography  Christopher Gross was born February 5, 1968, in Honolulu, where his father was stationed during the Vietnam War. Barron spent his childhood in the Bronx and Rye, New York, and later moved to Australia for over three years when he was eight years old. He went to primary school in Sydney. When his family returned to the United States, Barron attended the Princeton High School in Princeton, New Jersey,Staff. \\"Chris Barron: Spin Doctor helps old high school\\", Wilmington Morning Star, March 14, 1995. Accessed December 10, 2018. \\"Chris Barron, lead singer of the Spin Doctors, gave a pocketful of cash to his old high school. Mr. Barron returned to Princeton High School on Sunday for a benefit concert to help the New Jersey school choir raise money for its trip to England and France next month.\\" the same school as John Popper, and the two became close friends. Barron and Popper would jam together after school. He attended Bennington College in Vermont for one year. There, he was a member of two local bands: Dead Alcoholics With Boners and the Funbunnies. After leaving Bennington, Barron returned to Princeton, got a job at a restaurant, and immersed himself in music. During this time, he wrote \\"Jimmy Olsen's Blues\\" and \\"Two Princes\\". One night, John Popper's band Blues Traveler was in town. After hanging out for a night and hearing Barron's songs, Popper invited Barron to move in with them in New York City, and so Barron moved to New York City in 1988, with $100 and an acoustic guitar. He joined the band Trucking Company with Popper and Canadian guitarist Eric Schenkman. Popper left this side project to focus on his main gig with Blues Traveler full-time. With a name change to Spin Doctors, as well as the addition of Aaron Comess and Mark White, the classic lineup was in place by the spring of 1989. On May 17, 1999, just two weeks before the release of the band's album Here Comes the Bride, Barron woke up unable to talk. He lost his voice due to a rare acute form of vocal cord paralysis that severely affected his ability to talk, let alone sing. He was told he had a 50-50 chance of ever talking or singing normally again. Band keyboardist Ivan Neville took over vocal duties for a few dates, but the band eventually cancelled the remainder of its tour. Barron's voice came back in early 2000 (first comeback [solo] shows in March 2000), at which point he began performing with his band and the Give Daddy Five. Barron undertook what he calls \\"a journeyman songwriting experience,\\" composing tunes with Blues Traveler's John Popper and with former BMI executive Jeff Cohen. A solo album called Shag was released in 2001, featuring diverse influences, including rock, jazz, country, and funk. The Spin Doctors remained inactive as a band until September 2001, when news about the closing of legendary NYC venue Wetlands sparked the original four members to reunite. On September 7, 2001, the original line-up took the stage for the first time since 1994 to play at Wetlands. It was the final closing week of the club. The landmark show was a great success for the fans and the band. Barron met Laura Benanti in the early 2000s. They married on July 25, 2005 but by the end of the year were going through what Benanti has called a \\"terrible divorce.\\" They were divorced in 2006. He then married actress Lindsay Nicole Chambers, the lead in the Broadway tour of Kinky Boots. In 2009, he put out a solo album called Pancho and the Kid, and a year later he released an EP called Songs from the Summer of Sangria. In 2012, Barron took part in the Norwegian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, with The Canoes. In 2017, Barron released Angels and One Armed Jugglers to positive reviews.

She has written extensively on prison law and torture, Caribbean culture and literary history, as well as on Haitian poetics, Edgar Allan Poe, and the history of slavery. After receiving her Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center in 1980, she taught at Princeton University, Yale University, the City University of New York, the University of Arizona, and the University of Pennsylvania. After publishing A Rainbow for the Christian West (1977), an introduction to Ren√© Depestre's poetry and a translation of his long poem Un arc-en-ciel pour l'occident chr√©tien, she turned to early American literature and published Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe's Fiction (1987). Haiti, History, and the Gods (1995, 1998) reorients the study of Haitian history through what she calls \\"literary fieldwork\\". In the process, she recasts many boundaries: between politics and poetics, between the secular and the sacred, and between the colonizer and the colonized, those who deemed themselves masters and those who worked as slaves. The Story of Cruel and Unusual (2007), focuses on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and traces the precedents for the torture of detainees in the \\"war on terror\\". Chosen as one of top-25 books for 2011, The Law is a White Dog, How Legal Rituals Make and Unmake Persons was published by Princeton University Press in Spring 2011. Her next book, With Dogs at the Edge of Life (2016) moves seamlessly between memoir, case law, and film. With dogs in the lead, we watch the breath and fury and flexing of life at the edges‚Äînot the precondition for uniqueness but rather an imperative to seek a voracious communion with the nonhumans in our midsts. Dayan‚Äôs memoir In the Belly of Her Ghost (2019) takes readers to the Jim Crow South through the voice of her mother, who appears as muse, fury, and haunt. A ritual of memory, as well as a confession, this story captures racial terror, as well as a love so fierce that it takes the pulse of the South, its cruelties and its grit. ANIMAL QUINTET, her new memoir, returns to the South, this time through the lives of animals--ranging from war horses led by Civil War generals and doomed Spanish fighting bulls to the possum hunted by generations of Southerners. Dayan has received an NEH fellowship (1986); a Guggenheim fellowship (2005) recognized her work on conditions of disfigured personhood and civil death that long outlive slavery itself. She has been a fellow at the Shelby Cullom Davis Center in the Department of History and a fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs, both at Princeton. Her memoirs of growing up in Atlanta, Georgia have been published in The Yale Review, Southwest Review, and The Arizona Quarterly.

The Type 38 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 38th year of Emperor Meiji's reign (1905).War Department Special Series No 25 Japanese Field Artillery October 1944 History and development As Japan's priority lay in her navy, the Imperial Army was given a back seat to new land warfare designs, as well as the raw material (steel) needed to build them. Thus, like the US who purchased French Renault tanks (Model 1917s) for its first tank units, the planners at the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff found it necessary to purchase artillery, and turned to Krupp in Germany. Initial units were imported, and then further production was made under license by the Army‚Äôs Osaka Arsenal starting in 1911.Meyer, The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan, p. 97. After World War I, these weapons were considered largely obsolete and efforts were made to replace it with the Type 4 15 cm howitzer. However, it was still found in front line heavy artillery regiments.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces Design The Type 38 150mm Howitzer was a conventional design for its day, complete with crew seats on the gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydro-spring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield. It was designed to be moved by a team of eight horses, but in practice, its heavy weight was a problem. The Type 38 150mm Field Gun (improved) was capable of firing High-explosive, shrapnel, incendiary, smoke and illumination and gas shells.Bishop. The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II Surplus weapons were also mounted on the chassis of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank as the Type 4 Ho-Ro self-propelled gun.Zaloga, Japanese Tanks 1939-45, p. 20. Combat record Although obsolete, the Type 38 150mm Field Gun was found in theatres of operation in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and in the early Pacific War.Chant, Artillery of World War II Against the Chinese, the Type 38 was used with some success due to the fact the Chinese were desperately lacking in heavy artillery in the early part of the war. However, whenever the Japanese did face Chinese heavy artillery typically armed with German 15 cm sFH 18 heavy artillery guns, e.g. in the Battles of Wuhan and Changsha, Japanese gun crews found themselves both badly outranged and hopelessly outgunned and the Type 38 was withdrawn from front-line service in 1942. However, as the Type 4 Ho-Ro self-propelled gun, units were deployed on Luzon and other islands in the Philippines, and were used in combat against American forces at the Battle of the Philippines in 1944. Other units were retained on the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the projected Allied invasion. NotesReferences * Bishop, Chris (ed.). The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II.

Any mining, harvesting, or manufacturing process will yield products spanning a range of quality and desirability in the marketplace. Binning allows differing quality products to be priced appropriately for various uses and markets. Economic and legal theory Product binning and grading allows a degree of price discrimination which may be easier to defend legally, since it can be based on real or perceived differences in product quality. In order to undergo binning, manufactured products require testing, usually performed by machines in bulk. Binning allows large variances in performance to be condensed into a smaller number of marketed designations. This ensures coherency in the marketplace, with tiers of performance clearly delineated. The immediate result of this practice is that, for legal and reputational reasons, products sold under a certain designation must meet that designation at a minimum. Individual products may still exceed advertised performance. Different bins may even be assigned different model numbers and prices . Agriculture An everyday example of product binning occurs with agricultural products, such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables. The yield from a harvest may vary considerably in quality, from near-inedible to ideal photographic appearance. The produce is sorted into quality categories which may be based on nutrition and safety, but also often have criteria that are based on cosmetic appearance. The best quality items may be classified into categories such as \\"Choice\\" or \\"Grade A\\", and are sold at a premium price for table presentation and consumption. Items that are less visually appealing or damaged may be binned for incorporation into frozen, dried, canned, or otherwise-processed foods. Consumers rarely see these lesser categories for sale in a raw, unprocessed condition. Foods of even lower quality may be processed into pet food or animal feed, or composted into fertilizer. Clothing and fashionGemstonesSemiconductor manufacturing=Background= Semiconductor manufacturing is an imprecise process, sometimes achieving as low as 30% yield. Defects in manufacturing are not always fatal, however; in many cases it is possible to salvage part of a failed batch of integrated circuits by modifying performance characteristics. For example, by reducing the clock frequency or disabling non-critical parts that are defective, the parts can be sold at a lower price, fulfilling the needs of lower-end market segments. This practice occurs throughout the semiconductor industry on products such as CPUs, RAM, and GPUs. =Speed bump= A speed bump, in computer terms, is a slight increase in frequency (e.g., from 1.8 to 1.9 GHz) or a slight increase in functionality (e.g. Intel Core i7-8700K to i7-8086K). Some time after the initial release of a product, manufacturers may choose to increase the clock frequency of an integrated circuit for a variety of reasons, ranging from improved yields to more conservative speed ratings (e.g., actual power consumption lower than TDP). These models are binned as different product chipsets, which places the product into separate virtual bins in which manufacturers can designate them into lower-end chipsets with different performance characteristics. =Testing= Finished products enter a machinehttp://www.legitreviews.com/images/reviews/719/centaur_thermo.jpg that can test hundreds of pieces at a time, taking only a few hours to complete. Each piece can be tested to determine its highest stable clock frequency and accompanying voltage and temperature while running. =Overclocking and core unlocking=Overclocking Overclocking is the increase of clock speed beyond the manufacturer's maximum rated clockspeed. Since manufacturers are only required to meet the minimum advertised specifications, the potential for overclocking of a product is not typically tested during the binning process. Therefore, it should not be assumed that higher-rated products will overclock better than lower-rated ones. The resulting variation in upper-limit overclocking potential between otherwise identical pieces of hardware results in what is known as the \\"silicon lottery\\" by computer hobbyists, where the peak stable clock speeds (typically of a CPU or GPU) are unknown until being tested after purchasing. Core unlocking Similar to frequency binning, products may also be binned based upon the number of cores which are enabled. As with overclocking, some chips may have more cores than marketed. It may be possible for the end user to enable these cores.

In mathematics, an ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces Xn a limiting metric space. The notion of an ultralimit captures the limiting behavior of finite configurations in the spaces Xn and uses an ultrafilter to avoid the process of repeatedly passing to subsequences to ensure convergence. An ultralimit is a generalization of the notion of Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff convergence of metric spaces. Ultrafilters Recall that an ultrafilter œâ on the set of natural numbers is a set of nonempty subsets of (whose inclusion function can thought of as a measure) which is closed under finite intersection, upwards-closed, and which, given any subset X of , contains either X or . An ultrafilter œâ on is non-principal if it contains no finite set. Limit of a sequence of points with respect to an ultrafilter Let œâ be a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\mathbb N . If (x_n)_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbb N} is a sequence of points in a metric space (X,d) and x‚àà X, the point x is called the œâ -limit of xn, denoted x=\\\\lim_\\\\omega x_n, if for every \\\\epsilon>0 we have: :\\\\\\\\{n: d(x_n,x)\\\\le \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\}\\\\in\\\\omega. It is not hard to see the following: * If an œâ -limit of a sequence of points exists, it is unique. * If x=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} x_n in the standard sense, x=\\\\lim_\\\\omega x_n . (For this property to hold it is crucial that the ultrafilter be non- principal.) An important basic fact states that, if (X,d) is compact and œâ is a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\mathbb N , the œâ-limit of any sequence of points in X exists (and is necessarily unique). In particular, any bounded sequence of real numbers has a well-defined œâ-limit in \\\\mathbb R (as closed intervals are compact). Ultralimit of metric spaces with specified base- points Let œâ be a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\mathbb N . Let (Xn,dn) be a sequence of metric spaces with specified base-points pn‚ààXn. Let us say that a sequence (x_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N}, where xn‚ààXn, is admissible, if the sequence of real numbers (dn(xn,pn))n is bounded, that is, if there exists a positive real number C such that d_n(x_n,p_n)\\\\le C. Let us denote the set of all admissible sequences by \\\\mathcal A. It is easy to see from the triangle inequality that for any two admissible sequences \\\\mathbf x=(x_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N} and \\\\mathbf y=(y_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N} the sequence (dn(xn,yn))n is bounded and hence there exists an œâ-limit \\\\hat d_\\\\infty(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y):=\\\\lim_\\\\omega d_n(x_n,y_n). Let us define a relation \\\\sim on the set \\\\mathcal A of all admissible sequences as follows. For \\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y\\\\in \\\\mathcal A we have \\\\mathbf x\\\\sim\\\\mathbf y whenever \\\\hat d_\\\\infty(\\\\mathbf x, \\\\mathbf y)=0. It is easy to show that \\\\sim is an equivalence relation on \\\\mathcal A. The ultralimit with respect to œâ of the sequence (Xn,dn, pn) is a metric space (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty) defined as follows.John Roe. Lectures on Coarse Geometry. American Mathematical Society, 2003. ; Definition 7.19, p. 107. As a set, we have X_\\\\infty=\\\\mathcal A/{\\\\sim} . For two \\\\sim-equivalence classes [\\\\mathbf x], [\\\\mathbf y] of admissible sequences \\\\mathbf x=(x_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N} and \\\\mathbf y=(y_n)_{n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N} we have d_\\\\infty([\\\\mathbf x], [\\\\mathbf y]):=\\\\hat d_\\\\infty(\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega d_n(x_n,y_n). It is not hard to see that d_\\\\infty is well-defined and that it is a metric on the set X_\\\\infty. Denote (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n) . On basepoints in the case of uniformly bounded spaces Suppose that (Xn,dn) is a sequence of metric spaces of uniformly bounded diameter, that is, there exists a real number C>0 such that diam(Xn)‚â§C for every n\\\\in \\\\mathbb N. Then for any choice pn of base-points in Xn every sequence (x_n)_n, x_n\\\\in X_n is admissible. Therefore, in this situation the choice of base-points does not have to be specified when defining an ultralimit, and the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty) depends only on (Xn,dn) and on œâ but does not depend on the choice of a base-point sequence p_n\\\\in X_n.. In this case one writes (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n). Basic properties of ultralimits #If (Xn,dn) are geodesic metric spaces then (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n, d_n, p_n) is also a geodesic metric space. #If (Xn,dn) are complete metric spaces then (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n) is also a complete metric space.L.Van den Dries, A.J.Wilkie, On Gromov's theorem concerning groups of polynomial growth and elementary logic. Journal of Algebra, Vol. 89(1984), pp. 349-374.John Roe. Lectures on Coarse Geometry. American Mathematical Society, 2003. ; Proposition 7.20, p. 108. Actually, by construction, the limit space is always complete, even when (Xn,dn) is a repeating sequence of a space (X,d) which is not complete.Bridson, Haefliger \\"Metric Spaces of Non-positive curvature\\" Lemma 5.53 #If (Xn,dn) are compact metric spaces that converge to a compact metric space (X,d) in the Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff sense (this automatically implies that the spaces (Xn,dn) have uniformly bounded diameter), then the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n) is isometric to (X,d). #Suppose that (Xn,dn) are proper metric spaces and that p_n\\\\in X_n are base-points such that the pointed sequence (Xn,dn,pn) converges to a proper metric space (X,d) in the Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff sense. Then the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n,p_n) is isometric to (X,d). #Let Œ∫‚â§0 and let (Xn,dn) be a sequence of CAT(Œ∫)-metric spaces. Then the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n) is also a CAT(Œ∫)-space.M. Kapovich B. Leeb. On asymptotic cones and quasi-isometry classes of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, Geometric and Functional Analysis, Vol. 5 (1995), no. 3, pp. 582-603 #Let (Xn,dn) be a sequence of CAT(Œ∫n)-metric spaces where \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\kappa_n=-\\\\infty. Then the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n) is real tree. Asymptotic cones An important class of ultralimits are the so-called asymptotic cones of metric spaces. Let (X,d) be a metric space, let œâ be a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\mathbb N and let pn ‚àà X be a sequence of base-points. Then the œâ-ultralimit of the sequence (X, \\\\frac{d}{n}, p_n) is called the asymptotic cone of X with respect to œâ and (p_n)_n\\\\, and is denoted Cone_\\\\omega(X,d, (p_n)_n)\\\\,. One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, pn = p for some p ‚àà X; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of p ‚àà X and is denoted by Cone_\\\\omega(X,d)\\\\, or just Cone_\\\\omega(X)\\\\,. The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in geometric group theory since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their topological types and bi-Lipschitz types) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular.John Roe. Lectures on Coarse Geometry. American Mathematical Society, 2003. Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of relatively hyperbolic groups and their generalizations.Cornelia Dru≈£u and Mark Sapir (with an Appendix by Denis Osin and Mark Sapir), Tree-graded spaces and asymptotic cones of groups. Topology, Volume 44 (2005), no. 5, pp. 959-1058. Examples #Let (X,d) be a compact metric space and put (Xn,dn)=(X,d) for every n\\\\in \\\\mathbb N. Then the ultralimit (X_\\\\infty, d_\\\\infty)=\\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n) is isometric to (X,d). #Let (X,dX) and (Y,dY) be two distinct compact metric spaces and let (Xn,dn) be a sequence of metric spaces such that for each n either (Xn,dn)=(X,dX) or (Xn,dn)=(Y,dY). Let A_1=\\\\\\\\{n  (X_n,d_n)=(X,d_X)\\\\\\\\}\\\\, and A_2=\\\\\\\\{n  (X_n,d_n)=(Y,d_Y)\\\\\\\\}\\\\,. Thus A1, A2 are disjoint and A_1\\\\cup A_2=\\\\mathbb N. Therefore, one of A1, A2 has œâ-measure 1 and the other has œâ-measure 0. Hence \\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n) is isometric to (X,dX) if œâ(A1)=1 and \\\\lim_\\\\omega(X_n,d_n) is isometric to (Y,dY) if œâ(A2)=1. This shows that the ultralimit can depend on the choice of an ultrafilter œâ. #Let (M,g) be a compact connected Riemannian manifold of dimension m, where g is a Riemannian metric on M. Let d be the metric on M corresponding to g, so that (M,d) is a geodesic metric space. Choose a basepoint p‚ààM. Then the ultralimit (and even the ordinary Gromov-Hausdorff limit) \\\\lim_\\\\omega(M,n d, p) is isometric to the tangent space TpM of M at p with the distance function on TpM given by the inner product g(p). Therefore, the ultralimit \\\\lim_\\\\omega(M,n d, p) is isometric to the Euclidean space \\\\mathbb R^m with the standard Euclidean metric.Yu. Burago, M. Gromov, and G. Perel'man. A. D.

Biography Born in New York City to a teacher and worker, Jonathan spent much of his childhood exploring. He took an early interest to film. His family traveled with him, which inspired him to learn about other cultures and teach himself several foreign languages. Through a chance encounter with a National Geographic film crew, Stack decided to pursue what has been a lifelong interest in film, specializing in documentaries. Career During his career, Stack has written, produced and directed over 25 films and 50 television programs. Among the best-known are The Farm: Angola, USA (1998), exploring Louisiana State Prison (LSP) through the lives of six inmates, which he co-directed and co- produced with Elizabeth Garbus., Louisiana Department of Corrections They also collaborated with Wilbert Rideau, a life prisoner who was editor of The Angolite, a prisoner-run magazine, and whose book Life Sentences (1992) recounted the stories of several inmates. This film was honored with the Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize and an Emmy Award, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He had earlier worked with Garbus as director and producer of Final Judgment: The Execution of Antonio James(1996), also filmed at LSP. Moved by the life of Vincent Simmons, Stack returned to film Shadows of Doubt: Vincent Simmons (2009) about his case. Simmons struggled for years to gain the evidence file in his case, which he finally could read in 1993. He continues to say that he is innocent and was poorly represented; he notes many inconsistencies in evidence, much of which the prosecution suppressed. Stack filmed interviews with family and other residents of Avoyelles Parish, and a meeting of Simmons with the twins who had accused him of rape. Stack also returned to LSP to film The Farm: 10 Down (2009), a follow-up 10 years later with the survivors (including Simmons) among the six men featured in the 1998 The Farm. He continues to be deeply interested in issues associated with incarceration and the criminal justice system in the United States, and has made several films related to this. While working as an independent filmmaker, Stack has earned a reputation for his ability to gain access into forbidden and even dangerous worlds. His exclusives include President Charles Taylor's farewell speech to the nation of Liberia (Liberia: An Uncivil War co-directed by James Martin Brabazon), and a rare interview with David Miscavige, head of the Church of Scientology (Inside the Church of Scientology). In 2008, Stack was the executive producer of Iron Ladies of Liberia, directed by Elizabeth Garbus. The film tells about Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the contemporary president of Liberia and Africa's first female president. Over the course of his career, Stack has collaborated with artists and filmmakers from around the world. His films have been distributed through HBO, BBC, Channel Four, the Discovery Channel, A&E;, Netflix, and many other sources. In 1991, Stack founded Gabriel Films, an independent documentary film production company. In 2008, he formed Highest Common Denominator Media Group. Stack and HCD Media Group's newest venture is Gabriel City, an online community for those affected by incarceration in the United States.

If activated to federal service with the U.S. Air Force, the group is gained by Air Mobility Command (AMC). Its World War II predecessor, the 348th Fighter Group, was the most successful Republic P-47 Thunderbolt group in the Southwest Pacific Theater. Its commander, Neel E. Kearby was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in combat. Over a dozen of the group's pilots became aces. Overview The 108th Group mission is air refueling. The wing enhances the Air Force's capability to accomplish its primary missions of Global Reach and Global Power. It also provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft as well as aircraft of allied nations. The wing is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. In addition to their primary air refueling mission, the Wing also supports an Intelligence Squadron and a Contingency Response Group Units  The 108th Operations Group consists of the following units: * 108th Operations Support Squadron * 141st Air Refueling Squadron (KC-135R) \\"New Jersey\\", Orange Fin Flash * 140th Cyber Operations Squadron : The 140th Cyber Operations Squadron is one of the twelve Air National Guard Cyber Protection Teams that defend networks and systems against threats. * 150th Special Operations Squadron (C-32B) * 204th Intelligence Squadron : The 204th Intelligence Squadron is the first Air National Guard squadron that is solely dedicated to providing intelligence instruction and training products to the Air Mobility Command. It is also the first course of its kind in the intelligence community that integrates active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve students. During World War II, the group operated primarily in the Southwest Pacific Theater. It was the most successful Republic P-47 Thunderbolt unit in the Pacific War. The Group's commander, Colonel Neel Kearby ran up 20+ kills, including a 6-kills-in-1-mission, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The Group scored 396 kills, over half of all the kills credited to Fifth Air Force P-47s, and won two United States Distinguished Unit Citations. The Group had 20 P-47 aces, including Bob Rowland, Lawrence O'Neill, Bill Banks, Bill Dunham, Walt Benz, Sam Blair, Robert Sutcliffe, and George Davis, who would later be awarded the Medal of Honor flying F-86s during the Korean War. On 24 May 1946, the group was redesignated as the 108th Fighter Group and allotted to the National Guard. History=World War II= The 348th Fighter Group was activated at Mitchel Army Airfield, New York, on 30 September 1942. It was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt. The 348th was one of the first USAAF groups to be equipped with the P-47. 1943 First Lieutenant Lawrence F.

O'Neill survived the war and reached Ace status with a total of 5 aerial victories. Republic P-47D Thunderbolt AAF Serial No. 42-75332. Republic P-47D Thunderbolt AAF Serial No. 42-8053. After an extended period of training in the northeast United States, the personnel boarded the Army transport ship Henry Gibbons and left the wharf at Weehawken, New Jersey on 15 May 1943. They groups personnel all thought they were heading for the European theatre of war. However, they went through the Panama Canal instead and crossed the Pacific Ocean reaching Brisbane, Australia on 14 June 1943. They moved to Archer Field (Archerfield airfield) and waited for their aircraft to arrive. The group's P-47D Thunderbolts began to arrive in Brisbane in the same month, and by the end of July after they had \\"run in\\" their engines on local training flights, the group began long-range missions to strike at Japanese targets in New Guinea. In mid-June the 348th's three squadrons (340th, 341st, 342d) made the 1,200-mile flight from Brisbane to Port Moresby, New Guinea. The group operated from New Guinea and Noemfoor until November 1944, flying patrol and reconnaissance missions and escorted bombers to targets in New Guinea and New Britain. The 460th Fighter Squadron, stationed at Noemfoor, New Guinea, was also later attached to the 348th Fighter Group on 23 September 1944 . The arrival of the 348th as the first P-47 group in the Southwest Pacific area coincided with the opening of the Allied offensive in New Guinea. During the summer of 1943 the P-47 missions were chiefly as cover for bombers in the Lae- Salamaua area, and for transports carrying supplies to the new mountain locked airstrip at Tsili, only a few miles from the Japanese held Markham Valley. The group met its first air combat over Tsili on 16 August 1943, when two squadrons tangled with the fighter cover of an enemy bomber formation, and shot down three aircraft. In September the 348th's planes provided cover for the paratroop landing at Nadzab in the Markham valley, and with the capture of Nadzab and Lae the group entered into one of the most spectacular phases of its overseas career, in a series of fighter sweeps, generally by flights of four planes, over the Japanese stronghold of Wewak. Lieutenant Colonel Neel Kearby, the Commanding Officer of the 348th Fighter Group shot down his first Japanese aircraft on 4 September 1943. He shot down a second aircraft on 15 September 1943. Colonel Kearby was awarded the Medal of Honor for action over New Guinea on 11 October 1943. After leading a flight of four fighters to reconnoiter the enemy base at Wewak, Lt Col Kearby sighted a Japanese bomber formation escorted by more than 30 fighters. Despite the heavy odds and a low fuel supply, and although his mission had been accomplished, Kearby ordered an attack, personally destroying six of the enemy planes. For covering Allied landings and supporting ground forces on New Britain, 16‚Äì31 December 1943, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. 1944 In 1944 the group began to attack airfields, installations, and shipping in western New Guinea, Ceram, and Halmahera to aid in neutralizing those areas preparatory to the US invasion of the Philippines. The group's pilots shot down 100 Japanese planes without the loss of a single pilot in aerial combat. From Finschhafen the group flew its first fighter-bomber missions. In the early spring of 1944, while the group was at Saidor, fighter-bomber work began in earnest with attacks on the Japanese concentrations in the Hansa Bay region just ahead of the advancing Australian troops After 18 months in New Guinea the 348th boarded ship and plane for the Philippines. One squadron, the 460th, arrived several weeks before the other three, and proceeded to roll up an imposing score of enemy planes, shipping, and personnel destroyed, providing cover for convoys, flying patrols, escorted bombers, attacked enemy airfields, and supporting ground forces. During a three-week period it sank 50,000 tons of enemy shipping, which was slightly more than one-tenth of all the shipping sunk by the entire Fifth Air Force during the year 1944. On 10 November the 460th squadron deployed forward to Tacloban Airfield on Leyte, simultaneously escorting a group of B-25 bombers attacking a convoy loaded with an estimated 10,000 enemy troops en route to reinforce the Japanese army on Leyte. The squadron's planes were the first of the Army Air Force to fly over occupied Manila after the Japanese capture of the Philippines. A flight led by Colonel Dunham, made the first return flight on 17 November 1944. The group's greatest day, in point of total of enemy planes destroyed, was 14 December 1944 when, in protection of the invasion fleet heading to Mindoro, 5 Japanese planes were shot down, an estimated 75 were destroyed and 20 more damaged, on the airfields of Negros Island only a few minutes flight from the Allied invasion force, which landed on Mindoro the following morning. In aerial combat at the 348th's best day came on 24 December 1944 when its planes escorting B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in one of the first bomber strikes on Clark Field, met an attempted interception by an estimated 100 Japanese fighters. 32 of the enemy aircraft were definitely destroyed, 7 probably destroyed, the remainder were driven off, and the bombers proceeded undamaged to carry out their mission. Early in December 1944, while the group's planes were operating from Taoloban strip, the majority of group personnel were camped inland near Burauen when the Japanese landed several hundred paratroops on an uncompleted airstrip less than a quarter of a mile from the group's camp, cutting the only road leading from the camp. For several days the camp was isolated between the paratroops on the East and the Japanese patrols on the West. Two men on guard post were surprised and killed by an enemy patrol, but the camp defense's prevented any breakthrough and the paratroops were finally wiped out by infantry and tanks. When U.S. troops landed on Luzon the 348th, now in process of conversion from P-47's to North American P-51 Mustangs, began operation from San Marcelino airstrip a few days after the landing at San Marcelino and Subic Bay. From this location the unit entered upon what many of its members consider its most outstanding work of the war, bombing and strafing in close support of ground troops. This work lacks the excitement and glamor of serial combat, or even of bombing and strafing of seen targets. Bombs and bullets are poured into areas where the enemy is reported to be, and day after day the mission reports stated \\"Results unobserved due to foliage\\". Only rarely were advancing ground troops able to tell what part of the damage found was done by a particular air strike. 1945 At the time the 348th began ground support operations from San Marcelino, the infantry had taken Subic Bay and Olongapo and had started east with the objective of sealing off Bataan so that the Japanese, retreating southward from Lingayen, could not use the Bataan Peninsula's defensive strength as did the U.S. forces in 1942. However, a few miles East of Olongapo stubborn Japanese resistance suddenly had been met in Zigzag Pass, where the road climbed in a series of hairpin turns overlooked by the enemy's positions. Our ground forces had suffered some casualties, had dug in, and in four days had been unable to make any appreciable gain. North American P-51D-10-NA AAF Serial No. 44-14175 \\"Dirty Old Man\\" of the 342d Fighter Squadron, 1945 Second Lieutenant Stanley E. Michalowski, 342nd Fighter Squadron, standing by his P-51D Mustang, Ie Shima, Japan, August 1945. On Leyte the 348th had done experimental bombing with a new and highly effective firebomb weapon, and it was proposed that it be used to break the deadlock in Zigzag Pass. However the infantry division occupying the west end of the pass was uncertain about the use of the bomb in close support of their troops, for fear of inaccurate bombing. So a Japanese supply area, well back of their front line, was bombed as a demonstration of accuracy, and was left neatly blanked with flame. There was no further lack of confidence. American infantry proceeded to direct our pilots to bomb and strafe just ahead of their front line, and for seven days advanced steadily until their mission of scaling off the Bataan Peninsula had been accomplished. Occasionally the curtain of \\"unobserved results\\" would lift. One strike, directed by Filipino guerrillas who set off smoke pots to mark tan enemy bivouac area, was later found to have caused 700 Japanese casualties. After another strike west of Fort Stotsenburg, ground troops were able to move in quickly and found 574 Japanese, all killed by the single air attack. Neigher of those missions involved more than 32 sorties and 30 missions a day. It would be impossible to estimate how many other thousands of enemy dead were covered with the phrase \\"results unobserved\\". During the month of April 1945 the 348th net a record for tonnage of bombs dropped on the enemy, with a total of 2091.5 tons. Total ammunition expended was just under two million rounds. So far as is known, this bomb tonnage is the greatest every dropped in one month by any group, either fighter or bomber, and the accuracy of the bombing attested repeatedly by reports from ground observers. Most of the record tonnage was dropped in the Ipo Dam area northeast of Manila, and helped pave the way for the infantry's capture of that vital control-point of Manila's water supply. From San Marcelino the 348th also flew missions over French Indochina, Hainan, China, and Formosa. In May 1945 the group moved to Floridablanca airfield, west of Fort Stotsenburg, and from there continued attacks on Japanese ground troops, chiefly in the Cagayan Valley in northern Luzon. By the middle of June the enemy forces had disintegrated and scattered so that profitable targets were hard to find, So operations of the 348th were redirected to the Ryukyus, and the group began operations from Ie Shima in mid-July. Contrary to expectations the Japanese air forces did not choose to fight, and in the following month only 15 enemy planes were shot down without loss to the 348th in air combat. However, there was an abundance of ground and shipping targets in Ky≈´sh≈´ and North China, and the group's P-51s took a constant toll of enemy transportation on water and land before the afternoon of 14 August when the planes of the 348th delivered the last bombs dropped on Japan before the order was given to \\"cease firing\\". In the immediate postwar era, the group moved to Itami Airfield, Japan in October 1945 as part of Far East Air Forces, performing occupation duty. The 348th Fighter Group was inactivated at Itami Airfield on 10 May 1946. =Summary of Victories= Colonel Kearby went on to score 22 aerial victories. Other aerial aces of the group were Lt. Colonel W.D. Dunham ‚Äì 16, Lieutenant Colonel William M. Banks ‚Äì 9, Colonel R.R. Rowland ‚Äì 8, Major W.G. Benz ‚Äì 8, Lieutenant Colonel E.F. Roddy ‚Äì 8, Major S.V. Blair ‚Äì 7, Captain G.A.

O'Neill - 5. =Air National Guard= The 348th Fighter Group was redesignated as the 108th Fighter Group and allotted to the New Jersey National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Newark Municipal Airport and extended federal recognition later that year. Two of its World War squadrons, the 341st (now the 141st Fighter Squadron) and 342d (now the 142d Fighter Squadron) were assigned to it, along with the 119th Fighter Squadron, which had been an observation squadron in the National Guard before the war.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 423Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 424-425Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 590 The 119th was located with group headquarters at Newark Municipal Airport, while the 141st was at Mercer Airport, near the state capital of Trenton, New Jersey. The 142d was an element of the Delaware National Guard at New Castle, Delaware. Initially, the group reported to the 52d Fighter Wing of the New York National Guard and was supported by the 208th Air Service Group. In the fall of 1950, the Air National Guard reorganized its combat units under the wing base organization that had been used by the regular Air Force since 1947. In this reorganization, the 108th Fighter Wing was formed as the headquarters for the 108th Group and its support elements, organized into the 108th Air Base Group, 108th Maintenance and Supply Group and the 108th Medical Group. =Mobilization for the Korean War= In March 1951, the group was called to active duty and moved to Turner Air Force Base, Georgia, where it became part of Strategic Air Command. Only the 141st Fighter Squadron remained with the group on mobilization.The 142d Squadron was also mobilized, but was transferred to Air Defense Command, becoming an interceptor unit. To fill out the unit, the 149th Fighter Squadron of the Virginia Air National Guard and the 153d Fighter Squadron of the Mississippi Air National Guard were assigned to the group. In May, the group and its squadrons became fighter bomber units. =Air defense= With return to state control, the group assumed the air defense mission. Despite its retention of the fighter bomber designation, it was gained by Air Defense Command (ADC) upon mobilization. ADC required the squadrons it gained to be designed to augment active duty squadrons capable of performing air defense missions for an indefinite period after mobilization independently of their parent wing.See Cantwell, p. 148 for the same mission performed by reserve units. It was not until 1955 that the group was redesignated the 108th Fighter-Interceptor Group, when it received its first North American F-86E Sabres. Once again, the group commanded the 119th and 141st Squadrons, but not the 142d, which became part of another group. In October 1958, its parent received a new mission as the 108th Tactical Fighter Wing and the group was briefly inactivated. =Tactical fighter= The 108th Wing had been mobilized during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. This mobilization demonstrated that although mobilizing a wing with dispersed flying units was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing individual flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 To resolve this, the Air Force determined to reorganize its National Guard wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its squadrons to facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.See Cantwell, p. 156 (similar problem with reserve units) Shortly after the 108th Wing returned to state control in July, the group was again activated as this plan was implemented. The group remained active until December 1974, when the Air Force inactivated groups located on the same station as the wing to which they were assigned. =Objective wing= In 1973 the group was activated again as the 108th Operations Group as the Air Force implemented the Objective Wing organization in the Air National Guard. It once again became the flying organization of the 108th Wing, equipped with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers.

Newsome, 420 U.S. 283 (1975), is a U.S. Supreme Court case which held that when state law permits a defendant to plead guilty without giving up his right to judicial review of specified constitutional issues, such as the lawfulness of a search or the voluntariness of a confession, the defendant is not prevented from pursuing those constitutional claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.. Legal background Most states require that a defendant must plead not guilty and go to trial to maintain the right to have state appellate review of constitutional challenges he might make to arrest, admissibility of evidence, or the voluntariness of a confession. New York is unique in allowing a defendant to plead guilty while still maintaining these rights. Facts of the case Leon Newsome was arrested on the charge of loitering in the lobby of a New York City Housing Authority apartment building. Upon search, a small quantity of heroin and narcotics paraphernalia was found on his person. Thus he was charged with possession of a dangerous drug and drug paraphernalia, in addition to loitering. Newsome pleaded not guilty on all charges, claimed the loitering law was unconstitutional, and made a motion to suppress the evidence leading to the drug charges. Upon a non-jury trial by New York City Criminal Court, Newsome was convicted of loitering. In a hearing, the same court rejected the motion to suppress evidence related to the drug charges. One month later, Newsome withdrew his not guilty pleas, pleading guilty to a lesser charge of attempted possession of dangerous drugs. At the sentencing proceeding, Newsome announced that he would appeal both the loitering conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence related to the drug charges. Appeals The loitering charge was reversed upon appeal for lack of evidence by Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, but the drug convictions were upheld on the grounds that there was probable cause for the original arrest and search. Newsome petitioned for review of the drug conviction to the New York Court of Appeals, but this was denied. The Court also denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. Newsome subsequently filed a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The petition repeated the claim that because the loitering statute was unconstitutional, Newsome's arrest was therefore invalid, and that as a result, the evidence seized relating to that arrest should be suppressed. Meanwhile, the New York Court of Appeals declared New York's loitering statute unconstitutional before the District Court could render a decision on the merits of Newsome's petition; considering this, the District Court granted Newsome's application for a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court decided that because Newsome was searched on suspicion for probable cause during an arrest for the violation of a statute subsequently found to be unconstitutional, Newsome's search was unconstitutional and the evidence should be suppressed. The District Court granted the writ of habeas corpus. The Attorney General of New York sought review of both decisions: the decision that Newsome had not waived his right to file a federal habeas corpus petition by pleading guilty and also the decision that New York's loitering statute was unconstitutional. Since there was a conflict between Newsome's case and a previous decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the US Supreme Court granted certiorari restricted to the question of Newsome's right to file a federal habeas corpus petition challenging the issues in his case; that is, was the search lawful and was the confession voluntary, when a state provides for appellate review of those issues after a guilty plea? Decision The Supreme Court held the following: > ... when state law permits a defendant to plead guilty without forfeiting > his right to judicial review of specified constitutional issues, the > defendant is not foreclosed from pursuing those constitutional claims in a > federal habeas corpus proceeding. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for > the Second Circuit is affirmed.

Nations were a characteristic of some of the ancient universities and have gradually decreased in significance in recent times. As the newest of the ancient universities, nations never existed at the University of Edinburgh, and were abolished at St Andrews following discussions at the Royal Commission on the Universities of Scotland, which later led to the Universities (Scotland) Acts. Student nations continued into modern times at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Glasgow for the specific purpose of electing a Rector of the university. St Andrews The University of St Andrews, in common with continental universities at the time of its founding, was divided into nations each presided over by a Procurator. The four nations were originally Albany, Angus, Lothian and Britain covering approximately North West, North East, South East and South West Scotland. Later, the original Albany was renamed Fife, while Britain became Albany and included the Western Isles and all places outside Scotland. The four nations each chose an ‚Äúintrant‚Äù, who in turn chose the Lord Rector. At that time the duties of Rector were similar to those of the Principal of the university today. In case of a tie, the decision was left to the outgoing Lord Rector.R.G.Cant, The University of St Andrews (Scottish Academic Press, 1970), p.7-8 The use of the nations system for rectorial elections was discontinued after the national establishment of elected Rectors under the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858. Glasgow At the University of Glasgow the use of nations continued until 1977 for the election of the university's Lord Rector. The University has four nations, originally called Clydesdale, Teviotdale, Albany and Rothesay, and later as Clydesdale (Glottiana), Lothian, Transforthana (land over the Forth, essentially Albany) and Rothesay. Respectively, their heraldic symbols are: a two headed bird over crossed tools, an anchor over crossed tools, a horn over crossed tools and a sailing ship over crossed tools. Three of the 'nations' consisted of defined areas in Scotland, with Loudoniana consisting of students from all other places. The heraldic symbols of the nations can be seen in the stonework of a number of university buildings, including the Glasgow University Union and the chapel, under the Latin title of the university. Aberdeen King's College Chapel. The University of Aberdeen also had a system of nations. Following the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858, the use of nations to elect the Lord Rector continued via the election of Procurators, similar to the system used at the University of Glasgow, with the Chancellor having deciding vote in case of a tie. The four nations of the University were Angus, Mar (\\"Marriensis\\"), Buchan (\\"Buchanensis\\") and Moray (\\"Moraviensis\\"). Prior to the 1858 Act, Glasgow and Marischal College, one of Aberdeen's predecessor universities, were alone in making provision via the nations for election of a Rector.R.D.

It is in Cumbria and is located on a minor road off the A595 road south of Whitehaven. In 2018 it had an estimated population of 759. Moor Row is a residential community situated between Whitehaven and Egremont on Cumbria's coastal plain. The history of Moor Row goes back to at least 1762, but it was the 19th century discovery of iron ore in the vicinity that built the 'row of houses on a moor'. Cornish tin miners moved here to work the mines, and their presence is noted in a number of street names such as Penzance Street. One street, Dalzell, is named after Thomas Henry Dalzell, a mine owner. Houses The village name probably refers to the Scalegill street houses, which are noted on an 1860 Ordnance Survey map. The 1859 homes on Dalzell Street are thought to be the oldest of the terraced rows. The village has grown in the 20th century, adding modern suburban homes to the mixture and is continuing to do so in the 21st century. Mines Moor Row's Montreal Mines produced 250,000 tons a year, the largest of any mine in the Whitehaven or Furness district. The mine property covered , half of which was ore bearing. Both open pit and shaft mining took place. Between 1000 and 1200 people were employed locally in the industry. Railway Moor Row formerly had a station on the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Junction Railway. A railway shunting yard was built in the village, bringing further jobs and prosperity to the inhabitants. It became western Cumbria's most important junction and goods yard until the end of World War II when trucks and the motorways brought about the decline of the railways in the UK. The railway closed in 1980 with the closing of the last mine at Beckermet. The railway is still in situ and runs to Mirehouse Junction. It is also now part of both the national coast to coast walk and cycleway. Employment Westlakes Science and Technology Park is a local employer today.

The Type 4 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 4th year of Emperor Taish≈ç's reign (1915).War Department Special Series No 25 Japanese Field Artillery October 1944 History and development The Type 4 15 cm Howitzer was designed by the Army‚Äôs Osaka Armory to rectify the shortcomings of the Type 38 15 cm howitzer ‚Äì namely its lack of portability. The Type 96 15 cm Howitzer was intended to replace it, but it remained in use throughout World War II. Weapons captured by the Chinese remained in use at least through the Chinese Civil War. The Type 4 (1915) 150-mm Howitzer was designed during World War I to replace the Type 38 15 cm Howitzer. It was manufactured in considerable quantities and remained the standard Japanese medium artillery piece until 1936. The Type 4 is the first Japanese weapon to replace the hydrospring recoil system with the hydropneumatic. Its modified box trail allows it to fire at extreme elevations, increasing its usefulness in jungle or rugged terrain. Design A Type 4 15-cm-howitzer, China 1937 The Type 4 was notable as the first Japanese artillery piece to use a hydro-pneumatic recoil system. It had a vertical sliding breech block and a box type trail. It could be moved short distances as one load, but needed to be broken down into two loads for longer distances. The gun barrel was removed from the cradle and placed on the rear portion of the trail, to which were attached an extra pair of wheels. A limber was attached to each section, so that each load could be towed by six horses. The type 4 used semifixed ammunition with high-explosive, as well as armor- piercing, shrapnel, chemical, smoke and incendiary tracer projectiles.US Department of War. TM 30-480, Handbook on Japanese Military Forces Its most remarkable characteristic of the Type 4 is its extreme lightness in relation to the weight of the ammunition it fires. The howitzer is broken down into two loads-the tube and the cradle assembly-for travel. This operation increases the time necessary to emplace it, but in areas where bridges are flimsy or nonexistent, two-load draft considerably increases the mobility of the piece. Although it is possible to tow the Type 4 in one load, it is not safe to do this for considerable distances or over bad roads because of the extreme length of the trail which would be likely to break if subjected to any considerable jolting. Combat record Type 4 15 cm Howitzer was considered somewhat obsolescent for frontline combat service from the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but as insufficient quantities of the Type 96 15 cm howitzer were produced, it remained in service on many fronts during the Pacific War. Taki's Imperial Japanese Army page Against the Chinese, the Type 4 was used with some success due to the fact the Chinese were desperately lacking in heavy artillery in the early part of the war. However, whenever the Japanese did face Chinese heavy artillery typically armed with German 15 cm sFH 18 heavy artillery guns, e.g. in the Battles of Wuhan and Changsha, Type 4 crews found themselves badly outranged and hopelessly outgunned. Weapons captured by the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, or abandoned in China at the time of the surrender of Japan, were placed into service by both the National Revolutionary Army of the Nationalist government and the People's Liberation Army of the Chinese communist forces through the Chinese Civil War.

The members include Gerry Cullen, Phil Callery and Fran McPhail. They have recorded three albums and have toured Ireland, the UK and the US. Though group singing, especially in harmony, is not part of the Irish music tradition, The Voice Squad have a considerable repertoire of Irish traditional songs and have always sung unaccompanied. > 'Many's The Foolish Youth, first issued in 1987, was the first record by > Fran, Gerry and Phil.

Their > style of singing in harmony does not form part of the Irish singing > tradition, but each of the singers had already served his time in our > individual tradition before coming together to sing in harmony.' - Frank > HarteSleevenotes to 'Many's the Foolish Youth They have been compared to English family groups of similar style, such as 'The Watersons' and 'The Copper Family'. 'It is the union of the distinct tenor voices of Fran and Phil plus the bass of Gerry, along with their own particular arrangements of good songs, that has made them one of the most distinctive unaccompanied singing groups of recent times.' Performances The group have performed in Ireland, the UK, Europe and the US. 'In October 2002 they performed, in front of Ireland's President Mary McAleese, at the Gala opening of Dublin's newest concert venue The Helix at Dublin City University. The concert was recorded by RT√â television for later transmission. The track they performed was a special Shaun Davey arrangement of \\"The Parting Glass\\".' In June 2003 the group performed at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Games, in Ireland with Rita Connolly and Ronan Tynan to perform \\"May We Never Have To Say Goodbye\\", composed by Shaun Davey, which was the theme song for the games. > \\"The Voice Squad represent the melding of two related but separate > traditions ‚Äî a British harmony-singing tradition (as exemplified by the > Copper Family and the Watersons) and the unaccompanied solo singing > tradition of Northern Ireland (as exemplified by such legendary artists as > Paddy Tunney and Joe Heaney).

She was later reactivated for duty during the Korean War era. Built in Camden, New Jersey Teaberry (YN-29) was laid down on 25 October 1940 by John H. Mathis & Company, Camden, New Jersey; launched on 24 May 1941; sponsored by Miss Mary C. Howard; and placed in service on 16 March 1942. World War II service Teaberry operated in the 1st Naval District out of Boston, Massachusetts, until February 1943 when she shifted to the 7th Naval District at Miami, Florida. Late in March, she was ordered to Trinidad and operated from there until 8 March 1944 when she steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, to prepare for service in the South Pacific Ocean. In May, Teaberry sailed for New Guinea via Miami, Florida, Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal, Bora Bora, and New Caledonia. Upon arrival at Milne Bay on 22 July, she provided services to units of the U.S. 7th Fleet and operated out of that port, Langemak, and Hollandia, until ordered to the Philippine Islands early in 1945. The net layer served there until 4 June 1946 when she headed for Hawaii. Teaberry arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 July and, on the 14th, proceeded to the U.S. West Coast. The ship was at San Francisco, California, from 24 July to 9 October when she was assigned to the 19th Reserve Fleet at Astoria, Oregon. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 14 December 1946. Recommissioned during the Korean War  Teaberry was recommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 19 April 1952 and assigned to the 12th Naval District with San Francisco designated as her home port. She arrived there on 13 May and served in the 12th Naval District until July 1961, rendering such services to the fleet as: training students in net and boom defense techniques; working with the Research and Development Division of the Naval Net Depot, Tiburon, California; and participating in mine planting and recovery exercises. By August 1953, the ship had been equipped as a \\"diving-type vessel;\\" and she assisted the Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, in submarine rescue, surface and aerial torpedo recovery, and submarine communications.  Final decommissioning  Teaberry was again decommissioned on 7 July 1961 and struck from the Navy List on 1 August 1961. On 12 January 1962, Teaberry was sold to the Pacific Towboat and Salvage Co., for scrap.  Honors and awards  Teaberry earned one battle star (for Leyte operation) during World War II.

Yenikapƒ± is notable for the ongoing excavations on its Byzantine port, first discovered in 2004. Yenikapƒ±‚Äôs archeological investigations have become one of the largest in Europe, due to the size and number of the shipwrecks found since the initial discovery, and the large number of associated artefacts. The commercial harbor, called the Harbour of Theodosius, in use between the 5th and the 10th centuries, was an alternative to Constantinople's traditional berths situated along the inlet of the Golden Horn. The Yenikapƒ± Square is an artificial piece of land created on the Sea of Marmara, enlarging Yenikapƒ±. It is used for large gatherings, particularly pro-Erdoƒüan political rallies, and events such as the Ethnosport Cultural Festival. Transportation The Yenikapƒ± Transfer Center is also the site of an underground mass rapid transit terminal, the construction of which was delayed by the massive excavations necessary for the project. The new Yenikapƒ± terminal provides interchanges between the Hafif Metro (M1) line and the M2 line ‚Äî both of which constitute part of the Istanbul Metro network ‚Äî and the new Marmaray railway link connecting the Anatolian and European sides of the city through a new tunnel under the Bosporus. Yenikapƒ± is also a station on the ƒ∞stanbul-Halkalƒ± suburban railway line. Archaeology During the archaeological excavation at the Yenikapƒ± Marmaray construction site, it has been learned that Istanbul's history dates back further than was previously thought, some 8,500 years. 8,000-year-old skeletons were discovered, and with the continuous excavations, further graves have been unearthed. The graves reveal that Istanbul used to be home to the earliest settlements during the Stone Age. The skeletons were found in four prehistoric graves. Other than skeletons, the digs have revealed 34 sunken ships dating back to the seventh and 11th centuries. The sunken ships have been conserved at the Istanbul University and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology in Bodrum. There were also remnants of some walls found during the excavations. They are now considered to be the first city walls of Constantinople, erected when the city was founded as Byzantion. About 500 pieces taken from the relics unearthed during the Marmaray excavations were exhibited at the Istanbul Archeology Museum. In order to provide an adequate urban and architectural design for the archaeological site, an international design competition was organized in 2012, with the project by Peter Eisenman and Aytac Architects eventually selected as the winning proposal. The project also envisages the realization of an archeo-park and a large archaeological museum. In 2020, archaeologists discovered animals remains and skeletons, including cats, dating back to the Byzantine period.

Theme The series consists of various short stories relating the historical character's life, an invention, an historical event, or a story taking place in the past. A wise and learned man, the uncle Paul, use a pretext to tell a story to his two nephews, most of the time following a foolish remark or deed of the nephews. The purpose of the series was entirely educational and didactic, and served as a kind of illustrated history lessons for the young Spirou readers. Publication history The first strip appeared in the issue 668 of Spirou at the beginning of 1951, named Cap plein Sud. The series was first drawn by Eddy Paape, who at that time was drawing the series Valhardi. In 1952, Octave Joly became the main writer of the series. This series, very popular, made it possible for a lot of newcoming authors to hone their skills and make themselves well-known, among them Paape, Attanasio, Jean Graton, Mitacq (La Patrouille des Castors), Hermann (Jeremiah) and G√©rald Forton (Bob Morane). Several albums grouping the strips were published between in the 1950s. In the 70s, the series appeared less frequently, and finally disappeared in the 80s. L'oncle Paul was parodied many times in Spirou as well as in other magazines. An album of parodies was published. Albums Les Histoires vraies de l'Oncle Paul is a series of comics albums published by Dupuis grouping the Belles Histoires de l'Oncle Paul stories previously published in Spirou. *Tome 1: Barbe-Noire (1953) *Tome 2: Comment naquit la Marseillaise (1953) *Tome 3: Cap plein sud - 7 histoires d'exploration, 1953. ** Tacq and Joly - Sa√Ød, ami fid√®le. ** Paape and Charlier - Cap plein sud. ** Paape and Charlier - Martyrs du p√¥le sud. ** Paape and Charlier - Comment mourut Amundsen. ** Paape and Charlier - M√©decin des noirs. ** Graton and Charlier - Le h√©ros de Budapest. ** Graton and Charlier - Seul contre la barbarie. *Tome 4: Guynemer - 7 histoires sur la conqu√™te de l'air, 1953. ** Graton and Joly - Les conqu√©rants du ciel. ** Graton and Joly - Premier match a√©rien. ** Graton and Joly - Guynemer. ** Paape end Joly - Courrier s√ªr. ** Attanasio and Charlier - Guillaumet. ** Attanasio et Charlier - L'ange de la Cordill√®re. ** Paape and Charlier - Les sacrifi√©s du Canal Albert. *Tome 5: Le Myst√®re du brick fant√¥me - 7 histoires de navigateurs, 1953. ** Paape and Joly - R√©volte sur le n√©grier. ** Tacq and Attanasio - Kon-Tiki. ** Graton and Joly - Le Toumelin. ** Graton and Joly - Le myst√®re de la \\"Marie-C√©leste\\" [sic]. ** Graton and Joly - Le secret du Brick Fant√¥me. ** Graton and Charlier - La Vierge de la Grand-Porte. ** Graton and Joly - Forceur d'ab√Æmes. *Tome 6: Trois Enfants contre les indiens - 7 histoires d'enfants prodiges, 1953. ** Follet and Joly - Mozart. ** Graton and Joly - Trois enfants contre les peaux-rouges. ** Attanasio and Dewinne - Le fils du boulanger. ** Follet and Joly - Sapeur de 10 ans. ** Graton and Joly - Tom, gosse impossible. ** Graton and Joly - Le T√©l√©graphiste-Catastrophe. ** Tacq and Joly - Drame dans un phare. *Tome 7: H√©ros d'√©pop√©e - 7 histoires de h√©ros d'√©pop√©e, 1954. ** Attanasio and Joly - La mort de Roland. ** Attanasio and Joly - Guillaume Tell. ** Paape and Joly - Boduognat contre C√©sar. ** Tacq and Joly - Dollard des Ormeaux. ** Dupuis and Goscinny - De Lattre. ** Graton and Joly - Trafalgar. ** Tacq and Joly - Rien √† signaler, mon g√©n√©ral. *Tome 8: Combattant de la vie- 7 histoires sur les combattants de la vie, 1954. ** Graton and Joly - Echec au feu du ciel. ** Graton and Attanasio - Le Br√©sil est malade. ** Graton and Attanasio - Gutenberg. ** Attanasio and Joly - Un √©tudiant nomm√© Louis. ** Attanasio and Joly - Tue-moi, mais ne brouille pas cela. ** Forton and Joly - Un voyage tragique. ** Forton and Joly - L'homme en blanc. *Tome 9: Robert le Diable - 7 histoires fantastiques, 1954. ** Graton and Joly - Le coup de Jarnac. ** Tacq and Joly - Le chien de Montargis. ** Graton and Joly - L'enfant, l'√©p√©e, le g√©n√©ral. ** Graton and Joly - A la gueule du canon. ** Tacq and Attanasio - Robert le diable. ** Paape and Joly - Rois mages tragiques. ** Paape and Charlier - Paix sur la terre... *Tome 10: Requins d'acier- 7 histoires sur les sous-marins, 1954. ** Tacq and Joly - Fulton invente le premier sous-marin. ** Paape and Charlier - No√´l sous la mer. ** Graton and Joly - Feu... 1... 2... 3!... ** Forton and Joly - Le torpillage du Lusitania. ** Graton and Joly - La fin d'un pirate. ** Forton and Joly - A l'Abordage en 44. ** Forton and Joly - Les hommes-grenouilles. *Tome 11: √âcumeurs des mers - 7 r√©cits de marins, 1955. ** Funcken and Joly - Le pirate magicien. ** Funcken and Joly - Le vaisseau fant√¥me. ** Funcken and Roquet - Le dernier voyage. ** Forton and Attanasio - Laffite, pirate patriote. ** Graton and Joly - L'exploit du \\"Vindictive\\". ** Graton and Joly - La fin d'un corsaire. ** Forton and Joly - Jonas moderne. *Tome 12: Chasseurs de tombeau - 15 histoires sur des hommes remarquables, 1955 ** Hope and Charlier - Gouverneur malgr√© lui. ** Follet and Joly - L√©onard de Vinci. ** Paape and Charlier - Le sculpteur de Florence. ** Graton and Joly - Le vrai Robinson. ** Dupuis and Gramberger - Ren√© La√´nnec. ** Dehon and Joly - Le petit Louis. ** Dehon and Joly - Un gamin intelligent. ** Dehon and Joly - Le roi des railways. ** Paape and Roquet - Fr√©d√©ric Sauvage. ** Dupuis and Dupuis S. - Jack London. ** Hidalgo and Charlier - Le hussard de la mors. ** Hidalgo and Charlier - L'oiseau blanc. ** Forton and Joly - Un kid de Londres. ** Forton and Joly - Carter, chasseur de tombeaux. ** Graton and Joly - John Ford.

It is the flagship offering of the independent games company SmartMonsters and is currently in open beta.SmartMonsters: Games for Smart Grownups TriadCity has been cited in several scholarly forums for its literary merits, including the Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism.Connor, S. (2004) The Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism, p.79. . History Mark Phillips and Gary Smith, the creators of TriadCity, met at Golden Gate University in 1994. Phillips had a background in network technology and experimental fiction.Mark Phillips' publication history. Smith was a veteran of the high-tech industry who had written his own Fortran version of the popular adventure game Zork in 1980, which he later ported to C++ and Visual Basic.Gary Smith biographical note. Both were interested in designing a game where non-violent cooperative gameplay was more important than violence-based methods of character advancement. In 1999, Phillips and Smith incorporated the independent games company SmartMonsters for the purpose of developing such games.SmartMonsters: Company Info TriadCity is their flagship project. Gameplay=Interface= TriadCity runs on an entirely original codebase.SmartMonsters: TriadCity Reviewers Guide Gameplay is conducted through proprietary HTML5 GUIs or standard MUD clients and incorporates elements of both textual virtual worlds and traditional MUDs, such as the importance of role-play, social interaction through chat, and a text-based interface. Natural Language Processing,TriadCity Message of the Day 2014-01-14 allows players to type commands in conversational English, although players familiar with the MUD genre may alternatively prefer a more terse command vocabulary similar to older DikuMUD or CircleMUD. =Character development= Characters can take on a variety of genders including the familiar male, female, and hermaphrodite as well as such unfamiliar alternatives as splat (a noncommittal gender posture) and plural (characters which are a multitude of individuals). Characters are rewarded experience while playing the game for a variety of activities including simple acts of exploration and puzzle-solving. As in most MUDs, characters can eventually learn skills and adopt various roles including the somewhat familiar healer, warrior, and thief as well as the unfamiliar malopath (a kind of psychic vampire). Character advancement can often be furthered through the use of non-violent skills more effectively than it can through the use of violence, though in MUD tradition TriadCity does include combat among the activities available to characters. A prominent incentive for non-violence is the fact that character death is permanent in TriadCity. Characters do not respawn when they die, so combat carries much greater risks than it does in most other MUDs. Cooperative gameplay is privileged over individualism, making TriadCity a sometimes difficult experience for lone wolf players. Contributing to the game world can be the most lucrative source of character advancement. =The game world= The game takes place within its namesake city, a massive urban environment featuring a blend of historic, modern, and fantastic design elements. At the center of the city is a safe haven called Sanctuary Island where characters first enter the world. The geography of the city divides into three large areas called the Thirds which can be reached from Sanctuary Island. The north-west third of the city is a participatory democracy which excels in the arts and sciences. The north-east third of the city is a senatorial republic which excels in private enterprise and athletics. The southern third of the city is governed by the infallible Central Computer which affords its citizens plenty of leisure time to enjoy their unprecedented technological achievements. The game world currently comprises about 18,000 finished rooms, but is expected to reach a size of around 100,000 rooms when complete.SmartMonsters: TriadCity Reviewers Guide This will make TriadCity considerably larger than the average MUDs at its completion. The game world is written by both SmartMonsters and by player contributors. Novel features=Subjectivity= In TriadCity a character's experience of the world is colored by many things including their attributes and alignment. For example, a good character may see a room as dark and foreboding while an evil character may see that same room as plain and unexceptional. The resulting subjectivity of character experience is an enticing novelty of TriadCity which puts a powerful fictional tool in the hands of the game's authors. Authors of TriadCity view subjectivity of this kind as an example of Literary Modernism.Phillips, M. Literary Modernism in TriadCity =Literary orientation= The world of TriadCity is populated by an immense number of individual automata, many of which have been directly inspired by literature and other prominent forms of Western culture. Among the residents of the city are Friar Tuck, Hank Riordan, Arsene Lupin, Edna Pontellier, Tiresias, George of the Jungle, Jack Dawkins and many others; along with historical figures such as Alfred Jarry, Aristophanes, George Boole, Henry Ford, Israel Regardie, Saint Simon the Stylite, Suzanne Valadon, Spartacus, Fran√ßois Prelati, and more. There are locales within the world inspired by the work of Mark Twain and the occultism of Aleister Crowley as well as bots whose personalities are derived from the work of Douglas Adams and Oscar Wilde. The juxtaposition of diverse literary and cultural references together with the subjectivity of character experience has led the creators of TriadCity to describe the game as a piece of interactive postmodern literature.Phillips, M. Can A Game Be Literature? This ambitious claim has been endorsed by the Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism which cites TriadCity as an example of new, emerging literary forms.Connor, S. (2004) The Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism, p.79. . The creators of the game, Mark Phillips and Gary Smith, were featured panelists at the Richard Hugo House Sixth Annual Inquiry, on the topic of games.Richard Hugo House Sixth Annual Inquiry schedule of events. TriadCity was also the featured topic of an article in the Winter 2005 BayNet Newsletter.Winter 2005 BayNet Newsletter. It is cited in this course syllabus for English 597: Literature on the Web, at Western Michigan University; and this course syllabus for DANM132, Games as Literature: The Intersection of Writing and Play, at UC Santa Cruz. =Gender Parity= There are currently about 10,000 registered players of TriadCity. Players are evenly divided between women and men,TriadCity MOTD 2008.10.27 unusual for an online role-playing environment.

It is a modified form of GHRH (1-29) with improved pharmacokinetics, especially in regard to half-life. CJC-1295 markedly increases plasma growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in both animals and humans. With a single injection, in human subjects, CJC-1295 increases plasma GH levels by 2- to 10-fold for 6 days or longer and plasma IGF-1 levels by 0.5- to 3-fold for 9 to 11 days. The drug has an estimated half-life of about 6 to 8 days in humans. With multiple doses of CJC-1295, IGF-1 levels were found to remain elevated in humans for up to 28 days. CJC-1295 has been shown to extend the half-life and bioavailability of growth-hormone-releasing hormone 1-29 and stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 secretion. It increases the half-life of acting agents by bioconjugation. CJC-1295 was under investigation for the treatment of lipodystrophy and growth hormone deficiency and reached phase II clinical trials but was discontinued upon the death of one of the trial subjects. The attending physician of the trial believed that the most likely explanation for the incident was that the patient had asymptomatic coronary artery disease with plaque rupture and occlusion, and that the occurrence was unrelated to treatment with CJC-1295. In any case, research was terminated nonetheless as a precaution.

Summer Nuclear Generating Station.Lake Monticello Reservoir  South Carolina Department of Parks & Tourism It is located in Jenkinsville. While it does not dam any major rivers, its outflow flows directly into Parr Reservoir, an artificial lake created along the Broad River, via the Fairfield Pumped Storage power station. The lake is mainly used to cool the turbines of a nearby nuclear power plant. It is famous locally for its catfishing, as some 60 lb. and up fish have been pulled from its waters. Fluctuations in the level of the reservoir are thought to have increased the incidence of induced seismicity in the area. The referenced study by Talwani [2] actually states that after an initial increase, levels of seismicity at Monticello have returned to pre-reservoir levels. Therefore, induced seismicity is linked with the initial impoundment, and is not an ongoing issue at this location.

History=The Bean Spray Pump Company= Founded in 1884 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, CaliforniaLos Gatos city ordinance honoring the history of the Almond Grove neighborhood by John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer is on display at the Forbes Mill museum there.Forbes Mill museum (see photo of Bean sprayer) Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean. =FMC= In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells, and changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. FMC received a contract to design and build landing vehicles tracked for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC also built the M113 (APC) Armored Personnel Carrier and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle as well as the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. The troubled development of the Bradley was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C corporation. Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names. FMC also produced fire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies, and had an OEM arrangement with LTI (Ladder Towers Inc.) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the Fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC was ultimately unsuccessful in its expansion into production of aerial ladders. The FMC Fire Apparatus division was also ultimately shut down in 1990.Aerial Fire Trucks, By Larry Shapiro, page 61. =Spinoffs= In 1946, FMC bought out Bolens Lawn And Garden Equipment.

He was the first Spanish tennis player of international stature.  Biography  Alonso was born at San Sebasti√°n on 12 November 1895. He won the Spanish tennis championships in 1915, 1919 and 1920. He frequently played doubles with his elder brother Jos√© Mar√≠a (b. 1890) who also was a successful tennis player. In 1920, Alonso took part at the Summer Olympics at Antwerp. In singles, he reached the quarterfinals losing to British Noel Turnbull. In the same year, Alonso reached the semifinals at the World Hard Court Championships. At the 1924 Summer Olympics at Paris, Alonso reached the fourth round in singles. In the early 1920s, Bill Tilden wrote about Alonso: \\"Seldom have I seen such wonderful natural abilities as are found in this young Spaniard [...] Alonzo has a terrific forehand drive that is the closest rival to W.M. Johnston's of any shot I have seen [...] His overhead is at once severe, deadly and reliable. He smashes with speed and direction. It is not only in his varied stroke equipment that Alonzo is great but in his marvellous footwork. Such speed of foot and lightning turning I have never before seen on a tennis court [...] I look to see Alonzo, who today loses matches through lack of resource, become by virtue of experience and tournament play the greatest player on the continent.\\" In 1921, at his first appearance at the Wimbledon Championships, Alonso made his way through to the all-comers final (beating Algernon Kingscote and Zenzo Shimizu before losing to Brian Norton in five sets). He played at Wimbledon in 1922 and 1924 again, but couldn't repeat this success and dropped out of the competition in early rounds. From 1921 to 1925, Alonso was a member of the Spanish Davis Cup team and reached the final in 1922 partnering Manuel de Gomar. Both were called \\"Los Dos Manolos\\" (\\"the two Manuels\\"), a reference to the American \\"two Bills\\", \\"Big Bill\\" Tilden and \\"Little Bill\\" Johnston. Alonso moved to the United States in 1923 which made him eligible for a U.S. ranking. He regularly played at the U.S. Championships until 1927 and reached the quarterfinals in 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1927. He was three years in the U.S. Top 10 (No. 4 in 1925 and 1927, No. 2 in 1926). In 1927, he was ranked World No. 5 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph. In 1931 and 1936, Alonso made two short appearances for his country in the Davis Cup again. Soon thereafter, he retired from tennis. In 1977, Alonso was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. He died on 11 October 1984 at Madrid.

Ace reissued it as a stand- alone volume in 1977 and 1982; a Tor paperback appeared in 1988. An Italian translation was also published in 1961, and a German translation later appeared. Silverberg planned the novel as a serial for Astounding Science Fiction, but John W. Campbell rejected the work and Silverberg eventually sold a shorter version to Amazing Stories, where it appeared in 1959.ISFDB bibliographyMajipoor.com: The Works of Robert Silverberg (Silverberg- authorized bibliography) Collision Course details the response of the political leadership of Earth to an eventual collision of their aggressive expanding colonial empire with a newly discovered alien race. Plot The story is set in approximately the 26th century, after nearly five centuries of expansion into space limited by the speed of light, as ships with intrepid crews travel to new solar systems and install instantaneous transportation terminals known as transmats, which tie in with a system based on Earth. The current ruler, who leads a small group of men chosen and trained as leaders, is dissatisfied with the light barrier and upon becoming the leader‚Äîthe technarch‚Äîhe made a public address calling on science to find a way to exceed that barrier. The first crewed FTL (faster-than-light) ship has reported in from its test flight, and upon landing, report their successful voyage through an alternate universe to distant locations in the galaxy, and of discovering the outer reaches of an alien civilization. The technarch convenes a meeting of the ruling group, receive a report from the star crew, then deliberate the technarch's intention to negotiate a division of the galaxy between them. He selects four men to accompany the five star crew back out, although the crew are exhausted and not enthusiastic about another long trip. The four men selected to go on the trip find they are very different in temperament and outlook, and tempers flare between two of them. They endure the long voyage that is unlike an instant transmat trip, and upon arrival, the crew meet the aliens. The linguist chosen by the technarch proceeds to teach the aliens English, then explain the situation about the expanding empires. The aliens say they cannot speak for their people and walk out, summoning more senior officials. The officials seem agreeable there should be no war, but impose not a division between the two peoples, rather, they tell Earth it can no longer expand, then they walk out. The FTL ship crew agree to return home with the bad news, which they believe will lead to war, but they get lost in the alternate space and return to normal space in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The captain believes they should simply concede and find a place to live, even as the Milky Way tantalizes them in the sky of the planet they are borne to by a mysterious alien. The Magellanic aliens summon the officials from Earth's opponents, and force an equal division of the Milky Way, then return the Milky Way citizens to where they were‚Äîthe FTL ship right back to where it was before its faulty attempt to return home. This time, the flight home proceeds correctly and they arrive to inform the technarch of the Magellanic aliens' enforcement that would prevent the technarch's dreams of human settlement in other galaxies. Reception Rating it three stars out of five, Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale described the novel as \\"entertaining and deft\\", if glibly plotted, noting that it \\"benefits from [Silverberg's] sure control of pace\\".

He numbered it No. 4 in the cycle of 12 he wrote during his time in Weimar, Germany. It was first performed on 16 February 1854, conducted by the composer, as an introduction to the first Weimar performance of Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice.Searle, 291. The performance helped celebrate the birthday of Weimar's Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, who was an amateur musician and a staunch supporter of Liszt at Weimar.Shulstad, 208. Overview Etruscan musician with a barbiton, Tomb of the Triclinium, Tarquinia =Program= Orpheus is one of four symphonic poems Liszt composed as character sketches of men of creative genius, heroism or legend. (The other three poems are Tasso, Prometheus and Mazeppa.)Shulstad, 207. In his preface Liszt describes an Etruscan vase depicting Orpheus, then extols civilizing effect on humanity. This reference to the ennobling effect of Orpheus and his art may have been derived from the Orpheus depicted by the French philosopher Pierre-Simon Ballanche in Orph√©e in 1829. By introducing civilised laws, the Orpheus of this nine-volume work leads humanity into the modern age; this was intended by Ballanche to provide a new philosophy for all of Europe. Liszt was an acquaintance and supporter of Ballanche, and Liszt's enthusiasm was shared by members of the French salons during the 1830s, especially by George Sand.Shulstad, 208. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 2 harps and strings. Especially noteworthy is Orpheus's instrumentation, which includes two harps; their representation of Orpheus's lyre in the opening 14 bars immediately focuses the listener's attention on this instrument. Harpist Jeanne Pohl, one of the new virtuoso players brought to Weimar by Liszt to augment the court orchestra, inspired the composer to pen these effects.Shulstad, 208-9. =Structure= Orpheus is not a long work and takes the form of a gradual crescendo followed by a quiet ending which returns to the mood of the opening.Searle, 291. Unlike many of Liszt's other symphonic poems, the music here remains largely contemplative. For this reason, it became a favorite piece of Liszt's son-in-law, the composer Richard Wagner.Shulstad, 209. Formally, Orpheus is a modified sonata form with a secondary key area containing two themes. The second theme lacks the energy of the first, remaining a static motif hovering over oscillating major and minor harmonies. Nevertheless, it contains an especially poignant quality. This theme is presented by various solo instruments to a primarily harp accompaniment. The orchestration, together with the style, suggests an interpretation of this theme as Orpheus' voice.Shulstad, 209. The ethereal, chromatic ascent in the final bars attenuates any decisive closure that could be expected from a more conventional harmonic resolution. Combined with the closing theme of the second group, this ends the work as a cryptic vision which recalls the final moments of Ballanche's story. There the story's narrator, Thamyris, witnesses Orpheus disappearing into the clouds, leaving mankind the task of developing his teachings of civilisation.Shulstad, 209. Bibliography * ed.

Early life Khankhoje was born in November 1884 to a Marathi Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin (DRB) family at Wardha, where his father worked as a petition-writer. Young Khankhoje spent his childhood in Wardha, where he completed his primary and middle school education before moving to Nagpur for higher education. He was at the time inspired by the nationalist work of Bal Gangadhar Tilak. At some time in the first decade of the 1900s, Khankhoje left India on a voyage that ultimately saw him settle in the United States. Here he enrolled in the Washington State College (now called Washington State University), graduating in 1913. Indian independence activities Khankhoje's earliest nationalist work abroad dates back to the time around 1908 when he, along with Pandit Kanshi Ram founded the Indian Independence League in Portland, Oregon. His works also brought him close to other Indian nationalists in United States at the time, including Tarak Nath Das. In the years preceding World War I, Khankhoje was one of the founding members of the Pacific coast Hindustan association, and subsequently founded the Ghadar Party. He was at the time one of the most influential members of the party. He met Lala Har Dayal in 1911. He also enrolled at one point in a West Coast military academy. =Activities during World War I= Through World War I, Khankhoje was intricately involved in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy when he was involved in the plans for the mutiny. He visited Europe during the war and subsequently went to Mesopotamia along with other members of what was the Berlin Committee. In the summer of 1915, he worked clandestinely among troops of the Indian expeditionary force, spreading nationalist literature and hoping to incite a mutiny. Through the course of the war, Khankhoje made his way through Turkey and Persia under different Muslim guises as far as Baluchistan, spreading Ghadarite propaganda en route. He is known to have attempted insurrections and raised at the Iran-Baluchistan border while Mahendra Pratap's Indo-German expedition attempted to rally the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan against British India. Towards the end of the war, Khankhoje, like most of the members of the Berlin committee, began turning towards communism. He is known to have been in Soviet Union in company of the earliest Indian communist, including Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, M. P. T. Acharya, M. N. Roy, Abdur Rab Barq. He met Lenin at Moscow in 1921. For his nationalist work at the time, Khankhoje was banned from returning to India as a highly dangerous individual. Academic career Khankhoje later moved to Mexico in the 1920s, where he was the professor of Botany and Crop Breeding in the National School of Agriculture of Mexico. In 1936, Khankhoje married Jean Alexandrine Sindic, a Belgian woman in Mexico by whom he had two daughters. He led the Mexican corn breeding programme and was appointed director to the Mexican Government's department of Agriculture. Return to India and later years Both Pandurang and Jean returned to India after 1947. His application for visa was initially rejected by the Indian government due to the ban by the British Indian Government, but was eventually overturned. He settled in Nagpur and subsequently embarked on a political career. Pandurang Khankhoje died on 22 January 1967. References Asian American Studies: A Reader.

When it was first constructed, it was made of fiberboard and came out of a top hat with the slogan \\"Mets Magic\\" (this was replaced a few years later with the words \\"Home Run\\"). However, the Mets won only 67 games during the 1980 season and the Home Run Apple became known as \\"Harazin's folly\\". Often the Apple would get stuck, which necessitated an electrician to be sent to repair it. Over time the Apple became misshapen (due to periodic harsh weather conditions) and was hard to maintain, with a Mets executive stating, \\"It was just totally fabricated out of plaster layered on top of a metal screen with a wood frame inside\\". In 2007, the Mets announced that the Home Run Apple would be retired. In response, Mets fans started a petition website called savetheapple.com in order to preserve the Apple. Due to popular demand, including 89% of surveyed fans stating they wanted it moved over from Shea Stadium, the New York Mets announced that they would construct a new Home Run Apple to be installed in Citi Field. The old Home Run Apple from Shea Stadium was installed outside Citi Field near the home plate entrance. The original Apple outside Citi Field The Home Run Apple at Shea Stadium was operated using a motor and pulley- operated elevator mechanism, while the Home Run Apple at Citi Field is powered by hydraulics and is operated from the control room, which requires a key to be turned and button to be pressed to activate it. Despite the improved engineering on the new Apple, it is still susceptible to failure. In 2009 (Citi Field's first year), when Fernando Tat√≠s hit a home run for the Mets, the Apple did not rise. The fans booed and chanted \\"We Want Apple!\\" for two and a half minutes until it was eventually raised. It happened again in 2017, when Travis d'Arnaud hit a home run, and the apple failed to rise, making the Citi Field chant \\"We Want Apple!\\" again, just like in 2009. The Apple did rise two batters after d'Arnaud hit the home run.https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/09/26/mets-home-run-apple-cheers  Baseball  During Major League Baseball games, the Home Run Apple is raised only for New York Mets home runs. An exception to this happened in 1998 when the Mets' Subway Series rivals, the New York Yankees, were forced to play one of their home games at Shea Stadium because of a building code violation at Yankee Stadium. During the game, former Mets player Darryl Strawberry hit a home run and the Apple was partially raised for him, stopping before the Mets insignia was exposed. In 2015, after Travis d'Arnaud hit a home run that struck the Home Run Apple in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, a bandage was placed on the apple the next day in the place the ball had hit it.

In contrast, vaccination with traditional vaccines containing the complete pathogen, either attenuated or inactivated, precludes the use of serology (e.g. analysis of specific antibodies in body fluids) in epidemiological surveys in vaccinated populations.

History Completed in 1923, the 'Commercial/Renaissance Revival' style building served as Lodge 382 of the Free and Accepted Masons for sixty years. The original structure included retail shops on the ground floor with the lodge and banquet hall on the second floor. In 1983, the Masons were forced to vacate the structure when they were unable to afford the cost of retrofitting the building to meet seismic safety requirements. The building was purchased by private developers, and the second floor was converted into a banquet facility. The original Lodge Room, with its cherry wood paneling, anaglypta wall coverings, and other details has been restored and preserved and remains in use, now as a namesake 500 capacity music venue, Lodge Room. =Architecture and construction= Figueroa Street arcade balcony The building was designed by Elmore Robinson Jeffrey in the Renaissance Revival style with much of the architectural detailing in the Mediterranean Revival style. The 'Commercial/Renaissance Revival' style was popular in Los Angeles during the 1920s. The Highland Park Masonic Temple was built from 1922‚Äì1923 and opened in July 1923. The three-story structure was built for use by the Free and Accepted Masons as the site for Lodge 382. The Masons occupied the second and third floors, and the first floor was retail space, providing an income source for the lodge. Anaglypta along south wall of the Lodge Room The most impressive room in the building is the Lodge Room on the second floor. The Lodge Room has an ceiling and rich cherry wood paneling, original embossed cotton anaglypta, and paintings at both ends of the hall depicting Egyptian scenes, including a sphinx and pyramid. There was originally a second story arched balcony/arcade connecting the Lodge Room with the Banquet Hall. Other significant architectural features include a beautiful frieze featuring Masonic symbols running along the exterior roofline of the building along Figueroa Street and Avenue 56. From the exterior, the most impressive feature is the Figueroa Street facade with its columns and balcony at the eastern edge of the Banquet Hall. Use of the building=Masonic Lodge 382= The Masons used the building as Lodge 382 and several other lodges for 60 years from 1923 to 1983. However, in 1983, the owners were cited for failure to bring the building up to modern seismic safety standards. The local Masonic unit lacked the funds to undertake the expensive seismic work and were forced to vacate and sell the building. =Renovation as a mixed use and banquet facility= Main Entrance along Avenue 56 In 1983, Allen Golden, along with partners Jerry Sullivan and Jerry Manpearl, purchased the building. They undertook extensive renovation of the building between 1985 and 1989, including upgrade work to enable the structure to meet modern seismic safety requirements. As part of the renovation work, the owners replaced awnings that had been part of the original design, and leaded glass that had been covered was exposed. Additionally, during the seismic retrofit, care was taken to preserve numerous period details, including doorknobs embossed with Masonic symbols, the cherry wood paneling and the anaglypta wall covering. View looking up at Figueroa Street eaves from Banquet Hall balcony The renovated building opened in January 1990, with the second floor converted into a community meeting place and banquet hall. The Lodge Room was preserved much as it was in 1923. However, the chandeliers in the Lodge Room were replaced in the 1950s or 1960s with green light fixtures; the new owners installed antique light fixtures in the room as part of their restoration project. The Banquet Hall (in the front of the building along Figueroa) has been converted into a wood-floored multi-purpose room. The two large second floor rooms are now rented to the public for wedding receptions, anniversaries, quincea√±eras, and other functions. The third floor was converted to office space, rented initially to Operation Headstart. In order to make room for offices on the third floor, an interior balcony overlooking the Lodge Room and Banquet Hall had to be removed‚Äîone of the few sacrifices made to preservation. The Lodge Room and Checker Hall As of 2018 the building is used as a live music venue with an attached bar and restaurant. The talent buyer is Raghav Desai.

The game was released in December 2004 on CD- ROM for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh. By 2009, the game was no longer available, but it joined the ranks of games made by PETA, Greenpeace, and others. Gameplay Steer Madness is a single-player video game where the player assumes the role of Bryce the Cow, a walking, talking bovine determined to put an end to animal exploitation and turn everyone vegetarian. Transcript of interview is here. During gameplay, the player goes on a series of missions to save the animals using many different tactics. The game is based in an open city environment and features several transportation methods, with gameplay similar to the game Grand Theft Auto III (without the guns or violence), making it a nonviolent video game. Players have the option to walk, use a bicycle, or drive (in select missions) through the city to get to different areas of the game. Missions involve many gameplay elements, including climbing, jumping, racing, puzzle solving and operating heavy machinery. Development Steer Madness was developed in Vancouver, BC, Canada, by the independent game developer Veggie Games Inc. The majority of the game was made by just one person, founder Johnathan Skinner. This includes all of the programming (which was done from scratch), story, design and a significant portion of the artwork. He worked on the game in his spare time for about a year and a half while working other jobs, then decided to focus all his time into finishing and publishing the game. He registered the company, got a small office and hired an artist to help. After about 6 months of full-time development and the help of a few student interns, the game was complete and ready for release. Skinner, when interviewed by The Globe and Mail, hoped that the game would \\"sway a few people.\\" He later said he ran the game on a shoestring budget, funding Veggie Games \\"with a Visa card.\\" Music for the game was licensed from local independent artists, including Angie Inglis, Anita Athavale, Feisty, Hector and The Winks. Voice acting was done with the help of friends who were convinced to read lines into a microphone while sitting inside a little box which was sound-proofed with swatches of carpet and pillows. Taking the self-publishing route, game CDs were printed in small batches and sold through the website. Various animal rights groups in Canada, the United States, United Kingdom and Germany purchased wholesale quantities in order to resell the game CDs through their online stores as a form of fundraising, while it was also presented at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. Awards Steer Madness received two awards shortly after it was released. The first award was Best Animal-Friendly Video Game from the 2004 PETA Proggy Awards,Morton, Brian. Steer Madness ‚Äì Non-violent video game top pick for PETA award. The Vancouver Sun. 27 January 2005. and the second was Innovation in Audio from the 2005 Independent Games Festival.

Swan Lake was drained and filled with concrete before opening day in 2008; this would become the location of Diamondback's splashdown element. Kings Island started teasing visitors during the Fourth of July weekend in 2008 with signs saying, \\"Ride Sally ride\\" and \\"Steep incline ahead.\\" Diamondback was announced on August 6, 2008 as the largest investment in Kings Island history. The ride was topped off with the lift hill on October 30. The last piece of track was installed on January 26, 2009. Testing began the following month. Diamondback officially opened on April 18, 2009. Diamondback reached a milestone of one million riders in July 2009, and another milestone of ten million riders in July 2014. =First rider auction= On February 3, 2009, Kings Island announced they would hold an auction for the first riders on Diamondback. The winners of the auction would be given a commemorative first rider ticket, a special gift from the park, and an admission ticket. All proceeds from the auction would go to A Kid Again non-profit organization, formerly known as Adventures for Wish Kids. The first rider auction raised $102,000. The first eight trains, or the first 256 seats were auctioned off. The average bid was $398 per seat. Ride experience=Layout= After the train leaves the station, it begins its ascent up the chain lift hill. Once reaching the top of the hill, the coaster drops at 74¬∞ over the Rivertown midway reaching speeds up to . It then curves to the right up a hill, past Mystic Timbers' first drop, and then dives into the ravine, curving again to the left. The ride then ascends a camelback hill and drops, curving left into the hammerhead turn. After dropping out of the hammerhead, the train travels up a hill (which has a trim brake). After the fourth hill, the train turns down into a 287¬∞ counter-clockwise helix, containing the on-ride photo camera, and into the mid-course brake run. After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a pair of bunny hop hills before entering the final clockwise helix of 323¬∞. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down before going up another hill into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes. =Splashdown= A train in the splashdown element. Diamondback is the first hyper coaster to feature a splashdown. Scoops positioned at the back sides of the last car on each train send water soaring at heights of as the train passes. Splashdowns generally do not cause riders to get wet; they are used for a visual effect as well as to slow the train down. The splashdown is located in the former Swan Boat pond. =Trains= Diamondback operates with three open-air stadium style steel and fiberglass trains. The trains are the same prototype trains seen on Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, Intimidator at Carowinds and Shambhala: Expedici√≥n al Himalaya at PortAventura Park. Diamondback was the first roller coaster in the United States to feature the new trains. Each car seats four passengers, with two front seats set near the middle of the car and two rear seats set closer to the sides of the car, forming a \\"V\\" shape. The front car of each train features a yellow/orange snake head with long fangs, while the inside of the trains are black, red, and orange. Riders are restrained by a single T-shaped lap bar. There are three trains total, each train featuring a different fin color: green, red, or brown. Under the sides of the last car on each train are the scoops for the splashdown at the end. =Track= The back half of the ride located in the woods. The steel track is in length and the height of the lift is approximately . The ride has red track and tan supports, although for the first few years, the supports on the lift hill and second hill were painted yellow. The track was fabricated at the Ohio-based Clermont Steel Fabricators. Awards Diamondback won the award for \\"Best New Attraction in 2009\\" from the National Amusement Park Historical Association. Also the roller coaster was ranked second in the Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards for best new ride of 2009.

In an interview in 2000, Koch noted that this novel, and his later work Out of Ireland, formed a diptych called Beware of the Past.An Interview with Christopher Koch Plot summary When legendary Australian war photographer Mike Langford goes missing in Khmer Rouge Cambodia in 1976, childhood friend Ray inherits his taped diaries. Using these, his own memories, and the recollections and records of others, Ray attempts to reconstruct Langford's life, to understand how he became a myth and why he went back into Cambodia. Eventually this will lead Ray to Thailand, to the Cambodian border and the truth about Langford's fate. Though different parts of Highways to a War are told from different perspectives, the overall result is a coherent narrative and a portrait of a life. It begins with Langford's childhood on a Tasmanian farm, his \\"novitiate\\" in Singapore, where he nearly starves before finding work, and his early experiences in Vietnam, in Saigon and in the Mekong Delta with the ARVN, the South Vietnamese army. The story then jumps from Saigon in 1966 to Phnom Penh in 1973. Among other dramatic episodes, Langford is captured by North Vietnamese troops and witnesses the fall of Saigon. The story is tense and gripping, but the centre remains Langford's development: he is a tough man, a survivor, but he is also an idealist and, when he loses his objectivity and becomes involved with the Free Khmer, his fate has a tragic inevitability to it. Its unity comes from its focus on Langford, but Highways to a War has plenty of other memorable characters. His fellow photographers and correspondents are a fascinatingly idiosyncratic bunch. And Langford's romantic idealisation of women makes them a key part of his life: in Australia, the daughter of a poor fruit-picking family and then the wife of his mentor, in Saigon an older French-Vietnamese woman, and in Phnom Penh the Cambodian woman whose fate becomes tied up with Langford's. Highways to a War also offers a vivid perspective on the course of the Second Indochina War. This, however, is implicit: Koch makes no attempt to write a history of that war (and readers without any background knowledge may find parts of the novel confusing), or to take sides in the debates over that history, and it is through personal stories and personal tragedies that he sheds light on the broader tragedies.

The museum is open daily except Monday. Permanent collections are free. An admission fee is charged for temporary exhibitions. The nearest m√©tro stations are Pigalle, Blanche, Saint-Georges, and Li√®ge. The Mus√©e de la Vie romantique is one of the 14 City of Paris Museums that have been incorporated since January 1, 2013 in the public institution Paris Mus√©es.  Property  The main pavilion, built in 1830, was the Paris base of the Dutch-born painter Ary Scheffer (1795‚Äì1858), one of the prominent artists of the time, close to King Louis-Philippe and his family. For decades, Scheffer and his daughter hosted Friday-evening salons, among the most famous in La Nouvelle Ath√®nes. George Sand (1804‚Äì1876) used to come as a neighbour with Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, meeting Eug√®ne Delacroix, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Alphonse de Lamartine, Franz Liszt, Gioacchino Rossini and singer Pauline Viardot. Later in the century, Charles Dickens, Ivan Turgueniev, and Charles Gounod attended regularly.  Museum  The property remained in private hands and passed by descent until 1982 when it became a museum, under the name of \\"Mus√©e Renan-Scheffer\\". It is one of the City of Paris' three literary museums, along with the Maison de Balzac and the Maison de Victor Hugo. After an extensive renovation conducted by Jacques Garcia under the direction of Anne-Marie de Brem, it reopened in 1987 as \\"Mus√©e de la Vie romantique\\". Daniel Marchesseau, conservateur g√©n√©ral du Patrimoine, was appointed director in November 1998. For 13 years, he developed an ambitious program of exhibitions and acquisitions. Attendance has widely grown, from 18.000 visitors a year (1998) to 145.000 in 2010. He retired in winter 2013. His successor, J√©r√¥me Farigoule, was appointed in September 2013.  Collections  The Museum displays on the first floor numerous mementos of the romantic literary figure George Sand, including family portraits, household possessions, pieces of jewelry and memorabilia including plaster casts by Cl√©singer of the writer's sensuous right arm and Chopin's delicate left hand, plus a number of her own unique and rare watercolours called \\"dendrites\\". On the second floor, one can admire a number of Romantic canvases, sculptures and objets d'art. *Paintings by Ary Scheffer include portraits of Pauline Viardot, Queen Marie-Am√©lie, Princesse de Joinville, Princesse Marie d'Orl√©ans, as well as oils of The Giaour (after Lord Byron), Faust and Marguerite (after Goethe), Effie and Jeanie Deans after The Heart of Midlothian by Walter Scott. *Works by his contemporaries include Fran√ßois Bouchot (Maria Malibran), Fran√ßois Debon, Charles Durupt, Louis Hersent, Redout√©, Camille Roqueplan. *Sculptures are by Barre, Bartholdi, Th√©ophile Bra (Mme Mention, bronze), Auguste Cl√©singer (Self-portrait and Portrait of George Sand, marble), Dantan, David d'Angers, Jean-Jacques Feuch√®re (Satan), Fran√ßois-D√©sir√© Froment-Meurice, Th√©odore Gechter (Harold, bronze), Antonin Moine (Sully, bronze), Marie d'Orl√©ans (La Chasse au faucon, I & 2, plaster, ca. 1835), James Pradier (Sappho, bronze), Christian Daniel Rauch (Goethe, bronze, 1820)...

The club also has open age women and 3 girls teams. http://www.yorkshirejuniorsarl.co.uk Their home ground is the Millpond Stadium. They are the town's second side, after Featherstone Rovers who play in the Championship. History Featherstone Lions are the result of a merger between Jubilee Hotel and Traveller's amateur sides in the early 1990s. Featherstone's first season, 1994‚Äì95, was in the CMS Yorkshire league First Division. At the end of the 1995-96 season, they had won promotion to the Yorkshire League Premier Division and finished 2nd in the table. They were accepted into National Conference League Division 2 for the 1996-97 season. In 1997-98, Featherstone Lions won promotion to NCL Division 1 as champions, won the Yorkshire Cup beating Siddal in a bad tempered final at Thrum Hall and beat Doncaster in the third round of the Challenge Cup before losing to Hull Kingston Rovers. Featherstone reached the fourth round of the Challenge Cup, in 1998-99, after beating Hemel Stags before playing Super League side Halifax. In 2000-01, Featherstone reached the National Cup Final before losing to Thatto Heath at Spotland Stadium, Rochdale. The following year, the Lions narrowly avoided relegation but in 2002-03 were promoted to NCL Premier League. However, they were relegated back to NCL Division 1 in their first season and followed this with another relegation back down to NCL Division 2. Following this double relegation, Featherstone withdrew from National Conference to rebuild the open age team. In 2006, they joined National League Three which they won a year later under its new name RLC National Division.

However, contrary to their stated objectives, Soviet troops and the predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the Azerbaijan SSR OMON and army forcibly depopulated many Armenians.

Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado was born in Cantalapiedra, Salamanca in 1530. He was the son of Francisco Martinez Nieto and Ana Bernal del Mercado. He traveled to the Americas in 1541 with the expedition of Blasco Nu√±ez de Vela, recently named Viceroy of Peru. From Peru, he went to Bolivia where he had some success. In 1549, he joined with Pedro de Valdivia coming to Chile from the valley of Potos√≠, Valdivia gave him an encomienda in the area of the present Valdivia, naming him temporary captain of the new city. The death of Valdivia at the hands of Lautaro made so deep an impression on him that he left his encomienda and served under Francisco de Villagra in the war. Bernal del Mercado showed intelligence, bravery and an energetic character. He also had a deep and lasting hatred towards the Mapuche. The defense of the fort of Los Infantes was in his charge and he served under governor Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza and Pedro de Villagra and the government of the Real Audiencia. In 1564, he defeated and killed the toqui Illanguli√©n in the Battle of Angol. He gained a good reputation from his successes in the War of Arauco, and for that reason was appointed Maestro de Campo and in addition corregidor of Concepci√≥n in 1565 and of Santiago in 1583. In 1570, he was named to carry out the war as temporary Capit√°n General after the governor Melchor Bravo de Saravia resigned the post and appointed him in his place. The experience and prestige that he accumulated was immense and had all the merit to be named as Royal Governor of Chile, but his hard and undiplomatic character worked against him. He remained as Maestro de Campo until 1583, and was soon after named Captain of the line of defense. Sometimes he acted as an advisor to the king providing to him with detailed information on the state of the war. He died in Angol in 1593, without becoming governor.

Adkisson opened fire on members of the congregation during a church youth performance, killing two people and wounding six others before he was restrained by church members; according to police, he had planned to keep shooting until the police arrived and killed him. A letter, or \\"manifesto,\\" found in his vehicle after the shooting attributed his motivation for the rampage as a hatred of liberals, Democrats, African Americans, and homosexuals. In the letter he also described what he believed to be the cult-like atmosphere of the church. Adkisson pled guilty to two counts of murder and received a sentence of life in prison without parole. Shooting Jim David Adkisson The Unitarian Universalist church hosted a youth performance of Annie Jr. Some 200 people were watching the performance by 25 children when Adkisson entered the church and opened fire on the audience. 60-year-old Greg McKendry, a longtime church member and usher who deliberately stood in front of the gunman to protect others, was killed at the scene. A 61-year-old woman, Linda Kraeger, died from wounds suffered during the attack later that night. Kraeger was a member of Westside Unitarian Universalist Church in Farragut. The shooter was stopped when church members John Bohstedt, Robert Birdwell, Arthur Bolds, and Terry Uselton, along with visitor Jamie Parkey, restrained him. The perpetrator Jim David Adkisson (born June 25, 1950) was a former private in the United States Army from 1974 to 1977. After his arrest, he said that he was motivated by hatred of Democrats, liberals, African Americans and homosexuals. According to an affidavit by one of the officers who interviewed Adkisson on July 27, 2008: > During the interview Adkisson stated that he had targeted the church because > of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed > because they were ruining the country, and that he felt that the Democrats > had tied his country's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every > institution in America with the aid of major media outlets. Adkisson made > statements that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal > movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office. > Adkisson stated that he had held these beliefs for about the last ten years. Additionally, one of Adkisson's former wives had been a member (in the 1990s) of the church where the attack occurred. Adkisson's manifesto also cited the inability to find a job. His manifesto stated that he intended to keep shooting until police arrived and expected to be killed by police. Adkisson had a waist satchel with more ammunition, totaling 76 shells of #4 shot. In his manifesto, Adkisson also included the Democratic members of the House and Senate, and the 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America of Bernard Goldberg in his list of wished-for targets. David Neiwert has written that anger over Barack Obama's candidacy was also a factor as Adkisson had written \\"I'm protesting the DNC running such a radical leftist candidate. Osama Hussein Obama, yo mama\\" comparing candidate Obama to the fictional chimp Curious George. He complained about inter-racial couples: \\"How is a white woman having a niger [sic] baby progress?\\" Response Many Unitarian Universalist congregations held special vigils and services in response to the Knoxville shooting. The Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church scheduled a rededication ceremony on August 3, 2008, at which the Rev. Dr. John A. Buehrens, a former president of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and former pastor of TVUUC spoke. The UUA president, Rev. William G. Sinkford, spoke at a vigil held at Second Presbyterian Church, in Knoxville, on July 28, 2008. A relief fund was created by the UUA and its Thomas Jefferson District to aid those affected by the shooting. On August 10, 2008, the Unitarian Universalist Association took out a full-page ad in The New York Times. The ad carried the message, \\"Our Doors and Our Hearts Will Remain Open\\". The Unitarian Universalist Association carried comprehensive coverage of the response of the UU faith community online. The TVUUC Board voted to rename the 'greeting hall' to honor Greg McKendry, citing his outgoing and friendly personality, and to rename the church library to honor Linda Kraeger, citing her work as an author and professor. An oil painting of Greg McKendry was hung over the fireplace in the greeting hall. Legal proceedings At his first court appearance, Adkisson waived his rights to the preliminary hearing and requested the case go directly to the grand jury. Adkisson was represented by public defender Mark Stephens. Stephens indicated that this move was taken to get the case to trial stage as quickly as possible so resources would become available for a mental health assessment of Adkisson, indicating a possible insanity defense. On August 21, 2008, Adkisson was arraigned on charges of murder and attempted murder and a trial date of March 16, 2009 was set. He remained in jail on a $1 million bond. It was reported that the FBI had opened a civil rights probe in regards to the case. On February 4, 2009, lawyers representing Adkisson announced that he would plead guilty to two counts of murder, accepting a life sentence without possibility of parole. On February 9, 2009, Adkisson pleaded guilty to killing two people and wounding six others. \\"Yes, ma'am, I am guilty as charged,\\" he told Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz before she sentenced him to life in prison without parole. A mental health expert had determined that Adkisson was competent to make the plea, although public defender Mark Stephens was prepared to argue at the trial that his client was insane at the time the crime was committed. Victims and church members wept as the prosecutor described the wounds that killed Greg McKendry and Linda Kraeger. The judge gave Adkisson a chance to address members of the congregation before sentencing him. \\"No, ma'am,\\" he snapped. \\"I have nothing to say.\\" John Bohstedt, one of the church members who tackled Adkisson, said he didn't believe that Adkisson was insane, but that he had been manipulated by anti-liberal rhetoric. \\"Unbalanced, yes. Bitter, yes. Evil, yes. Insane, not in our ordinary use of the word,\\" Bohstedt said. Assistant District Attorney Leslie Nassios said Adkisson gave a statement to police, which showed that he planned the attack on the church because he believed that Democrats and the church's liberal politics \\"were responsible for his woes.\\" Evidence showed that Adkisson bought the shotgun a month before the attack, sawed off the barrel at his home and carried the weapon into the church in a guitar case he had purchased two days before the shooting. He had written a suicide note and intended to keep firing until police officers arrived and killed him. \\"Terrorism\\" terminology Douglas Lovelace, director of the Strategic Studies Institute at the US Army War College, contrasted Adkisson with another 21st-century mass shooter, Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California. According to Lovelace, Adkisson was \\"largely considered a terrorist\\" while Rodger was widely viewed as a mass murderer, a distinction that Lovelace questioned. Lovelace noted that many elements of Adkisson's background are consistent with those of typical mass murderers include a history of substance abuse and feelings of depression, anger and hopelessness stemming from unemployment and financial woes. Unlike other mass murderers, however, Adkisson gives some details about political motivations for the crime in his suicide note. He lambasts mainstream media as propaganda for the Democratic Party, he accuses Democrats of being allied with terrorists in the War on Terror and blames liberalism for what he sees as the ruin of the United States. Concerning the targeted Unitarian Universalist church he calls it \\"a den of un-American vipers\\" saying they are \\"sickos, weirdos and homos\\" who will \\"embrace every pervert\\". He labels his own actions variously as a \\"hate crime\\", \\"political protest\\" and a \\"symbolic killing\\" which he concludes: \\"I thought I'd do something good for the country and kill Democrats\\". Lovelace has written that Adkisson seems to have ascribed political causes to some of his personal problems, like his ex- wife's attendance at the church which as a target represented these political views.

This service is commonly used when the animal's owner is moving house (in which case, in the United States, it is tax deductible).However, it can also be used when transporting animals for other reasons, such as dog shows. The worldwide Industry body for Pet Shipping is the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association. Friday, 4 January 2019 Pet microchips, vaccinations, Rabies Titre Test, Import Permits and Health Certificates are required to ship an animal. Certain breeds are banned from the process due to increase risk associated. Statistics 2 million domestic animals board commercial flights each year. Domesticated pets have been selectively bred and genetically adapted to live alongside humans, which include dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and hamsters. Dogs and cats are the most popular types of pets that are shipped. From the total amount of pets shipped via aeroplane each year 58% are dogs and 22% are cats. Pet shipping has increased in the 21st century. Contributing factors to this rise include the global increase of pet ownership and the high-cost associated with pet care. Australia has the highest rate of pet ownership in the world where approximately 61% of households own a pet, with 40% being dogs and 27% being cats. Pet shipping is found both beneficial for owners and businesses, as some people will not travel without their pets and airlines therefore receive more demand to fly with them. 37% of owners have opted against travelling to stay at home with their dog, as 9 out of 10 households consider their dog part of the family. The Department of Transport's annual report states over half a million pets flew in 2016 and of these, 26 died and 22 were injured. A third of these deaths occurred on United airlines. The common causes of animal death during pet shipping are excessively hot or cold temperatures, poor ventilation and rough handling, according to the Humane Society. Laws The International Air Transport Association is the trade association for the world's airlines, covering 93% of scheduled international flights. It sets the minimum standards for the transportation of live animals worldwide under the ‚ÄòLive Animal Regulation‚Äô. This provides practices for humane treatment of animals, up-to-date government laws and documentation requirements for Pet shipping. Requirements=Pet microchip= A pet microchip is a permanent method of electronic identification implanted under the skin into domestic animals. A compatible microchip with the import country is required when shipping a pet, accompanied by paperwork of the microchips evidence. The microchip number contains information about recent treatments and tests the pet has undergone, which is included on all documentation to enter another country. =Vaccinations= Vaccination schedules differ across countries. The US, Australia, UK and Asia require fully vaccinated pets. Cats receive vaccinations that protect them against Feline Enteritis, Rhinotracheitis and Calicivirus. Dogs receive a vaccination that protects them against Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza and Bordetella bronchiectasis. Vaccinations must be valid for the entire post arrival quarantine period. =Rabies titre test= The ‚ÄòRabies Antibody Titre Test‚Äô is a blood test taken after the rabies vaccine to ensure the pet has adequate levels of the rabies antibody in their blood. This test safeguards local animals when pets have been imported from countries where rabies is prevalent. =Import permit= Import permits include a shipping fee and suitability guidelines for shipment, filed by the pet owner with the government of the importing country. =Pet passport scheme= A pet passport is a document that accompanies the pet during its travel. The passport allows the pet to travel between countries of the EU and others that accept the passport, without needing a quarantine period post shipment. The pet passport contains information regarding the animals microchip, rabies vaccination, rabies titre test results, parasite treatments, a picture of the pet and the animals veterinary and ownership details. Countries outside of the EU refer to a ‚Äòpet passport‚Äô as all the valid information required for a pet to travel between countries. =Health certificate= Health Check By Vet for Certificate Globally, a health certificate validated by a veterinarian is required within two weeks of the travel date. The veterinarians carry out laboratory tests in accordance with importing country requirements, undergo specified pre-export treatments, perform the final pre-export health examination and inspect the transport cages. The certificate provides confidence for the importing country that the animal has been correctly prepared for travel. Pet carrier Plastic Travel Pet Carrier, Labelled Pets are transported within a carrier that meets the International Air Transport Association standards, ensuring safety throughout travel. The International Air Transport Association requires the carrier to be large enough for the animal to sit, stand and lie comfortably within it, with a solid floor base. 14% of the floor and walls must be open to allow adequate ventilation and airflow, with shelter for protection. Handles are required for the crate to be carried, a label (with the owners details) for identification, an arrow (indicating the way it should be placed and carried), and food and water bowls for long journeys. The International Air Transport Association recommends getting the pet to be accustomed to the space before departure to reduce frightened behavior caused by the foreign enclosed environment. Banned breeds Breed Specific Legislation are rules and regulations that place restrictions on breeds from being imported into a country. 52 countries have some form of breed-specific legislation, restricting animals due to legal presumption that they are dangerous or vicious. =Australia= Cat breeds such as the Savannah cat, Safari cat, Chausie and Bengal cat are banned from entering Australia, according to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Dog breeds such as wolfhounds, Japanese Tosa, Pit-bull Terrier, Presa Canario and the Fila Brasileiro, are banned under the legislation of the Department of Home Affairs. =US= American Pit Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bulldog and American Mastiff are banned dog breeds by the Federal Government of the United States. =UK= The Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, which applies to four types of dog breeds; Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro, that are prohibited from entering the UK. Process Pets can be shipped as carry-on baggage, checked baggage or in the cargo of an aeroplane. If the animal is small enough to fit under the passenger seat in an airline-compliant carrier (such as kittens, rabbits and Maltese shit-zu dogs) some airlines allow the pet in the cabin of the plane as carry-on baggage. Larger dogs (such as a full grown Labrador) and cats are flown as checked baggage in the climate controlled sections of the cargo hold. All required paperwork is provided by the owner at check-in. They are then placed in a pet carrier that is approved by the International Air Transport Association and relocated to a separate baggage handling area specifically for animals. Animals are the last of the baggage to board the plane, to reduce the amount of time in the confined space. Baggage handlers strap animal crates in place and wrap them with perforated air cushion rolls. Cargo hold size and conditions depend on the airline and type of plane the pet is being flown in. For most planes, the baggage area is directly below the passenger cabins. To meet restrictions set by the ‚ÄòAnimal Welfare Act‚Äô, airlines do not travel in extreme hot or cold temperatures to avoid increasing health risks. Pets remain in the carrier and are not accessed by cabin crew throughout the duration of the flight. When the flight arrives at the destination, ground staff ensure pets are unloaded as soon as possible after landing. Risks=Animal stress= A 2002 study by the Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research on the physiology and behavior of dogs during air transport, revealed the stress that was placed on animals during the shipping process. Higher salivary cortisol levels and heart rates were measured, signifying the physical pressure of the confined cargo hold and lack of adequate ventilation placed on the animals body. =Risk of breeds= Animals from ‚ÄòBrachycephalic‚Äô (pushed faced) breeds, such as bulldogs, pugs and Persian cats, are prone to respiratory problems. Their short nasal passages makes them particularly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation and heat stroke during the process of pet shipping. Most airlines prohibit these breeds from being shipped due to the associated health risks. =Sedation= The International Air Transport Association regulations do not recommend sedating or tranquillising pets during shipment as it can increase the risk of breathing and vascular problems. Sedation remains the main cause of death whilst shipping an animal as the effect that the drug has upon the animal is uncertain and cannot be predicted before travel. Airlines no longer accept sedated pets on board their aircraft. Quarantine Quarantine is a process where the pet remains isolated in a quarantine facility to prevent the spread of infectious disease in the local destination. This process is required for strict rabies-free countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. For Australia, all pets must be imported into Melbourne and quarantined in the post entry facility for a minimum of 10 day.s An extension of the Quarantine period is necessary when biosecurity risks are increased, such as finding a tick on the pet. All quarantine processes must be approved by the 'International Pet and Animal Transport Association‚Äô pet agents before release. Countries such as North America, South America, Europe and Asia do not require quarantine periods. Quarantine Animal Shelter Controversy United Airlines has recorded the highest animal death rate from 2015‚Äì2017, responsible for 75% of all the deaths in 2017, data kept by the United States Department of Transportation. This high death rate may be associated with their acceptance of brachycephalic breeds, which other airline carriers do not allow due to the increased risk. In 2018, for instance, a 10-month year old bulldog died on United airlines flight as a flight attendant placed the carrier in the cabin overhead compartment. United Airlines accepts brachycephalic breeds as they believe pet owners rely on United to ship their pets and without the airline taking this risk they would have to sell their animals. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals urges all airlines to prohibit companion animals from being flown as checked baggage due to the confusion, noise, extreme temperatures and improper pressurisation of the cargo holds during travel. Improved procedures Contracts that govern the shipment of pets have been improved by stating all of the risks associated with pet shipping, ensuring owners understand the serious procedure involved. The ‚ÄòSafe Air Travel for Animals Act‚Äô was introduced in 1999 by Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Rep. Robert Menendez. The act requires US airlines to report monthly on any animal death, injury or loss, allowing pet owners to compare the safety records of airlines. ‚ÄòPet Airways‚Äô was the first pet-only airline, established in 2009, which transported unaccompanied pets in the cabin area of the plane. Attention is refocused on the pets, reducing the potential risks of live animal shipping by cargo. The company ceased operations in 2011. Several airlines have changed the way the animal carriers are moved. Removal of the live animal cargo from the routine baggage handling reduces rough handling, decreases the possibility of animal escape and limits the pet exposure to temperature variations.

Between 2014 and 2018, he was Vice Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission and Director of the National Energy Administration, with rank equivalent of a minister. Bekri was one of the highest ranked ethnic minority officials in the Chinese government. Bekri was born and raised in Xinjiang. Prior to his transfer to Beijing, he spent his entire life in the Region, aside from a short stint as the Deputy Mayor of Feicheng, Shandong Province. He is also former Mayor of √úr√ºmqi, the capital of Xinjiang. He was dismissed from his posts and placed under investigation for corruption in 2018. He was expelled from the Communist Party.  Early life  Nur Bekri was born in a village near Kazakhstan in an area under the jurisdiction of Bole (known in Uyghur as \\"Bortala\\"), Xinjiang. He received education in the Chinese language since early childhood and spoke Uyghur and Mandarin Chinese at a native fluency. He spent only one year in high school before taking the university entrance examinations, and scored highest in his township. He was sought after as a \\"minority talent\\" by the nation's top universities. Ultimately, Bekri enrolled at Xinjiang University in September 1978 and studied political theory. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in December 1982. He stayed at his alma mater to serve as a lecturer for political theory after graduation, and was a prominent member of the local Communist Youth League organization, rising to become the Xinjiang University Youth League organization's deputy chief in the late 1980s, eventually being promoted to the First Secretary (i.e. leader) of the Xinjiang University Youth League, a position he held until 1992. Political career Between 1993 and 1995 Bekri served in the Kashgar region as an assistant to the local governor. Between 1994 and 2002 Bekri served in a series of local political roles, including the vice-mayor of Feicheng, Shandong province, the deputy Secretary-General of the Xinjiang regional government, the deputy party secretary and mayor of √úr√ºmqi. At age 37, Bekri was the youngest mayor of a provincial-level capital in China at the time. Bekri then worked in the Xinjiang regional government beginning in 2000, becoming a member of the Party Committee, then Deputy Party Secretary in January 2005. = Chairman of Xinjiang = Nur Bekri was appointed Chairman of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People's Government, replacing Ismail Tiliwaldi, who resigned as Chairman in December 2007. At age 46, Bekri became one of the youngest provincial governors (or equivalents) in China. As Chairman, Bekri was nominally Xinjiang's top government official, but in practice was subordinate to the Communist Party Secretary for the region, Wang Lequan (term 1994-2010), then Zhang Chunxian (2010 onwards). After the 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, Bekri delivered the televised address in which he explained the situation that has led up to the violence and then condemned who he deemed to be coordinators of the attack.Xinjiang Chairman delivers speech on unrest Bekri has been subject to criticism by Uyghur economist and scholar Ilham Tohti, founder of Uyghur Online, a website that criticized the Chairman and his policies. Tohti said that Bekri was \\"unqualified\\" for his position and that he \\"does not care about Uyghurs\\". Tohti was later jailed on charges of \\"separatism\\". The World Uyghur Congress and some in the overseas Uyghur community also considered Bekri to be a \\"puppet of the Chinese government.\\" Bekri was the highest-ranked government official to deliver a televised speech on this issue. As the highest ranked ethnic Uyghur official in the Xinjiang government, Bekri toed the party line on issues related to Xinjiang independence, often issuing official denunciations of what the government saw as religious extremism or terrorism. He was sometimes called \\"Nol Bekri\\", an Uyghur language pun on his name which roughly meant \\"nil Bekri\\" or \\"zero Bekri\\", referring to his being seen as having little to no power. = National Energy Administration = Bekri was transferred to the National Energy Administration (NEA) under the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, a body with wide jurisdiction over economic development, in December 2014. He was replaced as Xinjiang Chairman by Shohrat Zakir. By taking on the top job at the National Energy Administration, Nur Bekri broke the mold of Uyghur government leaders, taking on a substantive post completely unrelated to ethnic affairs. His first act as leader of the NEA was to crack down on corruption; one of his predecessors Liu Tienan went to jail for corruption in a high-profile case. Under Bekri's leadership, the NEA pledged massive investment into renewable energy, and closed down over 100 coal-fired power plants. He became an outspoken proponent of renewable energy, meeting global industry executives and touting that China was contributing \\"strength and wisdom\\" to the transformation of the global energy production. Bekri is an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a member of the 18th Central Committee. He was the only ethnic Uyghur with full membership on the 18th Central Committee. He did not gain a seat on the 19th Central Committee despite not having reached retirement age, raising speculation in 2017 that he had fallen out of favor. Investigation In the early morning hours of 20 September 2018, Bekri was placed under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission. His last public appearance was a visit to Russia with Vice-Premier Han Zheng. On 16 March 2019, he was expelled from the Communist Party of China. French news agency AFP reported that Bekri had been arrested for graft (corruption), citing a statement on 2 April 2019 by national prosecutors;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/03/former-chair-chinas- xinjiang-region-nur-bekri-arrested-graft/ the report did not give a date for the former official's trial.

History The 244th Aviation Brigade was originally constituted on 16 September 1988 in the Army Reserve as Headquarters, 244th Aviation Group and was activated at Naval Air Station Glenview in Glenview, Illinois. On 31 March 1995 the group's location was changed to Fort Sheridan, Illinois and on 17 October 1995 the Group was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 244th Aviation Brigade. The 244th Aviation Brigade became a component of the 11th Theater Aviation Command when the command activated on 16 September 2007. At that time, a number of units which were formerly under the brigade were transferred away and several units within the brigade were reconsolidated. Until the transfer, the 244th Aviation Brigade was the largest aviation brigade in the United States Army. On 16 September 2016, the 11th Theater Aviation Command was reorganized as the Army Reserve Aviation Command. On 1 October 2008, the 244th Aviation Brigade headquarters was moved from Fort Sheridan, Illinois to Fort Dix, New Jersey.

She is the second child and oldest daughter of writer Leo Tolstoy. Tatiana (known in her family as Tanya) was born and grew up at Yasnaya Polyana, her father's estate south of Tula. She demonstrated an early love of painting, and in 1881 she entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where her teachers were Vasily Perov, Illarion Pryanishnikov, and Leonid Pasternak; she also studied with Nikolai Ge. Devoted to her father and his ideals, she had rejected a number of suitors. In 1897, she fell in love with Mikhail Sergeevich Sukhotin (1850‚Äî1914), although he was almost in his 50s and married with six children. For several months Tatiana had a platonic friendship with Sukhotin, despite having misgivings. She first mentioned him in his diary on November 2, 1882. Sukhotin's wife died later that year, and on 9 October, Tatiana announced her desire to marry Sukhotin to her father, who responded with a fiercely uncompromising rejection (\\"But why a pure girl should want to get mixed up in such a business is beyond me\\"). portrait by Ilya Repin (1893) Tatiana gave in for the time being, but finally insisted, and on 14 November 1899 the couple were married. They lived on Sukhotin's estate, \\"Kochety\\" (\\"The Roosters\\") in Tula guberniya, about east of Orel. On 19 November 1905, she gave birth at Yasnaya Polyana to her only child, a daughter also called Tatiana. After her husband's death in 1914, Tatiana moved back to Yasnaya Polyana, which was eventually turned into a museum. From 1917 to 1923 she was guardian of the museum; from 1923 to 1925 she was director of the Lev Tolstoy State Museum in Moscow. In 1925, together with her daughter, she immigrated to Paris, where she was hostess to Bunin, Chaliapin, Stravinsky, Alexandre Benois, and other members of the Russian exile community. From Paris she moved to Italy, where she spent her final years. In her diary entry on 13 December 1932, she wrote: \\"I have lived an incredibly and undeservedly happy and interesting life.

The film was directed by Xie Tieli and was based on a contemporary Beijing opera, one of the eight model plays allowed during the Cultural Revolution. The story is based on the novel Lin hai xue yuan (), and tells the story of an incident in 1946, during the Chinese Civil War. Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy has been identified as one of the most watched films of all time. Official Chinese government statistics claimed a total audience of 7.3 billion through the end of 1974, meaning every citizen of China had seen the film at least seven times. The large audience can be attributed to the fact that few films were produced during the Cultural Revolution, and almost all earlier films were banned; nevertheless, the average village held ten film showings per year, and failure to attend could have been seen as a sign of political deviation. Hence, Chinese citizens would have been expected to see the film multiple times during the Cultural Revolution era.

Life and career Wittrisch was born in Antwerp, Belgium to a German family, and subsequently studied in Munich, Leipzig, and Milan. His career began in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt in 1925 in a production of Hans Heiling by Marschner at the Halle Opera House. He then went to Brunswick and on to Berlin, where he sang opera from 1929 to 1944. Wittrisch also appeared as Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus at the Royal Opera House, London in 1931. The fact that Wittisch was able to carve out a fine career in the face of competition from such renowned German tenor rivals as Richard Tauber, Helge Roswaenge, Franz V√∂lker, Julius Patzak, and Peter Anders, among others, testifies to his talent. Wittrisch's singing in its prime period during the 1930s was characterised by a fresh, gleaming tone and easy top notes. As his voice matured, he undertook heavier operatic roles such as Wagner's Lohengrin in 1937 at the Bayreuth Festival and eventually Siegmund and Parsifal after the Second World War. He died in Stuttgart, aged 53. Critical appreciation Wittrisch is inevitably compared to his (now) better known contemporary Richard Tauber. According to the English music critic J B Steane: \\"Though less individual in style [than Tauber], he was certainly comparable in timbre and less restricted in the upper register.\\" Steane, J B (1992), 'Wittrisch, Marcel' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed.

Local jurisdictions in New Jersey differ from those in some other states because every square foot of the state is part of exactly one municipality; each of the 565 municipalities is in exactly one county; and each of the 21 counties has more than one municipality. New Jersey has no independent cities, or consolidated city-counties. The forms of municipality in New Jersey are more complex than in most other states, though, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding the governmental nature of an area and what local laws apply. With five types and six forms of local government (plus several non-standard forms in municipalities with special charters), some areas of New Jersey are administered significantly differently from other states. Types of municipalities may choose to operate under a form of government different from that of their default form. The New Jersey Legislature has provided optional forms of municipal government, but some forms carry restrictions and are not available to all municipalities in New Jersey. To make matters more complex, New Jersey also distinguishes between regional, consolidated, and countywide school districts and school districts that serve only a single municipality. As well, the total area of any given airport may or may not lie completely within the boundaries of a given municipality -- or even a given county. All local general purpose governments have equivalent legal powers, with the different forms and types reflecting the historical circumstances of the municipality's incorporation, similar to New England towns. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau treats only boroughs, cities, towns, and villages as \\"municipalities\\", and townships as \\"townships\\"; the Census Bureau's classification does not reflect the underlying state law that draws no distinction between the five types. County New Jersey is divided into 21 counties, and all are governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, which typically serves as both the legislative and executive body. The boards consist of three, five, seven or nine members; only Warren County, New Jersey has a board of 3 freeholders, with voters rejecting expansion to five in November 2007. The means of election of the freeholders varies from all freeholders elected in districts, all elected at-large, or mixed district and at-large freeholders. Elections are first past the post for single-member districts, and for at-large elections when only one seat is at stake. For at- large elections with more than one seat, plurality-at-large voting is used. All counties in New Jersey hold organizational meetings on or right after New Year's Day. At this time the boards elect members to leadership positions on the boards. Depending upon the specific board these offices include director, deputy director, president, vice-president, chair, chair pro tempore, vice- chair. Also at this organizational meeting each freeholder is assigned as liaison to one or more departments of the county. Five counties have a separately elected county executive (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer). A sixth county (Union) has a county executive that is appointed by the board, analogous to the council‚Äìmanager municipal form of government. In these counties, the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains only legislative authority. Most of the rest of the counties also appoint a county supervisor/administrator who is responsible for routine administrative operations of the county government. New Jersey counties have powers that are intermediate between the broad powers of counties in Pennsylvania and the limited powers of counties in New York. Counties in New Jersey do not have tax collecting power. Municipality types New Jersey is unique in the United States for having five distinct types of incorporated municipalities. Each type of municipality has equal legal standing, rights, and powers as any other type or form. Unlike other parts of the United States, New Jersey does not have different tiers of power or legal standing for its municipal governments. =Borough= The borough form of government is New Jersey's most common, being used by over 200 of the state's municipalities. Although it was once quite rare, the boroughitis phenomenon of the late 19th century led to the incorporation of large numbers of new boroughs. =CityTown= The town form of government dates back to the late 19th century when towns were first incorporated in the state. The town government law was rewritten in 1988. In this form of government, a mayor is elected at-large plus eight councilmen ‚Äì two from each of four wards. The mayor presides over council meetings and votes as a member of the council. The mayor has veto power over ordinances that can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the council. All appointments to municipal offices are performed by the council. Currently, only nine of the state's 15 towns still have the town form of government, with most of the rest opting to switch to one of the newer optional forms. =Township= The township form of government has a group of elected officials (the township committee) which serves as both the executive and legislative authority. This form of government is one of the oldest and is derived from the town meeting form of government used in New England, where the township committee has similar functions to the board of selectmen. The township committee has either three or five members elected at-large. Every year, the committee chooses one of their members to be the \\"mayor\\", becoming the moderator for meetings of the township committee but having no special powers. In general, all legislative and executive powers are exercised by the committee as a whole. The committee, however, may appoint an administrator to oversee day-to-day operations of the municipality. The township form of government is only available to municipalities that are of the township type. Out of the 246 townships in the state, the township form of government is used by 144 of them. =Village= The village form of government was made possible by the Village Act of 1891. This form consists of a five-member Board of Trustees elected for staggered three-year terms. The board selects a president and a treasurer from among the members. New incorporations under this form were stopped in 1961. While there are four municipalities that retain the Village type of government (Loch Arbour, Ridgefield Park, Ridgewood and South Orange), none of them still use the Village form of government. Loch Arbour was the last to do so, but on December 20, 2011, its residents voted to change to the Walsh Act form of government, with a three-member board of commissioners.Form Of Government Changed ‚Äì Special Election Information, Loch Arbour Municipal Website. Accessed March 14, 2012. Forms of municipal government New Jersey municipalities are not restricted in their form of government by the type of municipality. Any type of municipality that chooses to do so can adopt one of the six standard optional forms of government listed below, with some exceptions. Municipalities may also adopt non-standard forms of government by having the state legislature enact a special charter. =Walsh Act of 1911= The Walsh Act was enacted in the Progressive Era as a way to remove corruption and political influence from local politics. Voters elect three or five commissioners in non-partisan elections. Each commissioner is in charge of specific departments within the municipality, and all serve four-year concurrent terms. Together the commissioners make up the governing body of the municipality. =1923 Municipal Manager Law= The Municipal Manager Law was enacted in 1923 and is an optional form of government available to any type of municipality. Under this form of government, a municipal council composed of three, five, seven, or nine members is elected at-large with a term of office typically of four years. The council appoints several key officials, namely the municipal manager, tax assessor, auditor, clerk, treasurer, and attorney. The manager is the chief executive of the municipality and is responsible for appointing other officials and preparing the budget for council consideration. The manager serves only at the pleasure of the council. A mayor is also chosen from among the council members whose primary duty is to preside over council meetings. Only seven municipalities currently use this form of government. =Optional Municipal Charter Law= In 1950 the state legislature passed the Optional Municipal Charter Law, more familiarly known as the Faulkner Act. In the post-World War II era there was a general push toward more efficiency and professionalism in municipal government, as well as the creation of stronger executives at all levels of government. The 1947 New Jersey State Constitution, a contemporary document, reflects these trends as well. Under the Faulkner Act, municipalities can choose one of four different options for their form of government. They are: * Faulkner Act (council‚Äìmanager) * Faulkner Act (mayor‚Äìcouncil) * Faulkner Act (mayor‚Äìcouncil‚Äìadministrator) * Faulkner Act (small municipality) =Special charter= New Jersey municipalities are not required to be governed by the its type, by the Walsh Act, the 1923 Municipal Manager Law or the four forms of the Optional Municipal Charter Law (Faulkner Act). A community that finds all optional forms unsuitable may request a special charter from the state legislature. Such a charter, unique to this municipality, allows its government to be tailor-made to its needs. Changing a form of government A Charter Study Commission is one of two options available to residents of New Jersey to pursue a change in their form of government. The other option is a direct petition. The charter study commission approach is only available under the Faulkner Act. A charter study commission can be formed by a vote of the governing body. Alternatively, a ballot question to form a charter study commission can be performed through a petition or by the existing municipal governing body enacting an ordinance to form a commission. Voters simultaneously vote yes / no to form a commission and also vote to select its members (if it passes), with the top five candidates becoming the members of the commission. Communities There is no territory in the state of New Jersey that is not part of an incorporated municipality. Some communities in the state of New Jersey are well-defined areas or neighborhoods that are part of one or more incorporated municipalities, but they are not independent municipalities in their own right. While these communities may have a sense of \\"communal character\\" and unique identity, they are all located within incorporated municipalities. Some of the communities have official recognition as a census-designated place, such as Somerset, New Jersey which is part of Franklin Township. Other communities have their own ZIP Code because they have their own post office such as Neshanic Station (ZIP Code 08853), which is part of Branchburg Township, or Deans, which is part of South Brunswick Township. Other communities were once single-owner large farms that were later incorporated into a neighboring township such as Middlebush, New Jersey. Some smaller communities are incorporated into larger urban areas, such as when Greenville was merged into Jersey City as a neighborhood. School districts New Jersey distinguishes between regional, consolidated, and countywide districts and those serving single municipalities. There are also non- operating school districts, which are those districts that do not operate any school facilities and where all students attend school in other districts as part of sending/receiving relationships. The majority of school districts in New Jersey are established for general purposes, have boundaries equivalent to the municipality with which they are associated, and are classified as either Type I or Type II school districts. The schools of each public school district are governed by a board of education. Type I school districts include every local school district established in a city except where the district has changed its classification, and the board of education consists of five, seven or nine members, while in cities of the first class (cities with a population of over 150,000) the board of education must consist of nine members, and board members are appointed to three-year terms by the mayor or other chief executive of the municipality that constitutes the district. Type II school districts include all local districts in municipalities other than cities, all consolidated school districts, and all regional school districts, and can have either an elected board of education, where the board consists of nine members unless by law the number was reduced to three, five or seven members, elected at annual school elections for terms of three years, or appointed board of education, where members are appointed by the mayor or other chief executive officer of the municipality for five-year terms (for five-member boards) and three-year terms (for seven- and nine-member boards). Board of education members must be United States citizens, residents of their school districts for at least one year immediately preceding their appointment or election to the board, be registered to vote in the district, must be able to read and write English, cannot receive any compensation for their board service, and their conduct is governed by a code of ethics and the New Jersey School Ethics. All meetings of boards of education must be held in public, with certain exceptions, according to the Open Public Meetings Act. There is a superintendent for each district (which may be shared between districts), and a county superintendent of schools (the state Department of Education's representative) and executive county superintendent of schools (gubernatorial appointments whose duties include reducing district spending, collaboration and shared services) in each county. State law authorizes school districts: * to share superintendents and business administrators (N.J.S.A. 18A:14.1 and 18A:24.1), * to participate in joint insurance funds (), * to provide jointly for pupil transportation (), * child study team services and facilities and services for students with disabilities (, ), * nursing services to nonpublic schools (), * to establish various statewide, regional, county or multi- district entities offering shared or joint services, including educational service commissions ( et seq.), * to establish county special services school districts (), * to establish statewide distance learning networks (), * to establish educational improvement resource centers (), and * to use the statewide textbook bank (). =State intervention= The state Commissioner of Education has the power of \\"state intervention\\", to intervene in governance of a local public school district (and to intervene in the areas of instruction and program, operations, personnel, and fiscal management) if the Commissioner has determined that a school district has failed, or is unable, to take corrective actions necessary to establish a thorough and efficient system of education. When the state intervenes in governance of a school district, the board of education acts in an advisory capacity only, and ultimate authority is in a state district superintendent appointed by the State Board of Education. From 1987 to 2005, the State Board of Education had the power to take over an entire school district and manage it as a \\"state-operated school district\\", which was replaced by the legislature in 2005 with state intervention. Using this power, the state has assumed the operation of Newark Public Schools, Jersey City Public Schools, and Paterson Public Schools, which are in various stages of returning governance to local control: In Jersey City, governance has been restored to local control in the form of an elected school board, although the state district superintendent remains to manage curriculum functions, while in Newark and Paterson governance has yet to change from state to local management.

Announced in June 2008, the Omnia was launched in Singapore in mid-June, available in stores on the 20th of June, and in the rest of Asia in July. For some parts of Europe, it was launched in August. The American version launched in December 2008 through Verizon Wireless while the Canadian version launched in April 2009 through Telus Mobility. The Omnia was Samsung Mobile's top-of-the-line flagship handset. It runs on Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional, but comes other applications preinstalled to make its GUI and its functions distinguishable from others running the same platform: *Samsung Today Screen 1 (alternative home screen UI) *Samsung Today Screen 2 (similar to Samsung Today Screen 1) *Samsung Touch Wiz UI (alternative application menu with a widget bar and widgets) All these applications have the ability to be controlled by sliding the finger across the screen. The third Today Screen has gained interest because of its control method. It uses about a fourth of the screen on the left side to hold a bar of widgets that can be scrolled up and down. The rest of the screen is customizable, as widgets can be pulled out of the sidebar and onto the main screen to be expanded for quick use. Camera The Samsung Omnia has a 5.0-megapixel camera with autofocus and LED flash. Additionally Samsung Omnia supports VGA resolution video recording with about 20 - 25 frame/s. Samsung Omnia's front-facing 3G camera has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels (VGA). Korean edition (T*Omnia) thumb SK Telecom and Samsung announced a Korean edition of Samsung Omnia, T*Omnia or SCH-M490. T is a brand name marketed by SK Telecom. The hardware has been upgraded to have a Wide VGA (800 x 480) LCD screen and a PXA312 CPU that automatically overclocks up to 806 MHz. An S-DMB tuner has replaced the TV-out and FM tuner. The 4 GB version (SCH-M490) is priced at KRW68,000, and the 16 GB (SCH-M495) at KRW1,078,000 including 10% VAT. Japanese edition (930SC) In Japan, SoftBank Mobile announced that the Samsung Omnia will be sold as 930SC in November 2008. However, it adopted the proprietary operating system instead of Windows Mobile. It has a Wide VGA LCD and 1seg tuner, but GPS has been excluded. It is also available for SoftBank Mobile's own mobile Internet service. North American edition (SCH-i910) thumb The Samsung Omnia has been released under the version name SCH-i910 in North America, with Verizon Wireless as the network operator. The SCH-i910 has a speaker on the back and has CDMA2000 instead of the GSM radio. The SCH-i910 still runs Windows Mobile 6.1 along with some added software such as Visual Voicemail. Most other features stay the same as the SCH-i900. Most noticeably, the i910 does not include the secondary VGA camera on the front; presumably due to the lack of support for video calls in North America. The North American version of the phone uses the same 624 MHz chip used by other versions. This has been confirmed by numerous North American users through the \\"settings\\" menu on the Omnia.

The museum was originally Moreau's dwelling, transformed by his 1895 decision into a studio and museum of his work with his apartment remaining on the first floor. Today the museum contains Moreau's drawings, paintings, watercolors, and sculptures. Description The building has three floors. Of the six small rooms on the ground floor overlooking a garden, four rooms are decorated with drawings and sketches of which are dedicated to the Italian masters. The first floor apartment (one dining room, one bedroom, a den and a hallway and an office-library) reminds the gallery patrons of its original purpose as the dwelling place of the Moreau family. The second floor has a large studio-room and the third floor has two rooms of a larger format. The collection consists of around 1200 paintings (mostly sketches or unfinished), pastels or watercolors and 4830 drawings kept in cabinets and cupboards with pivoting shutters and wholesale inventory numbers, drawn by Moreau himself, with nearly 5000 drawings (7800 aside).

Moreno (November 9, 1872 in Valle del Tapu√°, Paraguay‚ÄìDecember 9, 1933 Valle del Tapu√°) was a Paraguayan journalist, financial expert, statesman and one of the most serious researchers of the Paraguayan history. Childhood and youth Moreno was descendant of the Yegros (by the side of his mother), a family that had significant importance in Paraguayan history. He went to high school in the Colegio Nacional de la Capital (National School of the Capital) and started to study Law in the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences, from which he, short time after, dropped out of because he consumed his time participating in political activities since 1900. He was an active member of the Colorado Party. He married Rosario Gonz√°lez Filisbert and fathered many children. Public service * Teacher of Paraguayan History in the Escuela Normal de Maestros (School of Teachers) and of Greek History in the Colegio Nacional (National School) * Director of the Colegio Nacional (National School) * Director of the Post Office and Telegraphs * Minister of Finance of Paraguay from 1901 to 1904 He was a historical researcher of authority. In 1910, in times of government of the Liberal Party, the president Manuel Gondra required his services because of a limit problem with Bolivia. He represented the country in the negotiations with Ricardo Muj√≠a (representative from Bolivia). He was diplomatic representative from Paraguay before the governments of Bolivia, Per√∫ and Chile. His work Carlos Zubizarreta describes him as a meticulous and sparkling writer. With funny and ironic verses, he knew how to find inspiration in the Native-American traditions. He used the satire very creatively: when he was secretary in the Post Office, he used to ask for salary increases in verses with funny twists, something that he repeated sometimes when he was a diplomatic too. The poet revealed in his poems the influence of the social and physical environment in which he grew up. He identified with the popular culture and learned the secrets of the city, in his writing is present the collective emotion of the people and the image of the Guaran√≠ land. Given his knowledge in financial matters, for Moreno, the economy was also present in his writing, he wrote many monographs about it, one of them was ‚ÄúLa cuesti√≥n monetaria en el Paraguay‚Äù (The financial matter in Paraguay), published in 1902. In it, he made an analysis of the productive balance and the consequences of the national currency‚Äôs devaluation. * ‚ÄúLos tratados con Bolivia‚Äù (The treaties with Bolivia), 1903 * ‚ÄúInformes sobre Impuestos Internos‚Äù (Reports about Internal Taxes), 1906 * ‚ÄúHistoria econ√≥mica del Paraguay‚Äù (Economical history of Paraguay), 1911 * ‚ÄúInmigraci√≥n y colonizaci√≥n antes y despu√©s de la guerra‚Äù (Immigration and colonization before and after the war), 1911 In the same year he published a writing of great diffusion: ‚ÄúEstudio sobre la Independencia del Paraguay‚Äù (Study about the Paraguayan Independence) with motive of the centenary of the Paraguayan Independence. * In 1913 he published his essay ‚ÄúEl mundo de los √°tomos‚Äù (The world of atoms) * In 1924 ‚ÄúLos guaran√≠es en el antiguo Tucum√°n‚Äù (The Guaran√≠ in the old Tucum√°n) * In 1926 ‚ÄúLa ciudad de Asunci√≥n‚Äù (The city of Asunci√≥n). In this one, he described meticulously the city‚Äôs process of formation since the colonial times until the independence. The same year, he published ‚ÄúExtensi√≥n territorial del Paraguay al oeste de su r√≠o‚Äù (The extension of the Paraguayan territory at the west side of the river‚Äù. He was a renowned journalist, permanent writer in ‚ÄúLa Prensa‚Äù of Buenos Aires. Historical labor Moreno ruled out the supposition of how influential was Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia for the independence of Paraguay. He maintained that: ‚ÄúWe can not identify the Paraguayan independence with Francia or attribute him the formation of our nationality because these affirmation, moreover than being contrary to the normal development of countries, are opposite to the documents and historical proves. The way of feeling and thinking of centuries does not change in a day with the effort of just one man‚Äù. Ra√∫l Amaral affirms that Moreno‚Äôs historical work would have been of great diversity if he would not have been so focused on the problems in Chaco, which consumes great part of his efforts. His work about the Guaran√≠ migration though, exposed in his investigations about the Chaco is of great value. In the defense of Paraguayan interests in the conflict with Bolivia he pay special interest in the precise knowledge of the history, his obsessive dedication to this subject gave him the nickname of ‚ÄúDoctor de L√≠mites‚Äù (Limits Doctor). Moreno was awarded with several decorations, Paraguayans and Bolivians. Moreno used to describe himself in a funny way: ‚ÄúI am republican, but I was a revolutionary fighter on October 18; I have several decorations without winning any battles, my name is Moreno (that means a person with dark skin) but I am white, I am sorry my friends, but I am no doctor.

Norris were renamed as the Detroit Red Wings in 1932. The team played their first game on November 18, 1926, and won their first two Stanley Cup titles in 1936 and 1937. The Red Wings have won the Cup eleven times, more than any other American team in NHL history. The franchise played their first season's home games in Windsor, Ontario at the Border Cities Arena. The Detroit Olympia opened in 1927 and served as the team's home arena until the midpoint of the 1979‚Äì80 season when the Wings moved into Joe Louis Arena. \\"The Joe\\", as it is known, had been their home arena until the end of the 2016-17 season. Starting in the 2017-18 season the Wings moved into Little Caesars Arena. The team, led by head coach and general manager Jack Adams, found success throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, making fourteen appearances in the finals and winning the Stanley Cup seven times. Led on the ice by the Production Line of Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, and Sid Abel (later replaced by Alex Delvecchio), along with goaltenders Harry Lumley and then Terry Sawchuk, the Wings appeared in the finals six times from 1948 through 1955, winning the Cup in 1950, 1952, 1954, and 1955. After Adams was fired in 1963 the team reached the finals three more times prior to the 1967 NHL expansion, however they qualified for the playoffs only twice in the next sixteen years until being purchased by Mike Ilitch in 1982. Ilitch revitalized the club, hiring Jim Devellano to manage the team; one of Devellano's first actions was to draft Steve Yzerman in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft. Yzerman went on stay with the team for his entire 22 year NHL career, 19 as team captain, winning the Stanley Cup three times as a player and once as an executive. With Ilitch as owner the Wings won the Cup in 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2008. Fifty-eight Red Wings players and fourteen builders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Lester Patrick Trophy has been presented to twenty-four former or current Wings and the club has retired the numbers of seven players. Founding At the April 18, 1926, NHL meetings to discuss expansion of the NHL, five applications were received from Detroit along with three from Chicago, one from Cleveland, one from New Jersey, one from Hamilton and one from New York. The New York application to become the New York Rangers was approved. The NHL decided to investigate all applicants before deciding at their next meeting. At the time, it was known that the Western Canada Hockey League was folding. Other than the Rangers, there was opposition to adding any other teams to the NHL. The NHL constitution required unanimous approval on adding new teams and the New York Americans were opposed to the plan to add one team in Detroit and one in Chicago, as the Americans favoured two teams in Chicago. This was overcome at the May 2, 1926 NHL meeting by amending the NHL constitution, which required only a 2/3 approval, to allow a simple majority vote for the approval of new teams and it became expected that Chicago and Detroit would receive franchises. At the meeting, what were now two competing syndicates vying for the Detroit franchise, one from Townsend and McCreath, and one from Bierer, were ordered to amalgamate by the NHL. The next day, May 3, it was announced by Detroit promoters Morris Caplan and Morris Friedberg that they had purchased the 1925 Stanley Cup champion Victoria Cougars in expectation of a NHL franchise being awarded to them at NHL meetings later that month. Similarly, the Portland Rosebuds were also purchased that day by Chicago interests. On May 15, 1926, Detroit was tentatively awarded a NHL expansion team to a group of investors led by Townsend, Seyburn and McCreath, not Caplan and Friedberg, on condition of the arena being ready for the upcoming season. At the time, the arena was expected to be ready for December 1. The Victoria Club was sold by Lester and Frank Patrick to the Townsend group for $100,000, of which $25,000 went to Caplan and Friedberg.Coleman(1968), p. 8 Although the arena was not ready, the franchise was permanently approved by the NHL on September 25, 1926. The franchise was established as the Detroit Cougars, retaining the Victoria name. However, the NHL does not consider the Red Wings to be a continuation of the Victoria team. The Rangers had been issued a franchise on May 15, while the Chicago Black Hawks joined the league the same day as the Cougars; the additions of these clubs increased the number of teams in the league to ten. Early seasons (1926‚Äì1942)=1926‚Äì1932: Cougars and Falcons= Team photo from Detroit's inaugural season. The franchise was known as the Detroit Cougars from 1926 to 1930. Without a Detroit arena, the new Cougars played their first season in Windsor, Ontario at the Border Cities Arena. Frank Patrick of Victoria did not come east to manage Detroit. The Cougars signed former Calgary Tigers player Art Duncan to play and coach the team, but the NHL, in its distribution of WHL players ordered Detroit to send players Art Gagne and Gord Fraser to the Chicago Black Hawks for Duncan.Coleman(1968), p. 9 The Cougars played their first game on November 18, 1926, losing 2‚Äì0 to the Boston Bruins, and finished their first season with a record of 12 wins, 28 losses and 4 ties for 28 points, the worst record in the league; the 12 wins and 4 ties remain club records for fewest wins and fewest ties in a season. The next year, the 1927‚Äì28 season, the team moved into the Detroit Olympia, playing their first game on November 22, 1927. This building would be the home arena for the team until 1979. Also in that year, Duncan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was replaced as coach and general manager by Jack Adams, recently retired from the Ottawa Senators. Adams would be the face of the franchise for the next 36 years as coach or general manager. The Cougars finished with a record of 19-19-6, moving up to fourth place in the American division. The team moved into its first permanent home, the Detroit Olympia, in 1927. The Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929 with Carson Cooper leading the team in scoring. The Cougars were outscored 7‚Äì2 in the two-game series with Toronto. In 1930 the team changed its name to the Detroit Falcons as a result of a promotion with a newspaper. They would reach the NHL playoffs for the first time in 1929, losing the series to the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, the team continued to have financial difficulties, and was forced into receivership in 1931. =1932‚Äì1942: The new Detroit Red Wings= Chicago grain merchant James E. Norris bought the team in 1932. His first act was to change the team's name to the Red Wings. Norris believed the new name would help the team curry favor with Detroit's auto industry, and also wanted to pay homage to a hockey team for whom he had played earlier in the century, the Montreal Hockey Club‚Äînicknamed the Winged Wheelers. He also designed the first logo for the Red Wings, which is more or less the same logo that is used today. Under the new name Red Wings, the team began to improve. Carl Voss was named the inaugural recipient of the NHL rookie-of-the-year award in 1932‚Äì33. The team as a whole also began to enjoy success. They reached the 1934 Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the Chicago Black Hawks. In 1935‚Äì36 the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup for the first time, defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs. En route to the final, they played in the longest overtime game in NHL history, winning the first game of a semi-final match against the Montreal Maroons in the sixth overtime frame. The match lasted 176 minutes and 30 seconds of game time, ending when rookie Mud Bruneteau scored, giving Detroit a 1‚Äì0 win. The following season, they defeated the New York Rangers for their second consecutive Stanley Cup title. In 1938, the Wings and the Montreal Canadiens became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, visiting Paris and London. The Wings played nine games against the Canadiens and went 3-5-1. The Wings did not play in Europe again until the preseason and start of the 2009-10 NHL season in Sweden against the St. Louis Blues. Original Six era (1942‚Äì1967)=1940s= They made the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive years during the early 1940s. In 1941 they were swept by the Boston Bruins, in 1942 they lost a seven-game series against Toronto in the finals after winning the first three games, but in 1943, with Syd Howe and Mud Bruneteau scoring 20 goals apiece, Detroit won their third Cup by sweeping the Bruins. They remained a solid team through the rest of the decade, making the playoffs every year, and reaching the finals three more times. Gordie Howe made his debut with the Red Wings in the 1946‚Äì47 season. In 1946, one of the greatest players in hockey history came into the NHL with the Red Wings. Gordie Howe, a right-winger from Floral, Saskatchewan, only scored seven goals and 15 assists in his first season and would not reach his prime for a few more years. It was also the last season as head coach for Adams, who stepped down after the season to concentrate on his duties as general manager. He was succeeded by minor league coach Tommy Ivan. By his second season, Howe was paired with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great lines in NHL history‚Äîthe \\"Production Line\\". Lindsay's 33 goals propelled the Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the Maple Leafs. Detroit reached the Finals again the following season, only to be swept again by Toronto. =1950‚Äì1966: The Gordie Howe Era= The Wings returned to the top in 1950, with Pete Babando scoring the game winner in double overtime of Game 7 to beat the Rangers in the Finals. After the game, Lindsay skated around the Olympia ice with the Cup, beginning a tradition that continues today. After being upset by Montreal in the 1951 semifinals, Detroit won its fifth Cup in 1952, sweeping both the Leafs and the Canadiens, with the Production Line of Howe, Abel and Lindsay joined by second-year goalie Terry Sawchuk. Detroit would become the first team in 17 years to go undefeated in the playoffs. They also scored an amazing 24 playoff goals, compared to Toronto and Montreal's combined total of 5. Abel left the Wings for Chicago following the season, and Alex Delvecchio took his spot on the roster. Team photo for the Red Wings, 1952. The Red Wings won their fifth Stanley Cup that year. James E. Norris died in December 1952. He was succeeded as team president by his daughter, Marguerite - the first (and as of the 2017‚Äì18 season, only) woman to head an NHL franchise. She made no secret of her dislike for Adams. While she could have summarily fired him, since he was still without a contract, she chose not to do so. Following another playoff upset in 1953 at the hands of the Bruins, the Red Wings won back to back Stanley Cups in 1954 (over Montreal, when Habs defenseman Doug Harvey redirected a Tony Leswick shot into his own net) and 1955 (also over Montreal in the full seven games). The 1954‚Äì55 season ended a run of eight straight regular season titles, an NHL record. Also during the 1955 off- season, Marguerite Norris lost an intrafamily power struggle, and was forced to turn the Wings over to younger brother Bruce, who had inherited his father's grain business. Detroit and Montreal met once again in the 1956 finals, but this time the Canadiens won the Cup, their first of five in a row. In 1957 Ted Lindsay, who scored 30 goals and led the league in assists with 55, teamed up with Harvey to help start the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). As a result, he, along with outspoken young netminder Glenn Hall, was promptly traded to Chicago (which was owned by James D. Norris, Bruce's elder brother) after his most productive year. The Wings had lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Bruins. The Lindsay deal was one of several questionable trades made by Adams in the late 1950s. For example, in 1955, he had traded Sawchuk to Boston in order to make room for Glenn Hall. While Adams managed to get Sawchuk back two years later, it came at the expense of sending up-and-coming Johnny Bucyk to Boston. It was one of the most one-sided trades in hockey history. Although Sawchuk played seven more years for Detroit (and would stay in the NHL for another five years), his best days had passed. Meanwhile, Bucyk went on to play 21 more years with the Bruins and score over 500 goals en route to the Hall of Fame. In 1958 the Red Wings were swept in the first round by Montreal; in 1959 they missed the playoffs for the first time in 21 years. Within a couple of years, however, Detroit was rejuvenated and made the Finals for four of the next six years between 1961 and 1966. Still, despite having Howe, Delvecchio, Norm Ullman, and Parker MacDonald as consistent goal-scorers, Lindsay's sudden one-year comeback in 1964‚Äì65, and Sawchuk and later Roger Crozier between the pipes, the Wings came away empty-handed. Adams was fired as general manager in 1963. He had coached for 15 years and served as general manager for 31 years on a handshake, and his 36‚Äìyear tenure is still the longest for any general manager in NHL history. Expansion era (1967‚Äì1993)=1967‚Äì1982: The \\"Dead Wings\\" Era= Only a year after making the Finals, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 24 points out of the playoffs. It was the beginning of a slump from which they would not emerge for almost 20 years. Between 1967 and 1983, Detroit only made the playoffs twice, winning one series. From 1968 to 1982, the Wings had 14 head coaches (not counting interim coaches), with none lasting more than three seasons. In contrast, their first six full-time coaches - Art Duncan, Adams, Ivan, Jimmy Skinner, and Abel - had covered a 42‚Äìyear period. During this dark era in franchise history, the team was derisively known as the \\"Dead Wings\\" or \\"Dead Things\\". One factor was the end of the old \\"development\\" system, which allowed Adams to get young prospects to commit to playing for Detroit as early as their 16th birthday. Another factor was Ned Harkness, who was hired as coach in 1970 and was promoted to general manager midway through the season. A successful college hockey coach, Harkness tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant to change. The Wings chafed under his discipline, in which he demanded short hair and no smoking, along with new rules regarding drinking and phone calls. Harkness was forced to resign in 1973. In the \\"expansion season\\" of 1967‚Äì68, the Red Wings also acquired longtime star left-winger Frank Mahovlich from the defending Cup champs in Toronto. Mahovlich would go on a line with Howe and Delvecchio, and in 1968‚Äì69, he scored a career-high 49 goals and had two All- Star seasons in Detroit. However, this could not last. Mahovlich was traded to Montreal in 1970, and Howe retired after the 1970‚Äì71 season. Howe returned to pro hockey shortly after to play with his two sons Mark and Marty Howe (Mark would later join the Red Wings at the end of his career) in the upstart World Hockey Association (WHA) in 1972. Through the decade, with Mickey Redmond having two 50‚Äìgoal seasons and Marcel Dionne starting to reach his prime (which he did not attain until he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1975), a lack of defensive and goaltending ability continually hampered the Wings. Joe Louis Arena in 2006. The Red Wings moved into the arena to begin the 1979‚Äì80 season. Around the same time, the area around the Olympia went to seed. After two murders took place near the arena, Norris seriously considered moving to an arena in suburban Pontiac. However, the city offered the Red Wings a deal Norris couldn't refuse‚Äîoperational control of a new city-owned arena on the banks of the Detroit River, Joe Louis Arena. The Red Wings moved to the new arena during the 1979‚Äì80 season. In 1982, after 50 years of family ownership, Bruce Norris sold the Red Wings to Mike Ilitch, founder of Little Caesars Pizza. =1983‚Äì1993: The Yzerman Era Begins= In 1983 the Wings drafted Steve Yzerman, a center from Cranbrook, British Columbia. He led the team in scoring in his rookie year, and started the Wings' climb back to the top. That season, with John Ogrodnick scoring 42 times and Ivan Boldirev and Ron Duguay also with 30‚Äìgoal seasons, Detroit made the playoffs for the first time in six years. Defenseman Brad Park, acquired from the Boston Bruins in the 1983 free-agent market, also helped the Wings reach the postseason and ended up winning the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy the same season. Later, Park was asked to coach the Wings, but was sacked after 45 games in 1985‚Äì86. He admitted, \\"I took over a last-place team, and I kept them there.\\" They did indeed end up in the basement, achieving a 17‚Äì57‚Äì6 record for only 40 points. This was the same year that the Wings added enforcer Bob Probert, one of the most familiar faces of the Wings in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1987, with Yzerman joined by Petr Klima, Adam Oates, Gerard Gallant, defenceman Darren Veitch and new head coach Jacques Demers, the Wings won a playoff series for only the second time in the modern era. They made it all the way to the conference finals against the powerful and eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers, but lost in five games. In 1988 they won their first division title in 23 years (since 1964‚Äì65, when they finished first in a one-division league). They did so, however, in a relatively weak division; no other team in the Norris finished above .500. As was the case in the previous season, they made it to the conference finals only to lose again to the eventual cup champion Oilers in five games. In 1989, Yzerman scored a career-best 65 goals, but Detroit was upset in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks. The following season Yzerman scored 62 goals, but the team missed the playoffs. Rumors spread that maybe \\"Stevie Wonder\\" should be traded. But it was Demers, not Yzerman, who received the pink slip. New coach Bryan Murray was unable to get them back over .500, but they returned to the playoffs. Yzerman was joined by Sergei Fedorov, who would be an award-winner and frequent all-star for the team in the 1990s. In 1992, the team acquired Ray Sheppard, who had a career-best 52 goals two years later; and in '93, top defenseman Paul Coffey. Also joining the Red Wings around this time were draft picks like Slava Kozlov, Darren McCarty, Vladimir Konstantinov and Nicklas Lidstrom. Modern era (1994‚Äìpresent)=1994‚Äì2004: The Russian Five and return to glory= The Yzerman trade rumors ended very soon after Scotty Bowman got behind the Motown bench in 1993. In his second season, the lockout-shortened 1994‚Äì95 season, he guided Detroit to its first Finals appearance in 29 years, only to be swept by the New Jersey Devils. The Wings kept adding more star power, picking up Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov and goaltender Mike Vernon in trades and winning an NHL record 62 games in 1996. After defeating the St. Louis Blues (with a Game 7, double-overtime goal by Yzerman), the Wings would fall in the Western Conference Finals to the eventual champion Colorado Avalanche (formerly Quebec Nordiques). The following year, Detroit, joined by Brendan Shanahan and Larry Murphy during the season, once again reached the Finals in 1997. After defeating the St. Louis Blues in six games, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Colorado Avalanche in the first three rounds, the Wings went on to beat the Philadelphia Flyers in four straight games in the Stanley Cup Finals. It was the Wings' first Stanley Cup since 1955, breaking the longest drought (42 years long) in the league at that time. Mike Vernon accepted the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the 1997 playoffs. Tragedy struck the Wings six days after their championship; defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the \\"Russian Five,\\" suffered a brain injury in a limousine accident, and his career came to an abrupt end. Wings trainer Sergei Mnatsakanov suffered similar injuries. Red Wings defenseman Slava Fetisov was also injured in the accident, but was released from the hospital the next day. The Red Wings dedicated the 1997‚Äì98 season, which also ended in a Stanley Cup victory (another sweep, this time over the Washington Capitals), to Konstantinov, who came out onto the ice in his wheelchair on victory night to touch the Cup. Yzerman, who had won the Conn Smythe Trophy as post-season Most Valuable Player that year, immediately gave the Cup to Konstantinov after he hoisted it. He later reported that he had intended to pass it to goalie Chris Osgood for his stellar surprise performance. \\"Not very often does a moment in hockey transcend sports,\\" remarked Brendan Shanahan later. The following season, the Wings looked poised to \\"three-peat\\" for the first time in franchise history, acquiring three-time top blueliner Chris Chelios from his hometown Chicago Blackhawks in March 1999, but it was not to be as they would end up losing the Western Conference Semifinals to Colorado in six games. The Wings had built up a fierce rivalry with the Avalanche in this time. With the Red Wings beating the Avs in the third round in 1997, and Colorado beating Detroit in the second round in both 1999 and 2000, the battles between these two teams had become one of the fiercest in sports. During a game on March 26, 1997, a brawl ensued between Colorado goalie Patrick Roy and his Detroit counterpart Mike Vernon. In a separate fight, Darren McCarty paid back Avalanche player Claude Lemieux for his hit from behind on Kris Draper the year before. Fittingly, it was Darren McCarty who scored the overtime goal to give the Red Wings the 6‚Äì5 victory in the game that became known as \\"Fight Night at the Joe.\\" George W. Bush receives a jersey from Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman, during the welcome reception at the White House for the 2002 Stanley Cup champions. In 2001, Detroit, the league's second-best team in the regular season, were upset in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings. During the summer that followed, they acquired legendary goalie Dominik Hasek (the defending Vezina Trophy winner) in a trade with the Buffalo Sabres. They also landed left-wing Luc Robitaille and right-wing Brett Hull through free agency. Rookie center Pavel Datsyuk joined the Wings from the Russian Superleague the same year. The Wings became the hands-down favorite to win the Cup in 2002. They did not disappoint, posting the league's best record in the regular season and defeating Colorado in seven games in the Western Conference Finals after beating the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues in rounds one and two. The Red Wings went on to capture another Cup in five games over the Cinderella- story Carolina Hurricanes, with Nicklas Lidstrom winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff's Most Valuable Player. Bowman and Hasek both elected to retire after the season. Yzerman, Hull, and Robitaille were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009. The 2002‚Äì03 season saw the Red Wings promote associate coach Dave Lewis to the head coach position after Bowman's retirement. Needing a new starting goaltender after Hasek's retirement, the Red wings signed Curtis Joseph from the Toronto Maple Leafs to a three-year, $24 million deal. Also new to the lineup was highly touted Swedish prospect Henrik Zetterberg. The Red Wings finished the season second in the Western Conference and third overall in the NHL. The Red Wings were favored in their first round matchup against the 7th seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. But the Ducks shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red Wings in four games, thanks in large part to the strong performance of Ducks goaltender J. S. Giguere. The Ducks later advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost in Game 7 to the New Jersey Devils. Longtime Wing Sergei Fedorov signed with the Mighty Ducks as a free agent during the offseason, after a long contract dispute. More importantly, Dominik Hasek decided to come out of retirement, and joined the Wings for the 2003‚Äì04 season. The Wings also added defenseman Derian Hatcher from the Dallas Stars via free agency, as well as forward Ray Whitney from the Columbus Blue Jackets. Joseph, despite being one of the highest-paid players in the NHL, had to spend part of the season with the Grand Rapids Griffins, Detroit's American Hockey League affiliate. The Wings attempted to trade him; but, perhaps because of his large contract, there were no suitors. Ultimately, Hasek called it quits after just 14 games because of a groin injury, and Joseph became the Wings' No. 1 goalie again, and helped lead the team to the top of the Central Division and the National Hockey League standings. Hatcher was also injured just a few games into the regular season with a torn MCL. Hatcher would not return until the end of the regular season. The Wings acquired veteran center Robert Lang from the Capitals at the trade deadline. The Red Wings eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games in the first round of the playoffs, which led to a second round matchup with the Calgary Flames. In Game 5, with the series tied at two games apiece, a deflected puck struck Steve Yzerman in the left eye, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. The Red Wings lost that game 1‚Äì0, and were eliminated the next game in Calgary by the same score in overtime. During the 2004 offseason, the Wings focused on keeping players they already had instead of being active on the free agent market. They re-signed Frank J. Selke Trophy-winning forward Kris Draper, who had just had a career season, to a four-year deal, and captain Yzerman to a one-year deal. They also re-signed Brendan Shanahan, Jiri Fischer, Jason Williams, and Mathieu Dandenault as well head coach Dave Lewis. Deals were not reached with veteran defensemen Chris Chelios and Mathieu Schneider or star forward Pavel Datsyuk before the NHL owners triggered their lockout on September 15. There also was a parting of ways with veteran forward Brett Hull, who signed with the Phoenix Coyotes as did forward Boyd Devereaux. =2005‚Äì2012: Nick Lidstrom and the 'Swedish Connection' era= Steve Yzerman with Nicklas Lidstrom during the 2005‚Äì06. The season would be Yzerman's last, with Lidstrom succeeding him as the team captain. On July 15, 2005, Mike Babcock, former head coach in Anaheim, became the new head coach for the Wings. During a November 21, 2005, game against Nashville, defenseman Jiri Fischer suffered a heart arrhythmia and collapsed on the bench. The game was canceled because of his injury, and was made up on January 23, 2006. This was the first time in NHL history a game had been postponed by injury. The game was played for the full 60 minutes; however, the Predators were allowed to maintain their 1‚Äì0 lead from the original game and won, 3‚Äì2. The Red Wings won the Presidents' Trophy with a 58‚Äì16‚Äì8 record, earning them 124 points, and secured home ice advantage for the entire playoffs. They opened the 2006 playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers with a 3‚Äì2 overtime victory at Joe Louis Arena, but the Oilers won four of the next five games to take the series. Continuing the shakeup of the Red Wings roster, the off-season saw the departure of Brendan Shanahan and the return of Dominik Hasek, while Steve Yzerman announced his retirement after a 23-season Hall of Fame-caliber career with the Wings, at the time having played the second most games in history all with a single team (behind fellow Red Wing Alex Delvecchio and later also surpassed by Nicklas Lidstrom). Yzerman retired with the additional distinction of having been the longest-serving team captain in NHL history. The Red Wings opened the 2006‚Äì07 season with Nicklas Lidstrom as the new captain. The team retired Steve Yzerman's jersey number 19 on January 2. The Wings finished first in the Western Conference and tied for first in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the Sabres were awarded the Presidents' Trophy by virtue of having the greater number of wins. Detroit advanced to the third round of the 2007 playoffs after defeating Calgary and the San Jose Sharks both in six games, coming back three-straight after the Sharks' 2‚Äì1 series lead. The Red Wings, however, then lost to the eventual Stanley Cup winning team, the Anaheim Ducks, in the Western Conference Finals, four games to two. Aaron Downey celebrates after winning the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. To start the 2007‚Äì08 campaign, Henrik Zetterberg recorded at least a point in each of Detroit's first 16 games, setting a club record. The Wings cruised to the playoffs, where they faced the Nashville Predators. After goalie Dominik Hasek played poorly in Games 3 and 4 of the series, both losses, head coach Mike Babcock replaced him with Chris Osgood. Osgood had departed the Wings earlier in the decade, only to be re-acquired as a backup in 2005. Osgood never left the net for the remainder of the playoffs, as the Red Wings came back in that series on their way to winning their 11th Stanley Cup. The final victory came in Game 6 on June 4, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, by a score of 3‚Äì2. This was the Wings' fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. Zetterberg scored the winning goal in the decisive game, and was also named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. It was the first time a team captained by a non-North American player (Nicklas Lidstrom) won the Stanley Cup. Chris Osgood makes a save against Bill Guerin in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals. On July 2, 2008, the Detroit Red Wings announced the signing of Marian Hossa. From the beginning of the 2008‚Äì09 season to New Year's Day, the Wings enjoyed success. Although they finished second in the conference to the San Jose Sharks, the Wings became the first team in NHL history to top 100 points in nine straight seasons. On January 1, 2009, the Red Wings played the Chicago Blackhawks in the third NHL Winter Classic at Chicago's Wrigley Field, beating them 6‚Äì4. The Wings entered the 2009 playoffs as the second overall seed in the Western Conference. The Red Wings handily swept the Columbus Blue Jackets, then beat the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in a hard-fought seven-game series. They took on the vastly improved Chicago Blackhawks in the Conference Finals, winning in five games. The Red Wings would face the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Finals for a second consecutive year, but this series would feature a different outcome. Pittsburgh defeated the Red Wings in seven games, Detroit becoming only the second NHL team to lose the Cup at home in Game 7. The Red Wings began the 2009‚Äì10 NHL season in Stockholm, Sweden, falling in both games to the St. Louis Blues by scores of 4‚Äì3 and 5‚Äì3, respectively. They were plagued by injuries throughout the season and lost the second most man-games to injury, with only the last place Edmonton Oilers losing more. The beginning of the season was a struggle for the Wings, with key players out of the lineup including Henrik Zetterberg, Tomas Holmstrom, Johan Franzen, Valtteri Filppula and Niklas Kronwall. After the Olympic break, Detroit posted a record of 13‚Äì2‚Äì2 and earned 28 points, the most by any team in the NHL in the month of March. This run helped them secure the fifth playoff seed in the Western Conference. Detroit won their first- round playoff series over the Phoenix Coyotes in seven games. In the second round, they fell behind the San Jose Sharks three games to one, before being knocked out of the playoffs in five games. All four games that the Red Wings lost that series were decided by one goal. The lone game that they won ended with a final score of 7‚Äì1. Henrik Zetterberg in January 2010. The Red Wings struggled to begin the 2009-10 season, with key players like Zetterberg injured. A healthier Red Wings team finished the 2010‚Äì11 NHL season with a 47‚Äì25‚Äì10 record and 104 points to win the Central Division title. They earned the #3 seed in the Western Conference for the Stanley Cup playoffs (extending their professional sports record of post-season appearances to 20 seasons), finishing behind the Vancouver Canucks (117) and San Jose Sharks (105). The Wings again faced the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the playoffs, this time sweeping them 4‚Äì0‚Äîmaking them the only team in the 2011 playoffs to sweep the first round‚Äîand again moved on to play the Sharks in Round 2. After losing the first three games of the series against the Sharks, the Red Wings won three consecutive games to force a Game 7, becoming just the eighth team in NHL history to accomplish the feat (the Chicago Blackhawks became the seventh team to do so earlier in the 2011 playoffs, against Vancouver). The Red Wings lost Game 7 to the Sharks by a score of 3‚Äì2, and were eliminated. During the 2011 off-season, Red Wings defenseman Brian Rafalski retired, citing injuries as the main reason behind his decision. Detroit soon signed free agent defenseman Ian White to take his place. Long-time Red Wings Kris Draper and Chris Osgood also announced their retirement from hockey, with both soon taking positions within the club. Detroit signed goaltender Ty Conklin for his second tour of duty with the team. Tragedy struck the organization and the rest of the National Hockey League upon the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, which claimed the lives of former Red Wings assistant coach Brad McCrimmon and defenseman Ruslan Salei, who had joined the KHL team during the summer. Stefan Liv, a former Red Wings goaltending prospect, was also among the fatalities. The Red Wings then added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms with the trio's initials. On February 14, 2012, the Red Wings set the NHL record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season by winning their 21st home game with a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Dallas Stars, and on Sunday, February 19, 2012, defeated the San Jose Sharks to record their 23rd consecutive home victory, breaking the overall record previously held by the Boston Bruins over two seasons from 1929 to 1930. The Red Wings also made the NHL playoffs extending their streak of 21-straight playoff appearances as the fifth seed. They were defeated in five games by their opening-round opponent, the Nashville Predators. On Thursday, May 31, 2012, Nicklas Lidstrom retired after his 20th consecutive NHL season, and sixth year as captain of the Detroit Red Wings. Later in the off-season, fellow longtime Swedish Red Wing Tomas Holmstrom would also retire. =2013‚Äì17: The Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk era= Henrik Zetterberg was named successor to Nicklas Lidstrom as team captain. On July 1, 2012, the first day of the NHL free agency period, the Detroit Red Wings signed Swiss forward Damien Brunner to a one-year, entry-level contract; forward Jordin Tootoo to a three-year, $5.7 million contract; and goaltender Jonas Gustavsson to a two-year, $3 million deal. Zetterberg was named as the Red Wings team captain in 2013. The team won their final four games of the 2012‚Äì13 season to earn the seventh seed of the playoffs. The Red Wings' 3‚Äì0 victory over the Dallas Stars on April 27, 2013, clinched a playoff appearance; had they lost the game in regulation, they would have missed the playoffs by one point. Detroit's win preserved their streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances, extending their North American professional sports franchise record. As the seventh seed in the 2013 playoffs, the Red Wings faced the second-seeded Anaheim Ducks. The Wings survived a fierce battle that included four overtime games, winning the series 4‚Äì3 after a 3‚Äì2 Game 7 victory in Anaheim. The next round pitted the Red Wings against the top-seeded and eventual Stanley cup winners Chicago, and also went seven games. On May 29, the Wings were eliminated from the playoffs in a 2‚Äì1 overtime loss to the 'Hawks in Game 7. On July 5, 2013, the Red Wings signed long time Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson to a one-year contract and long time Florida Panther Stephen Weiss to a five-year contract. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. On News Years Day 2014, the Red Wings hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs at Michigan Stadium for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic. The following game set an NHL attendance record, with 105,491 in attendance for the game. On April 9, 2014, the Red Wings clinched their 23rd consecutive playoff appearance, though they were eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins in five games. In January 2014, the Red Wings hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic. On April 9, 2015, after the 2014‚Äì15 regular season, the Red Wings clinched their 24th consecutive playoff appearance, thus extending the longest streak in the four major North American sports. The team, however, was eliminated in the first round by the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games. Head coach Mike Babcock, concluding the final year of his contract, left the Red Wings and became coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Dylan Larkin signed a contract with the Red Wings the day after. Jeff Blashill, head coach of the Red Wings' top farm club, the Grand Rapids Griffins, was named his successor on June 9. During the 2015‚Äì16 season, the Detroit Red Wings extended their North American major sports playoff streak to 25 seasons; they would be eliminated in the first round by the Lightning for the second consecutive season, in five games. On February 10, 2017, Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch died at the age of 87. In the 2016-17 season, the Red Wings missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1989-90 season, ending their playoff streak at 25 seasons. On April 9, 2017, the Red Wings beat the New Jersey Devils 4‚Äì1 in the final game played at Joe Louis Arena. Riley Sheahan scored his only two goals of the season in that game. =2017‚Äìpresent= Interior of Little Caesars Arena in September 2017, a month before the Red Wings begin regular season play in the arena. The Red Wings played their first regular season game at Little Caesars Arena on October 5, 2017, winning 4‚Äì2 over the Minnesota Wild. The Red Wings finished the 2017‚Äì18 season with a 30‚Äì39‚Äì13 record. They missed the playoffs for the second season in a row, marking the first time since the early 1980s the team missed the playoffs in consecutive years. The Red Wings finished the 2018‚Äì19 season with a 32‚Äì40‚Äì10 record, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive season. On April 19, 2019, the Red Wings announced that Steve Yzerman would rejoin the team as general manager and executive vice president.

In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the \\"female\\" or \\"male\\". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails, earthworms, and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites. Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word intersex has come into usage for humans, since the word hermaphrodite is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing, as well as \\"scientifically specious and clinically problematic.\\" A rough estimate of the number of hermaphroditic animal species is 65,000. The percentage of animal species that are hermaphroditic is about 5%. (Although the current estimated total number of animal species is about 7.7 million, the study, which estimated the number, 65,000, used an estimated total number of animal species, 1,211,577 from \\"Classification phylog√©n√©tique du vivant (Vol. 2)\\" - Lecointre and Le Guyader (2001)). Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self- fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals is similar to that of plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants. Etymology The term derives from the , from , which derives from Hermaphroditus (·ºôœÅŒºŒ±œÜœÅœåŒ¥ŒπœÑŒøœÇ), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with the nymph Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of male and female sexes;Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV: The story of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis. according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus, he was born with a physical body combining male and female sexes. The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon as early as the late fourteenth century.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edn, s.v. hermaphrodite, n. and adj.; Alexander ab Alexandro stated, using the term hermaphrodite, that the people who bore the sexes of both man and woman were regarded by the Athenians and the Romans as monsters, and thrown into the sea at Athens and into the Tiber at Rome. Zoology=Sequential hermaphrodites= Shells of Crepidula fornicata (common slipper shell) Clownfish are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes a female.Most species of parrotfish start life as females and later change into males. Sequential hermaphrodites (dichogamy) occur in species in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex. This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female genitalia. Sequential hermaphroditism is common in fish (particularly teleost fish) and many gastropods (such as the common slipper shell), and some flowering plants. Sequential hermaphrodites can only change sex once. Sequential hermaphroditism can best be understood in terms of behavioral ecology and evolutionary life history theory, as described in the size-advantage mode first proposed by Michael T. Ghiselin which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex. Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories: * Protandry: Where an organism is born as a male, and then changes sex to a female. ** Example: The clownfish (genus Amphiprion) are colorful reef fish found living in symbiosis with sea anemones. Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to natural selection. * Protogyny: Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male. ** Example: wrasses (Family Labridae) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group. *Bidirectional Sex Changers: where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life. **Example: Lythrypnus dalli (Family Lythrypnus) are a group of coral reef fish in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male. Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, groupers are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often aquacultured. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the broodstock are extremely valuable individuals. =Simultaneous hermaphrodites= Turbellarians mating by penis fencing. Each has two penises on the undersides of their heads which they use to inject sperm.Earthworms are simultaneous hermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs. A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time. Self- fertilization often occurs. * Reproductive system of gastropods: Pulmonate land snails and land slugs are perhaps the best-known kind of simultaneous hermaphrodite, and are the most widespread of terrestrial animals possessing this sexual polymorphism. Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via spermatophore, which can then be stored in the spermatheca. After exchange of spermatozoa, both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn. *:Banana slugs are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's radula), see apophallation. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation. * The species of colourful sea slugs Goniobranchus reticulatus is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation. After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours. * Hamlets, unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self- fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights. * Earthworms are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange gametes, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground. * The free-living hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%. * The mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is a species of fish that lives along the east coast of North, Central and South America. These fish are simultaneous hermaphrodites. K. marmoratus produces eggs and sperm by meiosis and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization. Each individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish's body.Sakakura, Y., Soyano, K., Noakes, D.L.G. & Hagiwara, A. (2006). Gonadal morphology in the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus. Ichthyological Research, Vol. 53, pp. 427-430 =Pseudohermaphroditism= When spotted hyenas were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The apparent penis in female spotted hyenas is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal. It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until sexual maturity, when they may become pregnant. When a female spotted hyena gives birth, they pass the cub through the cervix internally, but then pass it out through the elongated clitoris. Humans Hermaphroditus, the \\"son\\" of the Greek god Hermes and the goddess Aphrodite, origin of the word \\"hermaphrodite\\" The Obando Fertility Rites in the Philippines, before becoming a Catholic festival, was initially an Anitist ritual dedicated to the hermaphrodite deity, Lakapati, who presided over fertility. Nadar of an intersex person displaying genitalia, one of a nine- part series. The series may be the earliest medical photographic documentation of intersex. Hermaphrodite is used in older literature to describe any person whose physical characteristics do not neatly fit male or female classifications, but some people advocate to replace the term with intersex. Intersex describes a wide variety of combinations of what are considered male and female biology. Intersex biology may include, for example, ambiguous- looking external genitalia, karyotypes that include mixed XX and XY chromosome pairs (46XX/46XY, 46XX/47XXY or 45X/XY mosaic). Clinically, medicine currently describes intersex people as having disorders of sex development, a term vigorously contested. This is particularly because of a relationship between medical terminology and medical intervention. Intersex civil society organizations, and many human rights institutions, have criticized medical interventions designed to make intersex bodies more typically male or female. Some people who are intersex, such as some of those with androgen insensitivity syndrome, outwardly appear completely female or male, frequently without realizing they are intersex. Other kinds of intersex conditions are identified immediately at birth because those with the condition have a sexual organ larger than a clitoris and smaller than a penis. Some humans were historically termed true hermaphrodites if their gonadal tissue contained both testicular and ovarian tissue, or pseudohermaphrodites if their external appearance (phenotype) differed from sex expected from internal gonads. This language has fallen out of favor due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the terms, and also a shift to nomenclature based on genetics. Intersex is in some caused by unusual sex hormones; the unusual hormones may be caused by an atypical set of sex chromosomes. One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X chromosome and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues). Thus, testicular and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual. Fetuses before sexual differentiation are sometimes described as female by doctors explaining the process. This is technically not true. Before this stage, humans are simply undifferentiated and possess a M√ºllerian duct, a Wolffian duct, and a genital tubercle. Botany Hylocereus undatus, a hermaphrodite plant with both carpels and stamens. Hermaphrodite is used in botany to describe a flower that has both staminate (male, pollen-producing) and carpellate (female, ovule-producing) parts. This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual‚Äîsuch plants are called monoecious. Monoecy is especially common in conifers, but occurs in only about 7% of angiosperm species. The condition also occurs in some algae.Newton, L. 1931 A Handbook of the British Seaweeds. British Museum, London p.225 In addition, some plants can change their sex throughout their lifetime. This process is called Sequential hermaphroditism. In fiction Hermaphroditic life forms in fiction include the Hutts in Star Wars (as elaborated in spin-off novels), Hermats in Peter David's Star Trek: New Frontier series, and Asari in the Mass Effect game. The Trill symbionts in Star Trek are also notable as a species that melds with hosts of either sex.

Angel Island is an island in San Francisco Bay. It is currently a State Park administered by California State Parks and a California Historical Landmark. The island was originally a fishing and hunting site for Coastal Miwok Indians, then it was a haven for Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala. Later, it was developed as a cattle ranch, then, starting with the Civil War, the island served as a U.S. Army post. During the island's Immigration Station period, the island held hundreds of thousands of immigrants, the majority from China, Japan, India, Mexico and the Philippines. The detention facility was considered ideal because of its isolated location, making it very easy to control immigrants, contain outbreaks of disease, and enforce the new immigration laws. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the title Angel Island, U.S. Immigration Station, and is a National Historic Landmark. The station is open to the public as a museum ‚Äì \\"a place for reflection and discovery of our shared history as a nation of immigrants\\". History thumb thumb The reconstructed detention center located at the Angel Island Immigration Station. In 1850 President Fillmore declared Angel Island, the second largest island in San Francisco Bay, to be a military reserve. Indeed, during the Civil War, the island was fortified to defend San Francisco Bay from possible attack by Confederate forces. In the 19th century, new arrivals to the U.S. entering at the Port of San Francisco were housed and processed in quarters located at the Pacific Mail Steamship Company docks on the San Francisco waterfront. After the quarters at the docks proved inadequate and unsanitary, a study, authorized in 1904, recommended building a new immigration station on the isolated and nearby Angel Island. In 1905, the War Department transferred 20 acres of land on the north shore of the island, facing away from San Francisco, to the Department of Labor and Commerce as the site for the new immigration station. Architect Walter J. Mathews designed the station compound to include an enclosed detention center with an outdoor area and guard tower as well as an administration building, hospital, powerhouse and wharf, which was later known as China Cove. Angel Island Immigration Station, sometimes known as \\"Ellis Island of the West,\\" began construction in 1905 and opened January 21, 1910. The main difference between Ellis Island and Angel Island was that the majority of the immigrants that traveled through Angel Island were from Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and India. The facility was created to monitor the flow of Chinese immigrants entering the country after the implementation of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The Act only allowed entrance to merchants, clergy, diplomats, teachers, and students, barring laborers. The Act did give the government an idea of how to begin to regulate immigration, and realize the potential effect of immigration on the economy. At Ellis Island, only between one and three percent of all arriving immigrants were rejected; at Angel Island, the number was about 18%.Howard Markel and Alexandra Minna Stern, \\"Which Face? Whose Nation?\\" American Behavioral Scientist 42, no. 9 (June/July 1999): 1318; Roger Daniels, \\"No Lamps Were Lit for Them: Angel Island and the Historiography of Asian American Immigration,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 17, no. 1 (Fall 1997). The Chinese were targeted due to the large influx of immigrants that were arriving in the United States. Chinese immigrants were seen as a threat because they occupied low-wage jobs, and after the economic downturn during the 1870s, Americans experienced serious unemployment problems. This resulted in increased discrimination against the Chinese, who were labeled as unsuitable due to their appearance and social status. The detention center was opened in 1910, after a series of laws were enacted which significantly restricted Chinese immigration. Immigrants arrived from 84 different countries, with Chinese immigrants accounting for the largest ethnic group to enter San Francisco until 1915 when Japanese immigrants outnumbered the Chinese for the first time. =1910‚Äì1940: Process= The length of time immigrants spent detained varied depending on how long the interrogation process lasted. For some it was only a few days and for others it lasted for months, the longest recorded stay being 22 months. This was significantly different from Ellis Island which had more relaxed regulation, and allowed many immigrants to enter the United States on the day of their arrival. Interrogations were extended because of the racial discrimination against Asians that was prevalent at the time. Chinese immigrants, mostly males, claimed to be sons of Chinese individuals who were American citizensÔºåas Chinese's response to Chinese Exclusion Act. Since children of citizens are also considered U.S. citizens, regardless of where they are born, it is illegal to deny them entry if they can prove their familial relationship. Immigrants falsely claiming familial ties became known as \\"paper sons\\" or \\"paper daughters\\". Some American citizens of Chinese descent participated in immigration fraud as purported parents in return for money, or to help other people of the same ethnicity. As a result, an extensive and grueling interrogation process was made to weed out the people for making fraudulent claims. The applicant would then be called before a Board of Special Inquiry, composed of two immigrant inspectors, a stenographer, and, if needed, a translator. Over the course of a few hours or days, the individual would be grilled with specific questions that only the real applicants would know about, for instance, their family history, location of the village, their homes and so on. However, a way around these questions was preparing them months in advance with their sponsors and memorizing the answers. To ensure that the applicant was telling the truth, witnesses from the United States, who were often other family members, were called in to corroborate the applicants story. The \\"family members\\" sometimes lived across the country, which extended the process since their testimony had to be verified before proceeding. If there was any doubt that the applicant was lying then the questioning process was prolonged and if deviation was suspected from the testimony presented by the witnesses, then the applicant and the rest of the family would be in jeopardy of deportation. Some applicants appealed the decision of the Board, resulting in a prolonged stay at the detention center because the appeal process was so long and tedious. Additionally, the length of stay varied depending on what country the individual was coming from. Japanese immigrants often held documentation from government officials that expedited the process of entering the country. This resulted in the majority of detainees being Chinese since they had no alternative but to endure the questioning. Since the goal of Angel Island was to deport as many Chinese immigrants as possible, the whole process was much more intrusive and demanding for the Chinese compared to other applicants. =After 1940= Plaques in memory of Asian immigrants who were retained and interrogated in Angel Island. The detention center was in operation for thirty years; however, there were many concerns about sanitation and for the safety of the immigrants at Angel Island. The safety concern was proved to be warranted, when, in 1940, fire destroyed the administration building and women's quarters. As a result, all the immigrants were relocated to a landlocked facility in San Francisco and the former Immigration Station was returned to the U.S. Army. During World War II it served as a prisoner of war processing center. In 1943, Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. After the war, the Army decommissioned the military installations, reduced its presence on the island, and left the former Immigration Station to deteriorate. It wasn't until 1963 that the island, including the detention facility, was converted to a state park. The buildings were set for demolition, but were spared after, in 1970, Ranger Alexander Weiss discovered, partially obscured by layers of paint, Chinese poetry carved on the wooden walls of the men's barrack. \\"These poems carved into the walls remain as a memorial to all of those who passed through the island's harsh detention barracks on their journey to a new life in the U.S.\\" Today, more than 200 poems have been recovered and restored, and all but the detention centers are currently available to the public. Of the approximately one million immigrants who were processed at the Angel Island Immigration Station, roughly 175,000 were Chinese and 117,000 were Japanese. Between 75 and 82 percent entered America successfully. Immigrant perspectives Detained Chinese immigrants carved poems into the wooden walls of the immigration station The predominantly Chinese immigrants who were detained at Angel Island were not welcomed in the United States. As recounted by one detained in 1940: \\"When we arrived, they locked us up like criminals in compartments like the cages at the zoo.\\" Held in these \\"cages\\" for weeks, often months, individuals were subjected to rounds of long and stressful interrogations to assess the legitimacy of their immigration applications. Immigrants were made to recall minute details of their lives. On occasion, translators may have not have spoken the particular dialect of the immigrant competently; most Chinese immigrants were from southern China at that time, many spoke Cantonese. It was difficult to pass the interrogations, and cases were appealed many times over before one could leave the island and enter the United States. Often, successful immigrants produced elaborate instruction manuals that coached fellow detainees in passing interrogations; if anyone was caught with these manuals, they would most likely be deported. Those that failed these tests often feared the shame of returning to China, and some would commit suicide - either before leaving and or on the voyage back to their homeland.Yu, Connie Young. \\"Rediscovered Voices: Chinese Immigrants and Angel Island.\\" Amerasia Journal Vol. 4, No. 2 (1977), pp. 131. Many of the detainees turned to poetry as expression, spilling their emotions onto the very walls that contained them. Many of these poems were written in pencil and ink, or in brush, and then carved into the wooden walls or floors.Lai, Him Mark, Genny Lim, and Judy Yung.

Childhood and Youth Boettner was the son of Alfred Boettner (German) and Mar√≠a Victoria Gautier (French). While young he was sent to Germany to study in primary and secondary school. He studied medicine at the University of Jena, Hamburg and later in Buenos Aires, where he graduated in 1926. Medicine He was a man with sharp mind and intense spiritual sensibility and that made him outstand in his professional life. He started to practice medicine as a professor of Infectious Diseases in the Faculty of Medicine in the Mu√±iz Hospital in Buenos Aires. In 1929 he moved to Asunci√≥n, with the intention of dedicating fully to his specially, ‚Äútuberculosis‚Äù, at the time that disease was a great problem, it affected a big part of the population, plus there were just a few drugs that could serve to treat it and the use of X-rays was still very restricted. The campaign against the tuberculosis had a great impulse with him in charge. In a beginning he was Director of the Tuberculosis Clinic. Later he was Director of the ‚ÄúFight against Tuberculosis‚Äù, which with time became a department in the Public Health Ministry. He was professor of the Faculty of Medicine of Asunci√≥n, teaching about Tuberculosis, until 1941. Short time after arriving in Paraguay, Doctor Boettner published several valuable studies about medicine. In 1930 he published his work about ‚ÄúEvolution of Tuberculosis‚Äù, ‚ÄúStudy of the Vertebral Spine‚Äù, ‚ÄúCongenital Malformations of the Respiratory System‚Äù, ‚ÄúRespiratory Pathology‚Äù, ‚ÄúManual about Tuberculosis‚Äù in 1939, ‚ÄúSilicosis in Paraguay‚Äù, ‚ÄúGreek and Latin Etymology for Medical uses‚Äù in 1945. In 1945 he inaugurated the ‚ÄúSanatorio Bella Vista‚Äù (Hospital Bella Vista), built by his own impulse and destined to the medical attention of people with pulmonary diseases. In this institution many renowned specialist in thorax surgery were educated. Today it is an important hospital located in the Venezuela Street, in Asunci√≥n and it‚Äôs named ‚ÄúHospital Juan Max Boettner‚Äù. He was founder and the first president of the Paraguayan Circle of Medical Doctors. When the Chaco War started he presented himself and offered his services to the country. He was appointed 2nd Lieutenant and he took charge of the X-Ray Department in the Military Hospital of Asunci√≥n. He was also sent to Isla Po√≠, where he was promoted. Later he also served in the 2nd Body of the Army in Fort√≠n Camacho, nowadays called Mariscal Estigarribia. In 1935 he became captain of the Health Department. Justo Pastor Ben√≠tez, in 1947, recalls the names of Juan Max and Ricardo Boettner, both Medical Doctors as scientists of a new generation that stood out among others because of their work and the dedication to educate. Music His name acquired even more importance when his first musical arrangements were known. As a great piano player and composer he left many samples of his delicate interpretation of folkloric and also classical music. His musical work was rich in motivation. Among others, he composed in 1957 ‚ÄúHimno Nacional‚Äù, ‚ÄúDanzas Tradicionales del Paraguay‚Äù and ‚ÄúM√∫sica y m√∫sicos del Paraguay‚Äù and one didactic play called ‚ÄúC√≥mo reconocer el estilo y el autor de una obra musical‚Äù; ‚ÄúFantas√≠a esclava‚Äù, ‚ÄúSinfon√≠a en Mi Menor‚Äù, ‚ÄúEl alma del inca‚Äù, ‚ÄúYrendague‚Äù, ‚ÄúSinfon√≠a Paraguaya‚Äù and ‚ÄúCanciones folkl√≥ricas paraguayas‚Äù.

It is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dyskinesia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, negative symptoms of psychosis, and agitation and aggression in the elderly. A derivative of benzamide, tiapride is chemically and functionally similar to other benzamide antipsychotics such as sulpiride and amisulpride known for their dopamine antagonist effects. Medical uses=Alcoholism= Research in animal models and clinical studies in alcoholic patients have found that tiapride has anxiolytic effects. Dopamine hyperactivity has been linked with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), suggesting that tiapride's antidopaminergic effects are the most likely mechanism for its clinical efficacy, although others believe some other mechanism might be involved. Alcoholic patients treated with tiapride at a dosage of 300 mg/day reported reduced psychological distress and improved abstinence from alcohol. In another study in which alcoholic patients were given titrated doses up to 800 mg/day, subjects showed significant improvements in ratings of withdrawal, craving, psychiatric symptoms and quality of life. While tiapride does not affect positive symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinosis or delirium sometimes manifested in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, if combined with a drug such as carbamazepine that addresses those symptoms, it is ideal for treating alcohol dependency because its metabolism does not depend on liver function and it has low potential for abuse. This sets it apart from the benzodiazepines, which are contraindicated with alcohol and can be addictive. Moreover, tiapride's rapid onset makes intravenous or intramuscular injection prior to or during withdrawal episodes particularly effective. =Agitation and aggression= Agitation and aggression are also associated with hyperdopaminergic activity. Antipsychotic drugs are the most common treatment for these symptoms, but often come with a host of side-effects including orthostatic hypotension and deficits in vigilance and attention. One clinical study in agitated elderly patients compared the effects of tiapride, haloperidol and placebo and found that while the two drugs had comparable efficacy superior to the placebo effect, tiapride had fewer and less severe side effects than haloperidol. Tiapride's selectivity for the limbic system, which is associated with emotion, could underlie its particular efficacy in treating these affective disorders. Moreover, its selectivity for the dopaminergic system is thought to account for its avoidance of the side effects typically associated with other neuroleptic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, which act on a number of neurotransmitter systems. =Movement disorders= While tiapride preferentially targets the limbic system over the striatum, its moderate antagonistic effect on striatal dopamine receptors makes it effective in treating motor deficits that involve this area, such as tardive dyskinesia and chorea. Tiapride's moderate efficacy at D2 receptors may explain why it is able to treat motor symptoms without the extrapyramidal symptoms caused by excess dopamine blockage, which are sometimes seen in haloperidol or chlorpromazine. One clinical study of patients with tardive dyskinesia associated with Parkinson's disease found that tiapride significantly improved motor abilities without affecting other parkinsonian symptoms. Side effects Although it is considered a \\"safe\\" medicine, it is, like sulpiride, strictly contraindicated for patients under the age of 18 due to its effects during the process of puberty. This is likely related to its side effects on levels of the hormone prolactin, which is involved in sexual development. There are also insufficient clinical data on the other side effects in adolescents. Tiapride has been found to cause excess prolactin levels in plasma, which can cause decreased libido, infertility and increased risk of breast cancer. This is because dopamine plays a primary role in regulating prolactin release by binding to D2 receptors on prolactin-secreting cells in the anterior pituitary. Thus, when tiapride blocks these receptors these cells are disinhibited and release more prolactin. The side-effect reported most commonly to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by muscle tissue breakdown. Cardiac abnormalities such as prolongation of the QT interval and torsades de pointes have also been observed. Dosages above approximately 300 mg/day risk inducing tardive dyskinesia. However, given the drug's fairly wide window of tolerable doses, dosages can often be titrated to obtain the desired effect without bringing about motor deficits. In general, tiapride is considered an atypical antipsychotic because of its low risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, such as akinesia and akathesia. These effects are thought to be reduced in tiapride relative to typical antipsychotics because of its selectivity for the limbic system over extrapyramidal areas that control movement. Pharmacodynamics Tiapride is a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is more selective than other neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol and risperidone, which not only target four of the five known dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-4), but also block serotonin (5-HT2A, 2C), Œ±1 and Œ±2-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. Compared to these drugs, tiapride has a relatively moderate affinity for its target receptors, displacing 50 percent of 3H-raclopride binding at a concentration of 320 nM at D2 receptors and a concentration of 180 nM at D3 receptors. Tiapride displays a relatively high regional selectivity for limbic areas. One study found that, in contrast with haloperidol, which displays equal affinity for receptors in the rat limbic system and striatum, tiapride shows over three times as much affinity for limbic areas than striatal areas. Another study in rats found tiapride's affinity for the septum, a limbic region, to be over thirty times as high as for the striatum. Efficacy at the D2 receptor is moderate, with 80 percent of receptors occupied even in the presence of excess tiapride concentrations. Pharmacokinetics Tiapride is primarily taken orally in the form of a tablet, but can also be administered via intravenous or intramuscular injection. A liquid oral formulation is also available for elderly patients with difficulty chewing solids. For all three methods of administration, the bioavailability of tiapride is approximately 75 percent. Peak plasma concentrations are attained between 0.4 and 1.5 hours following administration, and steady-state concentrations achieved 24 to 48 hours after beginning administration 3 times a day. It distributes rapidly and exhibits virtually no binding to plasma proteins, giving it a relatively high volume of distribution. Benzamide and its derivatives are highly water-soluble, and because of their polarity are believed to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier via carrier-mediated transport. Elimination of tiapride, mostly in its original form, occurs through renal excretion with a half-life of 3 to 4 hours. Recommended dosages of tiapride vary with clinical symptoms. In alcoholic patients, delirium or pre-delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal can be alleviated by administration of 400‚Äì1200 mg/day or up to 1800 mg/day if necessary. Tremors and other dyskinsias can be treated with 300‚Äì800 mg/day. For reducing agitation and aggression in elderly patients, 200‚Äì300 mg/day is recommended. Availability Tiapride is marketed under various trade names and is widely available outside of the United States. The most common trade name for tiapride is Tiapridal, which is used throughout Europe, Russia, as well as parts of South America, the Middle East, and North Africa. It is also sold under different names in Italy (Italprid, Sereprile), Japan (Tialaread, Tiaryl, Tiaprim, Tiaprizal), Chile (Sereprid), Germany (Tiaprid, Tiapridex), and China (Tiapride).

This was Gould's attempt to fulfill a goal of his late father, financier Jay Gould. Due to financial troubles following the Panic of 1907, the system was never completed as a fully transcontinental line. The system competed with systems similarly amalgamated and controlled by other railroad magnates including that of E. H. Harriman (who controlled the Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and B&O; lines ) and James J. Hill (who controlled Great Northern). Both Harriman and Hill were involved in the Northern Securities Company antitrust litigation during this time. Gould sought to avoid similar litigation by acquiring control of railroads that could be chained together at their endpoints to make a longer system; under Gould's plan, Missouri Pacific Railroad would become a holding company owning the other lines in the system. After the 1907 financial panic, there were rumors of a merger of the Harriman and Gould systems. But as many of the eastern roads controlled by Gould entered receivership after 1907 despite receiving investment funds from John D.

In the 1920s, Route 2 (former New England Route 7) originally left Greenfield via Turners Falls Road, crossing the old suspension bridge into the village of Turners Falls. Route 2 left Turners Falls via Millers Falls Road. In 1932, a more modern bridge capable of handling the increased automobile traffic, the French King Bridge, opened further upstream and Route 2 was relocated to its modern alignment along French King Highway.Massachusetts Highway Department, French King Bridge The former alignment through Turners Falls was designated as Route 2A. The Route 2A designation remained on Turners Falls Road until the 1960s.Topographic maps show the Route 2A still marked in 1954. A 1972 map no longer shows Route 2A through Turners Falls. The Massachusetts Highway Department started a rehabilitation project in 2010, which is, as of May 2015, almost done.MassHighway project page  See also  *List of crossings of the Connecticut River  References  * Bridge Inventory Data on NationalBridges.com  Footnotes  External links  * Image of the original Lower Suspension Bridge Bridges over the Connecticut River Montague, Massachusetts Bridges completed in 1871 Bridges completed in 1936 Bridges in Franklin County, Massachusetts Road bridges in Massachusetts Steel bridges in the United States Girder bridges in the United States ","title":"Turners Falls Road Bridge"},{"id":"18611439","text":"Nafadotride is a dopamine antagonist with reasonable selectivity for the D3 subtype (9.6 times selectivity for D3 over D2).Pilla M, Perachon S, Sautel F, Garrido F, Mann A, Wermuth CG, Schwartz JC, Everitt BJ, Sokoloff P.

Biography Kaiser was born in Portland, Oregon, on July 5, 1942, and was the grandson of shipbuilding industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. He earned a BA degree from Stanford University and an MBA degree from Harvard University. Kaiser served as a White House Fellow and as a Special Assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson, President Richard M. Nixon, and as a Special Assistant to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel. He became a Canadian citizen in 1980. He died on January 11, 2012. Denver Broncos Kaiser purchased the Broncos from the Gerald Phipps‚Äô family in February 1981. He sold his 60.8% share of the Broncos to late owner Pat Bowlen in March 1984. He then sued Bowlen for violating the original sales‚Äô agreement, which he contended granted him right of first purchase of any sale of shares in the team. Kaiser claimed Bowlen violated this agreement by offering former Broncos quarterback John Elway a 10% stake of the company that holds ownership of the team. In 2004, a jury ruled in favor of Kaiser, and a federal judge decreed that Kaiser was entitled to purchase back 10% of the Broncos using the identical purchase terms offered to Elway. Bowlen appealed the original verdict that ruled in favor of Kaiser and won the appeal, as the appellate court ruled that the structure of the Bowlen-Elway deal did not violate the original agreement. Business career Kaiser held several corporate positions during his life, including chief executive officer of Vancouver-based Kaiser Resources Ltd, the family holding company. Kaiser Resources' coal assets were sold to British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation and Ashland Oil Canada to Dome Petroleum. Kaiser served as Chairman and CEO of the Bank of British Columbia from 1984 until the bank's 1986 demise. He also served on the board of directors of several large Canadian companies. The Kaiser Foundation In 1985, Edgar Kaiser Jr. established the Kaiser Foundation. It is a North Vancouver, British Columbia-based organization established as a Canadian national organization, operated separately from other ventures of the Kaiser family, with the goal of promoting the understanding and importance of mental health and addictions as health issues. It has also established the Kaiser Mental Health and Addictions Awareness Foundation and the Aboriginal Peoples' Health Initiative.

Career One Way System's initial line-up consisted of Craig Halliday (guitar), Gavin Whyte (vocals), Tez Mcdonald (drums) and Gaz Buckley (bass). A demo of the song Jerusalem, recorded by that lineup, was later included on the A Country Fit For Heroes compilation album, released in January 1982 - Catalogue number Oi3 - which reached No. 4 in the UK Indie Charts. David Ross of Poulton-Le-Fylde band Zyklon B joined as second guitarist and in 1981 Blackpool's Lightbeat/Beat The System label released the No Entry EP: A-side Stab The Judge, B-side Riot Torn City and Me and You, featuring all 5 musicians. The first ever record released by One Way System was \\"Stab the Judge\\", financed by Craig Halliday with his grandmother's legacy on a loan basis. Although all 1,000 pressings were sold, Craig's loan to Lightbeat Records founder Barry Lights remains unpaid, and it is believed the money was used by Lights to finance releases by other bands on his label. After some early personnel changes (Tez Mcdonald joined The Fits and Craig Halliday left following a disagreement regarding a broken Gibson SG, resurfacing years later in Sick 56), the line-up settled down with Gav Whyte on vocals, Dave \\"Crabby\\" Ross on guitar, Gary Buckley on bass and Tommy Couch on drums. The Give Us A Future 7\\" was the first release (Halliday, Couch, Whyte, Ross & Buckley) (ANA1) on Cherry Red's Anagram Records in 1982. In the same year, Anagram also re-released No Entry as the Stab The Judge EP (OWS2) and the single version of Jerusalem. One Way System became Anagram Records's first signing with the release of the All Systems Go LP, following the Give Us A Future 7\\" indie chart success and the band being featured on the front cover of UK national music paper Sounds. Between 1982 and 1984, the band had five Indie Chart hit singles and two Top Ten albums. A U.S. West Coast tour alongside Circle Jerks in 1984 was abandoned when Circle Jerks vocalist Keith Morris broke his neck, although the band managed to salvage one date with Suicidal Tendencies. In 1985 Gav Whyte was replaced on vocals by Andy Gibson of Preston punk band The Genocides and the band remained signed to Anagram until they split in early 1986 with enough songs written for an unreleased third album. Tom Couch then spent two years with the U.K. Subs and has since been voted one of the best punk drummers of all time. One Way System was resurrected in 1995 with Gavin Whyte returning after Captain Oi! re-released All Systems Go and Writing On The Wall in CD format. Gaz Buckley left the band to be replaced by Dave Brown for a ten date European Tour. Brown was replaced in turn by Andy Wilkinson and, in 1996, Cleopatra issued a Best Of collection. In 1996, whilst working on a new album, Gavin Whyte left the band and was replaced by longtime fan Lee Havok (real name Lee Pinkney) and it was with this line-up that undertook a tour of Japan. A new CD, Waiting For Zero was released through GMM in 1998 and Cherry Red released a Singles Collection in 2003. The 2005 various artists compilation CD Give Us A Future (The History Of Anagram Records 1982-1987) took its name from the One Way System single of that name. More recently, White South African Lee Havok was replaced by ukNige (ex of Pink Torpedoes and, with OWS founder member Craig Halliday, Sick 56) on vocals and ukNige was then replaced by Jay Susel. In 2011, Couch and Wilkinson, while remaining in One Way System, joined singer Dunk Rock (UFX) and guitarist Tony Mitchell (Kiss of The Gypsy) in gothic psychobilly band Boneyard Zombies, releasing the Death Rattle and Roll album in 2012. Both bands appeared at the 2012 Rebellion Festival in Blackpool. The band toured the U.S. West Coast in 2013. Gaz Buckley is currently in Aussie punk band The Terraces.

This castle has been home to the family of the marquis de GoulaineMarcis de Goulaine was living in 1130, but the genealogy begin with Jean, mentioned in 1149; his son, Mathieu, Jean II de Goulaine, 14th century obtained the right to hold a fair on St Martin's Day (Nicolas Viton de Saint-Allais, Nobiliaire universel de France ou Recueil g√©n√©ral des g√©n√©alogies ..., 1816, vol. 7); seigneurie of Goulaine erected as a marquisate for Gabriel de Goulaine (husband of Marguerite de Bretagne) by Henri IV, 1621 (Saint-Allais Fran√ßois-Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye des Bois, Dictionnaire de la Noblesse, s.v. \\"Goulaine\\" 2nd ed. 1774, vol. 7, p. 338. for over a thousand years.F.

History Arms of Goulaine, impaling England and France In the 12th century, when the Duchy of Brittany was independent, the first Goulaine, Jean de Goulaine, then captain of the city of Nantes, fortified the estate, which is still surrounded by marshes, to defend against attacks from Normans.The Goulaine coat-of-arms, parting England and France, accompanied by the motto, \\"De cettuy-cy, de cettuy-l√†, j'accorde les couronnes,\\"‚Äî \\"Of this one and that I award the crowns\\"‚Äî is recorded in Pol Potier de Courcy, Nobiliaire et Armorial de Bretagne, who records that Jean de Goulaine, Captain of Nantes, was sent by Geoffroy, duke of Brittany, to arrange peace between Henry II of England and Philip Augustus of France in 1180, occasioning the arms and motto carried by the Goulaine since; see also Saint-Allais 1816. The Goulaine were of the old nobility, recorded in the Seventh Crusade (1248). During the Wars of Religion, the Goulaine fought for the Catholic League: Gabriel, sieur de Goulaine, at the head of fifty lancers, and his brother Jean, baron du Faou√´t, took the ch√¢teaux of Trogoff (Plouescat) and of K√©rouz√©r√© (Sibiril) in 1590.Montifault, \\"Notice sur les seigneuries de Trogoff\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du Finist√®re vol. 1-2 (1873-74) p. 81 note 19. Gabriel was attached to the Bourbon cause in being made a marquis by Henry IV of France. The Goulaine family ownership of the estate continued uninterrupted until 1788 when it was sold to a Dutch banker. This circumstance helped save the ch√¢teau from destruction during the French Revolution. In 1858, a member of the Goulaine family reacquired the estate and maintains it today. Wines While it is not clear exactly when the estate vineyard started producing wine for commercial use, rather than just family consumption, the millennium during which the estate of Ch√¢teau de Goulaine has been producing wine makes it the oldest known wine business still in existence;G. Harding A Wine Miscellany pg 13, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 It is believed to be the third oldest commercial enterprise in the world.\\"The 100 Oldest Companies in the World\\" accessed 8 January 2010 It is considered the oldest European family owned business. Europe Intelligence Wire \\"The world's oldest family companies\\" Hull Daily Mail, January 10, 2007 The castle estate is one of the last Ch√¢teaux de la Loire to still be producing wine. In addition to producing a Muscadet, Ch√¢teau de Goulaine also produces a Sancerre and Vouvray as well as what is believed to be the first commercial Chardonnay in the western Loire Valley. The estate also grows some Folle blanche. Architecture of the ch√¢teau Today the style of the ch√¢teau, under its high pitched slate roofs bears some comparison to the central Loire estates of Ch√¢teau de Blois and Ch√¢teau de Chambord, though Ch√¢teau de Goulaine was built much earlier and in a more conservative style. The butterflies aviary Since 1984, hundreds of tropical butterflies are showcased in an aviary, flying freely among tropical plants. This project was initiated by Marquis Robert de Goulaine (1933-2010) himself. LU's Museum In the older stables, you can visit the LU Museum.

(1945‚Äì1960) was a manufacturer of small garden tractors and other agricultural equipment founded by Herbert C. Roths in Alma, Michigan. The company manufactured Garden King Walking Tractors, BesRo Riding Tractors, and Till Ro Stalk Cutters. History Herbert Carl Roths was born in Edna, Iowa in 1902 and died in St. Louis, Michigan in 1978. At the time of his first patent Herbert Roths was a resident of Alpena, Michigan and the company was in the early stages of startup. With the submission of the second patent, the late Roths had settled into Alma, in Gratiot County, Michigan. Roths Garden Tractor Patent No. D157432 on December 19, 1946 The first patent (D146,947) was applied for by Herbert C. Roths on August 24, 1945 for the design of an ornamental tractor. This patent was awarded on June 17, 1947. At the time of the second patent (D157,432), Herbert C. Roths was an assignor to Roths Industries Inc., Alma, Michigan. The patent was applied for on December 19, 1946 and awarded on February 21, 1950. The second patent was a garden tractor design which would later become the Roths Garden King walking tractor. The first production Garden King walking tractors were sold in late 1945. Over the next few years variations built from the Garden King's parts would become available. The Roths Model-G and BesRo would borrow many production parts from the Garden King, one of which being the transmission. The company was still producing the Terrier Tractor, Country Boy and Little Jeff riding tractors as late as 1960. Herbert Roths had two patents issued in 1970 and 1973 for a transplanting loader and transplanting machine. Products=Model W - Garden King= The Roths Garden King-Model W is a self-propelled two-wheel tractor which was introduced sometime around 1945. The number of units produced remains unknown. According to a March 15, 1949 part list, the 6 H.P. standard Garden King walking tractor and reverse drive with 6x12 tires had a domestic shipping weight of , a net weight of , and a list price of $375.00. Later in 1954 this tractor was listed as $345.00. These tractors may have been sold or licensed to a distributing company in 1946/1947, by the name of General Implement. General Implement sold the Garden King labeled as the GI garden tractor. This may have been a marketing strategy of Roths Industries to reach out to the national agricultural market. :Type: Two Wheel Walking Tractor with Steeromatic Control.

This new design came equipped with a new type ratchet differential drive based on the original Model W differential. By 1950 the tractor had become known as the Model G. To steer this type of tractor, the operator did not have to overcome the power in the drive wheels because of the differential design.

According to a December 18, 1947 advertisement, the new Columbia III Planter was a power-agitated attachment which had two adjustable opening shoes. The fertilizer was sowed in two bands with the seeds planted in-between the fertilizer bands. Roths Industries stated that this eliminated the danger of damaging the seeds during germination. The planter accurately planted all types of seeds from the smallest flower seed to the largest seed, including Spanish Peanuts in the shell. Any desired seed spacing could be obtained. Roths Industries also had special seed cylinders that could be furnished to suit a wide range of requirements. According to a March 15, 1949 part list, the Columbia III Planter with Fertilizer Attachment: Push Type Model and Tractor Mounted, both had a domestic shipping weight of , a net weight of , and a list price of $47.50. Also a Furrow Marker was available for the planter (required for Tractor Mounted use) which had a domestic shipping weight of , a net weight of , and a list price of $8.00. =Model W & Model R - BesRo= An optional steering assembly with a sulky seat and wheels was available in 1949 to convert the Model W transmission into a riding unit. The BesRo tractor utilized a similar transmission and drive unit as the Model-W Garden King. The idea of the Model W BesRo was developed from Herbert Roths design of an ornamental tractor patent(D146,947). This original tricycle design was known as the BesRo Model W and was precursor to the BesRo Model R. The Model R BesRo used four wheels with the drive unit mounted in the rear. The riding frame was attached to the front of the transmission. The BesRo tractor was phased out of production by the mid-1950s and replaced with the Roths Country Boy. :Type: Three wheel tricycleRoths Industries - The Besro - sales brochure :Weight: 830 lbs :Drive Wheel Tire Size: 6.00x12 Traction Type :Engine: 6 HP Gas Burning Special order for burning No. 1 fuel oil of 38-42 Baume or octane rating 35 or higher. :Speeds: 3/4 to 4 M.P.H. 1 Speed Forward :Reverse: Same rate as forward speed. :Overall Length: 90 inches :Wheel Base: 53 inches :Clearance: One row passing through center of tractor 16 inches.

In 1961 Jeannette Outhey was the first New Caledonian to join the religion. On the same year, Emma and Georges Wayenece were the first melanesian couple to accept the Faith of Baha'u'llah. With other converts and pioneers, they elected the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Noum√©a in 1962. The Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of New Caledonia was elected in 1977. Multiplying its involvements through to today, the 2001 population was reported at 1,070. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 955 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. First mention The first mention of New Caledonia in Bah√° º√≠ literature is in a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917 by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Written on 11 April 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 ‚Äì after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. > A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with > the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great > island groups of the Pacific Ocean‚ÄîPolynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and > the islands attached to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, > Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, > Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, > Friendly Islands, Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low > Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, > Marshall Islands, Timor and the other islands.

Early phase=Governmental policies in the area= 200px New Caledonia map from CIA World Factbook As a special member of the former Second French colonial empire today's New Caledonia has a Sui generis relationship with France. The French government oversight of the islands of French Polynesia included an immigration policy of denying non-French speakers/citizens long- term residency in French Overseas Territories. English speaking Australians Bah√° º√≠s were thus ineligible for permanent residency. Consequently, Australian Bah√° º√≠ pioneers were itinerant rather than permanent, and frequently returned to Australia or travelled between colonies when their visas expired. Access to the Loyalty Islands was even more restrictive as they were designated off- limits to all Europeans, including French citizens. =Pioneers and converts= Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, communicated about New Caledonia in several letters: 3 June 1952, 30 April 1953, 7 May 1953, 31 December 1954, 24 January 1956, 3 May 1956 and 15 February 1957, before he died in November 1957. Overall there was poor growth of the Bah√° º√≠ community in the French Overseas Territories in the period following World War II including New Caledonia which contrasted strongly with other areas of the Pacific (see, for example, Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Vietnam). In this atmosphere of restricted visits, the first pioneer to reach New Caledonia was Australia's Margaret Rowling in early 1952 followed closely by Mariette Bolton in February the same year. While visiting Noumea, Bolton went to Bourail and Voh communes. Francois Feminier is mentioned as a convert by July 1952 but may not have been a resident. In January 1955 Rowling described her experiences in New Caledonia in talks at Yerrinbool Bah√° º√≠ School in Australia. Daniel Haumont became a Bah√° º√≠ in the Society Islands in early 1955, and travelled to the Loyalty Islands in October 1955 and was named a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. A Persian family, the Sohailis, denied entrance to Australia because of Australia's White Australia policy was able to pioneer to New Caledonia in 1955. In 1958 representatives from the Bah√° º√≠ community of New Caledonia attended the 1958 intercontinental conference held in Sydney Australia. By 1959 translations in the Aji√´ language (also called Houailou) were available. In 1961 the first citizens of New Caledonia converted to the religion. Perhaps the first resident Bah√° º√≠ was Jeannette Outhey. She accepted the religion in Thio on the north side of the island on 10 June 1961. In the same year the first people from the Loyalty Islands converted to the religion ‚Äì they were a husband and wife who joined the religion in Noum√©a on the south side of the main island but whose home was on Mar√© Island. By the end of 1961 there were enough Bah√° º√≠s to form a Local Spiritual Assembly in Noum√©a with a smaller community in Thio. Outhey took part actively in 1961 in the election of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Noum√©a and served on that body for nineteen consecutive years before serving in other capacities. In 1962 Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone travelled between 3 October and 12 November with an itinerary that included Noum√©a among many stops. A regional National Spiritual Assembly had been elected in 1959 to whose annual convention a delegate from the Noum√©a spiritual assembly attended first in 1963. Jean Sevin, who was designated a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h to the Tuamotu Archipelago region, was the only French Bah√° º√≠ to pioneer in the Pacific during the Ten Year Crusade. In 1968, at the request of the Universal House of Justice, Sevin moved to New Caledonia, settling in Noum√©a. National Spiritual Assembly In 1964 the regional national assembly was divided into separate regional national assemblies with one based in Honiara, serving the South West Pacific Ocean (Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Loyalty Is, New Hebrides). Later in 1971, the Solomon Islands formed their own National Assembly and the seat of the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the South West Pacific Ocean was transferred from Honiara in the Solomon Islands to Noum√©a. The same year pioneers for Tuamotus were identified. The NSA was composed of Bah√° º√≠s from New Hebrides, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. In 1977, the National Spiritual Assembly of New Caledonia and Loyalty Islands was elected. Multiplying interests and growth Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In 1975 the assembly of Mar√© hosted a Women's Congress and the community of Noumea was visited by a Baha'√≠ traveler who shared stories of his father meeting Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the religion. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Bah√° º√≠ community in New Caledonia has participated in a number of events in New Caledonia. In 1988, and then again 1991, the Bah√° º√≠ International Community, who were meeting in New Caledonia, offered statements at the Secretariat of the Pacific Community; the statements summarized Bah√° º√≠ projects across the Pacific basin by the Bah√° º√≠s on projects related to initiatives of the United Nations (in this case Health, Education, and the Role of Women and Health and Nutrition). In 1999, New Caledonian Bah√° º√≠ were attendees of \\"Partnerships for the Next Millennium\\" international conference by the Office for the Advancement of Women of the Bah√° º√≠ community of Australia, and then in 2000 the New Caledonia Bah√° º√≠ National Women's Association was established and based in Anse Vata. In 2005, for the 80th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in Fiji the New Caledonian Bah√° º√≠ community contributed a Cook Pine in memory of those Bah√° º√≠s who have been killed in Iran (see Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s). In 2007 representatives from New Caledonia National Spiritual Assembly addressed the delegates to the national convention for the election of the national spiritual assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of New Zealand on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. =Growth= Growth by conversion had been sporadic but accelerating by the end of the 1970s. In the 1970s a number of gatherings of Bah√° º√≠s resulted in teams of people who cooperated in efforts to bring the religion to the attention of people in New Caledonia. In one nine-week period in early 1977 29 people converted to the religion; 12 being from the town of Thio alone, and three more are from the Loyalty Islands. In 1978 Meherangiz Munsiff, a Bah√° º√≠ from Great Britain, attracted publicity. In Noum√©a, Munsiff participated in a one and one-half-hour television broadcast mentioning Bah√° º√≠ teachings on the role of women which was transmitted to many places in the South Pacific. In 1979 Bah√° º√≠s sources state there were seven assemblies and 24 additional localities with at least one Bah√° º√≠, plus six assemblies and 24 localities of at least one Bah√° º√≠ in the Loyalty Islands. In the 1980s larger group dynamics began to come into play. In 1982 Bah√° º√≠s in the Loyalty Islands from Mar√© Island built a Bah√° º√≠ center for the Bah√° º√≠s of Nak√©ty of Canala province of the main island, in a traditional style ‚Äì at the dedication some 100 non-Bah√° º√≠s and village elders were moved by the act of service from one community to another. In 1986 tribal chiefs accepted news of the religion with enthusiasm when they understood that progressive revelation from a Bah√° º√≠ point of view neither negated nor condemned previous religions, and indeed their own tribal faith predicted the coming of a great \\"Peacemaker.\\" In 1990 in classes by Helen Perkins, a Bah√° º√≠ from Australia, aspects of the religion were emphasized as well as giving a chance to respond to questions of Bah√° º√≠s. She also spoke at a large gathering. Demographics A 2001 estimate for the number of Bah√° º√≠s in the country was listed at 0.50% of the national population or 1,070 individuals with an annual growth rate of +2.1% by Operation World. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 880 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 955 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

He was credited with introducing American consumers to low-cost, bargain imported wines while working with Trader Joe's.  Biography  Robert Berning was born in Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, California, on January 25, 1935. His father worked as a greenskeeper on a Santa Catalina golf course. = Early career = Berning began his career in the grocery industry at the age of 16 when he took a job at King Cole Markets in Whittier, California, in 1951. He was promoted to store supervisor at King Cole a few years afterwards. Soon he developed an interest in selling wines which had been imported from Europe. = Trader Joe's = Berning was hired by Pronto Markets, a chain of convenience stores based in Los Angeles in 1965. Pronto Markets was in the midst of its transformation from a convenience store to the Trader Joe's specialty grocery chain, which would officially be founded in 1967. Wines became a very important focus of the newly founded Trader Joe's and Berning would play a key part in that success. Joe Coulombe, the founder of Trader Joe's, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that Berning was brought into the company's main office in 1970 because he had expressed interest in wines. 1970 also coincided with the time that Trader Joe's began its \\"aggressive wine merchandising,\\" which meant that Trader Joe's began offering wines at lower prices than had been previously available in the marketplace. Berning quickly became Trader Joe's head wine buyer. He is credited with building Trader Joe's private wine label program. Berning's program offered wines from around the world under the Trader Joe's label. These wines were allowed to be sold at very inexpensive prices because of the Trader Joe's branded label. Under California law at the time, there were fair trade provisions for alcoholic beverages which made it illegal to sell wines at a cheaper price than branded competitors, such as Gallo's. Berning's program simply \\"got around\\" the alcohol fair trade laws by offering their own wines under the Trader's Joe brand, the Trader Joe's Winery label. The program was a huge success, which helped Trader Joe's stay competitive in wine retailing for eight years until the alcohol fair trade laws were abolished in 1978. Coulombe credited Berning with innovating Trader Joe's ability to buy and distribute lower-cost wines to their own stores without the use of traditional wholesalers. Trader Joe's, in turn, is credited as one of the pioneers which popularized wine in the United States. Under Berning's guidance, Trader Joe's began offering selections from small California wineries, some of which later became well-known brands themselves, including Heitz Wine Cellars, Mirassou Winery and Schramsberg. Berning traveled throughout California and the world to find wines for sale in Trader Joe's. Berning was featured in a series of radio commercials in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Berning retired from Trader Joe's in the middle of the 1990s. However, his legacy of marketing higher- quality, low-cost wines at the company continue. For example, the popularity of Charles Shaw wines, which has been nicknamed \\"Two Buck Chuck\\" for its $1.99 price. = Later life = Berning moved to Fallbrook, California, with his family following his retirement from Trader Joe's. He purchased a ranch where he grew limes and avocados. He continued to work within the wine industry as a consultant for Plume Ridge, import company based in San Dimas, California, which is owned by his daughter, Christina. He worked for the company until his illness in early 2008. Robert Berning died at his home in Fallbrook of bone cancer on July 19, 2008, at the age of 73. His wife, Nancy Anne Vigil-Berning died of cancer on October 11, 2005. He was survived by his daughters, Christina, Nanette Berning-Pate and Julia Berning-Escamilla; and his son, Craig.

He has been a significant figure in New Zealand popular music since the late 1970s. Biography Born in Auckland, Cammick, a school teacher and collector of soul music, launched Rip It Up magazine with Alastair Dougal in July 1977 as a free magazine. Initially ignored by the local record industry, the magazine quickly found favour with local bands. It struggled to survive until CBS Records came on board with a commitment to advertise in 1978. With a staff of one for many years, Cammick operated as editor, publisher, photographer and layout artist as his readership grew. His support for early New Zealand indie labels such as Propeller Records and Flying Nun Records played a huge part in their success. Extra, a short lived quarterly addition in 1980, did not survive. He launched Cha-Cha, a street style magazine edited by future Academy Awards winner Ngila Dickson, in 1983 and Shake, a pop magazine, in 1986. Over the years Rip It Up, its magazines and its take-no-prisoners approach to journalism provided a crucial training ground for many New Zealand writers and journalists. Amongst those who received their grounding there are Louise Chunn, Russell Brown, Chris Bourke and Chad Taylor. Tax problems forced Cammick to sell the group in 1994 to publisher Barry Colman (publisher of the National Business Review) but he remained as editor until 1998. In 1989 he launched the first of his record labels, Southside Records. The label released many of the earliest New Zealand hip hop recordings, including albums by the Upper Hutt Posse, Moana and the Moahunters, MC OJ & Rhythm Slave and the earliest released work of the Fuemana family (as Houseparty). Wildside Records, a rock music label, was launched in 1991. Wildside's roster included Shihad, Head Like A Hole, Rumblefish, Second Child, Hallelujah Picassos, Dead Flowers and, for a time, Bailter Space. Cammick's financial commitment, drive and belief were crucial to the later success of Shihad. A third label, Felix, was for the more pop acts signed by Cammick. His radio shows on Radio bFM (Land Of the Good Groove) from 1983 til 1993, and George FM (Soulfinger), have had a large and dedicated following. In November 2012 Land of the Good Groove returned to 95bFM and currently airs there. In 2016 he was presented with a Scroll of Honour from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand for services to New Zealand entertainment. In the 2020 New Year Honours, Cammick was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the music industry. References *Dix, J. (2005) Stranded in Paradise.

She didn't realise what it was until the series was re- broadcast on local TV, and she identified the episode as \\"A Piece of the Action\\". She became involved in a Star Trek fanzine, and wrote a story for it where the Enterprise computer falls in love with Captain Kirk. After she heard about Pocket Books accepting unsolicited manuscripts for Star Trek novels, she expanded the idea as a complication to a more serious main plot. She was between jobs at the time, and wrote the first draft of the novel in six weeks. After submitting it to the publishers, she didn't hear anything back. Murdock would chase once every six months or so and after nearly three months, she received word that they would like the manuscript to be expanded.Ayers (2006): p. 45 When she was around two thirds of the way through the expansion, Pocket Books contacted her and confirmed that they wanted to buy the novel.Ayers (2006): p. 46 Murdock was pleased with the published novel, as she felt that finished manuscript was unchanged from the expanded version she submitted to the publishers. However, they changed the title as she had been calling it We Who Are About To Die, which she preferred. She was concerned that calling the novel Web of the Romulans might confuse readers into thinking it had something to do with the episode \\"The Tholian Web\\". It had been changed because Pocket Books had another book coming out with a similar title, although Murdock suspected that they had also published several books with \\"Web\\" in the title during that year. Reception Web of the Romulans was the first original Star Trek novel to reach the US bestseller lists. In Robert Greenberger's analysis of the novelizations of Star Trek for Starlog, he described Web of the Romulans as an \\"interesting examination\\" of the Romulan culture and empire. He called the computer love subplot \\"silly\\", but overall called it a \\"well-done and well-conceived novel\\". Ken Ramstead reviewed Web of the Romulans in Ares Magazine #17 and commented that \\"Web makes for good reading. The author has skillfully blended just the right amounts of humor and drama together to create a mixture that will hold any Trekkie's attention - at least until the next Timescape Trek novel appears.\\" NotesReferences * External links Novels based on Star Trek: The Original Series 1983 American novels American science fiction novels ","title":"Web of the Romulans"},{"id":"18612274","text":"Chincoteague Channel with the swing bridge in the distance Chincoteague Channel is a channel on the Eastern Shore of Virginia between marshlands to the northwest and Chincoteague Island to the southeast.

For several years after the apparitions, pilgrims flocked to the small town of Beauraing, province of Namur (Belgium), and many cures were claimed. She is celebrated under this title on 29 November. Apparitions The young people who claimed to have seen the apparitions were Fernande (15), Gilberte (13), and Albert (11), children of Hector and Marie-Louise Perp√®te Voisin. Hector Voisin was a railway clerk. With them were Andr√©e (14) and Gilberte (9) Degeimbre, daughters of Degeimbre, a farmer's widow.Armstrong, Patti. \\"The ‚ÄúGolden Heart‚Äù Apparition of Our Lady of Beauraing\\", National Catholic Register, August 10, 2016 On the evening of 29 November 1932, four of the children walked to a school conducted by the Sisters of Christian Doctrine to meet Gilberte Voisin and walk home with her. When they reached the school, Albert pointed out a lady dressed in a long white robe, near a railroad viaduct just past the school. The other children reported seeing her as well. Over the next several weeks, they saw the lady thirty-two more times, generally in the garden of the convent-school. The final apparition was on 3 January 1933. The children reported that the lady requested that a chapel be built at the site and stated that \\"I am the Immaculate Virgin\\". She also desired for pilgrims to come to the site and asked the children (and everyone) to \\"pray, pray, pray\\" and, in one of the last visions, revealed her \\"Golden Heart\\".\\"Reported Cure at Beauraing\\", Catholic Herald, 27 August 1948 In the final vision, the Lady reportedly asked one of the children, Fernande, \\"Do you love My Son?\\" and she replied, \\"Yes\\". She then asked her \\"Do you love Me?\\" and Fernande again answered, \\"Yes\\". The Lady then stated, \\"Then sacrifice yourself for me\\" and bade them farewell before the child could reply. Ecclesiastical review In 1935, the Bishop of Namur, Thomas-Louis Heylen, appointed an Episcopal Commission to investigate the events. The work continued under his successor, Bishop Andr√©-Marie Charue. On 2 February 1943, he published a decree authorizing public devotions to Our Lady of Beauraing. The final approbation for the Marian apparition was granted in 1949 with the permission of the Holy Office.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices pages 73-74Francois Leuret, 2006 Modern Miraculous Cures - A Documented Account Of Miracles And Medicine In The 20th Century page 63Matthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, page 123 In 1949 in Lowell, Massachusetts, the Pro Maria Committee was founded by Joseph Debergh, O.M.I. to disseminate the story of Our Lady's thirty-three appearances in Beauraing. The committee created an archive of photographs of the history and activities relating to the apparitions, now housed at The Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute. After the apparitions, the five children all grew up, married, and lived quiet lives with their families.Sharkey, Don.

The Bottom 10 (officially, ESPN.com's Bottom 10) is a week-by- week regular season \\"ranking\\" of the worst ten college football teams in the NCAA Division I FBS.NT Daily News \\"NT among league's worst\\" by Michael Neglia, September 8, 2006 ESPN.com writer Ryan McGee currently writes the column each week and is the sole determiner of the teams that are listed. One of the running gags of the Bottom 10 is the \\"highly coveted Number 5 spot\\". This spot is typically reserved for \\"the top BCS blunder of the week\\" - a normally strong football team that found itself on the wrong end of an upset the prior week; an example would be the Bottom 10 of September 7, 2011, which featured Oregon State at the #5 ranking after its upset loss to Sacramento State, a Division I FCS program that had previously never beaten an FBS team in its history. Occasionally, the Number 5 spot can be used for other aspects relating to the game, as occurred on two consecutive weeks in 2015. On October 13, \\"Monday\\" (that day) was Number 5 following three significant events: the firing of Steve Sarkisian as head coach at USC, the PED suspension of Florida starting quarterback Will Grier, and the unexpected retirement of South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier. One week later, the Number 5 spot was handed to \\"Digital Tough Guys from Michigan\\", referring to a number of putative Michigan fans who sent insulting tweets and death threats to Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill after his mishandling of a snap led to the game-winning touchdown for Michigan State in their October 18 game. The Bottom 10 also features the \\"Pillow Fight of the Week\\", which is usually a matchup between fellow Bottom 10 teams. The Bottom 10 in popular culture The Bottom 10 rankings are occasionally referenced by other sportswriters when writing editorials about teams that the writers consider to be poor performers. One example of this can be found in the Stanford Review: \\"Stanford has consistently maintained the #2 spot on the ESPN \\"Bottom 10\\" rankings, only losing, or winning depending on your perspective, to equally hapless Duke.\\"Stanford Review \\"Time for Harris to Go?\\", Stuart Baimel, December 1, 2006 Original idea The Chicago Tribune credits the idea to Los Angeles sportswriter Steve Harvey approximately 30 years before ESPN began using the term.

Its Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) is 13D and it was created to strengthen USAF personnel recovery capabilities by providing commissioned officer leadership that possessed an operational skillset paralleling that of the enlisted pararescuemen (PJ). The CRO specialty includes direct combatant command and control of Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations. They plan, manage and execute the six tasks of CSAR: prepare, report, locate, support, recover, and reintegrate isolated personnel and materiel. CROs conduct strategic, operational and tactical level planning, provide battle staff expertise, manage theater personnel recovery operations and conduct combat operations. History The CRO specialty was created on December 8, 2000. In 2001, the first three Combat Rescue Officers were assigned, including Col. (as of 2010) Vincent Savino, first commander of the 38th Rescue Squadron, activated that year. Overview CROs command day-to-day activities to organize, train and equip assigned personnel to conduct Personnel Recovery operations. They deploy as a direct combatant commander of operations. CROs provide subject matter expertise to command battle staffs and theater command and control structure. CRO duties and responsibilities include planning missions and leading CSAR assets, pararescue and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape operations, including aerospace interface in the recovery objective area. Supporting joint and combined forces engaged in conventional and special operations air, ground, and/or maritime personnel recovery operations. Advising on readiness of forces based on force status reports, inspections, training exercise and evaluation results. Developing plans and coordinating activities to report, locate and support isolated personnel or materiel. Planning and conducting missions to recover personnel and materiel, coordinating evacuation of isolated personnel to friendly control. Developing plans and executing the debriefing and reintegration of recovered personnel. Ensuring CSAR activities are organized, and teams/units are trained and equipped to perform the full military spectrum of CSAR and Coalition/Joint PR. Inspecting and evaluating CSAR activities, functions, and personnel.  Training and selection process  The selection process is broken into two phases. Phase I requires an in depth application that summarizes the professional history and qualifications of the individual applying. Heavy consideration is given to prior military service, academic achievement, and leadership abilities. A board of field grade officers review the applications and select the group that will go on to Phase II of selection. Phase II takes place at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. This phase includes three mile running sessions, 1,500 meter swims, and rucksack marches up to six miles. The goal of Phase II is to place the candidates under extreme fatigue and constant stress to see how they think and act under circumstances that are similar to the real world battlefront. Many young officers going into Phase II drop out or are eliminated, leaving a fraction of the original class. CRO training consists of the following: *Combat Rescue Officer (CRO) / Pararescue (PJ) Indoctrination Course, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (9 weeks) The mission of the Indoctrination Course is to select and train future CRO and PJs. At this school, participants undergo extensive physical conditioning with swimming, running, functional weight training and calisthenics. This course helps prepare students for the rigors of training and the demands of these lifestyles. Other training includes water confidence training, obstacle courses, rucksack marches, and academics to prepare the candidates for follow- on training courses (e.g. diving physics/dive tables). Graduation of this course allows the individual to begin learning the special skills that make CROs and PJs highly regarded rescue operators throughout the joint community. *Army Airborne School, Fort Benning, Georgia (3 weeks) Students learn the basic parachuting skills required to infiltrate an objective area by static line airdrop.

Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon directed by Robert McKimson and written by David Detiege. The short was released on June 18, 1965, and stars Daffy Duck. It is Daffy's only solo cartoon in the DePatie‚ÄìFreleng series. This marks the final time Daffy appears solo, as well as the final time he says his catchphrase: \\"You're despicable.\\" Plot While on a hunting trip, Daffy Duck hopes to shoot a bear. An announcement from a nearby ranger station informs him of a boundary line drawn through the \\"hunting area.\\" Hunters are told to remain on one side of the boundary and bears to remain on the other side, unless they want to get shot. Daffy chases several bears to the boundary line, and a ranger keeps him from pursuing them across it. One bear taunts Daffy from his side of the line. In order to catch this bear, Daffy devises many schemes, including using bacon to entice the bear across the boundary line, erasing the boundary line, and disguising himself as a tree. Each time, the bear outsmarts him or he is caught and reprimanded by the park ranger. In his last attempt to catch the bear, Daffy digs a tunnel underneath the boundary line. The bear discovers his plot, traces his way to the spot where Daffy would come out, and places a small cabin of dynamite above him before hiding. Daffy digs up into the cabin, causing the dynamite to explode, leaving him mostly featherless (except for his head). He gathers up his feathers, saying he is lucky that he keeps his feathers \\"numbered for just such an occasion.\\" While re-attaching his feathers, he soon discovers that the bottom half of his feathers are missing, and he turns to see the bear wearing them as a headdress and necklace. Before he can retrieve his feathers, the ranger, having enough of Daffy's rule- breaking behavior, decides to close hunting season for the year and demands that he get out. Obviously irked, Daffy (wearing a barrel over his naked bottom half) tells the bear: \\"You're desthpicable. But, you haven't seen the last of me!!\\" As he turns to leave, the backend of the barrel falls away, revealing his plucked behind.

After finding out about Sarah Jane and her gang, Alan assisted on three occasions. Backstory As a youth, Alan Jackson loved to skateboard, and even showed off his skateboarding skills when he was older. It was mentioned by Chrissie that on one of their dates they went on a treasure hunt. He was, by trade, a computer security consultant. As a result, he had considerable computer expertise, particularly in systems penetration, a.k.a. \\"hacking\\", as well as some unorthodox contacts. Appearances Alan is first seen moving into Bannerman Road with his daughter Maria. It is soon learned that Alan and Maria's mum Chrissie have divorced and that's the reason they have moved house. Alan is later taken over by the Bane due to drinking a drink called Bubble Shock. Alan is then seen decorating Maria's bedroom with her. The next day he talks about his past as a computer technician and how he fitted computers into school's that looked just like Maria's. Sarah Jane later asks Alan if she can look at the plans he had for the job.

Alan confronts Chrissie about the consequences of her just showing up. Alan is later turned to stone by the Gorgon but is soon changed back thanks to an alien talisman. Alan accompanied Sarah Jane, Maria, Luke and Clyde to a skate park where they all had fun skating even though Luke was unable to do it. The next day, Alan had no knowledge of who Sarah Jane or Luke was. It was later revealed that Sarah Jane had been swapped for Andrea Yates her best friend who died when she was a teenager. When his daughter was erased from history by The Trickster, only Alan could remember her thanks to an alien device given to Maria by Sarah Jane, which in turn came from the Verron soothsayer. When he interrogated Andrea Yates about Maria's disappearance, the Graske chased him and tried to remove him from time. However, Alan trapped the Graske and forced it to tell him where Maria went. When the day was saved, he was very surprised to find out what his daughter had really been doing with Sarah Jane Smith. With his eyes now opened to the existence of alien life forms, Alan at first experienced a knee-jerk reaction which led him to consider selling his house and moving Maria away from Sarah Jane.

Alan later had cryptic messages from Clyde warning him about Sarah Jane being in danger from Mr Smith. Alan and Maria also learned that Luke's ‚Äúreal parents‚Äù were really Slitheen. Alan later assisted his daughter and Sarah Jane in defeating Mr Smith's attempt to destroy the world. It was mentioned by Luke that Alan and Maria were in Cornwall during the Dalek invasion. Alan was offered a job in the United States which shocked everyone but he eventually accepted the job. Before leaving for America, Alan assisted the gang in getting information about the Sontarans with Chrissie eventually finding out the secret of what Sarah Jane and her gang does. Months later, Alan and Maria are called to assist Luke and Rani in rescuing Clyde from his father who was slowly turning into a Berserker. Alan hacked the UNIT database to get information. Alan then called Sarah Jane offscreen.

The field's on-campus location eliminates not only the students' prior need to walk or be bussed from school to a separate location to play, but the need for the two prior schools to share the field. Although the merger of the former Union Hill Hillers and Emerson Bulldogs had experienced some difficulties a year prior when the students were still housed at separate high schools (called Union City High School's North and South campuses, respectively), the merge had been ameliorated by the move of the unified student body to the single new school.Hague, Jim (September 23, 2008). \\"Union City going through growing pains New program trying to meld teams of old\\".

The story concerns an heiress and her gambling husband, who are plagued by debt and embarrassment as everything seems to always go wrong for them. Their honour is saved just in time when a disgraced chauffeur tries to rob them but amiably ends up pulling them out of a hole. In the introduction to a published edition of the plays, Coward wrote, \\"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\\"Shaw Festival Study Guide, 2009, p. 4.

Synopsis Setting: In the bedroom of a French villa on the C√¥te d'Azur where heiress Stella Cartwright and her gambling husband Toby are staying. ;Scene 1 ‚Äì Half-past eleven o'clock on an April morning Stella and Toby are eating breakfast and discussing how they plan to recover the 50 pounds lost last night at the casino. Stella remembers that Lord Chapworth (\\"Chaps\\" for short) owes her a lot of money and, to their delight, the butler leads him in. Stella tries to use sex appeal to collect the debt, but Chaps doesn't catch on and goes on to say that he lost all his money due to getting stuck at the same table with Pearl Brandt. Stella tries to recuperate, but then the landowner, Olive Lloyde Ransome, and a very dopey Elena Krassiloff enter the room. Elena begins to tinker with random objects while Olive informs Toby and Stella that more guests are arriving the next afternoon, and they have to leave. The butler returns to inform them that their train tickets had already been booked, and they realise that the whole thing was set up to oust them. In desperation, Toby gathers up all the jewellery and sends Nanny to Cannes to pawn it so that he can try to win at the casino. Stella warns him, \\"You'll lose it, I know you will. I wish I could play the damned game.\\" ;Scene 2 ‚Äì Half-past one o'clock the next morning Stella and Toby recount the events of the evening. Just as Tony was about to join a game of baccarat, Pearl Brandt steals his seat and wins 170,000 francs, while Toby loses all of his money. After debating minor details, Toby comes up with a plan whereby they might save themselves: they will rob and murder Pearl Brandt. Toby becomes overwhelmed, and Stella orders him to stop and get ready for bed. Another argument ensues, and Toby storms into the bathroom and bangs his head on the cupboard. Stella leads him to the bed and says that she plans to abandon their humility and borrow enough money to get them home. ;Scene 3 ‚Äì Two hours later An armed robber enters the room and carelessly trips on a chair, waking Toby and Stella. He aims his gun at them and demands their jewellery, but they tell him that they have none. A scuffle ensues, and Toby ends up with the gun. They unmask the robber and discover that he is Stevens, a well known chauffeur. Stevens reveals to them that he lost his job (after having sex with his boss's wife) and is desperate for money. Stella starts to feel sympathetic, but Toby orders him out and threatens to call the police. All of a sudden, Stella realises that Stevens could be useful and pulls him back in. Her plan is to make Stevens rob the other guests, give them the money, and tie them up to make them look like victims. Toby doesn't catch on and is resistant until Stella mentions Pearl Brandt. Stevens runs off while Toby and Stella pull apart the bed sheets so that they can be used to bind them. Stevens returns with the money and jewellery and proceeds to bind and gag Stella and Toby. He leaves while they double over in laughter at their good fortune.

After striking up a conversation, Gates, \\"...told them about how I just moved to L.A., and it turned out that Geoff and I shopped at the same comics shop, DJ's Universal, so we talked about that. We said our 'good-byes' and our 'nice-to- meet-you's' and then the host sat them, and then came back and sat us at the table literally right next to theirs. A table maybe five inches from their table. And we kind of all looked at each other and I thought, 'Can this get more awkward? I doubt it.'\\" When Gates' friend, who was a rabid Johns fan, was not making the best first impression, Gates paid for Johns' and Wacker's meal as an apology. Gates hoped the meal would make up for his friend's behavior and after the generous act, Johns asked Gates directly, \\"Do you want a job?\\" Gates then interviewed with the writing staff for Blade: The Series on Johns' recommendation and was hired. After the series' cancellation, Gates discussed his history of writing comics with Johns, which was previously unbeknownst to him. Johns asked to read Gates' early comics work. Johns was impressed, and after Gates submitted outlines to Johns inspired by the Sinestro Corps War, Gates was interviewed by editor Eddie Berganza and was hired by DC Comics. Gates told a back-up story about Sinestro Corps member Kryb with artist Jerry Ordway in Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman Prime. He went on to write a two-part story about Alpha Lantern Boodikka in Green Lantern Corps #21-22.\\"Sterling Gates on the Alpha-Lanterns in GLC\\", Newsarama, February 8, 2008 He then took over full writing duties of the Supergirl title featuring Kara Zor-El, starting with issue #34 of volume 5, in October 2008.Vaneta Rogers and Cliff Biggers. \\"Planet Stories\\" Comic Shop News #1108.

He was closely associated with the Ferrarese Este family, worked for several humanistic Renaissance academies, and was well known as a composer of madrigals and dialogues. Life Interior of the baptistry at Padua Cathedral. Portinaro worked at the cathedral as maestro di cappella in the 1570s He was born in Padua around 1520. While he published a book of motets in Venice in 1548, no biographical details are available for the period before 1550. He was the son of a Paduan official, was married to Laura d'Este, and was resident in the Este palace in Padua. In 1555 he applied unsuccessfully for the post of maestro di cappella, music director, at the city's cathedral, and failing in this enterprise, spent the rest of the decade in humanistic as well as musical pursuits. In particular, he had an active life working for four secular groups: a group of musicians in Padua, and three humanistic academies in Vicenza, Padua, and Verona. Such academies were becoming common in the late 16th century, as a part of the Renaissance rebirth of humanistic thought; in music they were the location of the first experiments with monody and multi- voice dramatic vocal forms, the strands of which would eventually coalesce into opera. The first of Portinaro's associations was an unnamed group he founded himself, which existed to further the musical careers of its members, which he created on 21 June 1555. Upon the dissolution of this fraternity he moved to Vicenza, where he joined the Accademia dei Costanti in that city, a society of humanists to which he dedicated his 1557 book of madrigals. In March 1557 he was back in Padua, for the newly formed Accademia degli Elevati. Of this group, some records survive of its specific activities, and his role in them. There were approximately forty members of the academy; unlike the original Accademia Filarmonica in Verona, the members themselves did not seem to do most of the music-making. Portinaro was hired as maestro, and he was to find professional assistants to perform for the academy members. Their sessions, which involved lectures, speeches, and discussions about secular and Latin poetry and other humanistic topics, frequently began and ended with musical performances by Portinaro and his group. In addition, Portinaro and his assistants, of which there were three listed in the records, were required by the terms of his employment to teach singing, instrumental performance, and other aspects of music to any of the members who wished it.Einstein, vol. I p. 471-473 The organization did not survive long ‚Äì in 1560 it dissolved, for reasons unknown. Portinaro dedicated a book of madrigals for them that year.Archetto, Grove online Next he went to Verona, where the Accademia Filarmonica hired him for a year beginning in 1561. At the end of the year he was replaced by Ippolito Chamater√≤, who held the post for the next two years. Scipione Gonzaga was the recipient of a madrigal book of Portinaro's in 1563, in Padua; Gonzaga himself founded an academy in that city, the Accademia degli Eterei, though Portinaro is not known to have been associated with them directly. From 1564 to 1566 or 1568 Portinaro was in Rome, in the service of Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este as music director for his considerable musical establishment ‚Äì he had a group of 15 singers, with instrumentalists and an organist. Ippolito was a prominent patron of the arts, and brought much of the sumptuousness of the Ferrara Este court with him to the Holy City; he was also a patron of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina around the same time that Portinaro was there. Portinaro probably wrote much of his sacred music, mostly motets, during his tenure in Rome.Archetto, Grove online There is some dispute over whether he remained in Rome after 1566: he may have moved to the service of Cardinal Luigi d'Este, but no documentation survives other than the suggestive dedication to Luigi d'Este of some motets that Portinaro published in 1568. Musicologist Alfred Einstein believed that Portinaro was in Venice sometime around 1567 as a printer and publisher, not of music but poetry, including verse by Pietro Bembo and others.Einstein, p. 472 Whether he went to Venice or not, in 1568 Portinaro moved back to Padua, and then later that same year went to Vienna, most likely to apply for the vacant post of choirmaster at the court of Maximilian II. Unsuccessful in this endeavor, he returned to Padua sometime before March 1569, and he seems to have spent the rest of his life in his native city.Archetto, Grove online In 1573 a new academy in Padua, the Accademia degli Rinascenti, hired him as music-master with duties similar to those he had held at the previous academy of the Elevati; he even hired as assistants some of the same people who had helped him before. Different this time was the existence of a rival academy in Padua, the Accademia degli Animosi, but neither academy lasted for long. Competition from nearby Venice, one of the major musical centers of Europe at the time, was too intense to allow for multiple such institutions in Padua, and just three years later, in 1576, an outbreak of bubonic plague killed 12,000 in the city and ended most of the significant musical activity there for years.Einstein, p. 472-3 Portinaro himself survived the plague, and was hired as maestro di cappella at Padua Cathedral in December 1576, staying there at least through August 1577, from which month a payment record survives. Cathedral archives indicate that he was dead in by January 1579, at which time the administration was searching for his replacement; however the date and circumstances of his death are not known.Archetto, Grove onlinePetrobelli/Durante, Grove online Music and influence Portinaro wrote both sacred and secular vocal music, and also left a handful of lute intabulations, his only known instrumental music. His secular vocal music, which consisted of madrigals and dramatic dialogues, was the best-known portion of his output. He published six books of madrigals and dialogues in all, for between four and eight voices, as well as three books of motets. A few madrigals and motets were published separately, and an unpublished setting of the mass, Missa Surge Petre for 6 voices, survives in the Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek BSB-Hss Mus.ms. 45.Archetto, Grove online Most of his secular vocal music he seems to have written for the academies of which he was the maestro. He periodically gathered the pieces, madrigals and dramatic dialogues, into sets to publish and to dedicate to the academies and his aristocratic patrons. The madrigals show the influence of the Venetian School composers such as Adrian Willaert; in musical style they are polyphonic, reserved, and avoid the manneristic and experimental style of some of the mid-century composers such as Cipriano de Rore also working in the Venetian orbit.Archetto, Grove online However Portinaro was innovative in developing dramatic characterization in his dialogues, an important predecessor to opera. An example composition was one he wrote for Maximilian II in Vienna, the first piece in the 1568 Vergini collection. This work, for seven voices, features the Seven Muses, who have been exiled and seek a peaceful new home: the home they find is the imperial court in Vienna. Unlike the Muses, Portinaro failed to find a home there, but the piece shows the contemporary trend towards dramatic characterization, with single voices representing single characters, and it also demonstrates the era's increasing use of secular stories, largely drawn from classical antiquity.Einstein, vol. I p. 471-473 Portinaro likely wrote most of his motets both while in Rome in the service of Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, and some date from his earliest, undocumented years. These works also show the influence of Netherlandish polyphony such as practiced by Willaert in nearby Venice.Archetto, Grove online The only instrumental music assigned to Portinaro is a series of lute intabulations which he published in Venice within the book on lute-playing by Florentine humanist, music theorist, lutenist, and composer Vincenzo Galilei (the father of the astronomer). Galilei likely made the intabulations himself, as Portinaro is not known to have been a lutenist. The publication was called Fronimo dialogo di Vincentio Galilei fiorentino, nel quale si contengono le vere et necessarie regole del intavolare la musica nel liuto, and appeared in several editions in 1568, 1569 and 1584.Archetto, Grove online NotesReferences * Maria Archetto: \\"Portinaro, Francesco\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

For people coming from/going to Caguas, the highway has a direct intersection with PR-30; for those coming from/going to Humacao, drivers have to take short highway PR-952 and then take PR-189 just before its intersection with PR-30, hence this exit being one of the most disorganized junctions in the island between a main highway and a main freeway or tollway in the island. New Puerto Rico Highway 66 also has a poor-designed intersection with the highway, since it only allow people going to/coming from Carolina (west) and not the east. This is probably because the short segment open from the new tollway immediately ends at PR-3 only 2 kilometers from the exit to PR-185 and thus expected to be fixed when the segment to Rio Grande opens to the public.

The term comes from the tendency of a car's wheels to follow the normally recessed rails of street trams, without driver input in the same way that the train does. The same effect is sometimes called Nibbling. Tramlining can usually be blamed on tires, and its incidence depends greatly on the model of tire and its state of wear. Although not normally dangerous, at very high speeds it can become a source of instability. Vehicles with large and wide low profile tires are more prone to the effects as well as vehicles which have wheels fitted that are larger than the manufacturers recommendation or have reinforced sidewalls. People who are relatively inexperienced with driving with this tendency will feel that they have to make continual course corrections and it is very easy to overcompensate the steering, which could potentially lead to veering off the road especially if the road is a narrow track/country road. The effects of tramlining can be eased by subjecting the vehicle to an inspection and calibration of the wheels (i.e. a full geometry check) or replacing the tires with non-reinforced (soft sidewall) tires.

From 1849 to 1861, the ranch was important as a stop for emigrant travelers on the Southern Emigrant Trail, including the Gila River Emigrant Trail and the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line. Warner established the only trading post between New Mexico and Los Angeles. Warner's Ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark. Early life Warner was born in 1807 as Jonathan Trumbull Warner in Connecticut. He went west, travelling with a trading party from St. Louis in 1830, bound for Santa Fe. The following year he traveled with fur trappers to California. In 1907, the Annual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California published Colonel J. J. Warner's account of his California trapping days in \\"Reminiscences of Early California ‚Äì 1831 to 1846\\". Career In California Warner first trapped beaver for several years. From 1834‚Äì1841 he worked in a merchandising store in Los Angeles. As Mexico had controlled California since Mexican independence in 1821, Warner became a naturalized Mexican citizen and changed his name to Juan Jose Warner. About 1843, he moved to San Diego. In 1844, Warner was granted the Rancho San Jose del Valle Mexican land grant, previously granted to Jos√© Antonio Pico and abandoned.Vincent Nicholas Rossi, \\"Warner Springs' history shadowed by conflict\\", San Diego Union, 28 Jan 2007, accessed 18 Nov 2009 He established what became known as Warner's Ranch near Warner Springs, California. The ranch property included hot springs. After he started serving travelers in 1849 on the Southern Trail, Warner set up the only trading post between New Mexico and Los Angeles. Warner's ranch was a historic territory of the Cupe√±o Indians, who had inhabited the area for centuries before Spanish missionaries entered the area. Their land was taken over, many of the Cupe√±os worked for Warner on the ranch and constructed a village nearby. After California became part of the United States, taxes were imposed on the Cupe√±o, one of a series of issues that led in 1851 to the Garra Uprising. In the revolt, several of the Warner ranch buildings were burned down. Warner moved his family to Los Angeles but continued to manage the ranch for years. The ranch was used as a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line, which operated from 1857‚Äì1861. Warner lost the ranch when his grant was challenged by a previous claimant. He was active in California politics in Los Angeles. Death and legacy Warner died in 1890. The Cupe√±o gained no legal remedy to their issues but remained settled around the hot springs, to which they charged some travelers admission. In 1880 the ranch was purchased by John G. Downey, a former governor of the state. In 1892 Downey tried to evict the Cupe√±o from the property. They filed suit against him, but lost in federal court in 1901 and were forced to relocate in 1903 to the Warner Ranch Indian Reservation(32 Stat., 257) Mission Indians located in Pala Valley about 20 miles away.

Lloyd Eaton Collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, and Utopian Literature, is \\"the largest publicly accessible collection of science fiction, fantasy, horror and utopian and dystopian literature in the world\\". It is housed in Special Collections and Archives of the UCR Libraries at the University of California, Riverside. It consists of more than 300,000 items, including hardcover and paperback books, SF fanzines, film and visual material, and comic books, including manga and anime, as well as a variety of archival materials. Eaton J. Lloyd Eaton was a pulmonologist specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis. While still in high school he collected science fiction and fantasy pulp literature. By the 1940s he communicated with book dealers in London and New York to acquire more books, expanding to the detective and western genres at a time when science fiction was an obscure interest. Eaton had particular interest in stories of future war or lost race from before the 1920s by authors such as John Polidori, Frank Aubrey, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Eaton was also the first president of the Elves, Gnomes, and Little Men's Science Fiction, Chowder, and Marching Society, and served as the editor of the group's sercon fanzine, The Rhodomagnetic Digest. When Eaton's family sought a home for his collection, science fiction was considered an inferior literary product‚Äîpleasant enough as a diversion, but unworthy of serious academic study. As even public libraries did not regularly acquire science fiction, there was no comprehensive collection available anywhere outside of private hands. History of the collection Dr. Eaton's collection, acquired by UCR's University Librarian Donald Wilson in 1969, consisted of about 7,500 hardback editions of science fiction, fantasy, and horror from the late nineteenth century to 1955. The development of the collection continued under University Librarian Eleanor Montague, who created the position of Eaton Curator, hiring for the position George Slusser, a Harvard-trained literary scholar. When Hal W. Hall catalogued the growing Eaton Collection in 1975 for his then-upcoming Anatomy of Wonder bibliography, he determined the collection consisted of \\"over 8,500 volumes, and is particularly rich in early and scare items published from 1870 to 1930, along with some important eighteenth-century titles.\\" During Slusser's 25-year curatorship, the Eaton collection grew to more than 100,000 volumes, ranging from the 1517 edition of Thomas More's Utopia to the most recently published titles. The collection includes first editions of Bram Stoker's Dracula, H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Fantastic Four #1, and Action Comics #1. Foreign works of science fiction have been added systematically, including works in Chinese, Czech, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. The collection also includes journals, comic books, and fanzines, primarily acquired as donations from collectors Terry Carr, Bruce Pelz, Fred Patten, and Rick Sneary. Some of the extensive texts maintained by the collection were used in the 1970s by Arno Press for reprints of Supernatural and Occult Fiction and Lost Race and Adult Fantasy Fiction. In recent years, films, videos, DVDs, scripts and storyboards from TV series including Alien Nation and The X-Files, and other illustrated narratives have been added, most of which were donated. The archival holdings comprise the papers of leading science fiction and fantasy authors, including Gregory Benford, David Brin, F. M. Busby, Michael Cassutt, Robert L. Forward, Anne McCaffrey, William Rotsler, James White, and Colin Wilson. From 1986-1991, one of Slusser's students, author Daryl F. Mallett was instrumental in reaching out to authors and fans and asking if they would donate their archives, as well as starting a duplicate-asset trading program with the University of Michigan, which provided the Eaton Collection with its massive comic book collection. From 1988 to 1990, the Collection published three issues of J. Lloyd Eaton Collection Newsletter \\"designed to alert scholars of new acquisitions and happenings in the Eaton Collection\\". In 2014, George Slusser was asked how he assembled the world's largest SF collection: \\"By silence, exile and cunning\\", he replied. \\"And I did have allies in the library, who found funds to buy books, even when academics sought to block purchases. Librarians love books, and SF had a lot of them, with interesting covers and formats.\\"An Interview with: Professor George Slusser ‚Äì Eaton science fiction collection‚Äôs Curator Emeritus by Gregory Benford, August 10, 2014 Eaton SF conference Greg Benford, Eaton SF Conference, 2008-05-17As part of its scholarly mission, the Eaton Collection hosts the Eaton Science Fiction Conference, which is biennial in odd-number years from 2009. It was inaugurated in 1979 as the J. Lloyd Eaton Science Conference, annual for many years, including some at other sites. As of 2013, some 21 conferences have been held at UC Riverside, while others have taken place at international venues, co-sponsored by UCR and various host institutions: London Polytechnic University, 1984; the Sorbonne Nouvelle, 1986; University of Leeds, 1989; Texas A&M; University, 1990; the Maison d'Ailleurs, Yverdon-les-bains, and the Universit√© de Neuch√¢tel, 1991; Imperial College, London, 1995; the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2000, and the Science Fiction Museum in Seattle in 2005. Conference attendees have included writers such as Brian Aldiss, Ray Bradbury, David Brin, Samuel R. Delany, Larry Niven, Kim Stanley Robinson, Robert Silverberg, Theodore Sturgeon and Roger Zelazny as well as well-known critics of the genre and scientists like Harold Bloom, Leslie Fiedler, Harry Levin, Marvin Minsky and Robert Scholes. The Conference has produced more than twenty volumes of critical essays, published by various university presses. After a three-year gap, the conference resumed at UCR with the theme \\"Chronicling Mars\\", May 16‚Äì18, 2008. The 2009 conference, \\"Extraordinary Voyages: Jules Verne and Beyond\\" was held April 30 ‚Äì May 3, 2009. The 2011 conference on \\"Global Science Fiction\\" was held February 11‚Äì13, 2011 at Riverside's historic Mission Inn Hotel & Spa. The most recent conference was held April 11‚Äì14, 2013, on the subject \\"Science Fiction Media\\". Eaton Award The now biennial conference sponsors the J. Lloyd Eaton Memorial Award. From 1979 to 2001 it recognized the \\"best critical book of each year\\", although it was not precisely annual. From 2008 it is a lifetime achievement award, in full the J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award in Science Fiction, recognizing \\"contributions of lasting significance to the field\\". The four recipients to 2011 were Ray Bradbury, Frederik Pohl, Samuel R. Delany, and Harlan Ellison. Ursula K. Le Guin is the Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award winner for 2012.

History  IRL began in 2004 as a proposal to buy, disassemble, and move a petroleum refinery from Canada to Pakistan, for use in supplying Pakistan with refined petroleum products, with investment from both Middle Eastern, Pakistani, US, and UK sponsors and investors. In September 2006 it was announced that a memorandum of understanding had been signed between IRL and Fauji Oil Terminal Company to open an additional oil jetty at Port Qasim to serve the refinery. In April 2007 it was announced that work on the refinery was due to start in the following month (May 2007). The refinery was originally due to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2009. The refinery was, at this point, predicted to cost US$750 million to build, and would have led to a 35% increase in Pakistan's refining capacity, with a then-predicted capacity of 126,000 barrels per day. The total amount of components to be shipped from Canada to Pakistan for the project was roughly 100,000 cubic metres. Whilst by June 2007 65% of the plant had been shipped from Canada to Pakistan for assembly, further shipments of refinery components did not take place. Ultimately the components remaining in Canada were auctioned to pay off haulier firms and other service providers. By March 2008 a year's the delay in the completion of the project had been announced. The CEO of IRL, Sohail Shamsi, ascribed this to political instability in Pakistan and terrorist attacks deterring investment. The original Canadian plant, based in Oakville, that had been disassembled had also been criticised for polluting the environment, and had been closed by its owners, Petro Canada, partly because of more stringent standards in sulphur content of petroleum products. At this point, the forecast output of the plant was 93,000 barrels per day. The predicted cost of the refinery had increased to US$900 million. A subsequent plan to increase capacity to 133,000 barrels was shelved. In October 2009 it was announced that work on the refinery had stopped entirely. It was announced that this was due to investors pulling out due to increased political risk in the wake of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and the subsequent downgrading of Pakistan's credit rating. The refinery was \\"half-built\\" at this point according to the CEO of IRL. In August 2010 Sohail Shamsi announced that new Chinese investors had been found to support construction of the plant. In July 2011, Shamsi announced that the Chinese investors had pulled out of investing in the plant. In July 2013 Shamsi announced renewed interest in the project from German investors. By October 2013 the company was described as \\"dormant for years\\". Ryan Cornelius, the British owner of the principal investor company, Bahrain-based PSI Energy Holding Company, was at this time jailed under charges in Dubai that he and six other co-accused had allegedly diverted trade financing worth $501 million from the Dubai Islamic Bank to \\"extravagant projects\\", though he maintained that this money had been spent on the IRL project. At the same time, Cornelius was involved in a legal battle in Pakistan over ownership of IRL, in which he claimed he had lost an 80% stake due to a sale of shares that had occurred whilst he had been in jail and unable to vote as a shareholder. Sohail Shamsi maintained that 87% of the refinery belonged to him. In 2018, Cornelius was sentenced to an additional 20 years in jail in relation to the charges on top of the ten he had served since 2008.

In 2008, du Castel and Timothy M. Jurgensen published Computer Theology: Intelligent Design of the World Wide Web, a theology of the World Wide Web based on a comparative study of human societies and computer networks. Biography Du Castel was born in 1952 in France a descendant of Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac, who governed France as Prime Minister before being defeated by Napol√©on III, and Paul Dubois, whose Joan of Arc sculpture stands in Washington D.C. A graduate of Ecole Polytechnique with a 1977 PhD from the University of Paris in Theoretical Computer Science, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the IBM France Research Center before hiring with Schlumberger in France in 1978. He emigrated to the United States in 1983 where he has lived in Austin, Texas since, becoming an American citizen in 1994. In 2000, du Castel was invited by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence to make a presentation of artificial intelligence advances in the industry that were original to academia. Consequently, du Castel was invited to present at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (2001), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2001), University of Texas at Austin (2002), Peking University (2002), Tsinghua University (2002), Purdue University (2002), Grenoble Institute of Technology (2003), University of Paris (2004) and University of Hamburg (2004), which increasingly constituted the matter of a book on the relationship between religion and digital networks. In 2005Acknowledgments of Computer Theology: Intelligent Design of the World Wide Web du Castel joined with Timothy M. Jurgensen, author of two books on computer security, to write Computer Theology: Intelligent Design of the World Wide Web, which uses theological principles to study the role of religion in computer networks, and reciprocally studies religion in the light of well-established computer concepts such as trust. The book eventually proposed in 2008 a reference for the field of Computer Theology, following the road traced earlier by Donald Knuth and Anne Foerst, aiming at a better understanding of computer evolution as well as religion.

Life and career Ketchum attended high school at the Webb School of California. He received a B.A. in design from UCLA and a MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 1974. He studied photography under the direction of Edmund Teske and Robert Heinecken. After he graduated he began a lifelong friendship with Eliot Porter, who helped form his ideas about photography and about how photography can be used to help change the world. His commitment to conservation photography is unique amongst academically-trained photographers. Prior to his emergence as a photographer, he was a widely recognized curator, discovering the Paul Outerbridge, Jr. estatePaul Outerbridge, Jr. by Graham Howe (Author), Paul Outerbridge Jr (Photographer), Robert Glenn Ketchum (Editor), LA Ctr. for Photo. Studies, 1976 , and bringing recognition to the overlooked work of James Van Der Zee. He was also Curator of Photography for the National Park Foundation for 15 years, and in this capacity authored American Photographers and the National Parks (1981). After the publication of this last title, Ketchum began to concentrate on environmentally focused projects. Although his conservation photography encompasses many areas from Mexico to Canada, his most influential work was done in Alaska, the location of four books with Aperture. His book The Tongass: Alaska's Vanishing Rain Forest (1987) was instrumental in helping to pass the Tongass Timber Reform Bill of 1990. He subsequently turned his attention to Southwest Alaska with Rivers of Life: Southwest Alaska, The Last Great Salmon Fishery (2001) and Wood-Tikchik: Alaska¬πs Largest State Park (2003), advocating for the protection of Bristol Bay from the industrial invasion of oil and gas leasing and the largest open pit mine in the world. In 2010, the Obama administration withdrew Bristol Bay from oil and gas lease consideration. Ketchum and his close friend master printer Michael Wilder pioneered Cibachrome color printmaking in the early 1970s. They were also among the first contemporary photographers to explore print scale. Ketchum's very dimensional prints large color prints were distinctive at that time. Ketchum has expended the traditional media of the photographic prints in several ways. He has been working with a guild of embroiderers in China translating his imagery into wall hangings, table screens and standing, multi-panel floor screens using historic craft dating back from 2500 yearsDowdey, Patrick (Editor), \\"Threads of Light: Chinese Embroidery From Suzhou and the Photography of Robert Glenn Ketchum\\"; with contributions by Robert Glenn Ketchum, Zhang Meifang, Jo Q.

More recently, he created the company Jin Jiang Joy to bring photographic images from the natural world to bolt fabric design. Ketchum has had over 400 one-man and group shows, and his photographs are in major museum collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the National Museum of American Art (Washington, D.C.), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City), to name a few. Significant archives of more than 100 images have been acquired by the Amon Carter Museum in Texas and the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, and substantial bodies of work can be found at the High Museum in Atlanta, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Akron Art Museum, the Stanford University Art Museum and the Herbert F.

Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon directed by Phil Monroe and Maurice Noble, with a story by John W. Dunn. The short was released on May 16, 1964, and stars Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. It was the last Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon featuring Bugs and Daffy together until Box-Office Bunny in 1991, and the last that Chuck Jones worked on, though he was fired at an early stage of production and replaced by Monroe (by the time it was released, Jones had already produced two cartoons at his new studio, Sib-Tower 12). The roaring of the angry bears in the cartoon seems to be the same sound effect used for the monster's roar in the feature film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, which was also produced by Warner Bros. Clips from this cartoon were used and commentated on by John Madden and Pat Summerall as the second quarter of the 2001 Cartoon Network special The Big Game XXIX: Bugs Vs. Daffy. Summary At a trading post up in the Klondike, many fur trappers have come in to trade in their furs for big bucks after a successful fur trapping season. When Daffy Duck sees Garcon, the manager of the trading post, giving money to the last fur trapper, he checks in to ask if trading in furs for money is true. Garcon answers it's true, but Daffy decides to go out and trap some fur for money, just as Garcon warns him that fur trapping season is over due to the approaching winter. Scoffing at the idea of winter, Daffy vows to catch a fur just as winter sets in just as suddenly. Bugs Bunny makes a snow rabbit, telling us it'll fool Daffy for a while, while he makes his getaway. Daffy comes up to the snow rabbit and warns him not to move or be pulverized. When the coal nose of the snow rabbit falls off, Daffy takes that as movement and proceeds to whack the snow rabbit to pieces until he hits a hibernating bear, whom the snow rabbit was built over. Angry at having his hibernation disturbed, the bear claws Daffy, who runs off thinking the bear missed until he falls to pieces. Just as Bugs is tutting off Daffy's misfortune, Daffy catches up and pokes his rifle at him. When Bugs asks Daffy if he's got some antipathy towards him, Daffy states he's only after the fur, of which he finds Bugs' to be the softest he's felt. As Bugs starts bragging about getting his suits from \\"the same tailor as the Duke of Windsor,\\" Daffy just states he's not interested in any \\"sales pitch\\" (Ken Harris animates this scene‚Äîhis last work at Warner's). Daffy refuses to give Bugs a sporting chance and threatens to shoot him in the neck, but Bugs kisses him, plugs up his gun with his carrot and runs away. Daffy tries to shoot Bugs, but the gun expands from the carrot; as Daffy tries to dislodge the carrot, the gun explodes in his face. Daffy then snarls: \\"Ooooh, I LOVE him!\\" Later, Daffy ignores a sign warning him there are hibernating animals, vowing that \\"I know one that isn't gonna get much sleep!\\" No sooner does he say that than he comes across an alarm clock, that rings and wakes up another hibernating bear. Thinking Daffy to be responsible for the rude awakening, the bear chases him straight into a cave where Bugs directs them. Bugs then seals up the cave entrance with a boulder, leaving the bear to pummel Daffy, who finally exits the cave looking a little worse for wear. Further on, Bugs has come across a sign warning him that he's in avalanche territory just as Daffy comes running up. Bugs manages to inform him of where they are and instructs him to follow on tiptoe. Daffy obliges and, after a few seconds, asks Bugs if it's safe to talk. Bugs pretends he didn't hear, prompting Daffy to ask again in his loudest whisper. When Bugs again pretends not to hear, Daffy gets mad enough to simply shout his question, causing snow to fall all over him. Bugs informs him that it still isn't safe then and Daffy sarcastically thanks him. Back at his hole, Bugs goes down for a rest just as Daffy comes up with dynamite. As Daffy trails out the wire, Bugs moves the hole so he secretly places the dynamite next to Daffy, just as Daffy prepares a detonator (\\"I love doing this, especially because I DESPISE him!\\"). After the dynamite explodes on Daffy, Daffy states how he's going to cry. Bugs manages to take refuge in a tree, forcing Daffy to put firewood around the stump in an attempt to smoke him out, but the fire melts the snow on the tree, causing it to fall on Daffy and freeze him in an ice statue. Bugs takes this event to make his getaway, but Daffy manages to free himself and get blasted by his own gun while trying to free it from the ice statue (\\"Say, whose side are you on, fella?\\"). Using skis, Daffy pursues Bugs to the lake, firing his gun as he goes. Inspired by a guy's action in a toothpaste ad, Bugs creates an \\"invisible shield\\" by throwing out a bucket of water, which freezes into a shield, which Daffy crashes into. This gag spoofs Colgate commercials of the early 1960s. Up a hill, Daffy drops a pebble that rolls into a giant snowball, in the hopes it will engulf Bugs. The snowball misses Bugs by a few inches, but engulfs three hibernating bears in the cave Bugs had earlier trapped Daffy in, and falls out the other end of the cave. After a brief boulder catapult gag, similar to those from the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons, the snowball lands on Daffy, who runs up a tree just as the angry bears threaten to massacre him. Later that night, Bugs decides to turn in for winter hibernation and bids Daffy and the bears goodnight. Daffy, now looking blue from the cold and worse for wear from an unseen fight with the bears (that might've taken place during the blackout between this scene and the snowball gag), simply curses over the mess he's gotten himself into while still clinging to the treetop.

He is not related to the judo practitioner also named Masahiko Kimura. His father died when Masahiko was 11. By the wishes of his mother, at age 15 he started spending his time as an apprentice under the bonsai master Motosuke Hamano of Toju-en Bonsai Garden. This was for eleven years until about 1966. (Kimura would later say that during his teens he really wanted to be a rock and roll musician.) After this he took to working in the horticulture field on his own. He went on to become known as the \\"Magical Technician of Kindai Shuppan.\\" (Kimura has said that he personally doesn't really care for the title of \\"Magician.\\") His breathtaking sculpting and styling of trees on behalf of that Kyoto bonsai magazine publisher was done using hand and power tools of his own design. His skill with carving deadwood quickly made him well known in the bonsai community. While his work was at first highly controversial, his energy and vision soon became as respected as his art. A characteristic of his trees is a defined interplay of artistically sculptured deadwood with a smaller amount of more traditionally appearing live wood snaking up from the soil to foliage apex. Many of his trees have a more elaborate starkness than is ordinarily found in the wild, innovatively creative without historic model. Because of Kimura's willingness to break with convention, many in Japan refused to take him seriously, at least in the early years. Nowadays, no one disputes Kimura's genius or his pioneering position in the bonsai world. The sometimes controversial author and videotape producer has traveled in many countries, doing presentations and demonstrations. He first demonstrated and conducted a workshop outside Japan at the 1987 Golden State Federation Bonsai Convention in Anaheim, California. Kimura has demonstrated at these other major conventions, among others: Golden State Bonsai Federation (1990 Burlingame and 2006 Sacramento); World Bonsai Friendship Federation (1989 Omiya, Japan; 1997 Seoul, Korea; and 2017 Saitama, Japan); European Bonsai Association (1990 Turin, Italy and 1992 Luxembourg); Bonsai Clubs International (1992 Memphis, Tennessee, 1996 Washington, D.C. and 2006 Foshan City, China); American Bonsai Society Symposium (2000 Detroit, Michigan); Asia-Pacific Bonsai and Suiseki Exhibition and Convention (2003 Manila, Philippines and 2011 Takamatsu, Japan); Federati√≥n Latino Americana de Bonsai (2003 Caracas, Venezuela); and Association of Australian Clubs (2005 Sydney). His work as documented in the form of articles and photographs has graced the pages of many major specialty publications around the world. Trees designed by him, mostly Juniperus chinensis var. Shimpaku, won the prestigious Prime Minister's Award for the years 1988, 1995, 2000, and 2001, and the Minister of Education Award in 1999. He has had a number of students and apprentices from Japan, Europe, and America, several of which have gone on to become masters in their own right. These include Marco Invernizzi, Salvatore Liporace, Ernie Kuo, Marc Noelanders, Kawabe Takeo, and Ryan Neil. Katsuhito Onishi edited the Japanese texts The Magical Technician of Kindai Shuppan in 1982, Part II in 1984, and Part III in 1989.

The town is mainly Protestant and hosts numerous Protestant/loyalist marches each summer, but has a significant Catholic minority. The Orange Order (a Protestant, unionist organization) insists that it should be allowed to march its traditional route to and from Drumcree Church on the Sunday before the Twelfth of July. However, most of this route is through the mainly Catholic/Irish nationalist part of town. The residents, who see the march as sectarian, triumphalist\\"Drumcree tension eases\\". BBC News. 13 May 1999. and supremacist, have sought to ban it from their area.\\"Big changes in character of Drumcree dispute\\". Irish Independent. July 1998. The Orangemen see this as an attack on their traditions; they had marched the route since 1807, when the area was mostly farmland. There has been intermittent violence over the march since the 1800s. The outbreak of the Troubles led to the dispute intensifying in the 1970s and 1980s. At this time, the most contentious part of the route was the outward leg along Obins Street. After serious violence two years in a row, the march was banned from Obins Street in 1986. The focus then shifted to the march's return leg along Garvaghy Road. Each July from 1995‚Äì2000, the dispute drew international attention as it sparked protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, prompted a massive police and British Army operation, and threatened to derail the peace process. The situation in Portadown was likened to a \\"war zone\\"\\"Parade fervour turns country lane into war zone\\". The Guardian. 3 July 1999. and a \\"siege\\".\\"Siege of Drumcree\\". BBC News. 5 July 1998. During this time, the dispute led to the killing of at least six Catholic civilians. In 1995 and 1996, residents succeeded in stopping the march. This led to a standoff at Drumcree between the security forces and thousands of Orangemen/loyalists. Following a wave of loyalist violence, police allowed the march through. In 1997, security forces locked down the Catholic area and let the march through, citing loyalist threats to kill Catholics if it were stopped. This sparked widespread protests and violence by Irish nationalists. From 1998 onward, the march was banned from Garvaghy Road and the army sealed off the Catholic area with large steel, concrete and barbed-wire barricades. Each year there was a major standoff at Drumcree and widespread loyalist violence. Since 2001 things have been relatively calm, but moves to get the two sides into face-to-face talks have failed. Background An \\"Orange Arch\\" in Annalong. Similar arches are erected in Portadown each summer, including one at the end of the mainly nationalist and Catholic Garvaghy Road.\\"Anger as arch on Garvaghy Road is painted\\". Portadown Times (17 July 2009) Portadown has long been mainly Protestant and unionist. At the height of the conflict in the 1990s, about 70% of the population were from a Protestant background and 30% from a Catholic background. The town's Catholics and Irish nationalists, as in the rest of Northern Ireland, had long suffered discrimination, especially in employment.Mulholland, Peter. \\"Drumcree: A Struggle for Recognition\\". Irish Journal of Sociology, Vol. 9. 1999. Throughout the 20th century, the police‚ÄîRoyal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)‚Äîwas also almost wholly Protestant. Each summer the town centre is bedecked with loyalist flags and symbols. A loyalist arch is raised over the Garvaghy Road at the Corcrain River, just inside the Catholic district. This is to coincide with the \\"marching season\\", when numerous Protestant and loyalist marches are held in the town. Each July there are five Protestant or loyalist parades that enter the mainly nationalist district: *The \\"Drumcree Sunday\\" parade from the town centre, to Drumcree Church, and back again. This is the biggest of the parades. Its traditional route was Obins Street‚ÜíCorcrain Road‚ÜíDungannon Road‚ÜíDrumcree Road‚ÜíGarvaghy Road, but it is now banned from Obins Street and Garvaghy Road. *12 July parade. This involves a morning march from Corcrain Orange Hall to the town centre. The marchers then travel to a bigger parade elsewhere, return to the town centre in the evening, and march back to Corcrain Orange Hall. Its traditional route was along Obins Street, but it is now along Corcrain Road. *13 July parade. This follows the same format as the 12th parade. There is also a junior Orange parade each May along the lower Garvaghy Road at Victoria Terrace. =Map= Routes of the Protestant parades before they were banned from Obins Street (A) in 1986. border Red line: Route taken by Orangemen on the Sunday before 12 July; from their Carlton Street Hall (D) under the railway bridge (C) along Obins Street (A) to Drumcree Church (F) and back along Garvaghy Road (B). Blue line: Route taken on 12 July; from Corcrain Hall (E) along Obins Street (A) and under the railway bridge (C). Green areas are largely nationalist and Catholic. Orange areas are largely unionist and Protestant. =Before partition= The Orange Order was founded in 1795 in the village of Loughgall, a few miles from Drumcree, after the Battle of the Diamond. Its first ever marches were held on 12 July 1796 in Portadown, Lurgan and Waringstown.McCormack, W J. The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001. Page 317. The area is thus seen as the birthplace of Orangeism.Dominic Bryan. Drumcree and the \\"Right to March\\": Orangeism, Ritual and Politics in Northern Ireland, in T G Fraser, ed., The Irish Parading Tradition: Following the Drum, Houndmills 2000, p.194. In July 1795, the year the Order formed, a Reverend Devine had held a Battle of the Boyne commemoration sermon at Drumcree Church. In his History of Ireland Vol I (published in 1809), historian Francis Plowden described what followed this sermon: > [Reverend Devine] so worked up the minds of his audience, that upon retiring > from service [...] they gave full scope to the anti-papistical zeal, with > which he had inspired them; falling upon every Catholic they met, beating > and bruising them without provocation or distinction, breaking the doors and > windows of their houses, and actually murdering two unoffending Catholics in > a bog. The first official Orange parade to and from Drumcree Church was in July 1807. Originally and traditionally it was to celebrate the Battle of the Boyne, but the Order now claims that it commemorates the Battle of the Somme during World War I.McKay, Susan. Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People - Portadown. Blackstaff Press (2000). Each July, the Orangemen have marched from the town centre to Drumcree via Obins Street/Dungannon Road and returned along Garvaghy Road. In the early 19th century, this area was mostly farmland. In 1835, Armagh magistrate William Hancock (a Protestant) wrote that \\"For some time past the peaceable inhabitants of the parish of Drumcree have been insulted and outraged by large bodies of Orangemen parading the highways, playing party tunes, firing shots and using the most opprobrious epithets they could invent\\". He added that the Orangemen go \\"a considerable distance out of their way\\" to pass a Catholic chapel on their march to Drumcree. There was violence during the Drumcree parades in 1873, 1883, 1885, 1886, 1892, 1903, 1905, 1909 and 1917.Bryan, Fraser, Dunn. Political Rituals: Loyalist Parades in Portadown - Part 3 - Portadown and its Orange Tradition. CAIN =After partition= After the partition of Ireland in 1921, the Northern Ireland Government's policy tended to favour Protestant and unionist parades. From 1922 to 1950, almost 100 parades and meetings were banned under the Special Powers Act ‚Äì nearly all were Irish nationalist or republican.Laura K. Dohohue, 'Regulating Northern Ireland: The Special Powers Acts, 1922-1972', The Historical Journal, 41, 4 (1998), p.1093. Although violence died down during this period, there were clashes at the 1931 and 1950 Drumcree parades. The Public Order Act 1951 exempted \\"traditional\\" parades from having to ask police permission, but \\"non- traditional\\" parades could be banned or re-routed without appeal. Again, the legislation tended to benefit Protestant parades.Neil Jarman and Dominic Bryan, 'Green Parades in an Orange State: Nationalist and Republican Commemorations and Demonstrations from Partition to the Troubles, 1920-1970', in T.G. Fraser, ed., The Irish Parading Tradition: Following the Drum, London and New York, 2000, p.102. In the 1960s, housing estates were built along Garvaghy Road. In 1969, Northern Ireland was plunged into a conflict known as the Troubles. Portadown underwent major population shifts; these new estates became almost wholly Catholic, while the rest of the town's estates became almost wholly Protestant. Many Orangemen joined the Northern Ireland security forces: the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).\\"Memorial to honour the Orange victims\\". Portadown Times. 27 April 2007. Retrieved 1 April 2011. 1970s and 1980s: Obins Street The underpass leading from the town centre (behind camera) to Obins Street (beyond the bridge). The area is known as \\"the Tunnel\\". =1972= In March 1972, thousands of loyalists attended an Ulster Vanguard rally in the town, which was addressed by Martin Smyth (\\"Grand Master\\" of the Orange Order) and the mayor of Portadown. After the rally, loyalists attacked the Catholic neighbourhood around Obins Street, known as \\"The Tunnel\\".Mulholland, Peter. Two-Hundred Years in the Citadel. 2010. Following this, Catholic residents formed a protest group named the \\"Portadown Resistance Council\\", which called for the upcoming marches to be re-routed away from Obins Street (see map).Eric Kaufmann, The Orange Order: a contemporary Northern Irish history. Oxford University Press, 2007. p 154. The Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a then- legal loyalist vigilante and paramilitary group, warned of consequences if anything was done to stop the march.Belfast Telegraph, 11 July 1972, p.1. The day before the march, Catholics sealed off Obins Street with makeshift barricades. On the morning of the march, Sunday 9 July, British troops and riot police moved in to secure the area. When they bulldozed the barricades they were stoned by Catholic protesters and responded by firing CS gas and rubber bullets. Once the area was secured, they allowed the 1,200 Orangemen to march along the road, which was lined by at least fifty masked and uniformed UDA members.Belfast Telegraph, 12 July 1972, p.4.Bryan, Dominic. Orange parades: the politics of ritual, tradition, and control. Pluto Press, 2000. Page 92. The UDA men then made their way to Drumcree and escorted the Orangemen back into town along Garvaghy Road. With troops and police out in force, the march passed peacefully. However, on 12 July, three men were shot dead in Portadown. A Protestant, Paul Beattie, was shot in Churchill Park, a housing estate off Garvaghy Road. Hours later, a UDA member (and former police officer) entered McCabe's Bar and shot the Catholic pub-owner, Jack McCabe, and a Protestant customer, William Cochrane.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. Mainstream, 1999. p.219 That day, under tight security, the Orangemen again marched along Obins Street, this time from Corcrain Orange Hall to the town centre. On 15 July, Catholic civilian Felix Hughes was kidnapped, beaten, tortured and shot dead by the UDA in a Protestant area of the town. He had been a long-time member of St Patrick's Accordion Band based on Obins Street.McKittrick, p.225 Later in the month, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated a bomb on Woodhouse Street, and loyalists bombed a Catholic church. In the Obins Street area there was also a gun battle involving the IRA, the UDA, and the security forces. The UDA's involvement in the 1972 dispute made a lasting impression on Portadown's Catholics and Irish nationalists.Mervyn Jess. The Orange Order. Dublin, 2007. p.101 The IRA warned that the UDA would not be allowed to repeat such actions. =1985= On Saint Patrick's Day 1985 the Saint Patrick's Accordion Band (a local Catholic marching band) was given permission to parade a two-mile \\"circuit\\" of the mainly Catholic area.Kaufmann. p 155. However, a small part of the two-mile route (about 150 yards of Park Road) was lined with Protestant-owned houses. Arnold Hatch, the town's Ulster Unionist Party mayor, demanded the march be banned.Bryan, Fraser, Dunn. Political Rituals: Loyalist Parades in Portadown - Part 4 - 1985 & 1986\\\\. CAIN When the police let it go ahead, Hatch and a small group of loyalists staged a sit-down protest on Park Road. The police forced the band to turn around. That evening, the band again tried to march the route. Although the protesters had gone, police again stopped the band and there was a confrontation between police and residents. Following this incident, Portadown Catholics boosted their campaign to ban Orange marches from Obins Street. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician Br√≠d Rodgers described this incident as \\"pivotal\\" in the escalation of the parade dispute. Shortly before the Drumcree parade of 7 July 1985, hundreds of residents staged a sit-down protest on Obins Street. Present was Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of former US president John F. Kennedy. Among the 2,000 Orangemen were unionist politicians Martin Smyth (the Orange \\"Grand Master\\"), Harold McCusker and George Seawright. Riot police, armed with batons, forcefully removed the protesters and allowed the march to continue. At least one man was beaten unconscious by police and many were arrested. The whole length of Garvaghy Road was lined with British Army and police armoured vehicles for the march's return leg. At one point stones were thrown at the marchers and an Orangeman was injured. Police announced that the 12 and 13 July marches would be re-routed away from Obins Street. On 12 July, eight Orange lodges and hundreds of loyalist bandsmen met at Corcrain Orange Hall and tried to march through Obins Street to the town centre. When they were blocked by police, hundreds of loyalists gathered at both ends of Obins Street and attacked police lines for several hours. These clashes resumed the following evening and loyalists attacked police with ball bearings fired from slingshots. In the two-day clashes, at least 52 police officers and 28 rioters were injured, 37 people were arrested (including two Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers) and about 50 Catholic-owned homes and businesses were attacked. After this, police erected a barrier at each end of Obins Street. In July 1985, residents of the Catholic district formed a group called People Against Injustice, later renamed the Drumcree Faith & Justice Group (DFJG). It quickly became the main group representing the residents. The DFJG sought to explain to Orangemen how residents felt about the marches and to improve cross- community relations.Organizations: M, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) It organized peaceful protests, issued newsletters and held talks with police. It also tried, unsuccessfully, to hold talks with the Orangemen. One of the key figures in this group was a Jesuit priest who, during one of his Sunday sermons in Portadown, suggested that anyone who voted for Sinn F√©in should consider themselves excommunicated. =1986= The Apprentice Boys of Derry, a Protestant fraternity similar to the Orange Order, had planned to march along Garvaghy Road and through the town centre on the afternoon of 1 April (Easter Monday). On 31 March, police decided to ban the march as it believed loyalist paramilitaries were planning to hijack it. That evening, cars with loudspeakers toured Protestant areas and summoned people to gather in the town centre to contest the ban. At 1am, at least 3,000 loyalists gathered in the town centre, forced their way past a small group of police, and began marching along Garvaghy Road. Among them was Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and Free Presbyterian Church. Residents claimed that some of the marchers were carrying guns and were known to be members of the police and UDR. Some of the marchers attacked houses along the route and residents claimed the police did little or nothing to stop this. There followed rioting between residents and the police, and residents set up barricades for fear of further attacks. There was a feeling among locals that police had \\"mutinied\\" and refused to enforce the ban. In the afternoon, Apprentice Boys bands tried to enter the town centre for their planned march. When police blocked them, a fierce riot erupted. After negotiations, the bands were allowed to march through the town centre with some restrictions. However, loyalists then attacked police who had sealed off Obins Street. One of the loyalists, Keith White, was shot in the face by a plastic bullet and died in hospital on 14 April. Police again decided that the Drumcree Sunday parade would be allowed along Obins Street with some restrictions, but that the 12 and 13 July parades would be re-routed. On 6 July 1985, an estimated 4,000 soldiers and police were deployed in the town for the Drumcree parade. Police said the Orange Order had allowed \\"known troublemakers\\" to take part in the march, contrary to a prior agreement.The Calgary Herald, 7 July 1986 Among them was George Seawright, a unionist politician and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member who had proposed burning Catholics in ovens. As the march entered the Catholic district, police seized Seawright and others. Orangemen then attacked the police and journalists. A Catholic priest was assaulted by loyalists and at Drumcree a police landrover was overturned. Catholic youths also threw missiles at the police and marchers. At least 27 officers were injured. The 12 July march into the town centre was blocked from Obins Street for the second year. Instead, police escorted the march along Garvaghy Road without any bands. Although there was no violence on Garvaghy Road, loyalists later rioted with police in the town centre and tried to smash through the barrier leading to Obins Street. =1987 and 1988= In 1987 the Public Order Act was repealed by the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, which removed the special status of \\"traditional\\" parades. This meant that, after 1986, Orange marches were effectively banned from Obins Street indefinitely.Kaufmann. p 158. The July 1987 march was re-routed and 3,000 soldiers and 1,000 police were sent to keep order. Orangemen believed that sacrificing the Obins Street leg meant they would be guaranteed the Garvaghy Road leg. Although the Garvaghy Road leg had caused trouble before, it was less populated than Obins Street at the time. In June 1988 the Drumcree Faith & Justice Group (DFJG)‚Äîthe group representing the Catholic/Irish nationalist residents‚Äîplanned a march to the town centre to highlight what it saw as \\"double-standards\\" in the police's handling of nationalist and loyalist parades. It asked permission from police, saying there would be only 30 marchers and they would carry no flags or banners. They were denied permission. 1990s and 2000s: Garvaghy Road A mural supporting the Portadown Orangemen on Shankill Road, Belfast. On the left of the picture is a UDA/UFF flag. Although a few years passed without serious conflict over the Drumcree parades, both sides remained unhappy with the situation. Orangemen took the new route each year, but continued to apply for marches along Obins Street. Meanwhile, residents of Garvaghy Road and the surrounding Catholic district (see map) remained unhappy about what they viewed as \\"triumphalist\\" Orange marches through their area. They made their opposition known in a number of ways: through the tenants' associations that represented each housing estate, through the Drumcree Faith & Justice Group (DFJG), and through local politicians. A 1993 survey of people living on Garvaghy Road found that 95% of them were against Orange marches in the area. =Lead-up to July 1995= In 1994, the Provisional IRA and loyalist paramilitary groups called ceasefires. In May 1995 the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition (GRRC) was formed, comprising representatives from the DFJG and the tenants' associations.The Rosemary Nelson Inquiry Report (23 May 2011), pp.71-74 Its main goal was to divert Orange marches away from Garvaghy Road through peaceful means. It held peaceful protests, petitioned the police and government ministers, and tried to draw media attention to the dispute. The GRRC held regular public meetings with residents. There were usually about 12 representatives on the committee at any one time. According to one of its members, Joanne Tennyson, \\"Although the GRRC could speak to anyone they wanted, at the end of the day no-one in the committee had the right to say we would do anything, not even [...] the spokesman. The community had to agree as a whole and that was the purpose of holding public meetings\\". The GRRC's first secretary was Father Eamon Stack, a Jesuit priest and DFJG member who had lived in the area since 1993. Stack emphasized that the GRRC was non-sectarian and was not connected to any political parties. With the coalition chairman, he would remain its joint spokesman until after July 1997. The first chairman of the GRRC was Malachy Trainor. He stepped down after a week faced with threats from Loyalist terrorists who had already killed two his brothers (both Republican activists) and his mother (shot dead in 1975 on the Garvaghy Road after a night out with his Protestant father at a British Legion Club). He was replaced by Breandan MacCoinnaith (Brendan McKenna) who had a reputation as a Republican militant. In 1981 he had been jailed for six years for his part in a bomb attack in Portadown town centre. David Trimble, then the local Unionist MP, was to cite the presence \\"at the centre\\" of the GRRC of \\"a person, put forward as a spokesman, with a record of republican activity\\" as reason for refusing \\"to have dealings\\" with the group. By the mid-1990s, the population of Portadown was about 70% Protestant and 30% Catholic. There were three Orange halls in the town and an estimated 40 Protestant/loyalist marches each summer.The Rosemary Nelson Inquiry Report (23 May 2011), p.70 =1995= On Sunday 9 July 1995, the Orangemen marched to Drumcree Church, held their church service, and then began marching towards the Garvaghy Road. However, hundreds of Catholic residents were holding a sit-down protest on Garvaghy Road to block the march.Mervyn Jess, The Orange Order, Dublin, 2007, p.104. Although the march was legal and the protest was not, police stopped the march from continuing. The Orangemen refused to take an alternative route, announcing that they would stay at Drumcree until they were allowed to continue. The Orangemen refused to negotiate with the residents' group, and the Mediation Network was called upon to intercede. The police and local politicians were also involved in trying to resolve the deadlock. Meanwhile, about 10,000 Orangemen and supporters had gathered at Drumcree and were engaged in a standoff with about 1,000 police. During this standoff, loyalists continuously threw missiles at the police and tried to break through the police blockade; police responded by firing 24 plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked numerous roads across Northern Ireland, and sealed off the port of Larne. There was violence in some Protestant areas. On the evening of Monday 10 July, Ian Paisley (Democratic Unionist Party leader) and David Trimble (soon to be Ulster Unionist Party leader) held a rally at Drumcree. Afterwards, they gathered a number of Orangemen and tried to push through the police line, but were taken away by officers. By the morning of Tuesday 11 July, a compromise was reached. The Orangemen would be allowed to march along Garvaghy Road on condition that they did so silently and without accompanying bands. Ronnie Flanagan (Deputy Chief Constable of the police) told the GRRC that residents should peacefully remove themselves from the road because \\"an angry scene between police and protesters could worsen the Ormeau marching dispute and even destabilise the ceasefires\\". When GRRC chairman Breand√°n Mac Cionnaith asked protesters to clear the road, some heckled him and refused. Flanagan was told there would be a better chance of the protesters moving if they knew there would be no march there next year. Flanagan replied that \\"there was no question of marches going where there was no consent from the community\\". The residents were then persuaded to clear the road. This was all confirmed by the Mediation Network.Statement by the Mediation Network on their role in negotiations at Drumcree, 1995. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). The Orangemen then marched along the road with Paisley and Trimble at the head of the march. As they reached the end of Garvaghy Road, Paisley and Trimble held their hands in the air in what appeared to be a gesture of triumph. Trimble claims that he only took Paisley's hand to prevent the DUP leader from taking all the media attention.Jess, pp.110-1. Both sides were deeply unhappy with the events of July 1995. Residents were angered that the parade had gone ahead and at what they saw as unionist triumphalism, while Orangemen and their supporters were angered that their parade had been held up by an illegal protest. Some Orangemen formed a group called Spirit of Drumcree (SoD) to defend their \\"right to march\\". At a SoD meeting in Belfast's Ulster Hall one of the platform speakers said, to applause: > Sectarian means you belong to a particular sect or organisation. I belong to > the Orange Institution. Bigot means you look after the people you belong to. > That's what I'm doing. I'm a sectarian bigot and proud of it.Jess, p.112. =1996= On Saturday 6 July 1996 the Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, stated that the parade would be banned from Garvaghy Road. Police checkpoints and barricades were set up on all routes into the nationalist area. On Sunday 7 July the march made its way to Drumcree Church and, after the church service, was again blocked by police barricades. At least 4,000 Orangemen and loyalist supporters began another standoff. That afternoon, Orange \\"Grand Master\\" Martin Smyth arrived at Drumcree and announced that there could be no compromise. Over the next three days, buses full of Orangemen and their supporters arrived in Portadown, bringing traffic to a standstill.\\"Questions following U-turn\\". Irish News, 13 July 1996. Retrieved 15 July 2013. By Wednesday night the number of Orangemen and loyalists at Drumcree had risen to 10,000. Again, they pelted the police with missiles and tried to break through the blockade, while police responded with plastic bullets. Loyalists brought an armour-plated bulldozer to Drumcree, threatening to storm the police line. Throughout Northern Ireland, loyalists blocked hundreds of roads, clashed with the police, and attacked or intimidated Catholics and nationalists. Many towns and villages were blockaded, either completely or for much of the daytime. Several Catholic families were forced to flee their homes in Belfast due to loyalist intimidation.Chronology of the Conflict: 1996. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). Human Rights Watch said that the police failed to remove these illegal roadblocks and had \\"abandoned its traditional policing function in some areas\\".Chronology of the Conflict: 1997. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). Loyalists also targeted the homes of police officers, mainly of those on duty at Drumcree. During the disorder, thousands of extra British troops were sent to Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of troops deployed to 18,500. On the night of 7 July, Catholic taxi-driver Michael McGoldrick was shot dead near Lurgan by the Mid Ulster Brigade of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a loyalist paramilitary group.Jess, p.114. It is believed the killing was ordered by the brigade's leader, Billy Wright, from Portadown. Wright was frequently seen at Drumcree in the company of Harold Gracey, head of the Portadown Orange Lodge. He also held a meeting with David Trimble, leader of the UUP. Members of the brigade smuggled homemade weaponry to Drumcree, apparently unhindered by the Orangemen. Allegedly, the brigade also had plans to drive petrol tankers into the Garvaghy area and blow them up.Coogan, Tim. The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal 1966-1995 and the Search for Peace. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. Page 517. On Wednesday 10 July, the police reported that, over the previous four days of loyalist protests, there had been: *100 incidents of intimidation *758 attacks on the police *90 civilians injured *50 police injured *662 plastic bullets fired by the police and *156 arrests made Shortly before noon on Thursday 11 July, the Chief Constable reversed his decision and allowed the Orangemen to march along Garvaghy Road. The residents' group had not been consulted on this and rioting erupted as police in armoured vehicles flooded the Garvaghy area and batoned hundreds of protesters off the Garvaghy Road. About 1,200 Orangemen then marched down the road while residents were hemmed into their estates by riot police. There was outrage among the Catholic/nationalist community, who believed that the police had \\"surrendered\\" to loyalist violence and the threat of violence. An article in the Irish News concluded that \\"the police did not have the will to impose the rule of law on the Orange Order and loyalists\\". The Chief Constable said he believed the situation could no longer be contained. He claimed the crowd at Drumcree was expected to rise to 60,000 or 70,000 that night and would have broken through the defences and attacked the nationalist area. Nationalists argued that the police did nothing to stop the thousands of loyalists from gathering. Rioting erupted in nationalist areas of Lurgan, Armagh, Belfast and Derry. In Derry, 22 protesters were seriously injured and one, Dermot McShane, died after being run-over by a British Army armoured vehicle. An inquest later ruled that Private Daniel Moran, the driver, did not follow proper military procedures. The rioting was some of the worst in Derry during the Troubles. Rioting continued throughout the week, during which time the police fired 6,000 plastic bullets, 5,000 of which were directed at nationalists. The Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), who had sent members to observe the situation, condemned this \\"completely indiscriminate\\" use of plastic bullets. Human Rights Watch also accused the police of using \\"excessive force\\". Following the events, leaders of Sinn F√©in and the SDLP stated that nationalists had completely lost faith in the police as an impartial police force. In August 1996, Billy Wright and his Portadown unit of the UVF were \\"stood down\\" by the UVF leadership for breaking the ceasefire. The UVF warned Wright to leave Northern Ireland. He ignored the warning, and a large rally was held in Portadown in support of him. Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge) and William McCrea (a DUP politician) attended the rally and made speeches in support of Wright.Sydney Elliott & William D Flackes. Conflict in Northern Ireland: An Encyclopedia. Abc-Clio Incorporated, 1999. p.92. Along with most of his Portadown unit, Wright then formed a splinter group called the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). Following the events of July 1996, many Catholics and nationalists began boycotting businesses run by Orangemen who had been involved in the standoff. =1997= A placard opposing Orange marches in nationalist areas. Similar placards were used by protesters during the 1997 crisis In May 1997 a local Catholic, Robert Hamill, was kicked to death by a gang of loyalists on Portadown's main street. He and his friends were attacked while walking home. Weeks before the July 1997 march, Secretary of State Mo Mowlam privately decided to let the march proceed along Garvaghy Road. However, in the days leading up to the march, she insisted that no decision had been made. Garvaghy Road residents applied to hold a festival on the day of the march. When this was banned by the police, local women set up a peace camp along the Garvaghy Road. On Thursday 3 July, the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) threatened to kill Catholic civilians if the march was blocked and the Ulster Unionist Party threatened to withdraw from the Northern Ireland peace process.Jess, p.130. The following day, sixty families had to be evacuated from their homes on Garvaghy Road after a loyalist bomb threat. In the days leading up to the march, thousands of British troops were flown to Northern Ireland. Less than twelve hours before the Sunday 6 July march, the authorities still did not say whether it would be blocked. Then, at 3:30 am that morning, 1500 police and soldiers swept into the nationalist area in armoured vehicles and took control of the Garvaghy Road. About 100 residents managed to get to the road and stage a sit-down protest.The Rosemary Nelson Inquiry Report (23 May 2011), pp.86-88 They were forcefully removed by the police, who were then pelted with stones and petrol bombs as they pushed residents further back from the road. Rosemary Nelson‚Äîa prominent human rights lawyer and the GRRC's legal advisor‚Äîwas physically and verbally abused by police officers. From this point onward, residents were prevented from leaving their housing estates and accessing the Garvaghy Road. As residents were also unable to reach the Catholic , the local priests held an open-air mass in front of a line of soldiers and armoured personnel carriers. The Chief Constable said he had allowed the march to go ahead because of the threat to Catholic civilians by loyalist paramilitaries. About 1,200 Orangemen marched along Garvaghy Road at noon that day. After the march passed, the security forces began withdrawing from the area and severe rioting began. They were attacked by hundreds of nationalists with stones, bricks and petrol bombs. The security forces fired about 40 plastic bullets, and about 18 people were taken to hospital. As news from Portadown emerged, violence erupted in several nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. The Provisional IRA launched numerous gun and bomb attacks on the security forces. Nationalists also attacked the security forces and blocked roads with burning vehicles. There were protests against the police and Orange marches, and a number of Orange halls were burnt. The widespread violence lasted until 10 July, when the Orange Order decided unilaterally to re-route or cancel several marches. By the end of the violence, more than 100 civilians and 60 police officers had been injured, while 117 people had been arrested. There had been 815 attacks on the security forces, 1,506 petrol bombs thrown and 402 hijackings. The police had fired 2,500 plastic bullets. In 1997, Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams told an RT√â journalist of his party's involvement in the dispute: > Ask any activist in the north, 'did Drumcree happen by accident?', and he > will tell you, 'no'. Three years of work on the lower Ormeau Road, Portadown > and parts of Fermanagh and Newry, Armagh and in Bellaghy and up in Derry. > Three years of work went into creating that situation and fair play to those > people who put the work in.

Irish Independent. 14 July 2002. Retrieved 9 March 2011. After July 1997, GRRC member Breand√°n Mac Cionnaith replaced Eamon Stack as the group's spokesman. Mac Cionnaith had been convicted and imprisoned for his involvement in a 1981 IRA bomb attack on Portadown's Royal British Legion hall. He was released in 1984. This was the last time that the Orange Order was allowed to march on Garvaghy Road.Daugherty Rasnic, Carol (2003). Northern Ireland: can Sean and John live in peace? Brandylane Publishers Inc, p. 54. =1998= Early in 1998 the Public Processions Act was passed, establishing the Parades Commission. The Commission was now responsible for deciding what route contentious marches should take. On 29 June 1998, the Parades Commission decided to ban the march from Garvaghy Road. On Friday 3 July about 1,000 soldiers and 1,000 police were deployed in Portadown. The soldiers built large barricades (made of steel, concrete and barbed wire) across all roads leading into the nationalist area. In the fields between Drumcree Church and the nationalist area they dug a trench, fourteen feet wide,Kaufmann, Eric P. The Orange Order: a contemporary Northern Irish history. Oxford University Press, 2007. Page 198. which was then lined with rows of barbed wire. Soldiers also occupied the Catholic Drumcree College, St John the Baptist Primary School, and some properties near the barricades. On Sunday 5 July the Orangemen marched to Drumcree Church and stated that they would remain there until they were allowed to proceed. About 10,000 Orangemen and loyalists arrived at Drumcree from across Northern Ireland.Chronology of the Conflict: 1998. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). A loyalist group calling itself \\"Portadown Action Command\\" issued a statement which read: > As from midnight on Friday 10 July 1998, any driver of any vehicle supplying > any goods of any kind to the Gavaghy Road will be summarily executed. Over the next ten days, there were loyalist protests and violence across Northern Ireland in response to the ban. Loyalists blocked roads and attacked the security forces as well as Catholic homes, businesses, schools and churches. On 7 July, the mainly-Catholic village of Dunloy was \\"besieged\\" by over 1,000 Orangemen. The County Antrim Grand Lodge said that its members had \\"taken up positions\\" and \\"held\\" the village. On 8 July, eight blast bombs were thrown at Catholic homes in the Collingwood area of Lurgan. There were also sustained attacks on the security forces at Drumcree and attempts to break through the blockade. On 9 July, the security forces at Drumcree were attacked with gunfire and blast bombs; they responded with plastic bullets. The police recorded 2,561 \\"public order incidents\\" throughout Northern Ireland, including: *615 attacks on the security forces, which left 76 police offices injured *24 shooting incidents *45 blast bombs thrown *632 petrol bombs thrown *837 plastic bullets fired by the security forces *144 houses and 165 other buildings attacked (the vast majority owned by Catholics/nationalists) *467 vehicles damaged and 178 vehicles hijacked, and *284 people arrested On Sunday 12 July, Jason (aged 8), Mark (aged 9) and Richard Quinn (aged 10) were burnt to death when their home was petrol bombed by loyalists. The boys' mother was a Catholic, and their home was in a mainly-Protestant part of Ballymoney. Following the murders, William Bingham (County Grand Chaplain of Armagh and member of the Orange Order negotiating team) said that \\"walking down the Garvaghy Road would be a hollow victory, because it would be in the shadow of three coffins of little boys who wouldn't even know what the Orange Order is about\\". He said that the Order had lost control of the situation and that \\"no road is worth a life\\".Jess, pp.134-5. However he later apologized for implying that the Order was responsible for the deaths.Jess, p.136. The murders provoked widespread anger and calls for the Order to end its protest at Drumcree. Although the number of protesters at Drumcree dropped considerably, the Portadown lodges voted unanimously to continue their standoff. On Wednesday 15 July the police began a search operation in the fields at Drumcree. A number of loyalist weapons were found, including a homemade machine gun, spent and live ammunition, explosive devices, and two crossbows with more than a dozen homemade explosive arrows. =1999= In the year after July 1998, the Orange Order and GRRC tried to resolve the dispute through \\"proximity talks\\" using go-betweens, as the Orangemen refused to talk directly to the GRRC. Some senior Portadown Orangemen claim that they had been promised a parade on Garvaghy Road later that year if they could control things on the traditional parading dates.Jess, p.139. Throughout the year the Orangemen and supporters held scores of protest rallies and marches in Portadown. Following one protest in September 1998, a Catholic RUC officer was killed by a blast bomb thrown by loyalist rioters. A renegade loyalist group, the Orange Volunteers, also began carrying out attacks on Catholics and Irish nationalists. On 14 March 1999, the Parades Commission said the yearly march would again be banned from Garvaghy Road. The following day the GRRC's legal advisor, Rosemary Nelson, was assassinated in Lurgan by loyalists. In April, Portadown loyalists threatened to picket St John's Catholic Church at the top of Garvaghy Road. On 29 May a \\"junior\\" Orange march passed near Garvaghy Road. There were clashes following the march with 13 police officers and four civilians hurt. The police fired 50 plastic bullets during the clashes. That month, DUP politician and Orangeman Paul Berry said Orangemen would not be stopped from marching the Garvaghy Road: \\"If it is a matter of taking the law into our own hands then we are going to have to do it. That is a threat\\". On 24 June, Orangemen began a ten-day \\"Long March\\" from Derry to Drumcree in protest at the ban. The 1999 Drumcree march took place on Sunday 4 July. About 1,300 Orangemen marched to Drumcree and were met by several thousand supporters. The security forces had again blocked all roads leading into the nationalist area with large steel, concrete and barbed wire barricades. Rows of barbed wire were also stretched across the fields at Drumcree. There, loyalists threw missiles at police and soldiers, but there was less violence than the year before. On 5 July, police in Portadown arrested four Belfast loyalists after finding pickaxe handles, wire cutters, petrol and combat clothing in their car. Later that day, six officers were hurt in clashes with loyalists near Garvaghy Road. The barricades were eventually removed on 14 July. On 31 July, a drunken loyalist wielding an AK-47 and a handgun crossed the interface to Craigwell Avenue, a street of Catholic-owned houses. A resident wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him,\\"Local heroes capture gunman\\". Republican News. 5 August 1999. but was shot and wounded while doing so. The loyalist was arrested and later convicted for attempted murder.\\"Wounded man hailed as 'hero'\\". BBC News. 29 June 2000. In August, breeze blocks were thrown through the windows of houses on the street.Sectarian attacks: August 1999 . Pat Finucane Centre Also that year, the GRRC published a book detailing the history of Orange parades in the area. The book was called Garvaghy: A Community Under Siege. In 1999, the Orange Order's membership for the Portadown district, which had increased from 1995 through 1998, began a \\"catastrophic slump\\".http://www.sneps.net/wp- content/uploads/2011/09/1-Dominant-Ethnicity-demography-and-conflict_revision- Dec2010.pdf =2000= ;April‚ÄìJune In April 2000, a newspaper reported that Portadown Orangemen had threatened British Prime Minister Tony Blair, saying that if that year's march was banned from Garvaghy Road it would prove to be his \\"Bloody Sunday\\".Sectarian attacks: April 2000 .

Present at the concert were Secretary of State Peter Mandelson and UUP leader (and Orangeman) David Trimble. After the concert, teachers, parents, children and guests held a reception at the Protestant Portadown College. A 300-strong loyalist mob hurled missiles and sectarian abuse while preventing families from leaving the College. The security forces were deployed but did not disperse the mob or make arrests. On 7 June, St John's Catholic Church was set alight by arsonists.Sectarian attacks: June 2000 . Pat Finucane Centre On 16 June, Catholic workers at Denny's factory in Portadown walked-out after placards carrying sectarian slogans were erected near the main entrance. The week before, loyalists had thrown missiles at Catholics leaving the factory. The placards were removed shortly after. Later in the month, loyalists sent death threats to workers who were reinforcing the security barrier (or \\"peace line\\") along Corcrain Road. The work stopped, leaving the nationalist area vulnerable to attack. ;July In July, it was revealed that members of neo-Nazi group Combat 18 were travelling from England to join the Orangemen at Drumcree. They were given shelter by LVF members in Portadown and Tandragee. That month, Portadown Orangeman Ivan Hewitt (who sported neo-Nazi tattoos) warned in a TV documentary that it may be time for loyalists to \\"bring their war to Britain\\".Sectarian attacks: 8-14 July 2000 . Pat Finucane Centre The 2000 Drumcree march took place on Sunday 2 July. It was again banned from Garvaghy Road and the nationalist area was sealed off with barricades. Speaking after the march was stopped, Orange \\"District Master\\" Harold Gracey called for protests across Northern Ireland.Sectarian attacks: 1-7 July 2000 . Pat Finucane Centre A prominent leader of the protesters, Mark Harbinson, a Stoneyford Orangeman who was associated with the paramilitary Orange Volunteers, proclaimed that \\"the war begins today\\". On Monday 3 July a crowd of over fifty loyalists, led by UDA commander Johnny Adair, appeared at Drumcree with a banner bearing \\"Shankill Road UFF\\" [Ulster Freedom Fighters]. In the Corcrain area, LVF gunmen fired a volley of shots in the air for Adair and a cheering crowd. On Tuesday 4 July, security forces used water cannon against loyalist rioters at the Drumcree barricade. This was their first deployment in Northern Ireland for over 30 years. In an interview on 7 July, Harold Gracey refused to condemn the violence linked to the protests, saying \\"Gerry Adams doesn't condemn violence so I'll not\\". On 9 July, the police warned that loyalists had threatened to \\"kill a Catholic a day\\" until the Orangemen were allowed to march along Garvaghy Road. Two days later, a group of 150‚Äì200 loyalists ordered all shops in Portadown's town centre to shut. Along with another group, they then tried to march on Garvaghy Road from both ends, but were held back by police. That night, 21 police officers were hurt during clashes with loyalists. On 14 July, Portadown Orangemen's calls for another day of widespread protest went unheeded as the Armagh and Grand Lodges refused to support their calls. Businesses remained open and only a handful of roads were blocked for a short time. The security barriers were removed and soldiers returned to barracks. =2001 onward= Since July 1998, the Orangemen have applied to march the traditional route every Sunday of the year ‚Äì both the outward leg via Obins Street (which has been banned since 1986) and the return leg via Garvaghy Road.\\"Orangemen accuse Parades Commission of 'talking through its hat'\\" - Portadown Times - 9 March 2010\\"Orange plan Christmas Day parade at Drumcree\\" - Portadown Times - 30 September 2005\\"Police slammed but parade goes off peacefully\\" - Portadown Times - 10 July 2009 They have also held a small protest at Drumcree Church every Sunday.\\"Orangemen sceptical over parading report\\" - Portadown Times - 12 March 2010 Their proposals have been rejected by the Parades Commission. In February 2001, loyalists held protests on the lower Garvaghy Road as part of the run-up to \\"day 1000\\" of the standoff. The GRRC said that up to 300 people, some masked and armed with clubs, intimidated people living on Garvaghy Road. Some protesters also attacked a car with four women inside.Sectarian attacks: February 2001 , Pat Finucane Centre There was further violence in May 2001. On 5 May, 300 Orangemen and supporters tried to march on to Garvaghy Road but were stopped by police. There were some scuffles between Orangemen and police officers. District Master Harold Gracey drew controversy when he said to the police officers: \\"We all know where you come from...you come from the Protestant community, the vast majority of you come from the Protestant community and it is high time that you supported your own Protestant people\\".Sectarian attacks: May 2001 , Pat Finucane Centre On 12 May there were clashes between loyalists and nationalists on Woodhouse Street. On 27 May there were clashes between nationalists and police after a junior Orange march on the lower Garvaghy Road. Four days before the July 2001 Drumcree march, 200 supporters and members of the UDA rallied at Drumcree. The Portadown Orange Lodge claimed that it was powerless to stop such people from gathering and that they could not be held responsible for their actions. Nevertheless, David Jones (the Lodge's spokesman) said that he welcomed any support. Br√≠d Rodgers, a local SDLP politician, called this \\"a further example\\" of the Orangemen's \\"double standards\\".

After the war, he and other refugees traveled to Canada, and en route to Montreal, stopped in Toronto, where he met Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, then a rabbi in Toronto. Rabbi Kamenetsky was impressed by him and later called him back to Toronto where he was given a teaching position in the Talmud Torah and yeshiva. When Rabbi Kamenetsky moved to New York and was appointed rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, Rabbi Epstein followed and became a teacher there as well. The two rabbis shared maintained a close relationship, with Rabbi Epstein's wedding taking place in the Kamenetsky home. He was later appointed rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Shaar HaTorah in Queens, named for the yeshiva in Grodno of his wife's grandfather, Rabbi Shimon Shkop.

The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic. The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October 8, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October 15\\\\. The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October 18, Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) on October 20\\\\. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low-pressure area by October 24 and completely dissipated on October 27 without making landfall. Meteorological history A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on September 26, quickly spawning an area of low pressure. Upon the formation of the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September 28\\\\. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October 8\\\\. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275 miles (440 kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October 13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October 14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435 mi (705 km) southwest of Colima, Mexico. The depression was embedded within a broad, low-level cyclone with weak steering currents that caused Fifteen-E to drift southward for the next 30 hours. On October 16, strong easterly wind shear exposed the center of the depression from shower and thunderstorm activity. However, a curving convective band developed around the system, and satellites detected winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). This prompted the National Hurricane Center to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Kiko as it drifted about 430 mi (695 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The intensification was short-lived, and Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours later when the center separated from diminishing convection. On October 17, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm when the low became associated with deep convection. The center remained poorly defined, and winds of tropical storm-force blew only in Kiko's southwest quadrant. Over the next few days, Kiko moved slowly towards the east-northeast as a minimal tropical storm and was forecast to either brush land or to make landfall along the Mexican coast on October 19 or October 20. However, early on October 19, Kiko turned to the northwest when a high-pressure ridge developed over Mexico. Forecasters predicted that the storm would become a strong Category 1 hurricane as it turned away from Mexico and headed to sea. As the ridge pushed the storm away from the coast, weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures allowed Kiko to gradually intensify. The storm reached its peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) 991 mbar (hPa; 29.28 inHg) late on October 20 while located around 175 mi (280 km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it moved away from the coast, an eye began to form. Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection. By the afternoon of October 21, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed. At this time, the weakening system had winds sustained at 50 mph (85 km/h). Early on October 22, a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. That evening, Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm's center and exposed the low. As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area, two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones, it slowly weakened. It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low-pressure area on October 23, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night. The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October 27 over open waters. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Kiko's projected path on October 18, showing the storm striking the Mexican coast On October 18, a tropical storm warning was issued along the Mexican coastline from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero to Manzanillo, Colima, and a tropical storm watch extended northward to La Fortuna, Mexico, as Kiko was forecast to make landfall in that region on October 21\\\\. Above-normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast. Rainfall totals of 4 inches (100 millimetres) to 7 in (180 mm) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10 in (250 mm). As a precaution, port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low-lying areas that might flood. Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors. Emergency procedures were on standby in case conditions became more threatening. As the storm neared land, a ridge over Mexico prevented Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled parallel to the coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas off the coast of Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-five passengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuat√°n and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship. Only two people survived; fifteen bodies were recovered, and nine passengers were never found.

It is part of the Winnipeg School Division and teaches grades 7 to 12. History Grant Park High School is a grade 7-12 combined high school and middle school in Winnipeg, MB. It has a population of approximately 1,200 students and 150 staff. GP is noted for academic, athletic and visual art excellence, and is a draw for many students because of the large variety of programs and courses available at the school. The land currently occupied by the school was originally home to a longstanding M√©tis community commonly known by the name of Rooster Town. Barkwell, Lawrence. http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/07242.Rooster%20Town%201.pdf Grant Park High School was officially opened on November 27, 1959. From the Winnipeg School Division history files: > Grant Park opened in 1959 with the \\"all-purpose\\" plan that was mindful of > the ever-broadening concept of a high school: the original 1959 construction > consisted of seventeen rooms with a visual education classroom, > chemistry/physics classrooms and a biology classroom with lab, art room, > library, music room, electrical and automotive industrial arts shops and an > auditorium-gymnasium. In 1961 an addition was constructed which included > sixteen additional classrooms, two science rooms, food and clothing labs and > two additional industrial arts spaces. A larger addition was built in 1963, > adding twenty-one more classrooms, science room, library, art room, language > lab, a second gymnasium, lunchroom and alterations to the existing building, > which have continued. At the time of its completion and for more than a decade after that, Grant Park was the largest single-floor high school in western Canada. Many renovations and changes have been made to the building over the years, One example is the large windows that once looked out towards Nathaniel Street that were in place at time of construction were eventually changed to the small, square windows of the present by the late nineties. The original paint scheme for the exterior emphasised the natural brick and i-beam construction of the school, a faint memory now. Legend has it that an exact copy of the original school exists somewhere in southern California - that the architect first built down there, then came up here to copy the design. The boarded up recesses in the ceiling around the school supposedly are because of this - skylights were originally installed, copying the Californian design. However, these leaked and had to be covered up, and thus the odd ceiling. Legend aside, the school as originally constructed is quite a bit different than at present. The library was renovated circa 1973, changing it to approximately the current setup. The office has been renovated more than once, with rooms changed around and walls moved. The most recent renovation (2015) was to open up the copy area into one large room and move the staff mailboxes into the main office area. Guidance has also been renovated sometime, along with various Industrial Arts classrooms. The Technology Resource Centre was created out of a few adjoining rooms in 1999-2000, with the introduction of an internet network to the school. Other renovations were also carried out the school at that time to install ethernet cabling and update power distribution in the computer labs. The storage rooms at the end of hallway 1 (17 & 18) were once student washrooms, as recently as the early 1990s. Probably the largest renovation at the school was the creation of the Life Skills area, for Special Ed students in the early 1980s. This saw the shortening of hallway 4, and the loss of six classrooms for the creation of a complex of rooms and areas for Special Ed. There used to be a smoking hallway between halls 2 and 3. That was renovated sometime in the 1980s as well. Academics Grant Park High School offers a wide variety of academic options. Aside from the General Learning Program, an Advanced Program (AP) is offered for gifted students, who learn above grade level. The Advanced Program is available to students in grades 7-12. Middle school students (grades 7-8) can also apply to the Flexible Learning Program (Flex), where students can learn and express their learnings in a number of creative ways. There is also a very supportive and hands-on EAL Program for students ages 14‚Äì21. =Courses Available= Grant Park has a tremendous reputation for the arts as well as sports. The varsity Pirates football team proudly won city championships in 2011. Aside from core subjects [math (pre- calculus, calculus, essential and applied math), English, social studies (geography, history), and science (biology, chemistry, physics)], courses offered include Graphics, Metals, Power Mechanics, Woodworking, Applied Technology, Apprenticeships, Career Development/Lifework, Clothing, Housing and Design, Family Studies, Food and Nutrition, Independent Living, Digital Film-Making, Interactive Media, Yearbook, French, Spanish, Computer Science, Art, Band, Choral, Dance, Jazz Band, Drama, Theatre Technology, Psychology, Community Service, Cultural Exploration, American History, First Nations, Metis and Inuit studies, and Law.https://www.winnipegsd.ca/schools/GrantPark/AcademicsAndClasses/CourseDescriptions/Documents/HS%20Handbook%202014-2015.pdf =Performing Arts= Each year, all grades participate in a main show in the late fall (Ad Astra) where students showcase their talents. There are also a number of other performances throughout the year, including a middle school musical, a high school musical, several special education musicals, Two plays, (One for the high school students and one for middle school), several band concerts, dance competitions, and a middle school performing arts night. Some of these performances are held at the school, but several are held at professional theatres, including The Gas Station Theatre. Courses available relating to performing arts include Performing Arts (7‚Äì8), Junior Drama (9), Senior Drama (10‚Äì12), Choral (9‚Äì12), Band (7‚Äì12), and Dance (9‚Äì12). There are also additional credits that the high school students can earn, including Singers, Performing Arts Credit, and Jazz Band.

In 1595 he signed the Union of Brest which moved the Ruthenian Church from the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to the jurisdiction of the Pope, thus forming the Ruthenian Uniate Church. Life He was born in VolhyniaMichael Rohoza at Encyclopedia of Ukraine about 1540 from a noble Belarusians family in the region of Minsk county. He probably studied in a Jesuit college in Vilnius where he worked as clerk for the prince Bogush Koretsky, a voivode of Vilnius.Holovata, N. Mykhailo Rohoza. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine He later entered in the monastery of the Ascension in Minsk of which he became archimandrite in 1579. In 1589 Patriarch Jeremias II of Constantinople visited the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth on his return trip to Constantinople and, in agreement with king Sigismund III Vasa, deposed the Metropolitan , probably because he was a digamy (the second marriage for priests) and he tolerated this use. King Sigismund, under the advice of such magnates like voivode of Navahrudak Teodor Skumin-Tyszkiewicz and voivode of Kiev Konstanty Ostrogski, appointed Michel Rohoza as Metropolitan of Kiev (Ruthenian Orthodox Church), who was consecrated by Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II in August 1589 in Vilnius. As appointed Metropolitan, he started the reform of the Church, mainly by means of synods as the one summoned in 1590. His targets were reforming the mores of the clergy and a reduction of the meddling of lay people (and of confraternities) in the life of the Church and on monasteries. His attempts of reform were anyway opposed particularly from the stauropegics and the impossibility to carry on the reforms was one of the reasons for looking to Rome.T. Kempa, Metropolita Micha≈Ç Rahoza a unia brzeska, \\"Klio\\", t. 2: 2002, s. 56‚Äì62 Since 1590 Metropolitan of Kiev, Rohoza subscribed with all bishops a document soliciting a union with Catholic Church, conditioning this union of faith that Byzantine rite, liturgical practices and canon law would be preserved. This will was formalized in document on 2 December 1594 and again in two petitions, one to the king and one to Pope Clement VIII, undersigned in Brest on 12 June 1595. The Union of Brest was formally proclaimed 8 October 1596 always in Brest. Even if Rohoza signed the union, he later tried to hinder its action, but without results. Rohoza died between June and August 1599. He was succeeded by the bishop of Volodymyr, Hypatius Pociej, a fierce supporter of the union. Not all the Ukrainians supported the union, and twenty years later, in 1620 the Patriarch of Jerusalem re- established a Kievan Metropolia under his own jurisdiction, which first Metropolitan was Yov Boretsky, so duplicating the hierarchy.

Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track performance, to avoid legal liability, to protect trade secrets, and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact employee satisfaction due to its impact on the privacy of the employees. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.  Surveillance Methods  Due to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring. Software monitoring can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed. Telephone tapping can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company. Video surveillance can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. \\"This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998).\\" Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems. Email monitoring gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act#Employee privacy. Location monitoring can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company. Key logging, or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames. Legality Employee monitoring often is in conflict with employees' privacy. Monitoring collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities. Burks, F. Ethical Issues & Employer Monitoring Internet Usage. Chron.com, 2010. The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule. With employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded (especially during telephone calls). The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. \\"Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees‚Äô online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems.\\" Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct. Legal Uses Businesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to: * Find needed business information when the employee is not available. * Protect security of proprietary information and data. * Prevent or investigate possible criminal activities by employees. * Prevent personal use of employer facilities. * Check for violations of company policy against sending an offensive or pornographic email. * Investigate complaints of harassment. * Check for illegal software. According to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,\\"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship.\\"Kevin, P. P., & Tammy, Y. A. (2011). Computer monitoring: The hidden war of control. International Journal of Management and Information Systems, 15(1), 49-58. Retrieved from http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/IJMIS/article/view/1595 To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary. Legal Issues In January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of BƒÉrbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees‚Äô computers. The employee Mr. BƒÉrbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‚Äòprivate life‚Äô and ‚Äòcorrespondence‚Äô set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. But the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee‚Äôs computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees‚Äô computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights. A year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive. Employee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases. Financial benefits Employee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the illoyal employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance- related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance) In an article in Labour Economics, it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed. An indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to \\"Business 2 Community\\", inaccurately billing clients is always possible because of human error. Such inaccuracies can cause disputes between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. Johnathan Yerby said, \\"The enormity of potential productivity losses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars annually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day.\\" Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time. This often happens during the holidays with online shopping, as well as during March Madness. Employees might spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring is intended to regulate this.

The company grew from a payroll of two to over 400 workers at its peak. Castleberry's was sold by the Castleberry family in 1991 to Robert Kirby. Kirby later sold the company to Connors Brothers Limited, parent company of Bumble Bee Foods of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Due to problems with quality control, the brand experienced problems when it shipped products that were underprocessed, resulting in several cases of botulism and subsequent widespread recall, and the cessation of production at their food processing plant. Canned chili sauce The label affixed to cans of Castleberry's \\"Hot Dog Chili Sauce\\" contaminated with botulinum toxin Beginning in June 2007, eight people contracted botulism due to the consumption of \\"Hot Dog Chili Sauce\\" and other products manufactured by the Castleberry's Food Company plant in Augusta, Georgia, which were under- processed, resulting in the production of botulinum toxin within the cans. At that time, the Castleberry's plant was owned and operated by Bumble Bee. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the food poisoning to Castleberry's Food Company's use of a defective canning process which was inadequate to destroy spores of clostridium botulinum bacteria, thereby enabling the bacteria to produce botulinum toxin as the products aged. An FDA investigation later revealed that the problem arose from the use of canners which \\"had broken alarms, a leaky valve and an inaccurate temperature device.\\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised consumers to dispose of foods recalled due to the food poisoning incidents in the following manner: > Do not open or puncture any unopened can of the recalled product ... Dispose > of food that may be contaminated by placing in a sealable bag, wrapping > another plastic bag around the sealable bag, and then taping tightly. Place > bags in a trash receptacle for non-recyclable trash outside the home and out > of reach of humans and pets. Do not discard the food in a sink, garbage > disposal, or toilet. Avoid splashing and contact with the skin. Wear rubber > or latex gloves when handling open containers of food that you think may be > contaminated. Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 2 minutes > after handling food or containers that may be contaminated. In total, 14 people in seven states (Texas ‚Äì 4, Ohio ‚Äì 3, Indiana ‚Äì 2, Hawaii ‚Äì 2, Georgia ‚Äì 1, New Mexico ‚Äì 1, California ‚Äì 1) contracted botulism poisoning from Castleberry's chili products, under three different brands. The illnesses resulted in litigation against Castleberry's, Bumble Bee Foods, and the equipment manufacturer. Courthouse News Temporary recommencement of food manufacturing Following authorization by the FDA and USDA, Castleberry's Food Company restarted operations at its canning plant in September 2007, producing products which carried substantially different labeling and UPCs from those printed on cans of recalled food. Listed amongst the frequently asked questions on the Castleberry's Food Company Web site from November 2007 was the following query: \\"How do I know Castleberry's Food products are safe to eat?\\" However, in March 2008, the canning plant was closed when the FDA revoked the \\"temporary emergency operating permit\\" that was allowing production to continue. Sale to Hanover Foods After closing, Hanover Foods, best known for frozen and canned vegetables, bought the rights to Castleberry's food and name. Hanover continues to sell products like chili and beef stew under the Castleberry's name.

In 2007 El-Ganayni's U.S. security clearance was revoked, and he subsequently lost his job as a senior scientist at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. Biography El-Ganayni was born in Minyat Samannoud, Egypt in 1950. His father, Sheikh Ali ibn Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni (ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸäÿÆ ÿπŸÑŸä ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿπŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿßŸäŸÜŸä) was educated at the prestigious Al-Azhar University, where he completed his elementary, secondary, and high school studies. Sheikh Ali proceeded to the Al-Azhar Faculty of Islamic Law, where he completed the equivalent of a bachelor‚Äôs degree. He continued his studies to the graduate level, obtaining the equivalent of a Ph.D. in Islamic law (ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿ©), and later a certification to practice law (ÿ•ÿ¨ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∂ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ÿπŸä). In 1973, Dr. Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni obtained his Bachelor of Science in Physics from Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt. He went on to pursue a master's in Nuclear Physics and completed his degree in 1978. In 1980 El-Ganayni moved to the United States to complete his Ph.D., obtaining a second master's degree in Nuclear Physics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1983. Between 1984 and 1989 El-Ganayni worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Physics, and completed his Ph.D. in Atomic Physics in 1990. He became an American citizen in 1988. Shortly after completing his graduate studies, El-Ganayni was hired by Westinghouse Electric Company, working in the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory as a Senior Scientific Programmer, and later as a Senior Scientist. Throughout his employment at Bettis he received positive reviews, authored and coauthored a number of academic papers, and contributed to numerous projects. El-Ganayni‚Äôs contributions were not limited to scientific endeavors; he is a founding member of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, served two terms as the center‚Äôs president, and helped to establish the mosque‚Äôs current location in Schenley Heights. For close to a decade, El-Ganayni worked and volunteered as an Imam at correctional facilities in both Ohio and Pennsylvania. Part of El- Ganayni‚Äôs prison outreach included the creation of the PA DOC Monitor, a website examining the condition, and necessary reform of the Department of Corrections.  Loss of Security Clearance, Employment  Dr. El-Ganayni‚Äôs work at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory required the possession of a Department of Energy (DOE) issued security clearance, enabling him to work with classified information. In October 2007 El-Ganayni‚Äôs security clearance was suspended, effectively barring him from any work at Bettis. DOE regulations stipulate that an individual may appeal a suspension, however El-Ganayni‚Äôs right to appeal was denied in May 2008 when Jeffery F. Kupfer, deputy secretary of the DOE, invoked national security, refusing to reveal the government‚Äôs allegations against Dr. El-Ganayni.  Muslim sues over loss of security clearance The suspension of El-Ganayni‚Äôs security clearance was prefaced by an interview with DOE security officials, and later the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In these interviews, questions were asked regarding El-Ganayni‚Äôs political beliefs, religious views, and his work as an Imam in the prison system. No questions related to his work or any potential breaches of security were asked in either interview. The DOE officials instead focused on a seemingly innocent Islamic book entitled, ‚ÄúThe Miracle of the Ant,‚Äù authored by Turkish Islamic publisher and author Harun Yahya; unbeknownst to El-Ganayni, the content of Yahya‚Äôs book was largely, if not completely duplicated from a Pulitzer Prize winning work entitled, ‚ÄúJourney to the Ants‚Äù published by Harvard University Press. Dr. El-Ganayni distributed excerpts from book to prisoners (both Muslim and non-Muslim) while serving as an Imam at Forest State Correctional Institution. DOE officials expressed concern over a purely scientific description of ants‚Äô biological defense mechanisms in a chapter entitled, ‚ÄúDefense and War Tactics‚Äù insinuating that El-Ganayni distributed this material with sinister intent, and subsequently questioned his allegiance to the United States of America. His supervisor at Forest, chaplaincy director Glenn McQuown reviewed the book and described it as ‚Äúcompletely benign.‚Äù The interviews also focused on El-Ganayni‚Äôs criticism of American foreign policy and the FBI‚Äôs mistreatment of Muslims after September 11, 2001. Specifically, El-Ganayni raised concern over an FBI raid of a Pittsburgh mosque during Friday prayers, where attendees were searched and forced to stand outside while being questioned. Revocation of El-Ganayni‚Äôs security clearance also may be related to his establishment of the PA DOC Monitor, a website and prison outreach program which critically examines the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and its policies, insisting that drastic reform of the system is required for it to truly benefit prisoners and society at large.  Nuclear physicist/Muslim cleric fights to get job back, security clearance  El-Ganayni vs. the United States Department of Energy et al..  On June 26, 2008 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) with Schnader, Harrison, Segal, and Lewis as co-counsels filed a lawsuit on behalf of Dr. El-Ganayni alleging that the DOE revoked his clearance due to criticism of the FBI and U.S. foreign policy. The suit demands that the DOE reveal their allegations against El-Ganayni and restore due process, allowing him to contest any allegations made against him. A hearing date has not been set as of July 28, 2008.  Government Revoked Muslim Nuclear Physicist‚Äôs Security Clearance to Retaliate for Criticism of U.S. Policy, says ACLU A motion for preliminary and permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Energy and its acting director, Jeffrey Kupfer was filed on September 3, 2008 requesting the following: * Assert that the court has jurisdiction over the case. * Order the Energy Department to show Dr. El-Ganayni the evidence it claims to have against him. * Order the Energy Department to hold a hearing where he can tell his side of the story, as provided in the agency's own rules for inquiries on sensitive security matters.  Muslim scientist asks judge to order hearing On September 25, 2008 the DOE filed a motion to dismiss El-Ganayni's preliminary and permanent injunction.  DOE Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Permanent Injunction On October 14, 2008 Dr. El-Ganayni's attorneys filed a brief in opposition of the DOE's motion to dismiss.  Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss On October 31, 2008 Judge Terrence F. McVerry stated that the court \\"reluctantly concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims made in Counts I and II of the Complaint\\" effectively granting the DOE's Motion to Dismiss in relation to Counts I and II. However, the court requested supplemental briefing regarding Count III, specifically concerning the DOE's interpretation, application, and adherence to executive procedure. Briefs from both the DOE and El-Ganayni's defense regarding Count III were submitted on November 14, 2008. -Memorandum 10-31-2008 in reference to DOE's motion to dismiss Judge McVerry ruled in favor of Dr. El-Ganayni and refused to dismiss Count III on November 20, 2008. In his court order McVerry stated that, \\"[the] Defendants‚Äô interpretation [of their own regulations] is not consistent with the actual text of the Executive Orders.\\" This ruling was based on a DOE regulation stating that a clearance can only be revoked by a DOE agency head, not simply a Deputy Secretary. Subsequently, November 24, 2008, a day before a scheduled hearing to discuss pending motions, future direction of the litigation, and the possible scheduling of a preliminary injunction hearing, DOE secretary Samuel Bodman signed a revocation of El- Ganayni's clearance citing national security and the government requested a dismissal of the case. This dismissal was granted , however Dr. El-Ganayni appealed his case to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court.http://www.post- gazette.com/pg/08333/931314-52.stm Dr. El-Ganayni's brief for appeal of the dismissal was filed March 19, 2009 and a decision was made in the DOE's favor on January 11, 2010.

Career Dessloch was born in Bamberg, he joined the Bavarian Army in 1910 and served during World War I.Summary of Dessloch World war I service December 1914-November 1918.Accessed 5 November 2018 After the German defeat, he joined the right-wing Freikorps forces of Franz von Epp, fighting against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. From 1921, he served as an intelligence officer in the German Reichswehr. In the course of German re- armament, he attended the secret Lipetsk fighter-pilot school in 1926‚Äì27. Dessloch took part in the fast build-up of the Luftwaffe after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, from 1 December 1934 as commander of a Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (flight training school). From 1935 he served as commander of two Luftwaffe wings. During World War II he commanded a Luftflotte 2 corps from 3 October 1939 and was appointed Major general and commander of the 6th flight division on 1 January. He provided air support to the Wehrmacht Army Group B in the 1940 Battle of France and from 1941 commanded Luftwaffe units on the Eastern Front. Promoted to General der Flakartillerie on 1 January 1942, he served as a commander on the southern Eastern Front and in the Caucasus Mountains. On 11 June 1943 Dessloch succeeded Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen as commander-in-chief of Luftflotte 4 in the rank of Colonel general. When in the summer 1944 the Western Front collapsed, Dessloch was appointed commander of Luftflotte 3 by Hermann G√∂ring to replace dismissed Hugo Sperrle. After Paris was liberated by the Allied forces, Dessloch commanded an air unit that, in retaliation, bombed the city destroying civilian targets and killing 200 French civilians on September 1944.Mitcham 2007, pp. 185‚Äì195.

Its creator is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea and New York, the US. Altibase scales vertically and horizontally. The company has offices in South Korea, United States and China. Altibase is enterprise grade. Since 1999, Altibase has served over 600 enterprise clients including 8 Fortune Global 500 companies. Its major clients include Samsung, HP, Hyundai, China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, E*TRADE, Toshiba Medical and various world-renowned finance companies. Altibase has been deployed in over 6000 use cases in industries ranging from telecommunications, finance, manufacturing and public service. Altibase is an in-memory database. Since 1999, Altibase has pioneered the in-memory database space. Altibase has helped its clients with high performing database technologies that are mandatory for extremely demanding use cases such as billing and authentication for mega telecom companies and other applications for manufacturing and finance companies with very high throughput requirements. Altibase is a hybrid database. Altibase was the first company in the world to develop and commercialize a hybrid database back in 2005. Altibase's hybrid architecture allows for utilization of memory tables for high performance and disk tables for economical storage in a single unified engine. As a result, data can be stored and manipulated in main memory alone, on physical disk alone or a combination of both. Consequently, Altibase eliminates the need to purchase an in-memory database and an on-disk database separately. Altibase is relational and ACID and SQL compliant. Thus, Altibase can replace or interoperate with Oracle and other legacy databases. In addition, migration from other legacy databases to Altibase is exponentially less complex. Altibase is currently among a very small subset of relational databases that provide sharding. In 2014, Altibase developed its scale-out technology, sharding. Since then, it has been adopted by various multi- national companies. Altibase's sharding is unique in that it is designed to allow for linear performance enhancement with almost no coordinator-related bottlenecks no matter how many servers are added. Another significant advantage of Altibase's sharding is that it does not require any changes to existing applications in order to implement Altibase if users' systems are built on relational databases. Consequently, existing DBAs will find it easy to learn, adopt and administrate Altibase when they opt to scale out their systems with Altibase. History From 1991 through 1997 the Mr.RT project was an in-memory database research project, conducted by the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute a government-funded research organization in South Korea. Altibase was incorporated in 1999. = Release = The first version, called Spiner, was released in 2000 for commercial use. It took half of the in-memory DBMS market share in South Korea. In 2002 the second version was released renamed to Altibase v2.0. By 2003, Altibase v3.0 was released and it entered the Chinese market. Released version 4.0 with hybrid architecture, combining RAM and disk databases, was released in 2004. In 2005 Altibase began working with Chinese telecommunications providers for billing systems, and Twainese financial companies for home trading systems. The software was certified by the Telecommunications Technology Association. The Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs gave it an award in 2006.

Distribution Volutoconus species live in tropical and subtropical waters. All four species in the genus live in Australia, and the range of one species, Volutoconus bednalli, extends to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Volutoconus snails live in coarse sand and rubble from the shallow subtidal zone to over 200 m depth. Shell description The shells of Volutoconus species have a bluntly rounded protoconch with a small sharp projection called a calcarella. They are solid, glossy, cylindrical-shaped shells with an elongate aperture that has four distinct columellar plicae. Volutoconus coniformis, V. grossi and V. hargreavesi are reddish-brown in color, and V. bednalli is yellow with reticulate blue-black bands. Volutoconus grossi form mcmichaeli and Volutoconus hargreavesi form daiseyae have distinct axial ribs. Notes Volutoconus are uncommonly found alive. They are sometimes accidentally caught by fishermen as bycatch on prawn or scallop trawlers. These volutes are nocturnal and have a small foot compared to many other volutes. The foot, head, propodium, eyes and siphon of Volutoconus hargreavesi and Volutoconus grossi have a similar color pattern to that of the shell.
