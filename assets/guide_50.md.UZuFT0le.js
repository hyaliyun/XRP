Ellen van Loon is the lead architect and OMA have designed a structure with uniquely flexible internal spaces, as well as the spaces outside, including two public squares by the River Irwell, intended to make The Factory a destination for people living and working in Manchester, as well as visitors to the city. The Factory's internal spaces cover approximately 13,300 square meters, with adaptability designed to enable the commissioning of large scale and intimate work across different art forms, including dance, theatre, music, opera, visual arts, popular culture and digital work, plus major exhibitions and concerts. Work commissioned for The Factory will go on to be presented around the world, whilst Manchester International Festival will continue to take place every two years. The Factory is anticipated to bring 1,500 full time jobs and add up to ¬£1.1 billion to Manchester's economy over a decade. It will also offer a skills, training and engagement programme for people living across Greater Manchester.  History  Plans to build The Factory were announced in December 2014 by then Chancellor, George Osborne, who pledged a ¬£78 million investment as part of the Northern Powerhouse programme . The Factory was backed by Manchester City Council, which stated that the venue would \\"play an integral part in helping Manchester and the north of England provide a genuine cultural counterbalance to London\\". It has been suggested that The Factory will act as \\"a catalyst, encouraging other creative industries and specialist suppliers to cluster around it, establish Manchester as the country's most significant arts and cultural employment centre outside London.\\" Manchester City Council announced that, from 1 April 2018, they will provide Arts Council England (ACE) with an additional ¬£9 million per annum to offer revenue support to Factory. Pdf. Manchester City Council granted planning permission for the building in January 2017, announcing at the same time that Manchester International Festival will operate the centre with Mark Ball, the former Artistic Director of the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT), joining in June 2017 as Creative Director to oversee the development of The Factory programme alongside MIF Artistic Director and Chief Executive John McGrath.  Location  The Factory is being constructed on the former site of Granada Studios, where Coronation Street and other TV shows were filmed and is located within St John's, a \\"new cultural community for Manchester\\" being developed by Allied London, which purchased the site with Manchester City Council. The Factory's development coincides with that of the adjacent Science and Industry Museum, which \\"will become part of the creative public realm, with MSI's creative science ... balancing the creative and cultural production of Factory.\\" SIM are building a new ¬£6 million Special Exhibition Gallery alongside The Factory; the new gallery is set to be complete by 2020.

The Factory is situated next to the River Irwell and is close to other city centre cultural sites, including the People's History Museum, John Rylands Library, the Opera House, HOME and the Royal Exchange Theatre.  Overview  The Factory covers , and will comprise of three main flexible internal spaces including, ground floor, warehouse and auditorium, with further spaces inside and outside of the building. The warehouse will have a capacity of up to 5,000 and the auditorium up to 1,600 seated. The warehouse and auditorium can present events simultaneously, and the warehouse will also have the ability to be divided into two spaces by an acoustic wall. Both spaces can also be combined, with this adaptability meaning The Factory will be able to create and present different types and scale of event. Pdf. The building will also include dressing rooms, offices, toilets, and spaces to serve food and beverage. Two public squares on the north and west sides of the building also make up The Factory site. The scheme also includes the restoration and reuse of the northern brick arched portion of the Grade II-listed Colonnaded Railway ViaductHistoric England and two public squares to the north and west of the building also making up The Factory site.  Building Design  Rem Koolhaas of OMA pictured in 1987.Rem Koolhaas Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) were selected to design The Factory following an international competition. 48 architectural firms had expressed an interest in the project, the following nine were invited to go forward by the council: :Rafael Vi√±oly Architects ¬∑ Diller Scofidio + Renfro ¬∑ Bennetts Associates ¬∑ Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) ¬∑ Zaha Hadid Architects ¬∑ SimpsonHaugh and Partners ¬∑ Grimshaw Architects ¬∑ Mecanoo International ¬∑ Haworth Tompkins Limited The former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Angela Brady, was amongst a number of architects who expressed their concern that there were no architects amongst the jury that would name the successful bidding firm. The jury comprised: Richard Leese, (leader of Manchester City Council), Tom Bloxham, (chairman of the festival and Urban Splash), and Michael Ingall, (chief executive of Allied London). The jury were assisted by a technical panel: Maria Balshaw (then Director of Culture for Manchester City Council), Pat Bartoli, (head of the council's City Centre Regeneration Team), John McGrath, (artistic director and chief executive of the festival), Greg Attwood, (development director at Allied London), and Dave Carty, (development manager of the council's City Centre Regeneration). Lead Architect for The Factory is Ellen van Loon, who has worked on projects including Brighton College (2020), BLOX, the new home of the Danish Architecture Center in Copenhagen (2018); Rijnstraat 8 (2017); Lab City (2017); the G-Star Headquarters in Amsterdam (2014); De Rotterdam, the largest building in the Netherlands (2013); New Court, the Rothschild Bank headquarters in London (2011); exterior and interior design for Maggie's Centre near Glasgow (2011); the Prada Transformer pavilion in Seoul (2009); Casa da Musica in Porto (2005), winner of the 2007 RIBA Award; and the Dutch Embassy in Berlin (2003), winner of the European Union Mies van der Rohe award in 2005.  Training and employment  The Factory delivers a skills, engagement and training programme under the banner The Factory Academy. Over the next five years, it is expected to create up to 1,400 training places, plus thousands more learning and engagement opportunities - many particularly targeted at young people, providing an entry point to work in the creative industries. The Factory Academy is backed by the Greater Manchester Cultural Skills Consortium. Members include Brighter Sounds, Contact, HOME, The Lowry, Manchester Art Gallery, Manchester International Festival, Manchester Jewish Museum, Manchester Museum, Manchester Metropolitan University, Octagon Theatre, Oldham Coliseum, Palace Theatre, Manchester Opera House, People's History Museum, Royal Exchange Theatre, Royal Northern College of Music, Science and Industry Museum, Walk the Plank and Z-Arts. It is also anticipated that the venue will have 125 permanent staff plus 15 apprentices.  Personnel  In the summer of 2015, it was announced that the design and development process would be overseen by a Project Board set up by Manchester City Council with Maria Balshaw appointed the Single Responsible Owner for the project. Funding and project monitoring is the responsibility of ACE, who have agreed to second Simon Mellor, ACE's Executive Director, Arts and Culture, for up to two days a week (to be based in the Manchester project office in Manchester Town Hall). His role will be to support the further development of the business case and to work up the technical brief for the design team. point 5.0. Pdf. Mellor was previously a General Director at MIF. Other contacts for the project include: Joanne Roney (the council's Chief Executive), Dave Carty (development manager of the council's City Centre Regeneration) and Pat Bartoli (head of the council's City Centre Regeneration Team). In June 2016, it was announced that the chief operating officer for BBC England, Jenny Baxter, was to become project director of The Factory from autumn 2016, at a salary of ¬£140,000 to be paid by Manchester City Council.

Schaller held high-level positions in the administrations of three Nevada governors and a U. S. senator from Nevada. Schaller was a member of the Democratic Party, but also served a Republican governor. Schaller was posthumously honored by political associates when they commissioned a bronze bust of him. The bust was dedicated in the State of Nevada Old Assembly Chambers and was placed under the portrait of Governor Mike O'Callaghan (D) in the Nevada State Capitol Building, in Carson City, Nevada.  Early life  Christy Lee Kieser(1) was born on December 29, 1935 in Sioux City, Iowa to Burl and Eunice Christy Kieser(2). Chris and his older sister, Patricia Ann Kieser, lived in various states and in Canada(3) with his mother and step- fathers, and with maternal grandparents and friends of his mother. At age 11, he was adopted by his mother's husband, Robert Schaller(4), and he took the Schaller name legally. His mother and Robert Schaller bore two children, Robert E and Wendy Schaller, who were Chris Schaller's half-brother and sister. Schaller attended and graduated in 1953 from Hollywood High School in Los Angeles. During high school, he wrote a sports column for his high school newspaper. Schaller began his professional sports writing career at age 16 in 1952 with the Los Angeles Examiner. Schaller received a journalism scholarship from the LA Examiner to George Pepperdine College  Journalistic and political career  Schaller left Pepperdine in 1956 to work as sports editor at the Las Vegas Sun, and later became city editor (1960‚Äì1961). In 1958 Schaller joined the U.S. Army and served six months active duty at Fort Ord, California before continuing in the Army Active Reserves (1958‚Äì1964). Schaller married Harriet Jones(5), the assistant society editor of the Las Vegas SUN, on December 30, 1961. They moved to Carson City, Nevada, in 1962, where he worked as Public Information Officer for the Nevada Employment Security Department. He also wrote high school sports articles for the Carson City Nevada Appeal. Schaller became press aide and speech writer for Nevada Governor Grant Sawyer (D) in 1964‚Äì1967. He served as the news media coordinator of the 1966 Western Governor's Conference, press aide for the 1965 and 1966 National Governor's Conference and press aide for the Western Governor's Conference. Schaller's daughter, Leigh Christy Schaller (O'Neill) was born in Carson City on July 8, 1964.(6) In 1967, the Schaller family moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as speechwriter and press secretary for U.S. Senator Alan Bible (D-Nev). In 1978, Bible wrote: \\"To Chris Schaller‚ÄîA modern day Mark Twain. Super writer and political strategist‚Äîa close and dear friend‚ÄîWith Warm Regards and Best Wishes. Alan Bible\\" In 1978, Nevada Senator Alan Bible gave Chris Schaller a signed photograph of himself. The inscription to Schaller reads: \\"To Chris Schaller‚ÄîA modern day Mark Twain. Super writer and political strategist‚Äîa close and dear friend‚ÄîWith Warm Regards and Best Wishes. Alan Bible\\" Schaller took a leave of absence from the Senate in 1970 to manage the Nevada gubernatorial campaign of Mike O'Callaghan. He resigned from Senator Bible's staff six months later to serve as chief of staff for Governor O'Callaghan from 1971 to 1979. In 1979 Schaller was retained as chief-of-staff for newly elected Nevada Governor Robert List (R). According to the National Governor's Association, Schaller was the only person to serve as top advisor to two governors of opposite political affiliation, and was the only person to serve two terms as chairman of the Western Governor's Conference Staff Advisory Committee. At age 44 in 1980 Schaller left the List administration to work for the advertising firm of Reber, Glenn and Marz in Reno, Nevada. He became the president of Campaign Consultants. A year later he also began writing a humorous political column for the Nevada Appeal, titled \\"Observations\\". In 1982, Chris Schaller was the commencement speaker for Leigh Christy Schaller Carson City High School graduation. He advised his daughter's high school graduating class not to rely on politicians, however he also told the class that what they thought and did about their government could make a difference.  Death, acknowledgements and legacy  Chris Schaller died on February 27, 1984 at Washoe Medical Center, Reno, Ruthe Deskin wrote in her column in the Las Vegas SUN that Schaller was \\"indeed a man of virtue\\". The headstone at the Genoa Nevada Cemetery, where Schaller is buried, is inscribed \\"A Man of Virtue\\". Governor Mike O'Callaghan's eulogy to Chris Schaller was published in the Las Vegas Sun: > \\"Chris Schaller wasn't an elected official or millionaire businessman, but > he probably left a deeper imprint on Nevada than has any other single person > during the past 20 years.\\" O'Callaghan went on to say that Schaller \\"helped > mold legislation into law so we can all have a better life.\\" He praised > Schaller for his work to help other people, feed the poor and prevent future > wars. Four Nevada governors acknowledge Chris Schaller's contributions to their state. In attendance at the unveiling of the Chris Schaller bronze bust on May 19, 1986 were L-R then-current governor Richard Bryan, former governor Mike O'Callaghan, former governor Grant Sawyer and former governor Robert List. The Chris Schaller Memorial Award was created by WE CAN (organization working to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect), in 1984, in recognition of his contributions of helping to enact legislation to protect abused and neglected children. The first annual Chris Schaller Memorial Award for WE CAN was presented to Judge John Mendoza in 1989. A Chris Schaller Journalism scholarship was established at the Schaller family's request. The 1984 Reno Padres baseball team season was dedicated to Schaller and Ray Kroc. The Carson City animal facility was dedicated, in 1985, as the Chris Schaller Memorial Animal Care Facility. The Chris Schaller Trust Fund was created, in 1984, to defray his medical expenses. The \\"Fund\\" held a cocktail party at the Governor's Mansion and two boxing matches in his honor. Two years after his death, a group of friends and associates wanted to create a permanent memoriam for Schaller. They called their effort ‚ÄúThe Campaign to Bust Schaller‚Äù, and commissioned sculptor Kristin Lothrop of Manchester. Mass. to create a bronze bust. The bust was unveiled in the old senate chambers of the Nevada State Capitol Building on May 19, 1986. In attendance were the current governor, Richard Bryan, and former governors Robert List, Grant Sawyer and Mike O'Callaghan. Prior to the placement of the Schaller bust, there was only one bronze bust in the Capitol of Abraham Lincoln.  Footnotes  # Chris (Christy) was named for his maternal grandfather, W.

Union Colonel John Toland led a brigade of over 800 men against a Confederate force of about 130 soldiers and 120 civilians. The location of Wytheville, the county seat of Wythe County in southwestern Virginia, had strategic importance because of a nearby lead mine and the railroad that served it. This mine supplied lead for about one third of the Confederate Army's munitions, while the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad transported Confederate troops and supplies; plus telegraph wires along the railroad line were vital for communications. In addition to logistics of moving the lead to bullet manufacturing facilities, this rail line also connected an important salt works of an adjacent county with the wider Confederacy. Toland's entire brigade was mounted, and consisted of a mounted infantry regiment plus eight companies of cavalry. It approached the small town of Wytheville on the evening of July 18. The community had been warned that a large force of Union horsemen was heading in its direction, and hastily made preparations before the brigade's arrival. While many in the community fled south or hid in their homes, a force of about 120 civilians (including home guard) volunteered to defend their town. The Union cavalry entered the town first, charging in column down the main road that led into town. The men from the cavalry were ambushed by Confederate soldiers, Home Guard, and local citizens. Most of the local men, and women, fired their one‚Äìshot muskets from inside their homes and businesses. This type of warfare was considered unconventional at the time. One Union soldier described the road as an \\"avenue of death\\". The Union force suffered significant losses. The Union commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, was left to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. (Powell was also second in command of the entire brigade.) Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, wounded, or missing. The Union after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expedition‚Äîalthough Confederate leadership believed the Union casualties were much higher. (The entire expedition includes the trips to and from Wytheville.) Approximately 300 horses were lost (killed, wounded, or injured) by the brigade during the raid and retreat‚Äîincluding an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, the Union brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of the Union force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacy‚Äîa railroad line, telegraph line along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of the Union cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics. Wythe County alt= Old map showing railroad line and two communities Wythe County is located in southwestern Virginia near the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was created in 1790, and named after George Wythe. Wythe was a legal mentor to Thomas Jefferson during the 1760s, and signed the Declaration of Independence. The crossroads town of Wytheville was the county seat during the Civil War, and remains so today. According to the 1860 census, the county's population was 12,305, and Wytheville's population was 1,111. Wytheville was said to have 1,800 \\"inhabitants\\" in 1863. Wythe County had two resources that caught the attention of the Union army during the Civil War‚Äîa lead mine and a railroad. The lead mine was located about southeast of Wytheville in the unincorporated community of Austinville. The mine was the source for a significant portion, estimated to be about one third, of the lead used by the Confederacy to produce bullets for its armies. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which ran roughly east‚Äìwest through the county, served the lead mine. Telegraph lines strung along the railroad were vital for communications in the region, and enabled communications between the Confederate capitol of Richmond and points as far west as Tennessee. In addition, the railroad was important for transporting Confederate troops and supplies. The railroad had a station located about south of the center of Wytheville. Ammunition and weapons for the Confederate Army were often stored there. Thus, the town had a strategic significance during the American Civil War, and was often a target. Because of the railroad, Wytheville was connected to two more points of military significance. A small headquarters for the Confederate army was located about west of Wytheville at the western edge the adjacent Smyth County. The army outpost was at the community named Saltville, which was the home of a salt mine that was important to the Confederacy. Salt is essential for the diet of humans and livestock, and was also used (at the time) to preserve meat. Salt was not widely available during the Civil War, and eight states used salt from this mine. More fighting would occur at Saltville in 1864. About east of Wytheville in Pulaski County is the Dublin railroad depot, which was a regional headquarters for the Confederate Army. The Dublin Depot was originally named Newbern Depot, although the town of Newbern is south of the railroad line. A short time before the Civil War, the depot was renamed Dublin Depot in honor of the New Dublin Presbyterian Church, which was located nearby. Thus, some maps from the early 1860s still used New Bern to identify the depot. Union brigade On the afternoon of July 13, 1863, a brigade of 870 Union soldiers departed their base camp located a few miles upriver (east) of Charleston, West Virginia. Their orders, which came from General Eliakim P. Scammon, were to disable the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Telegraph line strung along the railroad line was also a target. If circumstances allowed, nearby lead and salt mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, and salt mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were in code. Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few. alt=old picture of oddly dressed American Civil War soldierThe Union brigade consisted of 365 men from the 2nd West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and 505 men from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. This combined force is considered undersized for a Civil War brigade, which usually consisted of about 2,600 soldiers. Colonel John T. Toland was the acting brigadier general, and therefore commanded the brigade. He was from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Toland had performed with \\"utmost bravery and valor\\" in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, which occurred during September 1862. During the campaign, Toland twice escaped serious injury while his horses were killed. The infantry commander was Lieutenant Colonel Freeman E. Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was also known as \\"Piatt's Zouaves\\" or the \\"1st Ohio Zouaves\\", and typically served as a mounted infantry, including in this expedition. As mounted infantry, Piatt's Zouaves used horses for transportation, but (unlike cavalry) fought dismounted. Their infantry weapons were heavier and had longer range than the light weapons used by cavalry. Colonel Abram S. Piatt, who retired in 1862 after injuries, was their original commander. Piatt's Zouaves wore distinctive caps and uniforms trimmed in red, but did not always have the Asian-style baggy pants with open jackets typical of zouave units. Regiments that dressed as zouaves during the Civil War were copying the look (and hopefully the discipline) of elite French troops that fought successfully during the 1850s in northern Africa. Colonel William H. Powell was commander of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment, and second in command of the brigade. Powell also performed well in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, leading (as a major) the advance guard of the 2nd Loyal (West) Virginia Cavalry that successfully attacked a larger rebel cavalry and drove it away. If the rebel cavalry had not been removed from its position, the entire Union army in the Kanawha River Valley would have been surrounded and prevented from retreating to safety. During November 1862, Powell led a group of 22 men that captured an entire rebel camp in what became known as the Sinking Creek Raid. For this action, Powell was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Powell, who had been told by General George Crook to not return from the Sinking Creek Raid without good results, received a letter from Crook in 1889 that said \\"... I have always regarded the part you took in that expedition as one of the most daring, brilliant and successful of the whole war.\\" Raleigh alt=map showing approximate route of Union Army from Charleston WV to Wytheville, VAAfter departing from camp, the brigade traveled along the Coal River, moving upriver about without significant incidents. Traveling along the river required numerous river crossings. On the evening of July 14, the advance guard (the cavalry's Company C) was about east of Raleigh Court House (also known as Beckley, West Virginia) when it was ambushed while crossing Piney Creek. A sergeant was killed, and a private mortally wounded. Three additional men were wounded. Colonel Toland sent forward two companies of infantry as skirmishers, which soon drove the Confederate force away. After the incident, the men were ordered to fall back to the pike that was located between the West Virginia communities of Raleigh Court House and Oceana. (At the time, Oceana was the county seat of Wyoming County.) The brigade became separated into two groups during this time (early morning before sunrise on July 15) because the portion led by Lieutenant Colonel Franklin had not received the order to fall back. Both groups were required to operate on bad roads and in extreme darkness. They were reunited about from Raleigh Court House around noon. At a farm west of Raleigh Court House, a two-company detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry joined the brigade and brought supplies. The detachment's leader, Captain George Washington Gilmore, also brought orders from General Scammon that clarified the brigade's mission. The men were issued four days of rations plus three days of rations for their horses. Any men or horses determined to be unfit to continue the expedition were sent back to their home camp with the empty supply wagons. The group returning to home camp was escorted by one company from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry. Thus, the brigade continued with 441 mounted infantry men, 298 men from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, and 79 men from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. Tug Ridge The brigade passed Oceana Court House in Wyoming County on July 16. On the next day, the advance guard (cavalry companies D, E, and F with Colonel Powell) was sent forward to the top of Tug Ridge. Tug Ridge is located on the north side of Abb's Valley, near the Virginia border with West Virginia. During the war, Abb's Valley was an important mountain pass monitored by rebel troops. It was raining as Powell's men advanced, and they encountered a picket of six rebels who were inside a tent. A portion of the three companies led by Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson surprised the rebels, capturing them without firing a shot. About beyond the ridge, near Abbs Valley, Powell and the three companies \\"... dashed into Camp Pemberton, at the head of Abb's Valley, and captured 25 prisoners belonging to a home-guard company ... and 700 stand of arms, intended for arming a regiment in that vicinity.\\" Food was also captured, and redistributed among the brigade. The weapons were destroyed. Up until this point, the brigade captured all rebels confronted in an effort to keep its location secret. However, one rebel in the Tug Ridge-Abb's Valley region either was not captured or was captured and escaped‚Äîand warned his superiors that a large Union force was approaching. A newspaper article about the raid, published a week later in Abingdon, Virginia, described the Union brigade while it was in Abb's Valley as having \\"a Colonel along acting as a Brigadier, but mainly commanded by a one-eyed Colonel by the name of Powell\\". Walker Mountain On the evening of July 17, the brigade (and its prisoners) camped on a farm about from Tazewell Court House (Jeffersonville) and from Wytheville. On the morning of July 18, they passed Burk's Garden, and some houses and weapons were burned. At the foot of Walker Mountain, about from Wytheville, the brigade's rear guard was attacked by Major Andrew Jackson May's cavalry of about 150 men. The rear guard at that time was Company C from the 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and it had also been assigned the task of guarding prisoners. The opposing forces had not expected a confrontation at this location, and May's force outnumbered the small group of surprised men from Ohio. May was able to free the rebel prisoners (many were from the company that had been captured in Abb's Valley) and capture Union soldiers. According to the report of Confederate General John S. Williams, Toland's brigade lost 8 men killed and 20 taken prisoner. About outside of Wytheville, Colonel Toland sent two companies (D and F) of cavalry west to strike the Mount Airy railroad depot. The two-company detachment was led by Captain George Millard. Its purpose was to destroy railroad infrastructure and telegraph lines on the west side of Wytheville, which would prevent Confederate troops located in the Saltville region from arriving by train and reinforcing Wytheville. It was determined that the target was too strongly guarded, so the two companies rode east to rejoin the brigade. They arrived in Wytheville near the end of the fighting. The main portion of Toland's brigade arrived in Wytheville around 6:00 p.m. on July 18. The rear of the brigade was still skirmishing with Major May's men at that time. After its successful clash with the rear guard, May's cavalry had pressed forward until it came upon the main body of Toland's men, about from Wytheville. May was eventually forced to retreat to the mountains, since he was now outnumbered and had no advantage in the open terrain. After a small rebel skirmish line was discovered in front of the brigade near the entrance to the town, Colonel Powell and the cavalry were called forward from the rear. Confederates Key points in the 1863 Wytheville Raid including Saltville, Burke's Garden, Tug Mountain/Abb's Valley, Wytheville, Austin lead mines, and Newbern/Dublin.The Confederate Army became aware of the Union horsemen on July 17, after one man from the 45th Virginia Infantry escaped Toland's brigade near Tug Mountain. The rebel, who either evaded capture or was captured and escaped, fled on horseback and warned Confederate headquarters. Saltville Confederate General John S. \\"Cerro Gordo\\" Williams, headquartered in Saltville, Virginia, was notified of the invading Union Army at 11:00am (July 17) while he was visiting outposts in Tazewell County. The information was passed by couriers and telegraph, and Confederate military posts throughout the region became aware of a Union army force near Tazewell Court House that was estimated to be 1,300 men. By sunrise on July 18, Williams had a cavalry unit of 250 men report for duty. This cavalry unit, which had been retrieved from adjacent counties west of Saltville, was led by Major May and Major John D. Morris. Rebel scouts were now reporting the movements of the Union army. Major May's cavalry was sent to harass the Union force until a planned junction with Confederate infantry led by Colonel William E. Peters. In addition to the headquarters of General Williams, Saltville was the home of an important salt mine that provided salt for much of the Confederate nation. As the Union brigade moved in Tazewell County, the Confederate Army command became concerned about the salt works, which is located on the west side of Smyth County. For this reason, the infantry force led by Colonel Peters was moved back toward Saltville‚Äîand Major May did not receive support. On the early afternoon of July 18, the situation changed: the Union expedition was moving closer to Wytheville and the lead mine located in Wythe County, just south of Wytheville in Austinville, Virginia. The lead mine was a major source of lead for bullets used by the Confederate army. (Ironically, the company that ran the mine was named Union Lead Mining Company.) Lead was shipped on the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad to Richmond, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, to be made into bullets for the Confederate Army. Dublin alt=Old picture of a Confederate Civil War officerGeneral Samuel Jones, commander of the Confederate Armies in southwest Virginia, was informed of the Union Army's movements beginning midday July 18. Jones' headquarters was at the Dublin railroad depot‚Äîeast of Wytheville along the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Jones intercepted a passenger train on the railroad line around 3:00pm, and the train was used to haul soldiers and equipment to Wytheville. He sent two small newly organized companies, employees from his headquarters, and some local citizens who volunteered to help. This group totaled to about 130, and was led by Major Thomas M. Bowyer. Bowyer's men were well armed, and brought two pieces of artillery plus additional small weapons for the locals. The train carrying Bowyer and his men was delayed because it had to wait for an eastbound train to pass. Wytheville The citizens of Wytheville eventually became aware of the invading Union Army. Local legend says that on July 17, a farmer in Tazewell County (located north of Wytheville) sent his daughter on a night ride to warn the town of Wytheville of the approaching Union horsemen. The young woman, Molly Tynes, rode through mountain ranges and a forest to warn the small town. Joseph Kent, who was working on his farm east of the town, was summoned by the town leaders. Kent was a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War who had fought at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas) before resigning and returning home. Kent was called \\"Major Joseph F. Kent\\" in Bowyer's after action report. Because of his military experience, Kent was asked to lead the community's defense. He held a meeting at the courthouse, and sent volunteers to Walker Mountain to serve as lookouts. Many in the community panicked and fled south to the mountains (not Walker Mountain). Valuables were removed from the banks and the post office, and also moved to the mountains south of town. The citizens that were willing to fight were asked to gather their weapons and reassemble at the courthouse. Bowyer and his men arrived at the train station south of Wytheville at 5:10pm, when the Union brigade was about north of town. The depot was about south of the center of town. The artillery was unloaded from the train, but horses could not be found to move it. Bowyer, with assistance from Kent and Abraham Umbarger from the local militia, distributed his extra small arms to the local citizens. A small line of rebels had already formed on the north side of town. By 5:30, Bowyer's men began moving from the depot toward town. Bowyer wanted to bring all armed citizens to the railroad depot, where he believed he could use his artillery. Kent rejected that idea, believing they would have no chance against a quick strike from the horsemen. Kent moved his citizen volunteers into houses and buildings, while most of Bowyer's men stayed near the courthouse or at the south end of town. Raid alt= Old map showing Union approaching from north and rebels from east.As the Union soldiers approached Wytheville in the early evening of July 18, the rear portion of the command was having small skirmishes with Confederate cavalry following them. About outside of Wytheville, rebels were encountered in the front. This small group of rebels was positioned along the crest of a low ridge that obscured the view into town. Colonel Powell and the cavalry were ordered from the rear to the front to charge into town. Toland's order was for the charge to be made in columns down the town's main pike that was blocked by the small group of rebels. Colonel Powell requested that Colonel Toland have the infantry dismount and drive the rebel skirmishers toward town before the charge, because he was unable to see what was behind the rebels. Powell also suggested that if the cavalry were to charge, the men should be deployed \\"to right and left\\" instead of a straight ahead charge. Toland \\"characteristically disregarded\\" and strongly rejected Powell's suggestions. Charge alt=Old picture of a U.S. Civil War officerThe cavalry obeyed Colonel Toland's order and charged forward in column, four abreast. The small group of rebels quickly fled into town with the Union cavalry following. The charge was led by Captain Gilmore's two-company detachment from the First West Virginia Cavalry, followed by Colonel Powell and Company I of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry. A second group consisting of Company B and Company H from the 2nd West Virginia, led by Major John J. Hoffman, entered the town next. Company E served as the cavalry's rear guard. The riders expected a battle line with Confederate soldiers further down the street. Instead, they discovered that the road was lined with a high stake fence, and the houses on both sides of the road were full of armed citizens of the community. Private Joseph Sutton, a member of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry and participant in the raid, described the street that led into Wytheville as \\"an avenue of death\\". As the Union cavalry approached, about half of the 120 local civilians fled south toward the railroad depot, and took positions closer to the men from the Confederate army. The initial volley fired by the remaining (and nervous) locals was ineffective because it had been fired too soon. The second volley, fired after a signal by Major Kent, found many in Captain Delaney's Company A. His group was fired upon by a company of Confederate soldiers in the street and from locals in the houses. One local, recalling this volley many years later, said \\"The colonel commanding the raiding party was killed, and the head of the column went down, men and horses in a confused mass.\\" He also said \\"The momentum of the column of cavalry carried many who were near the front over the dead and wounded men and horses. It was death to them to remain or hesitate. They spurred their horses forward over their dead and dying comrades and passed between our ranks as we opened out to the sidewalks. While they dashed by us firing their pistols, we continued the use of the musket. The bugle sounded the retreat, and the column of cavalrymen faced about and retired, only to re-form and come at us again.\\" Major Kent's idea to fight from the cover of buildings was considered \\"an irregular but most successful combat\\". Major Bowyer, leader of the Confederate force, said \\"Owing to the great advantage we secured in fighting from houses and other shelter against mounted men in the streets, we were enabled to inflict far greater loss upon the enemy than we sustained ...\\" Although the original shooters from the town's buildings were citizens and home guard, they were eventually joined by some of the soldiers from the Confederate army. A newspaper described the beginning as a \\"desperate fight\\", with the locals in the houses \\"shooting them down like sheep, and producing great consternation amongst them.\\" The three Union cavalry companies leading the charge advanced into the town, but suffered casualties almost immediately. Captain Delaney of Company A of the 1st West Virginia Cavalry (not a colonel) was the leader of the charge. Delaney was one of the first officers killed. Both of Delaney's lieutenants were wounded‚Äîone of them (First Lieutenant William E. Guseman) mortally. Leaders were definitely targets. Major Hoffman, leading the remaining portion of the cavalry, was thrown over his horse after it was shot. The horse was killed and the hard fall left Hoffman temporarily stunned. Although Hoffman was not killed, one newspaper report mentioned a major among the Union dead. Hoffman's portion of the cavalry, along with the many casualties from the first three companies, was effectively stopped‚Äîwith many of the men injured after being thrown from their horses, wounded, or killed. They were mostly caught in an open space and surrounded by a high fence and dead horses‚Äîand being shot by an enemy protected by the cover of buildings. One historian wrote that the trapped cavalry men were \\"sitting ducks\\". Some of the men took cover behind dead horses while others fled back up the road. Approximately 80 horses lay dead in the street. Assuming the 80 horses all belonged to the cavalry, about one fifth of the cavalry became horseless. Of the 79 men in the detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, 26 were killed, missing, or wounded during the expedition. Most of those casualties occurred in Wytheville. Confederate General Sam Jones claimed that the Union force \\"lost every one of their field officers.\\" Reinforcements Despite the casualties of men and horses, portions of the first three companies \\"began to work in earnest, flashing from one end of town to the other.\\" A request was made for reinforcements from the infantry. The infantry had been held in reserve, but \\"immediately dismounted\\" and moved forward when the 2nd West Virginia \\"sought safety\\". Lieutenant Colonel Franklin wisely brought his infantry forward on the sides of the street‚Äîdismounted (as Powell preferred earlier). A company of infantry occupied one side of the pike that led into town. Portions of the trapped 2nd West Virginia, now dismounted, pushed down the fence and occupied the other side. These two groups moved forward as skirmishers to dislodge its enemy from houses and buildings. Colonels shot During the early part of the fighting, Colonel Powell was accidentally shot in the back from friendly fire. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, without its two highest-ranking officers (Powell and Hoffman), became disorganized. A portion of the cavalry was trapped in the open against shooters protected by buildings, and many dismounted either for their own safety or because their horse had been shot. At that time, Colonel Toland hurried forward to run the leaderless dismounted cavalry. Freeman and the infantry were already further south in town. The cavalry believed their behavior was appropriate for the situation, and advised Colonel Toland to act in a similar manner. Toland, still on his horse, became an easy target for shooters from a nearby two-story brick house. Despite warnings from the cavalry's Company H that he should take cover, Toland refused to dismount‚Äîsaying \\"the bullet that can kill me has not been made\\". He was shot through the heart immediately after his exclamation. This happened early in the fighting, and men from the 2nd West Virginia's Company H were close enough to hear the bullet strike him. Thus, both colonels were eliminated from the fighting during the first 10 minutes. With Toland dead, the severely‚Äìwounded Powell was in command of the brigade‚Äîbut Powell was thought to be dying, and could not be moved. This left the infantry's Lieutenant Colonel Franklin in command, although he did not know this until the fighting was mostly over. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry did not reform and act as a regiment. It had only four companies in the town, and one was serving as the rear guard. Instead, individual companies were led by their captains (or lieutenants), and some of these leaders performed well. Captain Gilmore led the portion of cavalry that was still mounted, including what was left of his two-company detachment from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. Gilmore's detachment, which \\"suffered most severely\\", was complemented in the after action report made by Lieutenant Colonel Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, led by Franklin and Major John W. Shaw, also performed well. Overwhelmed On the south side of town, a Confederate artillery crew led by Captain John M. Oliver struggled to find horses to move their two artillery pieces. Finally securing horses, they moved toward Main Street with their two large weapons. Captain Gilmore, from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, became aware of the artillery threat, while a small group of Confederate soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Henry Bozang rushed to protect the artillery and its crew. A combined force of cavalry and infantry, led by Lieutenant Abraham from Gillmore's Company, charged through Bozang's men while the artillery crew hurriedly tried to load their weapons. The Confederate artillerists were able to fire one shot, but its main effect was to cause the horses still attached to the other piece of artillery to panic and pull it over. Before the remaining artillery piece could be reloaded, Abraham's men captured it while killing Oliver and two gunners. The remaining artillery crew fled. Lieutenant Bozang was wounded and his command surrendered. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, with its superiority in weapons and size, soon drove back all resistance. They attacked the courthouse (Major Bowyer's command post) and surrounding buildings. After some very intense and close fighting, the Confederate soldiers‚Äîunderstanding that they were vastly outnumbered, their artillery had been captured, and some of the buildings were on fire‚Äîwere ordered to withdraw from the town. They were to meet about south of the railroad depot at the railroad water tank, where the train had been moved for safety. When they arrived at the rendezvous point, they discovered that the railroad conductor had panicked‚Äîand left without them. They were forced to walk back to Dublin. Without the Confederate soldiers, the remaining fighters (home guard and citizens of the town) were vastly outnumbered by the invading force. Many of them dropped their weapons and fled south. The disorganized Union soldiers had trouble differentiating between innocent bystanders and fighters (unless gunpowder marks on their clothing gave them away). Toland's acting Adjutant-General, Lieutenant Ezra W. Clark, ordered more buildings burned. The Union soldiers began burning all buildings that had contained rebel marksmen (and markswomen), and prisoners were taken. Around this time, Captain Millard's cavalry detachment arrived in Wytheville. He reported that the Mount Airy Depot was occupied by a strong Confederate Army force. It was close to 8:00pm, and the fighting was over. The report of Lieutenant Colonel Freeman Franklin said that \\"The loss of the enemy in killed was estimated at 75; the number of wounded unknown. We took 86 prisoners, besides 35 at Abb's Valley.\\" Return march Mountains north of WythevilleEight to ten houses were set on fire by the Union army. A small amount of damage was inflicted on the railroad line, but it was later repaired in less than an hour. Later in the evening, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin began planning the brigade's next move. After consulting with Colonel Powell and regimental commanders, he determined that a return to the safety of base camp was the best alternative‚Äîespecially without good intelligence on the strength of the enemy forces assumed to be moving toward Wytheville. The brigade left town less than 12 hours after it arrived. Franklin's brigade departed on the same road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops under the command of Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville. Because of the difficult situation, the Union brigade paroled its prisoners, and continued its retreat north by obscure and winding mountain paths. Many horses \\"gave out\\" and were left on the mountain paths. Some of the worn animals fell to their deaths on the steep trails. The brigade was able to capture additional horses, so only about 100 men returned to home camp dismounted. The rear guard was attacked on July 19 and 20, but repulsed its pursuers. The Union brigade reached the safety of Union lines at Fayetteville on July 23, having received no rations for four days. Confederate Colonel McCausland believed that the retreating Union brigade should have been captured. His report said \\"I am also of the opinion that the cavalry force that was in Tazewell, under General Williams and Colonel May, was sufficient to have captured the enemy, if it had been properly managed.\\" Aftermath Beginning of a July 31 newspaper article about the Wytheville RaidFranklin's report said that Union losses for the entire excursion were 11 killed, 32 wounded, 17 taken prisoner, and 26 missing. This includes 2 officers killed, 5 wounded, and 1 missing. More men would eventually die from their wounds, including Lieutenant Guseman from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry. The infantry's portion of the casualties was 4 killed, 11 wounded, 17 taken prisoner, and 10 missing. Captain Gilmore's two-company cavalry detachment had the most severe losses (about one third of the men were killed or wounded), especially Company A. Companies B and I from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had fatalities in Wytheville, while Company C lost two men early in the excursion in the ambush near Piney Creek. An estimated 300 horses died or were left to die. Infantry leaders were critical of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, and members of the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership. Despite the losses, Union General Scammon wrote an order saying \\"The general commanding congratulates the troops of his command on the brilliant achievements ...\\" The Confederate point of view for the battle was much different from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported \\"The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded.\\" The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote \\"... there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure.\\" Colonel Powell's wound to his back was judged to be fatal by surgeons for both the Union and Confederate armies. One historian believed that Powell also lost an eye in this battle, but his eye was permanently injured before the war. When the Union army departed from Wytheville, Powell was left behind with other wounded soldiers that could not be moved. These men became prisoners of the Confederacy. The citizens of Wytheville blamed Powell for the burning of many of the community's homes. General Jones wanted Powell held accountable for the burning of two buildings from an earlier raid, and added that Powell was \\"... one of the most dangerous officers we have had to contend with ...\\" For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Several local women were instrumental in preventing retaliation on the blue-coated prisoners. Powell unexpectedly healed, and was eventually moved to Richmond's Libby Prison where he survived for a portion of that time in a dungeon on a bread and water diet. He was exchanged for Colonel Richard H. Lee in early February 1864, and returned to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry during March 1864. Years after the fighting, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry's Captain Fortescue (Company I), wrote \\"... though I was afterwards on many hotly contested fields, I was never upon any that was more so than Wytheville.\\" See also *West Virginia Units in the Civil War *West Virginia in the Civil War *Ohio in the Civil War Notes Footnotes Citations References     1863 in the United States Union victories of the American Civil War Cavalry raids of the American Civil War Military operations of the American Civil War in Virginia July 1863 events ","title":"Wytheville Raid"},{"id":"51182542","text":"Castanopsis oligoneura is a tree in the family Fagaceae.

Founded in 1905, it is the oldest girls' camp in the state. Open to children aged 12 to 17, it offers outdoor activities, arts and nature programs, and wilderness camping opportunities. The camp season is divided into two sessions of 3-1/2 weeks, running from late June to mid-August. The camp property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Facilities Aloha Camp is located on central eastern Vermont, on the northwestern shore of Lake Morey, in the hills north of Fairlee village just west of the Connecticut River. It is laid out over of land, divided in part by Lake Morey Road, which separates the bulk of the camp from its waterfront facilities. The camp layout is focused on the Main House and a number of activity buildings, with living quarters spread around the property. The Main House is an 1889 farmhouse, while the main activity buildings are repurposed agricultural outbuildings from the late 19th century. On the waterfront stands the Hale (pronounced in the Hawaiian manner, HAH-leh), an Adirondack style meeting hall with some Hawaiian stylistic touches. with History The camp was founded in 1905 by Harriet Farnsworth Gulick and Edward Leeds Gulick, both of whom grew up in missionary families with a history of service. The camp was named \\"Aloha\\" from the Hawaiian word meaning \\"welcome\\" (among other definitions). Edward Gulick was born and raised in Honolulu, and it is from this upbringing that the camp acquires its Hawaiian touches. The camp was so successful that the Gulicks soon opened Aloha Hive Camp on Lake Fairlee, for girls from 7 to 12 and Aloha Club on the shore of Lake Katherine in Piermont, New Hampshire, for girls from 17 to 70 (now closed), and in 1922 Lanakila Camp for boys, also on Lake Morey. The camps were run by members of the Gulick family until 1968, when the Aloha Foundation was established to continue their legacy.

Origins and capture Hardi was a privateer corvette commissioned at Bordeaux. c. June 1796. She was commissioned as an armed merchantman in 1799, with 194 men and 18 guns. At daybreak on 29 April 1800 encountered four French privateers: Brave (36 guns), Guepe (18), Hardi (18), and Duide (16). As soon as the French vessels realized that Anson was a British frigate they scattered. As Anson passed Brave going in the opposite direction Anson fired a broadside into her; Durham believed that the broadside did considerable damage, but he was unable to follow up as Brave had the wind in her favour and so outsailed Anson. Durham then set off after one of the other French vessels, which he was able to capture. She was Hardi, of 18 guns and 194 men. Durham described her as \\"a very fine new Ship just of the Stocks.\\" The Royal Navy took Hardi into service, first as HMS Hardi, before shortly thereafter renaming her HMS Rosario. Lastly, Durham reported sending into port for adjudication a very valuable ship that had been sailing from Batavia to Hamburg with the Governor of Batavia as passenger.

Fortunately had joined Rosario at noon and by 8 o'clock she came alongside the quarry, which struck her colours. The privateer was Atalante, six days out of Bordeaux, with a crew of 120 men under the command of Arnaud Martin. She was pierced for 22 guns but only had fourteen 6-pounders mounted, having thrown eight overboard during the chase. Captain Hammond of Plantagenet described Atalante as an \\"exceedingly handsome Vessel\\", and as sailing remarkably fast, having \\"run us nearly Ninety Miles in the Nine Hours.\\" later shared in the prize money for Atalante.

In actuality, she was under the temporary command of first Commander Edmund Heywood, and then Commander Alexander Cunningham. It is possible that she underwent refitting at this time, though there is no record of this. In any case, Rosario sailed for the Leeward Islands on 10 January 1807, under Mounsey's command. There she served in the squadron under Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, in , that was sent to occupy the Danish West Indies.

It has clapboard siding and six- over-six sash windows. The hip roof has wide eaves with exposed rafters. The southwest fa√ßade, which faced the tracks, has a bay window, two passenger doors with transom windows, and two large freight doors. The interior of the depot follows a standard design. One end (the northwest) contains the freight room while the other consists of separate men's and women's waiting rooms divided by an office. History Wheaton was founded in 1884 on a railroad line that had been built north from Ortonville, Minnesota, by the Fargo and Southern Railway. The following year the company was acquired by the Milwaukee Road, which immediately built a station in the nascent town. That building was Wheaton's main connection to the wider world for 21 years, but in March 1906 it caught fire and burned down. The Milwaukee Road built a replacement on the same site. It may have been designed by J. U. Nettenstrom, who was the company's architect at the time. Certainly it was based on a standard design used for many of the Milwaukee Road's stations in mid-sized towns at the turn of the 20th century. A standard design was useful both in keeping costs down and in providing consistency along the rail line. Before the era of automobiles and highways, the depot was the gateway into and out of Wheaton. Virtually all travelers funneled through the depot. It was also where freight arrived and local agricultural produce was sent to market. The mail came and left by train, and the depot housed the local telegraph office. The railroad and the station that symbolizes it played a crucial role in Wheaton's growth, which soon became the county seat and a regional trade center. At its peak the Wheaton Depot received four trains daily. As automobiles became more common in the 1930s passenger service was dropped. Freight service continued until 1976, when the Milwaukee Road closed the station for good. The following year the Traverse County Historical Society purchased the building and restored it as a county history museum. The railroad removed its tracks in 1980. In 1984 the historical society constructed an annex to the depot consisting of a metal pole framed building extending to the northwest.

The region is one of taiga (coniferous and mixed broad leaf forest landscape, with mixed larch forests at the lower elevations and shrubs at higher elevations). The vegetation is influenced by a maritime climate that is relatively warmer than the colder continental taiga in Siberia to the west. A long, thin island (1,000 km by 200 km), Sakhalin is connected to the mainland by ice bridges in the winter, so it shares certain flora and fauna species. It is in the Palearctic realm, and mostly in the taiga biome with a Humid continental climate, cool summer climate. It covers .  Location and description  The Sakhalin Island taiga covers nearly all of Sakhalin Island, with the exception of the extreme southwestern tip, where warmer conditions support a predominantly broad leaf forest cover. The island is flat in the north, while the southern extent of the island, totaling 70% of the area, is mountainous. The mountains are split into two ridges: the East Sakhalin mountains and the West Sakhalin mountains. Altitude zones play a large role in the types of forest cover. The island stretches north of Hokkaido, the northern major island of Japan, separated by 42 km. The mainland to the west is separated by the Sea of Okhotsk in the north, the Sea of Japan in the south, and the Tatar Strait at the narrowest point (8 km). To the east is the Pacific Ocean, and to the north the Sea of Okhotsk. The mountains are medium height, averaging 500‚Äì800 meters above sea level.  Climate  The climate of the region is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ).. The warm Tsushima Current flows up the southwest side of the island, while the cold Sea of Okhotsk current chills the northern part of the island. The cold influence of the Okhotsk Sea (which is covered in ice much of the year), drives much of the taiga ecology of the island, even at the relatively southern latitudes (the island stretches from 46 degrees north to 54 degrees). The collisions of warm and cold sea current in a humid area produce frequent storms and fog. The island is wet, with monsoon characteristics (precipitation being highest in the summer). Precipitation various from 600 to 1,200 mm/year, depending on location, altitude, etc. The Poronaysky Nature Reserve in the southeast of the island gets more than 100 rainstorms per year (average precipitation 600 mm/year), with frequent fog in the summer. Flora and fauna Most generally, the forest cover of Sakhalin grades from light taiga (mostly Larix (Larch) species in the north, through dark taiga Picea (Spruce) species in the middle, to dark taiga Abies (Fir) species dominant in the south. On the coast are meadows and at the high altitudes aspects of tundra. In the north, Kurile larch is found in wet, swampy soil. In the middle and south, Yeddo spruce and Sakhalin fir dominate the mountain ridges. There are few endemic species because the island became separated from the mainland only recently. View of Sakhalin Island, near Yuzhno-Sahalinsk The rivers are important spawning grounds for migratory fish, including Cypriniformes (Carp), Gobiidae (Gobys), Cottidae (Sculpin), and Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout, etc. The freshwater rivers of Sakhalin Island are in the \\"Sakhalin, Hokkaido, & Sikhote - Alin Coast\\" freshwater ecoregion (ID #641). The rivers and streams of this ecoregion are characterized by three levels of flood: snowmelt from lowlands in spring, snowmelt from the mountains in early summer, and floods from monsoon rains in later summer.  Threats  The area in the past has suffered from poor logging practices. Today, commercial logging is an important industry in the middle third of the ecoregion, threatening soil erosion and habitat degradation. Gas production fields are being developed in the northern areas.  Protection  There is a federally protected area in the southeast of the island, and a number of regional nature reserves (\\"zakazniks\\"). * Poronaysky Nature Reserve. An IUCN class 1a nature reserve (\\"zapovednik\\"). Area: 567 km2.  Urban areas and settlements  The only city in the ecoregion is Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, at the southern end of the island.

Left and right semi-abelian categories By dividing the two conditions on the induced map in the definition, one can define left semi- abelian categories by requiring that overline{f} is a monomorphism for each morphism f. Accordingly, right quasi-abelian categories are pre-abelian categories such that overline{f} is an epimorphism for each morphism f.Rump, 2001. If a category is left semi-abelian and right quasi-abelian, then it is already quasi-abelian. The same holds, if the category is right semi-abelian and left quasi-abelian.Rump, 2001.

He is primarily remembered for his grave- digging practices, where he illegally exhumed corpses in order to study human anatomy. He is also known for his influence on Mark Twain, and was likely the inspiration for Twain's fictional character Dr. Robinson in \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\\"  Early career  Dr. McDowell moved to St. Louis in 1839 with a reputation that preceded him. He had previously worked in Kentucky, Philadelphia, and Ohio, at various medical facilities, and studied at Transylvania University in Kentucky. In 1840, he founded Missouri's first medical school, Missouri Medical College. It was the first medical school founded west of the Mississippi River and helped create the Washington University School of Medicine, after McDowell's death, in 1891.  Collecting Corpses  In the 1840s, using cadavers to study human anatomy was a highly uncommon, and frowned upon, practice in the United States. Prior to the Civil War, only 5 states allowed the dissection of non-felons for medical and educational purposes. Three of these laws were soon repealed, leaving the practice legal in only New York and Massachusetts. Dissecting cadavers was crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of human anatomy and to enhance and develop more accurate medical practices; however, the public was wary of the idea, believing it to be a desecration of the dead. In large part, this feeling was due to religious reasons; Christianity, for example, calls for burial of the dead. Exhuming the dead was not only disrespectful but could also be considered sacrilegious. Dr. McDowell believed the practice to be necessary in order to advance medicine and his own personal understanding of the human body. During his time teaching at the medical school, he not only encouraged but also required that his students perform at least one human dissection before their graduation. This illegal practice served as a form of bonding for the students, as the public looked on these grave-robberies with scorn and they were left with only each other to discuss what they had done and how it impacted their education.  Rumors and Folklore  Perhaps the most memorable incident surrounding the rumors that McDowell was robbing graves came after the disappearance of the wife of a German immigrant, Mrs. Walters, in 1849. She was last seen walking within a few blocks of the Medical College, and one witness claimed to have seen an article of her clothing near the school. Days later, 200-400 people, led mostly by the German-immigrant population in St. Louis, stormed to the school. The crowd demanded permission to search the premises for evidence of Mrs. Walter's murder. McDowell eventually agreed to Mr. Walters searching the school on the condition that the crowd disperse. No evidence of Mrs. Walters or her alleged murder was found, and two months later, she was discovered living in a nearby city with another man. This was not the only instance that McDowell clashed with the public. While never caught red-handed, it was common knowledge that he and his medical students were exhuming the recently dead in order to dissect the bodies. Countless rumors began to spread, and he later became known as \\"Mad Doctor McDowell.\\" Another infamous rumor began after the death of McDowell's daughter, Amanda. Despite his insistence on the importance of science in medicine, McDowell held strong spiritual beliefs regarding the dead. He believed that communication between the living and dead was possible, and even reported seeing a vision of his dead mother on one occasion. He preserved his daughter's body in a container filled with alcohol and hung the container suspended over the ceiling of a cave in Hannibal, Missouri. He believed that this burial would somehow allow communication between himself and his daughter; however the local people of Hannibal soon discovered the bizarre manner in which she was laid to rest, and created rumors that Amanda was haunting the cave.  Civil War  During the onset of the Civil War, McDowell was recruited as the Surgeon General of the Confederate Army of the West. His medical school was taken over by the Union and temporarily became the Gratiot Street Prison. During this time, there were numerous reports of bones being removed from the building, and whispers that it was haunted spread through the public. McDowell returned to St. Louis in 1865 to find the school in ruins. Together with a colleague, he began to rebuild the Medical College. He died three years later, and is buried in the Bellefontaine Cemetery, together with his other family members, in St. Louis.

The term initially proposed by Shu-hsien Liao comprises a two dimensional model which incorporates experience inertia and learning inertia. Later, another dimension‚Äîthe dimension of thinking inertia‚Äîhas been added based on the theoretical exploration of the existing concepts of experience inertia and learning inertia. One of the central problems in knowledge management related to organizational learning is to deal with \\"inertia\\". Besides, individuals may also exhibit a natural tendency of inertia when facing problems during utilization of knowledge. Inertia in technical jargon means inactivity or torpor. Inertia in organizational learning context may be referred to as a slowdown in organizational learning-related activities. In fact, there are many other kinds of organizational inertia: e.g., innovation inertia, workforce inertia, productivity inertia, decision inertia, emotional inertia besides others that have different meanings in their own individual contexts. Some organization theorists have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002) to extend its further use in organizational learning studies.  Definition  Knowledge inertia (KI) may be defined as a problem solving strategy using old, redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without recourse to new knowledge and experience. Inertia is a concept in physics that is used to explain the state of an object either remaining in stationary or uniform motion. Organizational theorists adopted this concept of inertia and applied it to different contexts which resulted in the emergence of diverse concepts‚Äîsuch as, for example, organizational inertia, consumer inertia, outsourcing inertia, and cognitive inertia. Some organization theorists have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002) to extend its further use in organizational learning studies. Not every instances of knowledge inertia result in gloomy of negative outcome: one study suggested that knowledge inertia could positively affect a firm's product innovation.  The concept  Knowledge inertia stems from the use of routine problem solving procedures that involves the utilization of redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without any recourse to new knowledge and thinking processes. Different methodologies exist for diverse types of knowledge that could be applied to manage knowledge efficiently. Since KI is a component of knowledge management, it is essential to consider the circulation of various knowledge types in avoiding inertia. The theory of KI supposedly studies the extent to which an organization's ability on problem solving is inhibited. Numerous factors could be attributed as enablers or inhibitors of the abilities on problem solving of an individual or an organization. Knowledge inertia applicable in the context of problem solving, therefore, may require inputs from all these diverse knowledge types, or it may require learning, new thinking, and experience. Emergence of new ideas to supplement the existing knowledge and assimilation of the same could be of help in avoiding the use of stagnant, outdated information while attempting to solve problems.

This includes poor pulmonary function, and potentially having restrictive lung disease values.  Governance  Les Autres sport classification was originally created and then governed by the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD). Currently, classification is overseen by IWAS, having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. National sport organizations handle classification on the national level. In the United Kingdom, this is the British Amputee and Les Autres Sports Association. In the United States, this is the United States Les Autres Sports Association.

Established in 1974, it employs a church-based model for training pastors and lay persons to serve in their local churches.  History  SEMBEQ was founded in 1974 by the Association of Evangelical Baptist Churches of Quebec (AEBEQ, Association d'√âglises baptistes √©vang√©liques au Qu√©bec). The seminary was started by William (Bill) Phillips, Elis√©e Beau, and Jacques Alexanian in order to meet the need within Quebec to train local Protestant pastors (at the time, most theological education in Quebec was strictly Catholic). Sixty-five student registered for the first official course, The Gospel of Mark. By the school year of 1980‚Äì1981, the seminary offered 7 courses, attended by 130 students from 17 churches. In 1984, SEMBEQ awarded its first bachelor's degree, with a master program starting in 1990.  Mission & Services  SEMBEQ \\"exists to equip local churches for the training of their leaders.\\" Beginning in 2014, the seminary has a 10-year \\"strategic vision\\" to train 200 ministry workers, 200 elders, and 200 women. SEMBEQ offers classes in theology, Bible, and ministry practices (such as counseling and church leadership). Most courses are offered within local evangelical churches, in order to facilitate the practical emphasis of the instruction. SEMBEQ also offers a publishing service to facilitate the printing of French-language theology and ministry materials. SEMBEQ Magazine is published quarterly, with the first edition appearing in the summer of 2015.  Affiliations   AEBEQ/Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada  SEMBEQ is affiliated with the Association of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Qu√©bec (AEBEQ), a group of churches in Quebec and neighbouring Ontario and New Brunswick. SEMBEQ and AEBEQ are affiliated with the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada.  Mission Quebec  SEMBEQ is affiliated with Mission Quebec, an organization that has a mission to strengthen and equip churches, as well as plant new churches and share the gospel. SEMBEQ and Mission Quebec work closely together, with the shared goal of training missionaries who can share the gospel in the province.  Northwest Seminary  SEMBEQ has recently entered into a partnership with Northwest Baptist Seminary in order to offer the training program Immerse to leaders of Quebecois churches.  Values  SEMBEQ offers a holistic program that trains students in three domains:  Knowledge  The student will obtain a better knowledge of God, His Word, the nature of the church and of its mission, as well as intellectual and doctrinal growth.  Character  The student will experience growth in his or her personal character, helping him or her to cultivate good spiritual habits, to watch over his or her own person before God, his or her family, and his or her church.  Competency  The student will develop the essential competencies in order to uplift the church, so that he or she may become an experienced worker in evangelism and disciple-making.  Logo  SEMBEQ's logo is symbolic on several levels. The four ends of the cross in the centre represent sharing the gospel unto the four corners of the earth, resonating with SEMBEQs mission to multiply church leaders. There is a fleur de lis at each end, which, in addition to adding Quebecois character, also represents faith and wisdom in heraldry. The open book with the light coming from it represents the good news that needs to be shared. In the book's binding is the shape of a house, which calls seminary students back to their local churches. The entire logo is the shape of a university crest, which symbolizes the history of SEMBEQ and its vision for future training.

For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the naming of planets that orbit two stars, which are known as circumbinary planets. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.  Exoplanet naming standard  The convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the one used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple-star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union. ::In the WMC naming system, the brightest member of a star system receives the letter \\"A\\". Distinct components not contained within \\"A\\" are labeled \\"B\\", \\"C\\", etc. Subcomponents are designated by one or more suffixes with the primary label, starting with lowercase letters for the second hierarchical level and then numbers for the third. For example, if there is a triple star system in which two stars orbit each other closely with a third star in a more distant orbit, the two closely orbiting stars would be named Aa and Ab, whereas the distant star would be named B. For historical reasons, this standard is not always followed: for example Alpha Centauri A, B and C are not labelled Alpha Centauri Aa, Ab and B. Following an extension of the above standard, an exoplanet's name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation \\"b\\" (the parent star is considered to be \\"a\\") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. The orbits of the planets 55 Cancri e, 55 Cancri b, 55 Cancri c and 55 Cancri f For instance, in the 55 Cancri system the first planet ‚Äì 55 Cancri b ‚Äì was discovered in 1996; two additional farther planets were simultaneously discovered in 2002 with the nearest to the star being named 55 Cancri c and the other 55 Cancri d; a fourth planet was claimed (its existence was later disputed) in 2004 and named 55 Cancri e despite lying closer to the star than 55 Cancri b; and the most recently discovered planet, in 2007, was named 55 Cancri f despite lying between 55 Cancri c and 55 Cancri d. As of April 2012 the highest letter in use is \\"j\\", for the unconfirmed planet HD 10180 j, and, as of July 2020, with \\"i\\" being the highest letter for a confirmed planet (Kepler-90i). If a planet orbits one member of a binary star system, then an uppercase letter for the star will be followed by a lowercase letter for the planet. Examples are 16 Cygni Bb and HD 178911 Bb. Planets orbiting the primary or \\"A\\" star should have 'Ab' after the name of the system, as in HD 41004 Ab. However, the \\"A\\" is sometimes omitted; for example the first planet discovered around the primary star of the Tau Bo√∂tis binary system is usually called simply Tau Bo√∂tis b. The star designation is necessary when more than one star in the system has its own planetary system such as in case of WASP-94 A and WASP-94 B. If the parent star is a single star, then it may still be regarded as having an \\"A\\" designation, though the \\"A\\" is not normally written. The first exoplanet found to be orbiting such a star could then be regarded as a secondary subcomponent that should be given the suffix \\"Ab\\". For example, 51 Peg Aa is the host star in the system 51 Peg; and the first exoplanet is then 51 Peg Ab. Because most exoplanets are in single-star systems, the implicit \\"A\\" designation was simply dropped, leaving the exoplanet name with the lower- case letter only: 51 Peg b. A few exoplanets have been given names that do not conform to the above standard. For example, the planets that orbit the pulsar PSR 1257 are often referred to with capital rather than lowercase letters. Also, the underlying name of the star system itself can follow several different systems. In fact, some stars (such as Kepler-11) have only received their names due to their inclusion in planet-search programs, previously only being referred to by their celestial coordinates.  Circumbinary planets and 2010 proposal  According to Hessman et al., the implicit system for exoplanet names \\"utterly failed with the discovery of circumbinary planets\\", and they state that it is unhelpful. They note that the discoverers of the two planets around HW Virginis tried to circumvent the naming problem by calling them \\"HW Vir 3\\" and \\"HW Vir 4\\", i.e. the latter is the 4th object ‚Äì stellar or planetary ‚Äì discovered in the system. They also note that the discoverers of the two planets around NN Serpentis were confronted with multiple suggestions from various official sources and finally chose to use the designations \\"NN Ser c\\" and \\"NN Ser d\\". The proposal of Hessman et al. starts with the following two rules: :Rule 1. The formal name of an exoplanet is obtained by appending the appropriate suffixes to the formal name of the host star or stellar system. The upper hierarchy is defined by uppercase letters, followed by lower-case letters, followed by numbers, etc. The naming order within a hierarchical level is for the order of discovery only. (This rule corresponds to the present provisional WMC naming convention.) :Rule 2. Whenever the leading capital letter designation is missing, this is interpreted as being an informal form with an implicit \\"A\\" unless otherwise explicitly stated. (This rule corresponds to the present exoplanet community usage for planets around single stars.) They note that under these two proposed rules all of the present names for 99% of the planets around single stars are preserved as informal forms of the IAU sanctioned provisional standard. They would rename Tau Bo√∂tis b formally as Tau Bo√∂tis Ab, retaining the prior form as an informal usage (using Rule 2, above). To deal with the difficulties relating to circumbinary planets, the proposal contains two further rules: :Rule 3. As an alternative to the nomenclature standard in Rule 1, a hierarchical relationship can be expressed by concatenating the names of the higher order system and placing them in parentheses, after which the suffix for a lower order system is added. :Rule 4. When in doubt (i.e. if a different name has not been clearly set in the literature), the hierarchy expressed by the nomenclature should correspond to dynamically distinct (sub)systems in order of their dynamical relevance. The choice of hierarchical levels should be made to emphasize dynamical relationships, if known. They submit that the new form using parentheses is the best for known circumbinary planets and has the desirable effect of giving these planets identical sublevel hierarchical labels and stellar component names that conform to the usage for binary stars. They say that it requires the complete renaming of only two exoplanetary systems: The planets around HW Virginis would be renamed HW Vir (AB) b & (AB) c, whereas those around NN Serpentis would be renamed NN Ser (AB) b & (AB) c. In addition the previously known single circumbinary planets around PSR B1620-26 and DP Leonis can almost retain their names (PSR B1620-26 b and DP Leonis b) as unofficial informal forms of the \\"(AB)b\\" designation where the \\"(AB)\\" is left out. The discoverers of the circumbinary planet around Kepler-16 followed the naming scheme proposed by Hessman et al. when naming the body Kepler-16 (AB)-b, or simply Kepler-16b when there is no ambiguity.  Proper names  The proper names of the four innermost planets orbiting 55 Cancri Most exoplanets have catalog names that are explained in the preceding sections, but in July 2014 the IAU launched a process for giving proper names to exoplanets. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names, the results of which were announced in December 2015. The planets so named were AEgir , Amateru, Arion, Arkas, Brahe, Dagon, Dimidium, Draugr, Dulcinea, Fortitudo, Galileo, Harriot, Hypatia, Janssen, Lipperhey, Majriti, Meztli, Orbitar, Phobetor, Poltergeist, Quijote, Rocinante, Saffar, Samh, Smertrios, Sancho, Spe, Tadmor, Taphao Kaew, Taphao Thong and Thestias. The decision to give the planets new names followed the private company Uwingu's exoplanet naming contest, which the IAU harshly criticized. Previously a few planets had received unofficial names: notably Osiris (HD 209458 b), Bellerophon (51 Pegasi b), and Methuselah (PSR B1620-26 b).

The mosque was built in 1781 by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I (reigned 1774‚Äì1789) in memory of his early-died son Mehmed and the mother of his son H√ºma≈üah Kadƒ±nefendi. The mosque is officially named after the sultan's name in Ottoman language. Originally, it was part of a complex consisting of a still-existing square fountain, and non-existent structures like a Turkish bath, a bakery and a mill. The complex was constructed on the place of a former coastal palace owned by Emirg√ºneoƒülu Yusuf Pasha. The current mosque was rebuilt by Sultan Mahmud II (r. 1808‚Äì1839), the son of Abdul Hamid I. The architectural style details and the decorations of the mosque comply with the architecture of Empire Period (1808‚Äì1876) of the Mahmud II era rather than with the Baroque Period (1757‚Äì1808) architecture of the Abdul Hamid I era. Apparently, no part of the mosque building is original except the inscription dating the first construction by Abdul Hamid I in 1871, which is kept on place as a sign of respect. The square-plan mosque was built in a courtyard in ashlar masonry with a wooden roof. The big windows in two rows on each side bring natural lighting into the mosque. A cylindrical slim minaret with one balcony erected on a square base is situated south of the mosque. The Acanthus-type foliage ornaments and other decorations on the minaret, typical of 19th-century minarets, indicate that it underwent modifications. A two-story sultan's pavilion is attached to the mosque's eastern wall with a separate entrance. A bay window, supported by six columns, served as relaxation room for the sultan. According to a two-line poetic inscription written in Thuluth on top of the shadirvan situated at the northern corner of the mosque's courtyard, it was endowed by Rebgig√ºl Hanƒ±m, the head of female servants in the house of M√ºmtaz Kadƒ±n, a spouse of Wali and Khedive of Ottoman Egypt Kavalalƒ± Mehmet Ali Pasha (r. 1805‚Äì1848).

History  This award is organized by Ang√©nieux, a French manufacturer of zoom lenses since 1935, official partner of the Cannes Film Festival. This award celebrates a cinematographer for his/her career, not as a brand ambassador. Despite his 2015 award, Roger A. Deakins acknowledged that he does not shoot with zoom lenses. The company explains this sponsorship, writing: \\"For more than 80 years, with their demanding aesthetics and techniques, directors of photography have secured the success of Ang√©nieux zoom lenses. In honor, Ang√©nieux turns the spotlight to these image professionals without whom cinema would not exist\\". Since 2018, the promising work of a young film professional is also highlighted during the ceremony to celebrate the future of cinematography.  Awards ceremony  The ceremony takes place within Cannes Film Festival main venue, generally during the festival's last week (month of May), with the honoree walking on the red carpet. An overview of his/her filmography is projected, then the President of Ang√©nieux and the Director of the festival speak along with former partners who explain their experiences and the reasons of this tribute. An Ang√©nieux zoom lens engraved with the name of the recipient is offered as the award. A masterclass was organized during the 4th edition of the event. Peter Suschitzky presented some of his lighting techniques on his major scenes, and his collaboration with David Cronenberg  List of honored cinematographers  * 2013: Philippe Rousselot (AFC, ASC) * 2014: Vilmos Zsigmond (HSC, ASC) * 2015: Roger A.

It follows a mother and daughter, Rose and Sofia, who embark on a journey to a Spanish clinic in search of a medical cure for Rose‚Äôs paralysis, which confines her to a wheelchair and limits Sofia's freedoms. The proprietor of the clinic, G√≥mez, is charismatic but may be a quack. While Rose undergoes treatment, 25-year-old Sofia becomes obsessed with Ingrid, a seamstress. Later, Sofia visits her father, from whom she has been estranged, in Athens, and spends time with his new wife and daughter. Athens seems to be in a state of collapse, and the novel pictures both Greece and Spain in the throes of economic and political turmoil. Sofia is an anthropologist by training, and this informs her perspective on events. Reviewing the novel for the New York Times, Sarah Lyall explained that \\"the book is a tale of how Sofia uses strength of will, rigorous self-examination and her anthropological skills to understand and begin to repair things that are holding her back\\" and argued that \\"What makes the book so good is Ms Levy‚Äôs great imagination, the poetry of her language, her way of finding the wonder in the everyday, of saying a lot with a little, of moving gracefully among pathos, danger and humour and of providing a character as interesting and surprising as Sofia.

It follows a 10-year-old girl and her mother who invite a Chinese refugee into their home. Critically acclaimed, in 2016 the author was awarded both the Scotiabank Giller Prize and the Governor General's Award for this novel. It was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize as well as the Women's Prize for Fiction.  Plot summary  The novel begins with a girl named Marie living with her mother in Vancouver, Canada. The year is 1991, and the addition to their household of a Chinese refugee fleeing the post-Tiananmen Square crackdown, Ai-Ming, is the catalyst that sets the rest of the plot into motion. The novel quickly fractures into a number of different sub-plots, introduced by Ai-Ming, which span generations of both Marie and Ai-Ming's families, who are later revealed to be intrinsically connected. These sub- plots are set during a tumultuous period in China's history, from the beginning of Mao Zedong's reign in the late 1940s to the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. There are four main eras that the novel focuses on, though they do not necessarily occur in chronological order. The first involves Big Mother Knife, her sister Swirl, and Swirl's husband Wen the Dreamer during the land reform campaign and the executions that were involved. Secondly is the era focusing on Sparrow, Kai and Zhuli during the Cultural Revolution which centers around the Shanghai Conservatory and their experiences there. Thirdly is Sparrow and Ai-Ming, his daughter, during the Tiananmen Square protests and aftermath. Finally, the last era is the \\"present\\" which is Marie discovering her connection to all these stories. As well, the story contained in the Book of Records is a constant presence throughout all these other narratives. While Wen the Dreamer is the principal translator and contributor to the book, as the novel progresses the stories of all the characters become so incorporated into the Book of Records that the line is blurred between fact and fiction, past and present.  Characters  500x500px * Jiang Li-ling: Li-ling, also referred to as Marie and Ma-li, is the main character and narrator of the book. The novel shifts from present day where Marie interacts with her Ma and Ai-ming, to past generations where characters like Big Mother Knife and Sparrow struggle with the Cultural Revolution in China. * Jiang Kai: Kai is Marie's father. We learn at the beginning of the novel that he leaves his daughter and wife to go to Hong Kong and eventually commits suicide. Later we learn that he had a close relationship with Sparrow growing up, which stemmed from an interest in classical music at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. * Ma: Ma takes care of her daughter, Marie, back in Vancouver. She also takes Ai-ming into her home upon receiving word that she is seeking refuge after the Tiananmen Square protests. * Ai-ming: Ai-ming is the daughter of Sparrow and Ling as well as the friend and neighbour of Yiwen. Ai-ming flees China after participating in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and finds a home with Marie and Ma for a short while in Vancouver. Eventually she leaves for America with the hope that she can make a better life for herself. * Big Mother Knife: Big Mother Knife is the wife of Ba Lute, sister of Swirl, and mother to Sparrow, Flying Bear, and Big Mountain. She has a close relationship with her sister and has a hard time reconciling the horrors that Swirl faces with the political powers that Ba Lute fights for. * Swirl: Swirl is the sister of Big Mother Knife and the wife of Wen the Dreamer. Wen the Dreamer and Swirl are punished with re- education through hard labour under Mao Zedong's regime in order to help them learn from their mistakes ‚Äì they harbour a secret library cellar where they store valuable heirlooms, documents, American books, and other contraband. * Ba Lute: Ba Lute is the husband of Big Mother Knife and fought for the People's Liberation Army during the birth of his son Sparrow. He places a lot of trust in Mao's Communist Party. * Sparrow: Sparrow is the brother of Flying Bear and Big Mountain, as well as Zhuli's cousin. He develops a musical relationship with Zhuli through their interests at the conservatory. Sparrow writes several symphonies throughout the novel but struggles to share them out of fear of judgement. He has a close relationship with Kai because of their work together with classical music, but it grows into something more. * Wen the Dreamer: Wen the Dreamer is the husband of Swirl and the son of renowned Chinese scholar Old West. Old West was selected by the Emperor to embark on a trip to America in order to foster his learning. Upon returning, and before he could share a lot of his knowledge, Wen's father died. Wen faces some resentment in the novel because Old West still owed 10 years of skilled labour to the emperor when he died. Wen is a poet. * Zhuli: Zhuli is the daughter of Wen the Dreamer and Swirl. She is comforted by Big Mother Knife while her parents are tortured and is dropped off on her doorstep. She also is a gifted violinist and has a close relationship with Kai as well as Sparrow, despite being 10 years his junior. * Flying Bear and Big Mountain: Flying Bear and Big Mountain are brothers to Sparrow and sons to Big Mother Knife and Ba Lute. They are interchangeable at the beginning of the novel but eventually grow apart. *Ling: Ling is the wife of Sparrow and the mother of Ai-ming. She develops a close relationship with Yiwen particularly after Ai-ming flees China, and encourages her to attend the University of Tokyo. * Lu Yiwen: Yiwen is Ai-ming's neighbour and close friend growing up. The two of them get involved as students in the Tiananmen Square protests where they frequently get themselves in trouble, causing Yiwen's parents to worry.  Historical contexts  Thien references numerous songs and texts from Chinese history. These include Sima Qian's \\"Historical Records\\". The title, Do Not Say We Have Nothing, is a reference to the Chinese version of the left-wing anthem: \\"The Internationale\\", which has been a staple anthem of the Communist Party of China after Qu Qiubai‚Äôs translation of the Russian version in 1923. Within the plot of the novel this anthem occurs at numerous points, particularly as a rallying cry for the student protesters at Tiananmen Square, at which Ai-Ming and Sparrow are present: \\"The people around her were weeping. At the front, the student leaders began to sing the Internationale.\\" (Thien 438). Also referenced in the novel is the song \\"The East is Red\\", which was used as the unofficial national anthem during the Cultural Revolution within which many of the events in the Kai and Sparrow's subplots occur. Additionally, the novel refers to \\"Song of the Guerrillas\\", a Chinese anthem that describes Chinese guerrilla fighters during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In a 2017 interview, Thien created a \\"Book Note\\" playlist that included numerous musical artists who influenced her writing of the novel. These artists included J.S. Bach, Ros Sereysothea, Sinn Sisamouth, Dmitri Shostakovich, Leonard Cohen, and Sun Belt.

Ici Radio-Canada, October 29, 2019. Reception  Jiayang Fan, a staff writer of The New York Times, called Do Not Say We Have Nothing \\"a powerfully expansive novel\\", specifically calling Thien's \\"Book of Records\\" the root of the novel's \\"remarkable authenticity\\". Jennifer Senior, another writer for The New York Times, wrote that the book \\"impresses in many senses. ... It successfully explores larger ideas about politics and art. ... It has the satisfying, epic sweep of a 19th-century Russian novel, spanning three generations and lapping up against the shores of two continents\\". On a similar vein, Brian Bethune, a writer for Maclean's, called the novel \\"a worthy winner of the Governor General's Award\\". Highlighting the novel's interaction \\"with history and memory in [an] extraordinarily delicate fashion\\", Bethune claimed that \\"it is a story of such beauty that it provokes a paradoxical hope\\". Following the announcement of the 2016 Giller Prize, Mark Medley of The Globe and Mail wrote that \\"while Ms. Thien has long been considered one of [Canada]'s most talented young writers, with her books receiving critical acclaim, the country's major literary awards had eluded her - until this year\\". Lawrence Hill, a juror on the panel for the Giller Prize, called the novel a \\"beautiful look at the salvation of music and love and life in the face of genocide. It‚Äôs a huge epic novel told in an unusual way ‚Äì without a single protagonist, without a single struggle. It‚Äôs a challenging book, and you have to work to read it\\". Bronwyn Drainie of the Literary Review of Canada wrote that Thien \\"[creates] a memorial for the millions of lives lost, disappeared, shriveled or wasted during not just the years of Mao‚Äôs reign but back to the famine of 1910 and forward to the dashed hopes of Tiananmen in 1989.

Geography  The coastal strip along the east of the locality of Clairview is relatively flat (at or just above sea level), while most of the centre and western part of the locality is hilly, up to 500 metres. The coastal flats are partially used for grazing while the hillier land is undeveloped. Clairview has a natural sand beach along the coastline. The town of Clairview is in the south-eastern corner of the locality () and consists of a strip of housing on the seafront. The Bruce Highway (from Brisbane to Cairns) passes through Clairview from the south (the locality of St Lawrence) immediately beside the town of the Clairview and is one of the few places on this \\"coastal\\" highway where the sea is actually visible from the road. The highway then continues north on a more inland route into Carmila. The North Coast railway line (also from Brisbane to Cairns) runs just to the east of the highway in the southern town area and then continues north between the highway and the coast. In the northernmost part of the locality is the neighbourhood of Flaggy Rock (), which is sandwiched between the highway to the west and the railway line to the east.  History  Remains of the former Clairview railway station on the North Coast railway line, 2016 Clairview takes its name from a former pastoral station. Clairview was served by the Clairview railway station, but it has been closed.

Born to a peasant family, he moved to Petrograd and became a metalworker at the Putilov Plant, where he became a Red Guard squad leader and fought in the storming of the Winter Palace. He joined the Red Army and fought in the Russian Civil War. During the interwar period Petrov became an armored corps officer and fought as a tank battalion commander during the Spanish Civil War. For his leadership, he received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 21 June 1937. Petrov returned to the Soviet Union and became a tank corps commander, which he led in the Soviet invasion of Poland. He led a mechanized corps in the initial stages of Operation Barbarossa and became commander of the 50th Army in August 1941. He became commander of the Bryansk Front in October 1941 and was fatally wounded during the breakout from the Bryansk Pocket.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Petrov was born to a peasant family on 15 January 1898 in Zalustezhye, part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate. From a young age, he worked as a stove fitter alongside his father. After graduating from the fourth grade, he moved to Petrograd and worked as a metalworker at the Putilov Plant in Petrograd and as a chauffeur. There he came into contact with the Bolsheviks. In March 1917, he became a squad leader of the 2nd Petrograd Red Guard Detachment. Petrov participated in the storming of the Winter Palace during the October Revolution. He joined the Red Army in 1918 and fought in the Russian Civil War. In 1920, he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  Interwar years  Around 1920, Petrov was transferred to Central Asia and fought in the suppression of the Basmachi movement, a Muslim uprising against Russian and Soviet rule. He later fought against insurgents in the Caucasus before being sent to the Tambov Infantry School, from which he graduated in 1923. While at the school, he participated in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion. He graduated from the Transcaucasian Political School in 1925. In 1932, he graduated from the armored commanders refresher courses. Petrov served as the commander of a training battalion in the 1st Mechanized Brigade, before fighting in the Spanish Civil War, serving as a battalion commander in Dmitry Pavlov's tank brigade from October 1936 to June 1937. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 2 January 1937. On 21 June he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership. Returning to the Soviet Union, he held appointments as a battalion commander and then as a tank brigade commander. In 1937, he became commander of a tank division. In June of that year, he became commander of the 5th Mechanized Corps. Petrov also became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its first convocation. In 1938, the corps was converted into the 15th Tank Corps. He participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, during which he led the corps in the Battle of Grodno. During the invasion, the corps was resupplied with fuel by parachute. On 4 June 1940, he was promoted to major general. In July 1940 he became deputy commander of the 6th Mechanized Corps. In October he became inspector of armor for the Western Special Military District. In 1941, Petrov graduated from higher academic courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff. On 11 March 1941, he was appointed commander of the 17th Mechanized Corps, which was stationed near Slonim. The 17th Mechanized Corps was a cadre-strength formation equipped with only 36 tanks.  World War II  Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Petrov's corps fought in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. The corps was initially stationed in the rear but was moved forward to Baranovichi to stop the German advance, after the initial German breakthrough. On 26 June it fought defensive battles around Baranovichi, Stowbtsy, and Minsk, but the XLVII Army Corps (Motorized) managed to penetrate the corps' defenses. Outnumbered, the 17th Mechanized Corps was unable to offer much resistance to the attack and its remnants retreated eastwards to the Berezina, where they linked up with other Soviet units. It suffered heavy losses in the fighting and on 5 July became part of the 21st Army after being ordered to move to Babruysk on the previous day. By 7 July the corps had no armored vehicles left and later in the month the corps was withdrawn to the Sukhinichi area with the 4th Army. It was then converted into the 147th Tank Brigade on 1 August. In early August 1941, Petrov was appointed commander of the 20th Rifle Corps in the Gomel area. On 16 August, he became commander of the new 50th Army of the Bryansk Front as a result of a Stavka directive on 14 August. The 50th Army defended the Bryansk and Kaluga approaches, and conducted unsuccessful counterattacks against a German bridgehead on the Desna River. The army's sector was relatively calm during September and around this time the 50th Army headquarters was visited by journalist Vasily Grossman. In early October, the army was surrounded during the Orel-Bryansk Defensive Operation, in an area known as the Bryansk Pocket. On 7 October, while trapped in the pocket with his troops, Petrov became commander of the Bryansk Front after front commander Andrey Yeryomenko was mistakenly reported killed.  Death  There are differing accounts of Petrov's death. According to Aleksander Maslov, he was seriously wounded attempting to break out of the pocket and died on 10 October 1941. John Erickson states that he was wounded during the breakout and was hidden by his soldiers in a woodcutter's hut near Karachev, where he died of gangrene on 13 October. In 1956, Petrov's son, Alexander Petrov, investigated the circumstances of his death. Alexander concluded that his father had been shot through both hips during the breakout, taken to the village of Golynka and hidden in the house of the Novokreshchenovy family. By this time Petrov was suffering from gangrene and could not be moved. Novokreshchenov's wife reportedly threw an old coat over him when German troops searched the house, claiming he was her husband. Another group of Soviet soldiers moved him to an isolated cabin. As the gangrene worsened, the soldiers and civilians decided to take him to Karachev for treatment. He rejected the idea and reportedly died ten days later. Petrov was buried near the Golynka village in the Karachevsky District. In 1956, he was reburied in the Bryansk cemetery.

She led the congregation as its superior despite interference from outside visitors that officials in Rome appointed to supervise the order. Her beatification was celebrated in Lisbon in 2011 and Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the solemn Mass on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life Lib√¢nia do Carmo Galv√£o Mexia de Moura Telles de Albuquerque was born on 15 June 1843 in Lisbon to the nobles Nuno Tom√°s de Mascarenhas Galv√£o Mexia de Moura Telles de Albuquerque (25 January 1813 ‚Äî 3 December 1857) and Maria da Purifica√ß√£o de S√° Carneiro Duarte Ferreira (d. 30 May 1856); her brother was Henrique Galv√£o Mexia Moura Sousa Telles Albuquerque (b. 15 March 1851). She received her baptism from Father Jer√≥nimo on 2 September 1843 in the parish church of Benfica. Her godmother was Lib√¢nia do Carmo de Abranches Ferreira da Cunha. Her great-uncle died in her home during her adolescence and her little brother Rui died around that time. Her mother died from cholera on 30 May 1856 and her father followed mere months later in 1857 due to Yellow Fever in Saint Joseph's Hospital. In October 1857 she joined the Royal Asylum of Ajuda (Asilo Real da Ajuda) ‚Äî in the palace of King Peter V ‚Äî an orphanage for children of noble families that the Vincentian Sisters managed (until 1882) and remained there in the boarding school until 9 June 1862 when the Marquises of Valada invited her to reside with them. The Marchioness ‚Äî a friend of her late parents ‚Äî treated her like her own daughter. She remained there until 1867 when she sought shelter at the convent of S√£o Patr√≠cio. In 1869 she received the habit of the Capuchin order in the convent of S√£o Patr√≠cio and assumed the name of \\"Maria Clara of the Child Jesus\\". Father Raimundo dos Anjos Beir√£o supported her entrance into the religious life and suggested she go to profess her vows outside of the nation due to the volatile climate; he also supported her idea to establish her own religious congregation. Fr. Raimundo dos Anjos Beir√£o On 5 February 1870 she left Portugal for the novitiate in Calais in France ‚Äî profession was forbidden in Portugal due to the anti-religious climate ‚Äî with the Congregation of the Franciscan Hospitallers and Teachers; she commenced it on 10 February. She left for France alongside Sister Maria of Esp√≠rito Santo who returned to Portugal with her later. She made her profession on 14 April 1871 and returned to Lisbon on 1 May 1871. She was installed on 3 May 1871 as the superior and novice mistress of the Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of the Immaculate Conception that she founded; she was recognized as the foundress in a solemn celebration on 3 May 1876. Pope Pius IX provided papal assent to the order on 27 March 1876. On 25 November 1876 she sent a letter to the Holy See to request pontifical approval of her order. Fr. Beir√£o died on 13 June 1878 which prompted her to guide the order alone and she could not reach the funeral in time due to her visiting the houses of Braga. She sent the first missionaries to Africa on 7 February 1883 and sent more to India on 24 May 1886. On 23 June 1893 the Holy See appointed the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon Jos√© Sebasti√£o de Almeida Neto as the apostolic vicar to the order with the aim of securing her resignation as superior general. In 1894 she received approval from the Holy See to open a novitiate in Panjim in the colony of Goa. From 11‚Äì14 August 1894 the General Chapter of the order re-elected her as superior general with 45 out of 60 votes. The Holy See recognized her as the order's foundress on 22 May 1896 and as superior general until her death. On 29 May 1896 the Franciscan priest Antonio de Santa Maria was made the new apostolic visitor of the order and in the 2‚Äì25 October 1897 General Chapter sought to isolate her with amending the constitution of the order; the General Chapter of 2‚Äì6 September 1896 was for researching such amendments though the presiding priest was another appointed as the visitor. The full apostolic visit concluded on 20 December 1898 during which time her powers were suspended though the end of the visit restored her powers as superior. Her death in the evening of 1 December 1899 came due to cardiac illness coupled with asthma and a coin nodule that resulted in three hours of pain before her death. Her remains were buried on 4 December 1899 (her mortal remains were incorrupt for 55 years) in the Prazeres Cemetery and later transferred in 1954 to the convent of Santo Ant√≥nio in Caminha and then in 1998 to the motherhouse of the order in Linda-a-Pastora near Lisbon. Her order became aggregated to the Third Order of Saint Francis. Beatification Sister Maria Clara of the Child Jesus The beatification process commenced under Pope John Paul II on 21 August 1995 in Lisbon after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled her as a Servant of God and granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause ‚Äî the diocesan process spanned from 18 December 1995 until its closure on 12 November 1997 in which 21 boxes of documentation was sent to Rome. The C.C.S. validated the process on 6 November 1998 and assumed charge of the boxes. The postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 2003 at which point the C.C.S. transferred the cause to a board of historians on 4 May 2004 so that the latter could deem there were no historical obstacles to it. The consulting theologians voted in favor of the cause on 1 February 2008 while the C.C.S. followed this decision in a meeting on 7 October 2008. She was proclaimed to be Venerable on 6 December 2009 after Pope Benedict XVI approved the fact that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The miracle approved for her beatification was the cure of the Spanish woman Mrs. Georgina Troncoso Monteagudo on 12 November 2003. The purported miracle was investigated in Spain in a diocesan process from 24 January 2005 until 23 April 2005 while the C.C.S. approved the process and validated it on 15 February 2008. The medical board approved the miracle on 14 January 2010 while consulting theologians followed suit on 15 June 2010; the C.C.S. also approved it on 7 December 2010. Benedict XVI approved the miracle on 10 December 2010 and delegated Cardinal Angelo Amato to preside over the beatification on 21 May 2011 in Portugal in which the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon Jos√© Policarpo was in attendance and presided over the Eucharistic rites.

She was launched on 10 September 1776 and began active service soon thereafter, Capt. Seth Warner in command. Design Trumbull was long, wide with a draft of and a displacement of . She was armed with one 18-pounder long gun, one 12-pounder long gun, two 9-pounder guns and six 6-pounder guns. Trumbull had a crew of 80 men. Service history September 1776 Trumbull transported a draft of reinforcements to Crown Point, New York, as General Arnold's forces sought to hurry to completion a squadron of small vessels, mostly galleys and cannon-carrying gondolas, or \\"gun-dalows,\\" to oppose the expected British push down the lake toward Fort Ticonderoga. The Americans sought to retain possession of the lake, which they had controlled since early in the war, and thus engaged in a shipbuilding race with the British, who were also constructing a fleet of specially designed lake craft. Since there were no roads parallel to the lake, the British were forced to launch their invasion southward by water instead of by land. Control of Lake Champlain was thus vital to the success of British plans. Battle of Valcour Island Trumbull was among Arnold's vessels that anchored in the lee of Valcour Island, south of Plattsburgh, New York, by early October, to await the British onslaught. With 25 ships, the British outnumbered the Americans by 10; and, in view of this numerical inferiority, Arnold's second-in-command urged a withdrawal. Nevertheless, despite his squadron's inferiority, Arnold bravely stood and fought. Initially, the Americans' position favored them, as on the morning of 11 October 1776, Capt. Thomas Pringle's 25-vessel \\"fleet\\" sailed past Valcour Island and failed to discover Arnold's ships until he was south of them. Then, forced to attack from the leeward, Pringle's ships sailed up to meet Arnold's which were deployed in a crescent-shaped formation, anchored across Valcour Bay. In the resultant action, the Americans suffered heavy damage to , , and ; and the loss of and . The action ended at nightfall when the British withdrew and anchored, thinking that the Americans could not escape. Under cover of darkness and fog, the surviving ships in Arnold's squadron muffled their oars to slip past the unsuspecting British. However, before they could reach safety, a contrary wind sprang up and slowed their progress southward. The British weighed anchor, gave chase, and soon overhauled the Americans. In the ensuing battle, Arnold lost his own flagship, the galley Congress, and five other ships. Trumbull escaped the holocaust, only to be captured by the British the following year, 1777, and was eventually destroyed. Aftermath of the Battle of Valcour Island Thus, the Battle of Valcour Island ended in a crushing tactical defeat for the Americans since it all but annihilated Arnold's flotilla and left the British in full control of Lake Champlain. However, the dominance of Arnold's little warships on the lake during the first year and one-half of the Revolutionary War had prevented British troops from invading the newly independent colonies from Canada through the Lake Champlain, Lake George, Hudson River corridor. Then, when the Royal Navy finally did manage to best Arnold's flotilla at Valcour Island in the autumn of 1776, winter was too close to permit English land forces to take advantage of British victory by a thrust down the corridor to attack Washington's army from the rear. This gave the colonies additional time to recruit, train, and arm the forces which the following year stopped a British invasion in a decisive victory at Saratoga, New York, which has been called the turning point of the American Revolution. Thus, while losing on a tactical level at Valcour, the Americans won a strategic victory which ultimately enabled them to achieve independence.

In 1984, she co-founded the non-profit housing support center, LAMP, and in 2006 she founded an advocacy group, Housing Works. Early life Lowery was born Mollie Ellen Raddatz on August 2, 1945, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. She was educated at Bishop Alemany High School and the University of Portland, where she received a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling.  Career  Lowery's first position was as director of the non-profit organisation Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica. While there, she founded the Sojourn Shelter for Battered Women and Their Children, which was one of the first such facilities in the state. In 1984, wanting to help people who had been moved out of California's mental hospitals, she left Ocean Park and started working with philanthropist Frank Rice. Together they founded the Los Angeles Men's Place, based in Skid Row. The facility initially offered night-time support to homeless and mentally ill people. Rice and Lowery later renamed the center LAMP, and expanded it to provide permanent supportive housing and complementary social services, such as counselling and substance abuse treatment. The foundation also opened a laundromat on Skid Row, employing homeless people as well as providing a service for them, and later a convenience store and a craft shop. Lowery's approach was groundbreaking in that her organisation offered help to homeless people without preconditions, and considered housing to be the most crucial service to provide to people in need. Unlike other non-profit foundations or government agencies, no paperwork or identification was required, and clients did not need to overcome drug or alcohol addiction before using the shelters and services. This approach became known as \\"housing first\\" and Lowery was considered one of its pioneers. Over the next 20 years Lowery oversaw further development of the center, eventually opening an additional 8 facilities across Los Angeles and employing 80 people. In 2005 she oversaw the construction of a new building, the $1.2 million Frank Rice Safehaven, which houses the organisation's headquarters, a day center and a crisis shelter.  Recognition  In 2003, Lowery received the Ruth Hollmann Award for Outstanding Contribution to Mental Health from Share! and the Emotional Health Association of California. In 2016, the California Community Foundation named Lowery one of their 30 Unsung Heroes of Los Angeles County.  Later life  Following her retirement from LAMP in 2005, Lowery moved to a ranch in the rural area of Bishop, California. She regularly took LAMP residents to the ranch for visits, believing that experiencing the outdoors could assist their recovery. In 2006, Lowery founded an advocacy group, Housing Works, which aimed to assist long-term homeless people into accommodation. She served as the group's director until 2015, and continued in an advisory position until a few weeks before her death. She also held a position with Bring Los Angeles Home, a coalition of cross-sector agencies established in 2006. Lowery died of cancer on July 25, 2016. She was 70 years old.

It is a low, spreading, short-lived shrub with broad leaves, and pale, greenish-yellow flowers over a long period. Description Eremophila calcicola is an spreading shrub growing to high and wide. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long, wide, elliptic to lance-shaped with a few white hairs. Unlike in some other eremophilas, the leaves are not clustered on the ends of the branches. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on an S-shaped stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, narrow triangular sepals which are long and green with a few hairs. The petals are long, pale yellowish-green and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tips of the petals are different sizes and are curved backwards. The inside and outside of the petal tube have a few scattered glandular hairs. The 4 stamens are much longer than the petal tube and are paired. Flowering time is from May to October. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila calcicola was first formally described by Robert Davis in 2016 and the description was published in Nuytsia. It was formerly known as Eremophila sp. Parmango Road. The specific epithet (calcicola) is derived from the Latin calx meaning \\"lime\\" and -cola meaning \\"dweller\\" referring to the soil type in which this species grows. Distribution and habitat This eremophila is found south of Balladonia in the Mallee biogeographic region where it grows in sandy, calcareous soil in open woodland. It appears in large numbers after bushfire, quickly reaches maturity, produces large number of flowers then dying of old age after a few years. Conservation status Eremophila calcicola is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

It belongs to the Diocese of V√§xj√∂. History and architecture Hagby Church dates from the late 12th century. It was preceded by a wooden chapel dedicated to Saint Sigfrid of Sweden a few kilometres south of the present church; by 1541 it was abandoned. The present church was dedicated to Saint Olaf during the Catholic era . The church was built in a round shape to serve both a religious purpose and a defensive one, i.e. it was a fortified church. 17 arrowslits have been identified in the upper part of the wall. The interior layout has changed considerably through the centuries. Originally it consisted of two floors, a basement floor and an upper floor that served as the church proper. The present layout of the church largely dates from a renovation carried out in 1968. Inside the church, there are fragments of frescos from the 14th century on the walls. The church contains a wooden crucifix from the 16th century and a baptismal font of Gotlandic limestone. The pulpit dates from the 1760s. A silver chalice and paten dating from the 16th century were found under the church floor during a renovation in 1889, and are today part of the collections of the Swedish History Museum.

The Boar's Head Tavern is featured in historical plays by Shakespeare, particularly Henry IV, Part 1, as a favourite resort of the fictional character Falstaff and his friends in the early 15th century. The landlady is Mistress Quickly. It was the subject of essays by Oliver Goldsmith and Washington Irving. Though there is no evidence of a Boar's Head inn existing at the time the play is set, Shakespeare was referring to a real inn that existed in his own day. Established before 1537, but destroyed in 1666 in the Great Fire of London, it was soon rebuilt and continued operation until some point in the late 18th century, when the building was used by retail outlets. What remained of the building was demolished in 1831.Henry C. Shelley, Inns and Taverns of Old London, Boston, L.C. Page, 1909, p.21. The boar's head sign was kept, and is now installed in the Shakespeare's Globe theatre.Asbury, Nick, White Hart Red Lion: The England of Shakespeare's Histories, Oberon, 2013, p.52. The site of the original inn is now part of the approach to London Bridge in Cannon Street. Near the site on modern Eastcheap, architect Robert Lewis Roumieu created a neo-Gothic building in 1868; this makes references to the Boar's Head Inn in its design and exterior decorations, which include a boar's head peeping out from grass, and portrait heads of Henry IV and Henry V. Roumieu's building originally functioned as a vinegar warehouse, though it has since been converted into offices.Crawford, David, The City of London: its architectural heritage: the book of the City of London's heritage walks, Woodhead-Faulkner, 1976, p.56.

It was released theatrically in Germany on 10 November 2016 and in Austria the following day. Reception Boyd van Hoeij from The Hollywood Reporter welcomed that only two people are at the center of the story: \\"Luckily, the blossoming relationship between Phil and Nick are at the center of the movie where a hot flirt turns into a physical relationship.\\" According to van Hoeij, it is a big forte of the film that Erwa shows how teenagers have to struggle with their sexuality, and the director proves that he has understood that, in physical love, less is sometimes more. Van Hoeij praises the actors Hofmann and Sch√ºmann, who portrayed those two boys in an affectionate and tender way, which is as interesting as the fact that those teenagers have to question themselves, due to their sexuality, if they are ever going to be happy. However, van Hoeij also noted that because of the focus on those two characters, others like Kat and Diane felt like they were neither protagonists nor side characters.Boyd van Hoeij: 'Center of My World' ('Die Mitte der Welt'): Munich Review In: The Hollywood Reporter, 7. Juli 2016. Reaction in Russia On the verge of the press conference in the course of the premiere in Moscow, the film was rejected by some journalists and critics as propaganda as non-traditional portrayal of sexual relationships between teenagers that are not allowed to be distributed in Russia. Kirill Raslogow, the program director of the film festival, had warned his fellow countrymen beforehand: \\"This movie could shock the audience.\\" The Austria Presse Agentur (APA) described the problem of the film in Russia: \\"With this portrayal of society, the director reproduces a downright nightmare of right- conservative Russians who often disqualify Europe as 'Gayrope'.\\"Ein schwuler Jugendlicher begeistert Moskau In: Austria Presse Agentur (zitiert in futter.), 27 June 2016.

He served as the first-ever Bishop of Algiers from 1838 to 1845 in Algiers, French Algeria. He attempted to evangelise the local Arab population and he built nearly 60 new churches in Algeria. Early life Antoine-Adolphe Dupuch was born on May 22, 1800 in Bordeaux, France. Career Dupuch was ordained as a priest by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bordeaux in 1825. Dupuch served as the first Bishop of Algiers from 1838 to 1845. He was initially appointed to cater to the French colonists who lived in Algeria and ensure they led righteous lives. However, Dupuch felt called by God to restore Christianity in Algeria. Indeed, he believed Arabs had been Christians before they were forced to convert to Islam. He also believed Algeria could be used as a springboard to rechristianise the entire continent of Africa. Dupuch's views on evangelisation clashed with official doctrine of the French Army under Governor-General Thomas Robert Bugeaud, who feared the Arabs might feel disrespected and rebel. He also clashed with Emily de Vialar and expelled her Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition from Algeria; the order focused on evangelising Tunisia instead. Meanwhile, Dupuch helped build churches across Algeria. By 1846, he had paid for the construction of 60 new churches, chapels and oratories in French Algeria, out of his own pocket. However, he was forced to resign as bishop as he went into debt. Dupuch was the author of several books about Christianity in French Algeria and Africa. He wrote two books about Abdelkader El Djezairi. Death Dupuch died on July 11, 1856.

The season took off with an impressive start, in which the club remained undefeated for 8 consecutive matches (the best undefeated record in the club's history in the league). At the end of October however, Ergotelis began struggling, and as a result, the club's board of directors decided to replace Petrakis on 14 January 2014. =PAS Giannina = Fourteen days later, on 28 January 2014, Petrakis was hired by Epirus-based Superleague club PAS Giannina. Petrakis managed avoid relegation at the end of the season, and subsequently went on to secure a 6th- place finish in the 2014‚Äì15 and 2015-16, thus leading PAS Giannina to their first ever UEFA Europa League campaign. For this feat, Petrakis was named \\"Best Manager in Greece\\" for the 2014‚Äì2015 season. Further contributing to the club's history, Petrakis managed to advance PAS Giannina to the Third qualifying round of the competition, after eliminating Norwegian club Odd 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. He was a candidate for \\"Best Manager in Greece\\" for the 2015‚Äì2016 season but he didn't voted again. His contract didnt renewed because PAS Giannina relegated from Super League.

Biography  At college of Rouen where he studied, Saas distinguished himself by his talent for Latin poetry. Having embraced the ecclesiastical state, he became one of the secretaries of the archbishop of Rouen and took advantage of the leisure left to him by this modest employment to become familiar with reading charts and study in depth the History of Normandy. Provided the cure of Saint-Jacques- sur-Darn√©tal, he soon resigned this benefit and accepted instead a position of librarian of the metropolitan chapter, which would facilitate the means to indulge his taste for historical and literary research. In the trial the chapter had to support against the Benedictines of the abbaye de Saint-Ouen, father Saas showed great zeal for the maintenance of the privileges of his church, and he was rewarded in 1751 by a canonry. Saas was known for a long time in an advantageous manner as a bibliographer. The assiduous reading of historical dictionaries proved him that those who were most esteemed were not error-free, and he was quick to point out, in small scholarly writings, those he had noticed. He was going to press a volume of notes forming a useful supplement to the latest edition of the Dictionaire of Mor√©ri, when the sudden weakening of his forces forced him to give up all kind of work. He died suddenly after lingering a few years. Abbot Saas was a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen since its founding, and he had shared the work with zeal, but the fate of the memoirs he had shared with this company is unknown.The list of these various pieces, sixteen in number, are to be found in the √âloge de Saas, by Cotton, (p. 22). The first is a Lettre sur les po√®tes de Normandie, read 21 December 1745, and inserted by Goujet in his Biblioth√®que fran√ßaise, vol.6. Haillet de Couronne read his √âloge of which an extract can be found in the Recueil de l‚Äôacad√©mie by M. Gosseaume, vol.4, (p. 286). Another praise of abbot Saas, by Cotton Deshoussayes, was printed in Paris, Berton, 1776, in-8¬∞ (35 pages).  Publications  * Fables choisies by la Fontaine, translated into Latin verse bys PP.

Fautes et b√©vues de toute esp√®ce. Fautes de dates et de chronologie. Le chanoine de Rouen emploie la m√™me forme, avec un plus grand nombre de divisions, pour critiquer le Dictionnaire historique de Ladvocat, √©dition de 1760 ; et ce dernier √† son tour, dans une lettre de Mercier de Saint-L√©ger, qui ne fut publi√©e qu‚Äôen f√©vrier 17C6, critiqua les premiers volumes du Nouveau Dictionnaire historique, auquel il supposait que Saas n‚Äô√©tait pas √©tranger, et dont il avait lu les deux premiers volumes avant sa mort: ces deux volumes, publi√©s √† Avignon sous la rubrique d‚ÄôAmsterdam, ayant √©t√© imprim√©s d√®s 1765, bien qu‚Äôil n‚Äôaient paru qu‚Äôen 1766, la lettre de Ladvocat, sous le pseudonyme de Pont-de-Ri, est dat√©e de Cavaillon, 10 d√©cembre 1765, c‚Äôest-√†-dire dix-neuf jours avant sa mort. Douai (Rouen), 1762, in-8¬∞ de 119 pages ; (Saas also points out several mistakes by Mor√©ri in 1759.Among his unpublished works, we may regret a Chronologie en vers latins hexam√®tres, a work of his youth, but one that Father Tournemine put a lot over the work of Father Labbe on the same subject.) * Lettres (au nombre de sept) sur l‚ÄôEncyclop√©die pour servir de suppl√©ment aux sept volumes de ce dictionnaire, Amsterdam (Rouen), 1764, in-8¬∞; he only reports errors in geography, history and chronology. * Lettre √† l‚Äôabb√© Goujet, contenant de nouvelles remarques sur lsotta, femme savante d‚ÄôItalie, dans le tome 5 des M√©moires d‚ÄôArtigny. (It is believed that Saas lent his hand to the two letters by Pierre-Nicolas Midy, of the Acad√©mie de Rouen, to Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, printer of the Grand Vocabulaire fran√ßais, Amsterdam (Rouen), 1767, in-8¬∞.) Saas had Hippolytus redivivus reprinted; he provided notes to Fontette for the Biblioth√®que historique de la France; We owe him much of the project Affiches et annonces de la haute et basse Normandie, where he contributed several articles. Saas started under the name Anti-More√©ri, a much larger work. The manuscript, forming 625 pages in- fol., extended only on the first five letters of the alphabet, mainly on TA. It passed into the hands of Drouet, who intended to make use of for a supplement (√âloge de Saas, by Cotton, p. 30).

The movie is made special by very special role of Saugat Malla and the best role played by Karma Shakya in his entire film career till date as claimed by critics and audience. Unfortunately the movie had to clash with very much anticipated Bollywood movie that year by Salman Khan named 'Sultan' which occupied the major portion of screen and audience attention in Nepal. So it did a lot less income than the movie deserved and than producers expected. But all the movie viewers claim the movie to be a true gem for Nepalese Movie Industry and the IMDB rating of the movie also gives a similar idea. Plot Lukamari means hide and seek. The film story is based on a police investigation of a murder case of a school girl Rupa K.C. As the film unfolds, the case gets connected to the tenants of Musya Sahu and the hide and seek between cops and criminals starts. The movie starts when two undercover veteran crime investigating agents meet coincidentally and start sharing a same room in some place in Kathmandu valley. In the movie they are investigating two seemingly different cases. One cop is seen investigating murder case of a young girl and another cop is seen finding clues about murder of two young boys. The cop in girl's murder case is dragged to Kathmandu due to the relation of the girl with a suspicious sick teacher of her and another cop finds some papers of land in the crime scene that gives hint about the criminal's location. To keep the mission secret both the cops change their names, jobs and motives of living in the valley without any idea about each other's reality. The movie starts with some comedy and proceeds with the suspicious acts of all the actors in the screen. The movie also showcases some side characters like a priest, some drug addict youths and a tea shopkeeper who initially seem to be present for comedy but things change afterwards. As the film reaches to its interval there start a rapid change in all aspects. The two cops spying on a young girl living in the same house as they do and a love affair between a married women and a handsome landlord carries the comedy till the end but every minute brings few more thrill as the suspense starts disclosing. The two cops again meet coincidentally to find out each other's identity. They share their investigations just to know that their cases are somehow interconnected. At the climax, they find out that both their suspect lives next door to them. The suspect happens to be the husband of the women who is in affair with the landlord. So the cops use the landlord to get into the suspect's room and after finding a solid proof of him being the criminal, they raid in his house a thrilling chase begins. The chase discloses the reasons of murder and also the identities of some seemingly less significant characters like the priest. The movie focuses on comedy, thrill, suspense, Nepalese crime fighting methods and also some problems of Kathmandu like unemployment, lack of water and prostitution.  Cast  *Saugat Malla as Budhan Chaudhary *Karma as Unique Maharjan *Bikram Singh Tharu as Kirateshwar Rai *Surabina Karki as Jaya Giri *Rista Basnet as Ragini *Krishna Bhakta Maharjan as Musya Sahu Critical reception This film received generally mixed critical review. Many critics who were attracted by new types of story lines being portrayed in movies at those years found the movie to be a revolution in the industry but some people who searched for the classical tone of Nepalese movies in this movie really could not find it to be a good movie. The movie was appreciated for brilliant direction. Critics believed the movie to have very catchy plot even though the story proceeds very slowly. The movie also received appreciation for its comic timing and rapid turn of events. The movie is rated around 8 out of 10 in IMDB scale.

Located at the intersection between Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, it serves as the boundary between Barangays South Triangle, Laging Handa and Sacred Heart. A monument stands in the middle of the roundabout which commemorates the members of the ill-fated Philippine contingent to the 11th World Scout Jamboree that was among the casualties of the United Arab Airlines Flight 869 crash of 1963. The monument consists of a circular pedestal with bronze statues positioned around the structure, in the likenesses of the 24 members of the Philippine delegation (22 Boy Scouts, 2 veteran Scouters, and 2 chaperons). In 2007, the Quezon City government performed a renovation on the monument that included the addition of an obelisk on top of the structure honoring Tom√°s Morat√≥, the first mayor of Quezon City and the one after whom Tomas Morato Avenue is named.

A biologist might argue that this has the function of signalling to predators, helping the springbok to survive and allowing it to reproduce. Teleology in biology is the use of the language of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology to have been made to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and attempts have been made to teach students to avoid teleological language. Nevertheless, biologists still often write about evolution as if organisms had goals, and some philosophers of biology such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language is unavoidable in evolutionary biology. Context Teleology Teleology, from Greek œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ, telos \\"end, purpose\\" and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, logia, \\"a branch of learning\\", was coined by the philosopher Christian von Wolff in 1728. The concept derives from the ancient Greek philosophy of Aristotle, where the final cause (the purpose) of a thing is its function. However, Aristotle's biology does not envisage evolution by natural selection. Phrases used by biologists like \\"a function of ... is to ...\\" or \\"is designed for\\" are teleological at least in language. The presence of real or apparent teleology in explanations of natural selection is a controversial aspect of the philosophy of biology, not least for its echoes of natural theology. natural theologian John Ray, and later William Derham, used teleological arguments to illustrate the glory of God from nature. Natural theology Before Darwin, natural theology both assumed the existence of God and used the appearance of function in nature to argue for the existence of God. The English parson-naturalist John Ray stated that his intention was \\"to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation\\". Natural theology presented forms of the teleological argument or argument from design, namely that organs functioned well for their apparent purpose, so they were well-designed, so they must have been designed by a benevolent creator. For example, the eye had the function of seeing, and contained features like the iris and lens that assisted with seeing; therefore, ran the argument, it had been designed for that purpose. Goal- directed evolution Religious thinkers and biologists have repeatedly supposed that evolution was driven by some kind of life force, a philosophy known as vitalism, and have often supposed that it had some kind of goal or direction (towards which the life force was striving, if they also believed in that), known as orthogenesis or evolutionary progress. Such goal-directedness implies a long-term teleological force; some supporters of orthogenesis considered it to be a spiritual force, while others held that it was purely biological. For example, the Russian embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer believed in a teleological force in nature,Barbieri, Marcello. (2013). Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems.

The French biophysicist Pierre Lecomte du No√ºy and the American botanist Edmund Ware Sinnott developed vitalist evolutionary philosophies known as telefinalism and telism respectively. Their views were heavily criticized as non-scientific; the palaeontologist George Gaylord Simpson argued that Du No√ºy and Sinnott were promoting religious versions of evolution.Simpson, George Gaylord.

With the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were discovered, the hypothesis of orthogenesis was largely abandoned by biologists,Levinton, Jeffrey S.

Wiley. p. 218. \\"With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change. This demonstrated that Darwinian natural selection was the primary mechanism for evolution and that other models of evolution, such as neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, were invalid.\\" especially with Ronald Fisher's argument in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. Natural selection Natural selection, introduced in 1859 as the central mechanism of evolution by Charles Darwin, is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. The mechanism directly implies evolution, a change in heritable traits of a population over time. Adaptation flight, but they were co- opted rather than adapted for this task, having evolved for an earlier purpose in theropods like Sinornithosaurus millenii, perhaps insulation. A trait which persists in a population is often assumed by biologists to have been selected for in the course of evolution, raising the question of how the trait achieves this. Biologists call any such mechanism the function of the trait, using phrases like \\"A function of stotting by antelopes is to communicate to predators that they have been detected\\", or \\"The primate hand is designed (by natural selection) for grasping.\\" An adaptation is an observable structure or other feature of an organism (for example, an enzyme) generated by natural selection to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the hypothesis that feathers are adaptations for bird flight. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the fitness of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living birds. However, there is also a historical question, namely, did the trait arise at the same time as bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: theropod dinosaurs had feathers, but many of them did not fly. Feathers can be described as an exaptation, having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as insulation. Biologists may describe both the co-option and the earlier adaptation in teleological language. Status in evolutionary biology Reasons for discomfort Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in evolutionary biology, much to the consternation of some writers, and as an explanatory style it remains controversial. There are various reasons for discomfort with teleology among biologists. Firstly, the concept of adaptation is itself controversial, as it can be taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin argued, that biologists agree with Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss in his 1759 satire Candide that this is \\"the best of all possible worlds\\", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions. However, all that evolutionary biology requires is the weaker claim that one trait is at least slightly better in a certain context than another, and hence is selected for. The Watchmaker analogy argues that the presence of a complex mechanism like a watch implies the existence of a conscious designer. Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of natural theology, that the natural world gives evidence of the conscious design and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray. William Derham continued Ray's tradition with books such as his 1713 Physico-Theology and his 1714 Astro-Theology. They in turn influenced William Paley who wrote a detailed teleological argument for God in 1802, Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature, starting with the Watchmaker analogy. Such creationism, along with a vitalist life-force and directed orthogenetic evolution, has been rejected by most biologists. Thirdly, attributing purposes to adaptations risks confusion with popular forms of Lamarckism where animals in particular have been supposed to influence their own evolution through their intentions, though Lamarck himself spoke rather of habits of use, and the belief that his thinking was teleological has been challenged. Fourthly, the teleological explanation of adaptation is uncomfortable because it seems to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because it seems to attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically. A fifth reason concerns students rather than researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then the use of teleological language by scientists may act as an obstacle to students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective. Removable teleological shorthand Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something \\"in order to\\" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. Some philosophers of biology such as James G. Lennox have argued that Darwin was a teleologist, while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions, and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and actually being teleological. Michael Heads, on the other hand, describes a change in Darwin's thinking about evolution that can be traced from the first volume of On the Origin of Species to later volumes. For Heads, Darwin was originally a far more teleological thinker, but over time, \\"learned to avoid teleology.\\" Heads cites a letter Darwin wrote in 1872, in which he downplayed the role of natural selection as a causal force on its own in explaining biological adaptation, and instead gave more weight to \\"laws of growth,\\" that operate [without the aid of natural selection]. Andrew Askland, from the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law claims that unlike transhumanism, an ideology that aims to improve the human condition, which he asserts is \\"wholly teleological\\", Darwinian evolution is not teleological. Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand for describing any function which offers an evolutionary advantage through natural selection. For example, the zoologist S. H. P. Madrell wrote that \\"the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements\\" for the sake of saving space, but that this \\"should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection.\\" Irreducible teleology Other philosophers of biology argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. Francisco Ayala specified three separate situations in which teleological explanations are appropriate. First, if the agent consciously anticipates the goal of their own action; for example the behavior of picking up a pen can be explained by reference to the agent's desire to write. Ayala extends this type of teleological explanation to non-human animals by noting that A deer running away from a mountain lion. . . has at least the appearance of purposeful behavior.\\" Second, teleological explanations are useful for systems that have a mechanism for self-regulation despite fluctuations in environment; for example, the self-regulation of body temperature in animals. Finally, they are appropriate \\"in reference to structures anatomically and physiologically designed to perform a certain function. \\" Ayala, relying on work done by philosopher Ernest Nagel, also rejects the idea that teleological arguments are inadmissible because they cannot be causal. For Nagel, teleological arguments must be consistent because they can always be reformulated as non-teleological arguments. The difference between the two is, for Ayala, merely one of emphasis. Nagel writes that while teleological arguments focus on \\"the consequences for a given system of a constituent part or process,\\" the equivalent non-teleological arguments focus on \\"\\"some of the conditions ... under which the system persists in its characteristic organization and activities.\\" However, Francisco Ayala argued that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander similarly argued that the modern concept of biological 'function' depends on natural selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided.Neander, Karen (1998). \\"Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense,\\" in C. Allen, M. Bekoff & G. Lauder (Eds.), Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology (pp. 313‚Äì333). The MIT Press. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr likewise stated that \\"adaptedness ... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal- seeking.\\" Angela Breitenbach, looking at the question of teleology in biology from a Kantian perspective, argues that teleology is important as \\"a heuristic in the search for causal explanations of nature and ... an inevitable analogical perspective on living beings.\\" In her view of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy. Colin Pittendrigh coined the similar term 'teleonomy' for apparently goal-directed biological phenomena. For Pittendrigh, the notion of 'adaptation' in biology, however it is defined, necessarily \\"connote that aura of design, purpose, or end-directedness, which has, since the time of Aristotle, seemed to characterize the living thing\\" This association with Aristotle, however, is problematic, because it meant that the study of adaptation would inevitably be bound up with teleological explanations. Pittendrigh sought to preserve the aspect of design and purpose in biological systems, while denying that this design can be understood as a causal principle. The confusion, he says, would be removed if we described these systems \\"by some other term, like 'teleonomic,' in order to emphasize that the recognition and description of end-directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient causal principle.\\" Ernst Mayr criticised Pittendrigh's confusion of Aristotle's four causes, arguing that evolution only involved the material and formal but not the efficient cause. Mayr proposed to use the term only for \\"systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information.\\" William C. Wimsatt affirmed that the teleologicality of the language of biology and other fields derives from the logical structure of their background theories, and not merely from the use of teleological locutions such as \\"function\\" and \\"in order to\\". He stated that \\"To replace talk about function by talk about selection [...] is not to eliminate teleology but to rephrase it\\". However, Wimsatt argues that this thought does not mean an appeal to backwards causation, vitalism, entelechy, or anti-reductionist sentiments. The biologist J. B. S. Haldane observed that \\"Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public.\\"Mayr, Ernst (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pages 91‚Äì117.

He was an expert on New Zealand poisonous plants and the taxonomy and reproductive biology of New Zealand grasses, and served as the director of the Botany Division of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Biography Born in Wellington on 4 August 1922, Connor was the son of James Connor and Margaret Edith Connor (n√©e Byrne). He was educated at St Patrick's College, Wellington, and then studied at Victoria University College, graduating Bachelor of Science in 1948 and Master of Science with first-class honours in 1950. In his early scientific career, he catalogued plants that were dangerous to livestock, leading to the publication of the book, The Poisonous Plants in New Zealand, in 1951, and an expanded edition in 1977, which is regarded as the canonical text on the subject. However, his major body of research was concerned with the taxonomy and reproductive biology of New Zealand grasses. Working at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) for 40 years, Connor rose to become director of the Botany Division. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science by Lincoln College in 1978 on the basis of papers submitted. Following his retirement from the DSIR in 1982, Connor continued working at the University of Canterbury as an honorary fellow. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1983. Connor served on various statutory authorities, including the North Canterbury Nasella Tussock Board, the North Canterbury Catchment Board and the Mount Cook National Park Board. In 2000, Connor was awarded the Hutton Medal of the Royal Society of New Zealand jointly with Elizabeth Edgar for their contributions to the documentation and botanical classification of New Zealand flora. Together they authored the final volume, volume 5, of the series Flora of New Zealand devoted to grasses, which was published in 2000. Connor was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours for services to botany.

The Buschgro√ümutter is a forest spirit living in the deepest woods which shows herself to humans only once every hundred years. She is as old as the hills, her appearance being small and ducked, wrinkly and ugly. She has staring eyes and is sometimes said to have an iron head, a typical demonic feature. The Buschgro√ümutter's hair is long, as white as snow, but messy and full of lice. The Buschweibchen holds a gnarled stick in her hand. Her feet are overgrown by moss and she walks in a wavering manner. She has tied her apron as if she were transporting something in itJosef Virgil Grohmann: Sagen-Buch von B√∂hmen und M√§hren. Berlin 2013, p. 88. and also carries a basket on her back. The Buschweibchen manifests herself in different natural phenomena. When the mountains are \\"smoking\\" with fog in spring and autumn, then the Buschweibchen is said to be cooking. Also when a hailstorm comes up in April and the mountains look veiled, then the Buschweibchen climbs over the mountains. The character of the Buschgro√ümutter is ambivalent, fluctuating between benevolent and malevolent behaviour. She asks people to comb or louse her hair. Those who fulfill her request will be rewarded with a neverending clew of yarn or with yellow leaves which will later become gold if not thrown away. It is but very difficult to clean and tidy the Buschweibchen's hair because her head is as cold as ice, thus leading to a (temporary) freezing of the helper's hands. When she was sneered at, the Buschgro√ümutter takes revenge by breathing on the sneerer which will result in illnesses, most commonly rash. Alternatively she will perch herself on the sneerer, also leading to negative effects. Sometimes this woman of the woods is simply evil, e.g. when she attacks children which are picking berries or when she steals the milk of a herdsman's cows. The Buschgro√ümutter is regionally used to scare the children. Normally the Buschgro√ümutter is a solitary figure, but occasionally she is said to be the leader of a horde of Moosfr√§ulein (\\"moss ladies\\"), female forest spiritsH.

In the 19th century, mythologists such as Jacob Grimm or Wilhelm Mannhardt declared the Buschgro√ümutter to be the leaderWilhelm Mannhardt: Wald und Feldkulte: Band I. 2005, p. 75. or even the queen of the moss people, similar to the elf queen. Ludwig Bechstein, another mythologist of the 19th century, declared her to be identical with legendary creatures such as Hulda or Bertha,Ludwig Bechstein: Deutsches Sagenbuch. Meersbusch, Leipzig 1930, p. 380. which were interpreted as ancient goddesses at that time, basically on the same level as the historically recorded Germanic goddesses. This view was abandoned in early 20th century, thus defining Buschgro√ümutter and Buschweibchen as forest demons of the most primitive kind.  Literature  * H.

It was released in China on 22 December 2017. In the U.S, Lionsgate Premiere released the film in theaters and on VOD on 6 July 2018.  Plot  Hong Kong Special Agent Lin Dong was told that his daughter Xixi (who suffers from leukemia) is in critical condition. He speeds over to the hospital, but on the way, his co- worker, Xiao Su, informs him that a critical witness is in danger. Agent Lin stops right outside the hospital, pauses, and turns back to protect the critical witness, Dr. James. Dr. James injects himself with a chemical substance stored with a mechanical heart right before the police burst in to escort him away. They are ambushed by men with exotic black armor and high- tech weaponry led by a monstrous-looking man named Andre, and almost all in the team are killed. Xixi, meanwhile, dies at the hospital. Before Andre can claim Dr. James for himself, Lin Dong manages to ram him against an oil tank using his car. When Andre proves uncannily resistant to both the car's impact and the bullets Lin Dong fires against him, Lin Dong shoots the oil tank instead, causing a huge explosion. Both Lin Dong and Andre are later shown to have survived, although Andre's injuries have him turned into a cyborg. 13 years later in Sydney, Australia, author Rick Rogers has recently released a book titled Bleeding Steel about the US Marine with a mechanical heart. A woman named Li Sen, disguised as a prostitute, pays a visit to Rogers at his hotel, drugs him, and downloads information from his computer. Simultaneously, a black-clad woman and two men with black armor suits attack the building and torture Rogers to reveal the source of his inspiration for the book, while Li Sen hides in the suite's bathtub. At that very moment, the intruders are attacked by Lin Dong, who also tries to find out the same answer. Rogers is killed by the Woman, and the arrival of the police forces everyone to retreat. When briefed about the failed operation, Andre identifies Lin Dong and Li Sen and sends the Woman after the latter, but Li Sen has already fled. Acting upon the data they purloined from Rogers, Li Sen, and Lin Dong separately begin to track Nancy, a young girl who is plagued by nightmares about a laboratory where strange experiments were conducted. In order to deal with them, she has been visiting a spiritualist, who is the source of Roger's manuscript. She is tracked down by the Woman in Black, but rescued and taken to safety by Lin Dong and Li Sen's combined efforts. Subsequently, Nancy is revealed to be Xixi, resurrected by the efforts of Dr. James, who was working on genetic enhancements of human beings, specifically regeneration, to create immortal bioroid soldiers. James fitted Xixi with a mechanical heart and abiogenetic blood substitute which enhanced her regenerative abilities. However, Xixi's temporary death left her amnesic, whereupon she was put into an orphanage for her own safety, while Lin Dong and his old unit secretly watched over her. Her nightmares stem from James' memories which imprinted themselves on the compound he had injected himself with, and his blood was afterwards used in her resurrection. Andre, a former Special Forces soldier, was another test subject who infiltrated the project in the interest of a prominent Korean arms dealer to market the bioroids. However, the artificial genome failed on Andre, slowly consuming him from within. James himself died soon after his operation on Xixi, making her the sole successful subject of his achievements. Lin Dong takes Nancy and Li Sen to his house, where he locks the young man in his advanced security vault and pays a visit to the spiritualist, who he finds murdered. Nancy runs away to take a flight back to James' abandoned home, where she recovers both her old memories of her father and a bank vault key hidden by James. Following her, Lin Dong reunites with Xiao Su, but before he can reach Nancy, she is kidnapped by the Woman in Black and brought separately to Andre's airborne laboratory. Rejoined by Li Sen, who has managed to free himself, they proceed to the bank vault, where the Woman, while retrieving a video camera from the vault, was trapped and incapacitated by Lin's old unit. Checking the camera's contents, which detail Andre's bioroid conversion, Lin and Xiao Su surmise that he needs both this information and Nancy's altered genome to bestow the regenerative effect upon himself. Onboard the laboratory plane, Andre proceeds to extracted Nancy's blood and inject it into himself to restore his body. Lin Dong, Xiao Su, and Li Sen infiltrate the craft but are thwarted by an impenetrable security screen. A scuffle with Andre's henchmen forces the villain to join the fight before the transfusion is completed, which gives Nancy sufficient time to fully regenerate and come to her father's aid. Lin and his allies cast Andre into the craft's reactor core, which overloads and destroys the lab. Li Sen is caught in the explosion; Xiao Su and Nancy manage to escape by parachute, but Lin Dong is attacked by Andre before he can join them. However, because Andre has accidentally injected Lin Dong with the enhanced blood during their fight, Lin Dong gains enough power to deprive Andre of his heart, killing him. In the aftermath, as Lin Dong, Nancy and Xiao Suspend time together as a family, Lin learns from his colleague that Li Sen was the son of the arms dealer who sought to recover James' achievements and take revenge on Andre for the murder of his family thirteen years ago. He also was a fellow mate of Nancy/Xixi at the orphanage and had acted out of genuine affection for her. At the same time, Li Sen is shown to have survived and now offering the camcorder tape to the most interested buyer.

It was developed by Charles Galton Darwin and Ralph H. Fowler in 1922‚Äì1923. Distribution functions are used in statistical physics to estimate the mean number of particles occupying an energy level (hence also called occupation numbers). These distributions are mostly derived as those numbers for which the system under consideration is in its state of maximum probability. But one really requires average numbers. These average numbers can be obtained by the Darwin‚ÄìFowler method. Of course, for systems in the thermodynamic limit (large number of particles), as in statistical mechanics, the results are the same as with maximization. Darwin‚ÄìFowler method In most texts on statistical mechanics the statistical distribution functions f in Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics, Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics, Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics) are derived by determining those for which the system is in its state of maximum probability. But one really requires those with average or mean probability, although ‚Äì of course ‚Äì the results are usually the same for systems with a huge number of elements, as is the case in statistical mechanics. The method for deriving the distribution functions with mean probability has been developed by C. G. Darwin and FowlerC.G. Darwin and R.H. Fowler, Phil. Mag. 44(1922) 450‚Äì479, 823‚Äì842. and is therefore known as the Darwin‚ÄìFowler method. This method is the most reliable general procedure for deriving statistical distribution functions. Since the method employs a selector variable (a factor introduced for each element to permit a counting procedure) the method is also known as the Darwin‚ÄìFowler method of selector variables. Note that a distribution function is not the same as the probability ‚Äì cf. Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, Bose‚ÄìEinstein distribution, Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution. Also note that the distribution function f_i which is a measure of the fraction of those states which are actually occupied by elements, is given by f_i = n_i/g_i or n_i= f_ig_i, where g_i is the degeneracy of energy level i of energy varepsilon_i and n_i is the number of elements occupying this level (e.g. in Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics 0 or 1). Total energy E and total number of elements N are then given by E = sum_i n_ivarepsilon_i and N = sum n_i. The Darwin‚ÄìFowler method has been treated in the texts of E. Schr√∂dinger,E. Schr√∂dinger, Statistical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press (1952). FowlerR.H. Fowler, Statistical Mechanics, Cambridge University Press (1952). and Fowler and E. A. Guggenheim,R.H. Fowler and E. Guggenheim, Statistical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press (1960). of K. Huang,K. Huang, Statistical Mechanics, Wiley (1963). and of H. J. W. M√ºller‚ÄìKirsten.H. J. W. M√ºller‚ÄìKirsten, Basics of Statistical Physics, 2nd ed., World Scientific (2013), . The method is also discussed and used for the derivation of Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation in the book of .R. B. Dingle, Asymptotic Expansions: Their Derivation and Interpretation, Academic Press (1973); pp. 267‚Äì271. Classical statistics For N=sum_in_i independent elements with n_i on level with energy varepsilon_i and E=sum_in_ivarepsilon_i for a canonical system in a heat bath with temperature T we set : Z = sum_text{arrangements}e^{-E/kT} = sum_text{arrangements}prod_iz_i^{n_i}, ;;; z_i = e^{-varepsilon_i/kT}. The average over all arrangements is the mean occupation number : (n_i)_text{av} = frac{sum_jn_jZ}{Z} = z_jfrac{partial}{partial z_j}ln Z. Insert a selector variable omega by setting : Z_omega = sum prod_i(omega z_i)^{n_i}. In classical statistics the N elements are (a) distinguishable and can be arranged with packets of n_i elements on level varepsilon_i whose number is : frac{N!}{prod_in_i!}, so that in this case : Z_omega = N!sum_{n_i}prod_ifrac{(omega z_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}. Allowing for (b) the degeneracy g_i of level varepsilon_i this expression becomes : Z_omega = N!prod_{i=1}^{infty}left(sum_{n_i=0,1,2,ldots}frac{(omega z_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}right)^{g_i} = N!e^{omegasum_ig_iz_i}. The selector variable omega allows to pick out the coefficient of omega^N which is Z. Thus : Z = left(sum_ig_iz_iright)^N, and hence : (n_j)_text{av} = z_jfrac{partial}{partial z_j}ln Z = Nfrac{g_je^{-varepsilon_j/kT}}{sum_ig_ie^{-varepsilon_i/kT}}. This result which agrees with the most probable value obtained by maximization does not involve a single approximation and is therefore exact, and thus demonstrates the power of this Darwin‚ÄìFowler method. Quantum statistics We have as above : Z_{omega}=sumprod (omega z_i)^{n_i}, ;; z_i=e^{-varepsilon_i/kT}, where n_i is the number of elements in energy level varepsilon_i. Since in quantum statistics elements are indistinguishable no preliminary calculation of the number of ways of dividing elements into packets n_1, n_2, n_3, ... is required. Therefore the sum sum refers only to the sum over possible values of n_i. In the case of Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics we have : n_i=0 or n_i=1 per state. There are g_i states for energy level varepsilon_i. Hence we have : Z_omega=(1+omega z_1)^{g_1}(1+omega z_2)^{g_2}cdots=prod(1+omega z_i)^{g_i}. In the case of Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics we have : n_i=0,1,2,3, ldots infty. By the same procedure as before we obtain in the present case :Z_{omega}=(1+omega z_1+(omega z_1)^2 + (omega z_1)^3 + cdots)^{g_1}(1+omega z_2 + (omega z_2)^2 + cdots)^{g_2} cdots. But :1 + omega z_1 + (omega z_1)^2 + cdots = frac{1}{(1 - omega z_1)}. Therefore : Z_omega=prod_i(1-omega z_i)^{-g_i}. Summarizing both cases and recalling the definition of Z, we have that Z is the coefficient of omega^N in : Z_omega=prod_i(1pm omega z_i)^{pm g_i}, where the upper signs apply to Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics, and the lower signs to Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. Next we have to evaluate the coefficient of omega^N in Z_omega. In the case of a function phi(omega) which can be expanded as : phi(omega) = a_0 + a_1omega + a_2omega^2 + cdots, the coefficient of omega^N is, with the help of the residue theorem of Cauchy, : a_N = frac{1}{2pi i}oint frac{phi(omega)domega}{omega^{N+1}}. We note that similarly the coefficient Z in the above can be obtained as : Z=frac{1}{2pi i}ointfrac{Z_{omega}}{omega^{N+1}}domegaequiv frac{1}{2pi i}int e^{f(omega)}domega, where : f(omega)=pmsum_ig_iln (1pm omega z_i)-(N+1)lnomega. Differentiating one obtains : f'(omega) = frac{1}{omega}left[sum_ifrac{g_i}{(omega z_i)^{-1}pm 1}-(N+1)right], and : f(omega) = frac{N+1}{omega^2}mp frac{1}{omega^2}sum_ifrac{g_i}{[(omega z_i)^{-1}pm 1]^2}. One now evaluates the first and second derivatives of f(omega) at the stationary point omega_0 at which f'(omega_0)=0.. This method of evaluation of Z around the saddle point omega_0is known as the method of steepest descent. One then obtains : Z = frac{e^{f(omega_0)}}{sqrt{2pi f(omega_0)}}. We have f'(omega_0) = 0 and hence :N (+1) = sum_ifrac{g_i}{(omega_0z_i)^{-1}pm 1} (the +1 being negligible since N is large). We shall see in a moment that this last relation is simply the formula : N = sum_in_i. We obtain the mean occupation number (n_i)_{av} by evaluating :(n_j)_{av} = z_jfrac{d}{dz_j}ln Z = frac{g_j}{(omega_0z_j)^{-1}pm 1} = frac{g_j}{e^{(varepsilon_j-mu)/kT} pm 1}, quad e^{mu/kT}= omega_0. This expression gives the mean number of elements of the total of N in the volume V which occupy at temperature T the 1-particle level varepsilon_j with degeneracy g_j (see e.g. a priori probability). For the relation to be reliable one should check that higher order contributions are initially decreasing in magnitude so that the expansion around the saddle point does indeed yield an asymptotic expansion.

It features Raveena Tandon in the lead role alongside Madhur Mittal, Divya Jagdale, Shailendra Goel, Anurag Arora, Saheem Khan and Rushad Rana. Casting is by Rajesh Gautam. The music is created by a Pakistani Sufi rock band Fuz√∂n. The film's principal photography commenced in March 2016. The film is shot in Delhi and Haryana. The film was released on 21 April 2017. It emerged as a commercial success. Plot Vidya Chauhan (Raveena Tandon) is a school teacher living in Delhi with her husband Ravi (Rushad Rana) and teenaged daughter Tia (Alisha Khan). One night she is returning home from a school event that is an annual function with her daughter when she decides to take a deserted route to avoid a huge traffic jam. During the traffic jam, Vidya calls her friend Ritu and starts telling her about the school function; while talking on phone they met with an accident. Vidya and her daughter are kidnapped by the Chief Minister's son Apurva Malik (Madhur Mittal) and his friends who take the women to a farmhouse and gang rape them before dumping their bodies on the roadside. Tia dies as a result of the assault but Vidya survives. She names the CM's son and his friends as the attackers. However, those men use their influence to get away. Vidya moves in with her friend Ritu (Divya Jagdale) after her husband leaves her. She decides to hunt down and punish her daughter's killers. First up is Sikander Beniwal. She loosens the screws on tyres of his bike causing a severe accident that kills him. She notes down the numbers and names of his friends from his phone. She finds out that one of the men, Inder Jhangra has been abusing Meenal, one of her students and Tia's friend. She helps Meenal poison Inder when he tries to abuse her in a hotel room. The inspector on the case Akhil Sachdeva is starting to get suspicious of Vidya but has no proof. Apurva Malik and his friends have also become suspicious. They beat up Ravi in order to pressure Vidya to back off. One night Ritu takes Vidya out for dinner. Vidya doesn't know that the restaurant is owned by Harshit Poojari, one of the rapists who attacked her. When Harshit sees her on the CCTV cameras, he calls Apurva who tells him to hold her. He also calls his other friends before following Vidya to the bathroom. In the ensuing scuffle Vidya stabs him and manages to escape in a taxi. She is followed by Kamran Qureshi, Poojari's accomplice. Kamran rams his car into her taxi and shoots the driver before accidentally dropping his gun. Vidya grabs the gun and kills him before rushing home. Back home she tells Ritu the truth. Inspector Suchdeva comes to question her but leaves without getting anything out of her. Apurva's men beat up Ritu and she lands up in the hospital. Vidya decides to go after the rest of them. She uses a fake name to set up a meeting at a building under construction with Sofi who is a property dealer. Once there, she holds him at gun point and makes him call Apurva and tell him that he is turning himself and the others in to the police. Sofi then jumps off the building and kills himself knowing that Apurva will kill him now. Sutti Mama who had driven Sofi there sees Vidya come out of the building with a gun in her hand and jumps into his car and drives away. His car is hit by a truck and he dies on the spot. Apurva finally tells his father to tell the cops to stop Vidya. But before they can do that, she sneaks into the CM's house during Holi and kills Apurva and his father before walking away.

Plot A young mother of two, Alejandra, is unhappy in her marriage to her husband √Ångel, who is in a secret affair with Alejandra's brother, a nurse named Fabian. In public however, √Ångel makes fun of Fabian and gays in general. Alejandra is desperately unhappy in her marriage and extremely sexually frustrated. While in the shower, she masturbates and almost reaches an orgasm until her kids knock on the door, interrupting her. Veronica is a young woman who is sexually infatuated with a tentacled alien creature, originating from a crashed meteor, that an elderly couple keep in a barn in the countryside. She has been visiting the alien for years, having sexual encounters where the creature brings her to orgasm. Having never injured her in the past, the creature suddenly bites her in the abdomen. At the hospital, she is cared for by Fabian, and makes friends with him. When she tells the older couple she wants to continue visiting the alien, they forbid it, as it has become dangerous for her. √Ångel visits Fabi√°n and angrily demands to know why Fabian has not answered his texts. Fabi√°n informs him that their affair is over. Veronica entices Fabi√°n to visit the barn, but later Fabi√°n is found naked in a field, sexually assaulted and beaten into a coma. As he lays in the hospital, Alejandra finds his phone and reads the angry texts from √Ångel, where √Ångel demands sex from him, threatening violence. √Ångel is arrested at work, and Alejandra testifies against him, as does one of Fabi√°n's co-workers who witnessed their disputes. Veronica brings Alejandra to the farm, where the couple tell her about how the alien arrived when something from the sky made a crater in a field near the farm. In the crater, animals of all sorts are wildly copulating. Alejandra is drugged by the couple and escorted into the barn, where the alien pleasures her. She continues to visit the barn, even sometimes bringing her kids along when she can't find anyone to watch them for her; they play outside while she joins her body with that of the creature. The elderly couple become increasingly concerned by the creature's capacity for violence. Veronica attempts to form a sexual relationship with a man, but he cannot satisfy her as the creature did. √Ångel's wealthy parents use their influence to have their son released from jail, posting bail by selling his house. They berate him for embarrassing them so badly, and insist he leave town and never return. Instead, he visits Alejandra in hopes of reuniting his family. She tells him that she now knows he didn't hurt Fabian, but he hits her when she says that they are done. When he tries to pull a gun on her, he accidentally shoots himself in the leg. Alejandra helps him into her truck, but drives into the countryside. She drags a semi-conscious √Ångel into the barn, where she finds Veronica dead. As Alejandra leaves, the creature lowers itself from the ceiling towards √Ångel. Later, the older man and Alejandra dump the bodies of Veronica and √Ångel into a pit, where Alejandra comments on how rapidly the pit is filling.

He was the founder of the Franciscan Sisters of the Cross. He was a noted preacher and founder of various orphanages and schools across Lebanon. Presidents of the state honored him with various awards while the populace compared him to the likes of Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Giovanni Bosco. His beatification process opened in 1979 when he was titled as a Servant of God and Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable on 21 December 1992. Pope Benedict XVI approved his beatification and delegated Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins to preside over the celebration on 22 June 2008 in Beirut. Life Khalƒ´l al-HaddƒÅd was born on 1 February 1875 in Lebanon as the third of eight children to the Maronites Boutros Saleh al- Haddad and Shams Yoakim el-Haddad. He was baptized on 21 February 1875 in the Maronite church located in his town and received the sacrament of Confirmation on 9 February 1881. He attended school in Ghazƒ´r from 1885 until 1891 and then at the College de La Sageese in Beirut where he studied the Arabic language as was the standard in addition to French and Syriac. In 1892 he left Lebanon and served as a teacher of Arabic at the Christian Brothers' College of Saint Mark's in Alexandria in Egypt from 1892 to 1893 where he felt a strong call to the religious life. The negative example of a priest stationed there struck him while the tale of the death of a Capuchin friar moved him. He returned home in 1893 to inform his father of his decision to enter the order to which his father opposed but later accepted as his son's will and that of God's. He entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in Khashbau at Saint Anthony's on 25 August 1893 and received his religious name in honor of Saint James of the Marches; he professed his perpetual vows in 1898. Upon starting his novitiate he made a covenant with God: \\"I came alive and I will only come out dead\\". He received the habit on 26 March 1894. He was ordained to the priesthood on 1 November 1901 in Beirut from Monsignor Carlos Duval in the chapel of the apostolic vicariate. Father al-HaddƒÅd was then assigned to the convent of Bab Idriss where he worked for the spiritual improvement of the local people while later his superiors tasked him with the financial management of five friaries; in his memoirs he told of occasions when he went along paths to visit such friaries and was beaten and threatened with death threats dozens of times but escaped each encounter without serious issues. The priest became noted amongst the public for the establishment of churches and hospitals in addition to the foundation of various schools and orphanages. From 1903 until a decade later in 1914 he served as an itinerant preacher and was dubbed \\"the Apostle of Lebanon\\". In 1905 he was appointed as the director of all schools that the Capuchins oversaw. In the winters when he set about preaching he was chilled to the bone because he travelled on foot while he sweated during the summers with his knapsack strung across his shoulder. On 7 October 1918 he and other friars organized fifteen soup kitchens with 18000 meals each day being handed out and a total of 3600000 meals being handed out from November 1918 until July 1919. Father al-HaddƒÅd also undertook a pilgrimage to both Lourdes and Assisi and had the chance to go to Rome where he met Pope Pius X in a private audience. The outbreak of World War II saw French Capuchins leave Lebanon in 1914 which saw the order's mission entrusted to al-HaddƒÅd who went about his work with great diligence and attention. On 25 August 1919 he purchased a piece of land on the hill of Jall-Eddib - north of Beirut - and constructed a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea while erecting a great cross in a location close to the chapel. He also introduced the Third Order of Saint Francis into Lebanon. In 1919 he founded Saint Francis' School at Jall-Eddib. In 1930 - despite finding the task quite unsettling - he founded the Franciscan Sisters of the Cross as a means of catering to the needs of the old and the disabled. Sister Marie Zougheib was his first collaborator and aided him in setting up his new congregation; he set out in the statues of his order the insistence above all else that the works of mercy never be neglected in the pursuit of the order's work. He had been titled as the \\"Vincent de Paul of Lebanon\\". In 1933 he opened the house of the Sacred Heart in Deir el-Qamar as a girls orphanage and the a hospital for handicapped girls at Dier el-Qamar in 1933. The priest later in 1948 opened the Hospital of Our Lady for the aged and for those suffering from chronic illnesses. He founded the monthly magazine \\"The Friend of the Family\\". In 1950 he also opened Saint Anthony's House for beggars and vagabonds whom police found roaming the streets. Father al-HaddƒÅd became a well-known figure across Lebanon and was often dubbed as the \\"new Don Bosco\\" and as the \\"new Cottolengo\\". He left behind a total of 24 volumes of transcribed sermons he gave in Lebanon as well as in Iran and Palestine; he also preached across Syria and Iraq. He often said: \\"Sow Hosts; reap saints\\" in response to the Blessed Sacrament. On one occasion he was called to hear the confession of an ill priest in hospital and was shocked to learn that this priest never had the chance to celebrate Mass at the hospital and so took him to Our Lady of the Sea where other ill priest soon flocked to within a short period of time. Father al-HaddƒÅd went on to found Saint Joseph's Hospital in Dora in 1948 and also the School of the Sisters of the Cross at Brummana in 1950; he also founded the Hospice of Christ the King at Zouk-Mosbeh in 1950. Father al-HaddƒÅd received from President √âmile Edd√© the Palm Medal of Lebanese Merit on 5 January 1938 while President Bechara El Khoury awarded him the Golden Medal of Lebanese Merit on 2 June 1949 and then the Officer Degree of the Lebanese Cedars Medal on 26 November 1951. He said at dawn on 26 June 1954: \\"Today is my last day!\\" and al-HaddƒÅd died at 3:00pm on 26 June 1954 in Beirut of leukemia while holding a crucifix. His last words came out in a murmur: \\"The Cross of God: the love of my heart\\". He suffered from vision impairment in his last decade and was almost blind before his death. Church bells - as well as the media - announced his death nationwide. The apostolic nuncio Giuseppe Beltrami said of him: \\"He was the greatest man that Lebanon has given to our times\\". Alfred Naqqache - representing the President Camille Chamoun - pinned on the late priest the Gold Medal of the Cedar First Class. The late priest left behind 10000 pages worth of spiritual writings. Beatification The beatification process opened in Beirut in an informative process that commenced on 27 September 1960 and concluded its business on 19 June 1964 while a team of theologians collated all of his spiritual writings and approved them as being orthodox - and not in contradiction of the faith - on 1 June 1968 while the formal introduction of the cause - on 24 February 1979 - conferred upon the late friar the title of Servant of God. An apostolic process was held in Beirut from 28 December 1979 until 1 January 1981 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the previous two processes on 15 March 1985. The postulation submitted the Positio dossier to the officials of the C.C.S. in 1990 while a team of theologians voted in favor of the dossier's contents in a meeting of 26 May 1991 while the C.C.S. also voted in favor of the cause on 17 November 1992. Father al-HaddƒÅd was declared to be Venerable on 21 December 1992 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late friar had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The process for the investigation of a miracle attributed to his intercession spanned from 17 February 2005 until 8 November 2005 while officials of the C.C.S. validated the process on 10 February 2006 before passing it to a medical board for their approval on 22 March 2007. Consulting theologians voiced their approval to the miracle as well on 1 June 2007 while the C.C.S. also voted in the affirmative on 20 October 2007 before passing it onto Pope Benedict XVI on 17 December 2007 for the final stamp of approval. Father al-HaddƒÅd was beatified in Beirut on 22 June 2008 with Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presiding on the behalf of Benedict XVI. The painting unveiled for his beatification was painted by the celebrated Russian artist Natalia Tsarkova; the painting was specially blessed by the pontiff in Rome prior to the beatification and now hangs above his tomb. The current postulator assigned to the cause is Carlo Calloni.

Generally used for airline travel, they also provide protection from dust when in storage for the occasional user. When used for airline travel the strollers and car seats are placed in gate check bags at the departure gate before boarding. The bags protect strollers and car seats from dirt whilst in the loading or cargo bay as well as from elements such as rain or snow if left on the tarmac. Strollers and car seats can be checked without a bag, but airline companies do not assume any liability for damage so it is advised to use a special bag. Passengers have to make sure that the gate check tag is visibly displayed on the bag if they need their stroller or car seat returned at the gate upon arrival. Gate check bags for strollers and car seats are usually made of strong and light fabric, such as ballistic nylon that is waterproof and offers protection from the weather on the tarmac. Types 1. Universal stroller and car seat travel bags: lightweight and economical travel bags designed to fit most strollers and car seats. Universal stroller and car seats travel bags are usually made of light, waterproof materials and they can be carried to the gate in a normal carry-on baggage. They can be found in three large categories: *Car seat travel bag ‚Äì keeps any car seats safe, secure, and free from dirt *Single stroller travel bag ‚Äì designed to fit most umbrella style strollers *Double stroller travel bag ‚Äì offers protection for most jogging strollers, double strollers, and travel systems 2. Custom stroller and car seat travel bags: designed to fit a particular stroller or car seat model. They are made of different materials, depending on the manufacturer, and they are usually padded, which makes them heavier and harder to carry. Custom travel bags are also more expensive than universal travel bags. Airline policies Delta checks strollers and car seats for free either at the curbside, at the ticket counter or at the gate. United Airlines checks strollers without a fee. No strollers are allowed as carry-on baggage and only small, collapsible strollers can be checked at the gate. Upon request, the stroller can be delivered to the aircraft door at the connecting city or destination. The company does not assume any responsibility for any damage that might occur to strollers or car seat that are not checked at the check-in counter packed in a box. American Airlines allows one stroller and one car seat per ticketed passenger. However, only small, collapsible strollers up to 20 lbs/9 kg can be checked at the gate. Strollers that are non-collapsible or heavier than 20 lbs/9 kg must be checked at the ticket counter. Southwest Airlines gives customers traveling with children the chance to free check in any type of stroller and CRS or car seat either at the curb, at the ticket counter or at the gate. The company does not assume any liability for damage to strollers, CRSs or car seats. Air Canada recommends the use of small collapsible umbrella type strollers with a collapsed diameter of maximum diameter of 25.5 cm (10 in) and maximum length of 92 cm (36 in) for free gate checking. Large strollers can only be checked in and will count as one piece of baggage. A car seat can be checked in for free. British Airways allows free gate checking of one car seat and one fully collapsible stroller with maximum dimensions of 117 cm x 38 cm x 38 cm / 46in x 15 in x 15 in. KLM allows one completely collapsible stroller for each child. If the stroller won‚Äôt fit under the seat or in the overhead baggage compartment it can be checked in at no extra charge.

The Network has made significant contributions to the development of Trade facilitation and Paperless trade in the region. History and evolution Launched by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in cooperation with United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in 2009, early work of the Community focused on building capacity of developing countries on fundamental issues associated with single window and paperless trade system development, such as business process analysis of trade procedures, data harmonization, and legal framework development. Initially referred to as the UN Network of Experts for Paperless Trade in Asia-Pacific ‚ÄúTransport‚Äù was added to the full name of the network in 2014 in recognition of the importance of transit facilitation and transport-related procedures for the many landlocked developing countries members of ESCAP, particularly those in Central Asia. Taking into account the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture for the sustainable and inclusive development of the region, recent work of the Network has increasingly focused on these two sectors since 2012. With the growing interest and investment of Governments in the development of national single window and related paperless trade systems, addressing the issue of system interoperability and the need to enable electronic exchange and legal recognition of data and documents across borders has become more pressing. A UNNExT Advisory Group dedicated to this issue was set up in 2013 and provided significant support in the development of the ‚ÄúFramework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific‚Äù, a new United Nations treaty open for signature to 53 ESCAP member states starting 1 October 2016. The continuous demand for capacity building on paperless trade and trade facilitation has led the network to develop online training and certification programmes, with a first e-learning series on \\"Business Process Analysis for Trade Facilitation\\" launched in 2015. As emphasized in the UNNExT-supported 7th Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum held in Wuhan, China in 2015, there are strong linkages between paperless trade and e-commerce and future work of the network is expected to address procedural bottlenecks to cross-border e-commerce.

Right heart strain can be caused by pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism (or PE, which itself can cause pulmonary hypertension), RV infarction (a heart attack affecting the RV), chronic lung disease (such as pulmonary fibrosis), pulmonic stenosis, bronchospasm, and pneumothorax. When using an echocardiograph (echo) to visualize the heart, strain can appear with the RV being enlarged and more round than typical. When normal, the RV is about half the size of the left ventricle (LV). When strained, it can be as large as or larger than the LV. An important potential finding with echo is McConnell's sign, where only the RV apex wall contracts; it is specific for right heart strain and typically indicates a large PE. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), there are multiple ways RV strain can be demonstrated. A finding of S1Q3T3 is an insensitive sign of right heart strain. It is non-specific (as it does not indicate a cause) and is present in a minority of PE cases. It can also result from acute changes associated with bronchospasm and pneumothorax. Other EKG signs include a right bundle branch block as well as T wave inversions in the anterior leads, which are \\"thought to be the consequence of an ischemic phenomenon due to low cardiac output in the context of RV dilation and strain.\\" Aside from echo and ECG, RV strain is visible with a CT scan of the chest and via cardiac magnetic resonance.

History He was born 8 November 1965 in Menzel Bourguiba in northern Tunisia. He became involved in 1980 with the 'Movement of Islamic Tendency' which later became the Ennahda Movement. He was a senior leader in the Tunisian Islamic Front, the armed wing of the party, by 1986. He was in Saudi Arabia with Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz and may have had interaction with the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. He fled Tunisia following a crackdown by the regime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali against the student movements in 1987. He was sentenced in absentia by the Tunis military court to two years in prison for his participation in the events. He first moved to Morocco where he studied in the Faculty of Legal Sciences at the Mohammed I University. It was at this time he married. He later went to the United Kingdom in the 1990s and studied under the al-Qaeda cleric Abu Qatada. He then fought alongside Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and in 2000 was the co-founder of a group of Tunisian militants known as the Tunisian Combat Group. He ran a guesthouse for Tunisians in Jalalabad and the men who stayed there were connected to al-Qaeda.

Completed in 1914, it was designed by David A and Charles Stevenson. History Following a complaint by the shipping owner Lord Inverclyde that a number of ships had foundered as a result of poor maritime signalling near the Whitestone Bank, and that a fog signal should be built at Maughold Head, the need for a new lighthouse was raised in 1909 by the Commissioners of Northern Light Houses. Trinity House stated that there was already a fog and light signal established on the Bahama Bank Lightship nearby. But after further discussion, and with the support of the Board of Trade they approved the works for a lightstation to be built on Maughold Head. lamp changer at Maughold Head Designed by Charles and David, two brothers from the notable Stevenson lighthouse engineering family, it consists of a 23 metre high masonry tower, with the lighthouse keepers accommodation built on the headland above at the same level as the lantern. A set of 127 steps links the tower to the keeper's cottage. The optic was supplied by Chance Brothers of Smethwick, the fog signal and other ancillary equipment by Dove & Co of Edinburgh. The 1st order Fresnel lens is still in use. Maughold Head Lighthouse became operational on 15 April 1914, and the Bahama Bank Lightship was subsequently taken out of service. With a focal height of above the sea, the light has a nominal range of 15 nautical miles, and has a characteristic of three flashes of white light every thirty seconds. The fog signal, which formed the major part of justification for the station, produced a single blast every 90 seconds. It was deactivated in 1987. Following automation in 1993, the former keeper's cottages were converted into bed and breakfast holiday accommodation, they were later sold in 2014 for a guide price of ¬£600,000. The light and tower continues to be maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board, and is registered under the international Admiralty number A4786 and has the NGA identifier of 114-5036.

The Book of Magauran The castle of Niall at Coologe was one of the stops on the medieval Irish poetic circuit. It attracted poets from all over Ireland and even as far away as Scotland. A poet would leave his own house, where he often ran a poet's school, and set off on circuit. When arriving at a lord's castle he would be given free food and board in exchange for entertaining the lord and his guests. If the lord agreed, then the poet would compose a praise poem in the chief's honour which would then be recited in front of the assembled guests and afterwards transcribed into the chief's family poem book or Duanaire, along with the poems of previous poets. In return the chief would pay the poet with cattle or a horse or gold. The poet would then leave and visit another lord's castle on the circuit, eventually returning to his own home laden with gifts. The McGovern Duanaire or Book of Magauran is the oldest such Duanaire still surviving. The earliest poem in the book was composed in honour of Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in c.1290 and the latest poem is in honour of Niall, composed about 1362. Poems 14, 15, 17, 30, 32 & 33 are dedicated to Niall and poems 13 & 16 to his wife Sadhbh. They were composed by the following poets who visited the castle during his reign- Mac Taidhg mac Raith (poem 13); two members of the √ì‚ÄôCl√∫mh√°in family from County Sligo- Caoch Ceise √ì‚ÄôCl√∫mh√°n (poem 17) and Giolla Aonghuis √ì‚ÄôCl√∫mh√°n (poem 15); Tadhg √ì‚ÄôDomhnall√°in (poem 33) and three poets from the noted poetic O'Higgins family, Mathghamhain √ì'hUiginn (poem 32), Niall √ì'hUiginn (d. 1340, poem 16, composed before 1341 when Sadhbh was married to Flaithbheartach mac Domnall Carrach O‚ÄôRourke), Tadhg √ì'hUiginn (poem 30) and Uilliam √ì'hUiginn (d. 1378, poem 14). Personal appearance According to the Book of Magauran, Niall was handsome, with curly hair, dark eyebrows, blue-grey eyes, red lips and white teeth. He had small feet and wore bright ornamented shoes and a green cotton tunic. He had a sweet, pleasant voice. In battle he wore a steel helmet. He was fond of horses and was a strong swimmer. His wife Sadhbh had blue eyes, black eyebrows and curly long blond hair which was braided and reached to her feet. Her hair was built up into a powdered coiffure. When her hair was being washed she wore a red robe and was attended by a line of kneeling maids. She did embroidery on satin and depicted lions, dragons, horses, birds and herds of oxen fleeing from a golden wolf. She worked her husband's name into the tapestry and also engraved it on the stem of his wine goblets, which had fine carvings and thin stems. She liked boating, swimming and riding horses. She wore an ornamented girdle on her waist with four buckles. She also wore coloured satin garments containing twisted golden thread and a scarlet cloak. Death Niall died in 1359 but some annals give a later date. The Annals of Ulster for 1359 state- Niall Mag Samradhain, chief of Tellach-Eathach, died. The Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1362 state- Niall Magauran, Chief of Teallach Eachdhach, died. The Annals of Connacht 1362 state- Niall Mag Samradain, chieftain of Tullyhaw, rested. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1362 state- Niall Mac Samhradhain, dux of Tellach-Echach, quievit. Family Niall married Sadhbh (d. 1373), the daughter of Cathal mac Domhnall √ì Conchobair (d. 1324), King of Connacht from 1318 to 1324, and his wife Ailbhe. She had previously been married (from before 1340 until 1352) to Flaithbheartach mac Domnall Carrach O‚ÄôRourke, King of Breifne O‚ÄôRourke from 1346 to 1349 (deposed 1349, died 1352) who was the brother of Ualgarg M√≥r √ì Ruairc also king of Breifne from 1316 to 1346. Niall's sons were Tighearn√°n M√≥r, Ruadhr√≠, E√≥ghan and C√∫Chonnacht. Flaithbheartach O'Rourke's sons, some or all by Sadhbh and therefore Niall's step-sons, were Maelsechlainn (d. 1401), Domhnall, C√∫Chonnacht, Fergal, Tighern√°n na Lurgan, Art and Concobhar. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1400 mentions their fate- The sons of Flaherty O'Rourke were banished from Breifny; and they went to Tirconnell, and brought some of the Kinel-Connell with them into Breifny, where they committed great depredations on O'Rourke, and carried away the spoils into Tirconnell. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1401 state- A war afterwards broke out between O'Donnell and Brian, the son of Henry O'Neill; for Brian had led an army into Tirconnell, and had attacked the fortress of O'Donnell, and killed the son of Niall Oge, son of Niall Garv, son of Hugh, son of Donnell Oge O'Donnell, and Melaghlin, son of Flaherty O'Rourke, and many others.

Notable buildings include the former Garrison Hospital. and the Methodist Jerusalem's Church. History The Gold House Rigensgade originates in the 1649 plan for New Copenhagen, the large area which was included in the fortified city when the old East Rampart along present day Gothersgade was decommissioned and a new one was built in a more northerly direction. According to the plan, the streets in the area were to be named after Danish territorial possessions, royalty and the upper classes. The shape of the Nyboder development indicates that the original intension was to create a street parallel to Adelgade and Borgergade at the site. Rigensgade in c. 1910 At the far end of the street was an open area, Gr√∏nland (Greenland), which was used as a military drill ground. It was also known as Rigens Marskalks Plads but by 1679 the name had already passed out of use. The so- called Gold House, am alchemist laboratory was located at the beginning of the street. It was converted into a military hospital in 1673 and later into a royal textile factory which moved to Usser√∏d in 1815. The site was then taken over by the Garrison Hospital. In 1683, Christian V purchased the buildings and used them as a textile factory.

He is also the co-chairman of Counsel Financial, a financing company that gives loans to small law firms that specialize in personal injury.  Background  Weitz started the law firm with an asbestos lawsuit. He sued on behalf of 36 workers who became sick after working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. His suit got his clients $75 million. Of that $75 million, approximately one third went to Weitz & Luxenberg. The firm now makes 60 percent of its revenue from litigation related to asbestos cases. Asbestos litigation Among the countless numbers of asbestos trust funds, seven of them paid $2.4 billion in claims in 2008. Those payments amounted to $600 million in legal fees for the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. Within the asbestos litigation system, advisory committees exist to advocate for payments for plaintiffs. The committees usually oppose advocates who would preserve trust fund resources for the future, rather than pay claims at present. Weitz served on six of these committees. The interests of current and future claimants clash; current claimants want their payment at full value and quickly, while future claimants want to preserve the trust assets until they can apply for their own compensation. In a 2002 article by The New York Times, \\"A Surge in Asbestos Suits, Many by Healthy Plaintiffs,\\" a law professor at Yeshiva University, Lester Brickman, said, \\"Sick people with legitimate claims represent a tiny fraction of the claims being brought.\\" In response, Weitz was quoted in the article as saying, \\"Juries throughout the United States have said that these people deserve compensation . . . You really have to have faith in the jury system.\\"  Politics  Weitz is a director of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association. The association is \\"a heavy lobbying presence in Albany,\\" according to The New York Times. In 2010, Kathleen Rice, the Nassau County district attorney, ran for New York state attorney general. In 2009, Rice hired Weitz's son, Justin Weitz, as an assistant district attorney. In the 2010 election cycle, Weitz and his partner, along with three other attorneys at Weitz & Luxenberg, contributed a total of $236,698 to Rice's campaign.

The district occupies a roughly triangular area west of downtown Augusta and north of the state capitol district. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, and enlarged slightly in 2008. Description and history The Winthrop Street Historic District is located on Augusta's west side, with portions of Winthrop and State Streets as its major through streets. The district extends west and south from the junction of these two roads, also including properties on side streets extending to the north of Winthrop and the east of State. It is roughly bounded on the southwest by properties on Green, Chapel, Court, and Chestnut Streets. It is about in size, and includes 193 historic buildings. Ten of these have been previously listed individually on the National Register: the Fuller-Weston House, the Tappan-Viles House, the Gov. John F. Hill Mansion, the All Souls Church, the Dr. J.W. Ellis House, the Kennebec County Courthouse, the library, the Lot Morrill House, and the South Parish Congregational Church and Parish House. Stylistically, the buildings in the district range from the Federal period to the Colonial Revival, with fine examples of late Victorian residential architecture included. The size and scale also vary, from the grand Hill Mansion to more modest Federal period houses. with The district was enlarged in 2008 by the addition of a single house, the 1830s Federal style house of merchant George Morton at 20 Spring Street. with The Winthrop Street area saw its earliest significant residential development between about 1830 and 1850, when the city experienced a construction boom following the decision to locate the state capitol and other major state facilities there. During this period, the two main roads became lined with houses, and some of the side streets were developed. Over the following century, development expanded to fill the undeveloped areas to the south and west, and along residential streets joining to other roads to the north and east. This development was spurred by the city's growth as an industrial and publishing center. Major development ended about 1915, with modest infill and redevelopment occurring in limited places within the district.

Fairbank was born July 21, 1858 in Niagara Falls, Welland County Ontario. He was the son of famous Petrolia oil pioneer, John Henry Fairbank and grew up in the oil rush of Oil Springs and Petrolia. From the age of four to eight lived with his father in the Oil Springs log shanty. He was an oil operator who took the reins of all the family businesses in 1912 as the oil fields began declining. The businesses included oil production and a hardware store. The Fairbank family founded Fairbank Oil (still in operation) in 1861. He studied at Helmuth College in London, Ontario. Gentleman Cadet Fairbank was a member of the first class at Royal Military College of Canada, soon known as the \\"Old Eighteen.\\" He entered 1st term on the 1st June 1876 and graduated in 1880. He graduated in 1891 with a degree of Doctor of Medicine from College of the Province of New York Known as King's College, now Columbia College. Due to his short stature, he was known as the little doctor. As part of the HQ staff, During World War I, he served as M.D. #1.Charles Fairbank, Petroleum Hall of Fame The businesses included one of Canada's last private banks, which was in continuous operation from 1869 - 1924 when it closed its doors voluntarily. He was the oilman who hit Canada's first gas gusher in 1914 and developed oil fields both in Bothwell, Ontario and in the Elk Hills in California. Personal life An oilman, he was actually in California when the war broke out. Although he was 57, married with children, exceptionally wealthy, and on the road to retirement, his patriotism and dedication to his country brought him back to Canada to enlist to fight for King and Country. He lived in Petrolia, Ontario with his wife, Clara Mabel Fairbank (n√©e Sussex) and their four boys: John Henry (15 years), Charles Oliver Fairbank (11 years), Henry Churchill (10 years) and Robert Theodore (8 months). He was an oil operator and M.D. He was Church of England. Military service He was appointed Lieutenant, Royal Artillery 25 Aug 1880 and took more military training in England. He was appointed Lieutenant in the Active Militia, Province of Ontario 16 July 1880. He resigned his commission in June 1881. On May 12, 1898 he was promoted Major, Sixth \\"London\\" Field Battery in London, Ontario. Before the war, he served with the Canadian Artillery, a Unit of the Active Militia. He had served previously with the Royal Artillery. He belonged to the 6th Battery Militia and Royal Rothesay. He was 5'61/2 inches and 124 pounds and 57 years of age when he enlisted for World War I, on December 3, 1915. He was an oil operator and Medical Doctor. The military were not exactly keen to send a 57-year-old to the frontline, particularly one who was an experienced soldier. So he spent time training new recruits first in Canada, then in England. Although he wanted to go overseas and fight, he was told that he could not because he was too old.Charles Oliver Fairbank Eventually, Fairbank got his wish to fight on the front lines in France. He fought in the trenches at the battle of the Somme for the 70th Battalion, but the Canadian military had different plans for him. They sent Fairbank a letter asking him to return from the front, as they believed his skills would be better put to use training younger soldiers and supporting the war effort at home by giving speeches in support of the war effort, thus helping the army recruit new soldiers. He came back to Canada to give barnburner speeches around the region, including during a parade in Sarnia. He served in the Army in Canada, England and France during World War I with the 70th Battalion, 59th Battalion, 18th Battalion and Headquarters Staff M.D. #1. He initially served overseas as a Major with the 70th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Forces from Aug 1915-September 1916.

Stead, was a British social reformer notable for the establishment of Browning Hall in London, 1895, and for his work on the National Committee of Organised Labour which waged a decade-long campaign for the introduction of a general tax funded system of old-age pensions from 1899. Biography Francis Herbert Stead was born in 1857 in Howdon, near Wallsend, North Tyneside, in the north- east of England, the son of a Congregational minister, the Rev William Stead, and Isabella (n√©e Jobson), a cultivated daughter of a Yorkshire farmer. For a time Francis followed in the footsteps of his older brother William Thomas Stead, a campaigning journalist. Later he took an Master of Arts in theology at the University of Glasgow in 1881 and trained there for the ministry. He thereafter studied in Germany and travelled in Europe. He was the Minister of Gallowtree Gate Congregational Church, Leicester, from 1884 to 1890, during which period he married Bessie MacGregor, a school teacher. They would have two daughters and two sons. Stead moved to London to assume the editorship of the Independent and Nonconformist from 1890 to 1892 and was involved in the settlement movement, which aimed to encourage relatively wealthy, educated and socially advantaged people to live in proximity with the working poor. Perhaps influenced by the model of Toynbee Hall and the work of Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, in 1894‚Äì95 he founded Browning Hall in 1894‚Äì95 at 62 Camberwell Road, Walworth. The Robert Browning Settlement provided accommodation for some university educated residents and a relatively large number of autodidacts such as James Keir Hardie. Browning Hall formed a centre for practical experimentation in social change, with a more political emphasis than other contemporary settlements, and became a local centre for trade union activities. Stead's interest in the problems of old-age led to a Browning Hall conference on pensions in December 1898, out of which arose the National Committee of Organised Labour (NECL), which worked to encourage the introduction of old-age pensions funded from general taxation ‚Äì a campaign won with the passing of the Old-Age Pensions Act 1908. Stead worked with Frederick Rogers for a decade, writing pamphlets and books, lobbying parliament and religious leaders, and travelling the length of the country to speak for the cause. Stead died at Blackheath on 14 January 1928. References  External links  * F.

Regulations  Sweden's Penal Code makes an offence of cruelty to animals, either intentional or due to gross carelessness. These protections apply to all animals capable of suffering. In addition to the Penal Code, Sweden's Animal Welfare Act 1988 provides that animals be treated well and protected from unnecessary suffering and disease. It includes specific requirements including provision of sufficient food, water, care, and space; placing animals in an environment that promotes their health and permits natural behavior; using transportation suitable to provide shelter and protection; and not subjecting animals to surgical procedures or giving injections except where necessary for veterinary medical reasons. At slaughter, animals are required to be spared unnecessary discomfort and suffering and that livestock be stunned before being bled. This exceeds the slaughter requirements of the European Union, which allows member states to grant exemptions for religious slaughter; thus no kosher slaughter can take place in Sweden. The Animal Welfare Ordinance 1988 contains further provisions related to livestock. Livestock buildings cannot be erected or altered without the approval of an animal welfare and animal health authority. The Ordinance grants powers for the Board of Agriculture to make further regulations on specific species. Regulations made under this provision include rules on fish farming and transport. In 2014, Sweden received a B out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index.  Animals used for food   Animal agriculture  In 2010 Sweden had approximately 80 million broilers, 500,000 beef cattle, 350,000 dairy cows, 200,000 sows, 2.5 million pigs, and 6 million layer hens. An investigation by the Swedish animal activist organization Animal Rights Alliance of one hundred Swedish pig farms found that 94% of farms lacked straw (rooting in straw is a natural behavior for pigs), 20% of farms used gestation crates (which are illegal in Sweden), dead animals were found at 40% of farms, tail biting (which occurs when pigs lack enough space and straw for stimulation) was found at 50%, and 84% had severely ill or wounded pigs.  Animal product consumption  Between the 1990s and 2014, Swedish meat consumption grew by 40% but in 2014 was slightly below the European Union average. However, Swedish beef consumption per capita is the third-hiehest in Europe, behind Denmark and France. In 2007, Sweden had the second-highest milk consumption in the world, behind Finland.  Veganism  In a 2014 survey of 1000 Swedes commissioned by Animal Rights Sweden, ten percent of respondents identified as either vegan or vegetarian. This was a four-percent increase from a survey five years earlier.  Animals used in research  In 2012, 982,842 animals were used in research in Sweden. If fish used in sample-based fishery surveys are included, 5,535,458 animals were used.  Animals used for fur  An undercover investigation of 15 Swedish mink farms by activist group Animal Rights Alliance found behavior indicative of high stress and frustration on 13 of 15 farms; infected, unconscious, convulsive, maimed, and dead animals; cages with large amounts of feces piled up on 67% of farms; illegal handling of carcasses on 73% of farms; and cannibalism on half of farms. In a 2015 opinion poll, 78% of the 1000 Swedish respondents (and 85% under age 30) said \\"No\\" to \\"Do you think it should be allowed to breed minks in cages for fur production?\\".  Animal activism  The leading Swedish animal rights organization, Djurens R√§tt (Animal Rights Sweden), was founded in 1882 under the name Nordiska Samfundet (Nordic Association) with the goal of opposing painful animal testing. Its current membership is about 40,000 (out of 10 million Swedes). Another Swedish animal activist organization is Djurr√§ttsalliansen (Animal Rights Alliance) The Animal Rights Alliance is a grassroots group formed in 2005 whose activities include undercover investigations of animal testing operations and farms, demonstrations, and vegan outreach.

The Block House was an old fort in the town of Melcombe, in Weymouth, Dorset, southern England. There are no visible remains today. History The fort was mentioned in texts from 1568 and 1617, and so dates from before that time. It was probably built by the town of Melcombe, before 1571, when Melcome and Weymouth became a single borough. When built, the fort was square, and was made of stone. It likely stood opposite a passage from Maiden Street to St Mary's Street, which today is likely Blockhouse Lane. At the time, it was built on the site of \\"Charloote Row\\" which is now a terrace and listed building. There were embrasures for eight guns, although only five were ever fitted. During the reign of Elizabeth I, a gentleman called Richard Smith was given the office of gunner, known as vi bellator, for life. This suggests some royal funding for the fort, although it was likely built by the town of Melcombe, rather than the Crown itself.

It is under development since 2014 and currently compatible with the x86 platform. The system is based on a microkernel and features symmetric multi-processing and multitasking. Most of the kernel and system programs are written in C++.  Design  The architectural concept is a micro-kernel design. Many of the functionalities that are usually integrated in the kernel in a monolithic or hybrid system are implemented as user-level applications. Drivers and some vital components (like the executable loader) are running as such processes. This approach tries to improve stability and avoid crashes due to faulty accesses, hardware uses or memory corruption. There is a userspace spawner process used to load executables. The current implementation supports static 32-bit ELF binaries. Dynamic linking is not supported yet. The kernel provides an application programming interface that is used for all inter-process communications and system commands. Driver processes access this interface to manage memory or request direct resource access. The interface functions are C-compatible.  Library support  A custom implementation of the libc is provided. This implementation incorporates the libm from the musl C library. libstdc++ is available as a default part when setting up the Ghost specific compiler toolchain.  POSIX compatibility  The system is partially POSIX.1 compatible.

Consensus in evidence-based medicine and the recommendations of medical specialty organizations establish the guidelines which determine the treatment for pain which health care providers ought to offer. For various social reasons, persons in pain may not seek or may not be able to access treatment for their pain. At the same time, health care providers may not provide the treatment which authorities recommend. Classification When pain is a symptom of a disease, then treatment may focus on addressing the cause of the disease. Because of the hope that treatment which ends the disease would eliminate the pain, sometimes pain management is not recognized as a priority in favor of efforts to address an underlying cause of the pain. In other cases, the pain itself might need its own treatment plan. Palliative care could be used to address the pain as its own priority. Palliative care might be used either with or alongside any treatment for an underlying condition. Signs Some organizations advise that health care providers treat pain whenever it is present. The perspective is that when a person complains of serious pain, then that person is in need of treatment. Various publications offer guidance on recognizing pain and advising when a person with pain needs additional treatment. Affected Populations Undertreatment of pain is common,  and is experienced by all age groups, from neonates to the elderly. In September 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 80 percent of the world population has either no or insufficient access to treatment for moderate to severe pain. Every year tens of millions of people around the world, including around four million cancer patients and 0.8 million HIV/AIDS patients at the end of their lives suffer from such pain without treatment. Yet the medications to treat pain are cheap, safe, effective, generally straightforward to administer, and international law obliges countries to make adequate pain medications available.Human Rights Watch, \\"Please, do not make us suffer any more...\\" Access to Pain Treatment as a Human Right, March 2009 In addition, there are multiple demographics, namely elders, non-white racial minorities, and women, which suffer from undertreatment at disproportionate rates relative to their younger, non- Hispanic white male peers.Age Undertreatment in the elderly can be due to a variety of reasons including the misconception that pain is a normal part of aging, therefore it is unrealistic to expect older adults to be pain free. Other misconceptions surrounding pain and older adults are that older adults have decreased pain sensitivity, especially if they have a cognitive dysfunction such as dementia and that opioids should not be administered to older adults as they are too dangerous. However, with appropriate assessment and careful administration and monitoring older adults can have to same level of pain management as any other population of care. However, as a result of two recent cases in California where physicians who failed to provide adequate pain relief were successfully sued for elder abuse, the North American medical and health care communities appear to be undergoing a shift in perspective. The California Medical Board publicly reprimanded the physician in the second case; the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has declared a willingness to charge with fraud health care providers who accept payment for providing adequate pain relief while failing to do so; and clinical practice guidelines and standards are evolving into clear, unambiguous statements on acceptable pain management, so health care providers, in California at least, can no longer avoid culpability by claiming that poor or no pain relief meets community standards. Race Literature examining the medical field indicates disparities in pain care for racial and ethnic minorities. Compared to Caucasian patients, African American and Hispanic patients are particularly at risk for undertreatment of pain. There are a variety of conditions for which African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities experience continuous undertreatment, including cancer pain, acute postoperative pain, chest pain, acute pain, and chronic low back pain. Research demonstrates that even when controlling for age, gender, and pain intensity, racial and ethnic minorities are frequently subjected to insufficient treatment for acute and chronic pain when compared to non-Hispanic whites. A study examining over 1300 nonminority and minority patients discovered that patients at facilities that had principally minority patients, were three times more likely to be undermedicated than patients treated in nonminority facilities. Furthermore, a follow-up study that investigated pain treatment in minority patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer found that 74% of Latinx and 59% of African American patients experiencing pain were not given the adequate analgesics. Minority patients, when compared to nonminority patients, were not as likely to be appropriately evaluated for their pain and reported less pain relief. Although the prescription of opioid analgesics in response to pain-related visits grew from 1993 to 2005, disparities in prescribing to racial and ethnic minorities persisted. White patients experiencing pain were considerably more likely to be prescribed an opioid analgesic when compared to Black, Hispanic or Asian patients. Specifically, 40% of white patients were prescribed opioid analgesics in 2005, while only 32% of nonwhite patients experiencing pain were prescribed them. Gender There are disparities in the quality of healthcare between sexes and genders, and because pain is one of the most common reasons for people to seek healthcare, there are disparities in the treatment of pain. Research show that there are biological differences in the experience of pain both along biological sex lines and along gender identity lines. There is also evidence to support that social expectations about the expression of pain can dictate patient and doctor responses, linking the treatment of pain to social stereotypes. However, historically, women have been underrepresented in clinical studies, meaning that their experience of pain and their reaction to various medications is less understood. Additionally, chronic pain, and conditions of chronic pain, are more common in women, but the rates of chronic pain and the differences in experience between men and women are not well documented. Chronic pain in women may also be attributed to reproductive issues or mental health, even when these are not causes. Causes This phenomenon can be associated with a multitude of causes. Firstly, the biomedical model of disease, focused on pathophysiology rather than quality of life, reinforces entrenched attitudes that marginalize pain management as a priority.Brennan F., Carr D.B., Cousins M., Pain Management: A Fundamental Human Right, Pain Medicine, V. 105, N. 1, July 2007. Other reasons may have to do with inadequate training, personal biases or fear of prescription drug abuse. For example, physicians may fear of being accused of over-prescribing (see for instance the case of Dr William Hurwitz), despite the relative rarity of prosecutions, or physicians' poor understanding of the health risks attached to opioid prescription.* Human Rights Watch, \\"Please, do not make us suffer any more...\\" Access to Pain Treatment as a Human Right, March 2009 * Oregon State University (2010, January 5). Pain management failing as fears of prescription drug abuse rise. ScienceDaily. Retrieved January 5, 2010, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100104151929.htm * A complicated history of politics also influences practices in the treatment of pain. This includes cultural, societal, religious, and political attitudes. These factors often disadvantage certain groups, such as the above populations, in seeking treatment for pain.  Social, cultural, and political factors  Under treatment of pain may also be cause by biases among healthcare practitioners. = The United States = In the U.S., historical and ongoing racism against nonwhites has lead to the undertreatment of pain for minorities. Research review by the National Academy of Medicine has recorded persistent qualitative discrepancies between the medical care provided to racial minorities. In its publication Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare, researchers cite cultural barriers, distrust of the healthcare system by racial minorities, and racial stereotyping. In the case of cultural barriers, physicians and their patients may lack the tools to communicate effectively because of language barriers and other differences. Many minority individuals may not trust their doctors due to past and current unethical medical practices, such as experiments performed on slaves, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and the forced sterilization of Native American women, African Americans, and potentially, current immigrants in ICE detention centers. They therefore avoid care or do not fully participate in treatment plans. Furthermore, healthcare providers, who are typically white, may also empathize more with patients of their own race than with others. Prevention and screening Current strategies for improvement in pain management include framing it as an ethical issue; promoting pain management as a legal right; providing constitutional guarantees and statutory regulations that span negligence law, criminal law, and elder abuse; defining pain management as a fundamental human right; categorizing failure to provide pain management as professional misconduct, and issuing guidelines and standards of practice by professional bodies. History In 1961 the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs established that certain drugs are \\" for the relief of pain and suffering\\" and that states should make them available to people who need them. In 2009, a World Health Organization report noted that accessing treatment for pain was difficult for many people in many places in the world for a range of reasons. In 2010 the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and adopted a resolution on access to pain treatments. Also in 2010 the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime published a feature explaining the problem of lack of access to pain treatment and expressing interest in the topic. In 2011 the International Narcotics Control Board published a supplement to its annual report which highlighted the issue as a concern to be addressed.

It was originally ordered and operated by the Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation (B-SAT). It was used as backup of BSAT-1a to broadcast television channels for NHK and WOWOW over Japan. It had a pure Ku band payload and operated on the 110¬∞E longitude until it was replaced, along its twin BSAT-1a, by BSAT-3a. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-376 satellite bus. This spin-stabilized platform had two main sections. One, the spinning section, was kept rotating at 50 rpm to maintain attitude, and a despun section that was used by the payload to maintain radio coverage. The spinning section included the Star-30BP Apogee kick motor, most of the attitude control, the power subsystem and the command and telemetry subsystems. The despun section contained the communications payload, including the antennas and transponders. It had a launch mass of , a mass of after reaching geostationary orbit and a 10-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were long and in diameter. With its solar panels fully extended it spanned . Its power system generated approximately 1,200 Watts of power thanks to two cylindrical solar panels. It also had a NiH2 batteries for surviving solar eclipses. It would serve along BSAT-1a on the 110¬∞E longitude position for the B-SAT. Its payload was composed of a four active plus four spares Ku band transponders fed by a TWTA with an output power of 106 Watts. Its footprint covered Japan and its surrounding island. History Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation (B-SAT) was founded in 1993 to broadcast by satellite the analog signals of NHK and WOWOW, including analog high definition Hi-Vision channels. In June 1994, it orders two HS-376 satellite from Hughes (now Boeing), BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. During 1997 B-SAT completed its Kawaguchi and Kimitsu satellite control centers, launched and commissioned BSAT-1a. At 22:53 UTC, April 28, 1998, the Ariane-44P flight V-108 successfully launched BSAT-1b, along Nilesat 101, from Kourou ELA-2 launch pad. On August 1, 1998, BSAT-1b entered into commercial service. In December 2000, due to launch delays of BSAT-2a, BSAT-1b started digital broadcasting services for B-SAT. During May 2005, B-SAT ordered BSAT-3a, the replacement satellite for BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. It was successfully launched in August 2007, and accepted into the fleet the next month. During November, 2007 BSAT-3a took over the broadcasting of analog and digital signals from BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. In August 2011, BSAT-1b was placed in a graveyard orbit and decommissioned.

Its front facade is three bays wide, with the front entrance in the leftmost bay, sheltered by a simple gabled hood. A secondary entrance is located on the west side of the first ell, with an open porch for access. The building retains original builtin shelving and other fixtures from the 19th century. with When the main block was built about 1797, it was originally located nearer Woodstock's center, on Elm Street. It was moved a short distance in 1806, and in 1876 it was moved to eastern Pleasant Street, at which time it was converted from a law office into a grain store. In 1880 it was moved to its present location, and adapted for residential use. It was built for Charles Marsh, a prominent lawyer and politician of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Marsh trained two of his four sons, George Perkins Marsh and Lyndon Arnold Marsh, in the law, and the latter eventually took over his practice. George Perkins Marsh became well known as a politician and diplomat, and for his early writings on conservation and preservation of open spaces. (The Marsh House is a centerpiece of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park, on Woodstock's north side.)

Biography  Robert Constantin studied and practiced the art of medicine and was a pupil of Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484‚Äì1558), with whose children he worked in publishing his Poetics (Lyon, 1561). He taught at the University of Caen, where he achieved a reputation as a Hellenist and physician and was alderman of Montauban from 1571, where he died in 1605. Among other works, especially philological (corrections of Dioscorides, Theophrastus and the De re medica by Celsus, an edition of Hippocrates and others of Ausonius), but also of bibliographic character (composed with Conrad Gesner (1516-1565), the first bibliography published in French soil, the Nomenclator insignium scriptorium, 1555). In lexicography, the Lexicon Graeco- Latinum (1562) was, along the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae by Robert Estienne, one of the most popular dictionaries for many centuries, whose composition was helped by Jean Crespin.

Personal history Rowlings was born in Shrewsbury, England in 1996. During his birth he was delivered with the umbilical chord wrapped around his neck causing oxygen starvation which in turn resulted in Rowlings developing cerebral palsy. Athletics career Rowlings first became involved in competitive sport as a teenager when he took up swimming. He competed at national level but switched to wheelchair racing at the age of 15 after he went to a British Athletics talent identification day. After gaining his classification in 2011 as a T34 athlete, Rowlings began competing at national meets. By 2013 Rowlings was appearing at senior meets and entered his first IPC Grand Prix. The next year he represented Great Britain at his first major international event, the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea. There he entered three events, taking the bronze medal in the 800m T34 in a time of 1:56.11. In 2015 Rowlings was selected to again represent Great Britain, this time at the IPC World Championships in Doha. Although he failed to take any medals, he came fourth in both the 400 metres and 800 metres races. 2015 also saw Rowlings set four British records in the same meet, when he broke the 100m, 200, 400, and 800m records at the IPC Grand Prix in Nottwil, Switzerland. The following year, in the build-up to the Summer Paralympics in Rio, Rowlings attended the 2016 European Championships in Grosseto. He medaled in all three events, improving on all his times from Swansea two years ago. He won the bronze medal in the 100m, 400m and 800m T34.

It was opened in 1923 by psychiatric nurse Agnes Richards as a private mental health institution for women with mild mental and nervous disorders as the brochure read. At Rockhaven women could be treated with dignity and grace in a beautiful and serene environment. Institution Rockhaven was inspired by principles of the Cottage Plan of Asylum architecture for mental institutions, first developed in the late nineteenth century. The Cottage Plan placed numerous individual buildings within landscaped gardens in order to create a serene, home-like environment for residents. Rockhaven is one of the best examples of an early twentieth-century woman-owned, women-serving private sanitarium in California, and was one of the first of its type in the nation. It reflects the vision of founder Agnes Richards, R.N., and represents a small, yet significant movement that sought to improve the conditions of mentally ill women in the early twentieth century. Agnes Traviss Richards, a registered nurse, was inspired to found her own institution when she became discouraged by the way women with mental illness were treated by large, state-run facilities. Having worked in state- run insane asylums in Nebraska, Iowa and Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, California, she witnessed the atrocities firsthand. Richards‚Äô vision was to create a peaceful, home-like setting where women could be cared for surrounded by gardens and lush landscaping. Building and Architecture Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District occupies a 3.4-acre site on beautiful oak-treed grounds with several vintage hospital wards and guest cottages. There are a total of fifteen buildings on the property that were erected between 1920 and 1972. Agnes Richards had some buildings relocated to the Rockhaven Sanitarium and others lifted and turned on their foundation to invite sunlight into the rooms. Richards acquired the five Craftsman-style buildings over time and she hired Prescott and Brothers to design the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style structures which were popular in Southern California in the 1920s and 1930s. Patios and courtyards acted as extensions of the residents‚Äô indoor living quarters inviting privacy and serenity. Notable residents Rockhaven Sanitarium became known as the \\"Screen Actors' Sanitarium\\", housing starlets and others connected to show business. Gladys Pearl Eley Baker, the mother of Marilyn Monroe, lived at Rockhaven from 1952 to 1966. Eley was reported to have escaped from the sanitarium several times; a year after Monroe's death in 1962, Eley received press attention for having walked 15 miles to the Lakeview Terrace Baptist Church. Billie Burke was a famous Broadway actress and film star who is best known for her role as Glinda the Good Witch in The Wizard of Oz. Burke was a long-time resident of Rockhaven. Peggy Fears, Broadway actress and legendary Ziegfeld Follies performer-turned-producer who became a real estate financier, died at Rockhaven in August 1994. Josephine Dillon, famed acting teacher and married at one time to Clark Gable, died at Rockhaven on November 11, 1971 where she had been lovingly cared for during a long illness. Marion Eleanor Statler Rose, actress best known as the female half of the vaudeville duo Statler & Rose who appeared in technicolor musicals of the time including King of Jazz (1933), entered Rockhaven as a resident in 1994. Mary Florence Cecilia (Babe) Egan, was the leader of the all-female band The Hollywood Redheads that played throughout the United States, Canada and Europe in the mid-1920s. Egan lived her final years at Rockhaven where she died of a stroke in 1966. Gwen Lee, a stage and film actress and flapper in silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, whose mental health difficulties, real or alleged, made the news when her mother sued to become Lee's legal guardian and take control of her money. Lee spent some time at Rockhaven to stay out of the limelight. Closure and Current Fate Agnes Richards ran Rockhaven Sanitarium until 1967 when she passed it on to her granddaughter Patricia Traviss. In Traviss' time, Rockhaven changed with the needs of its residents and became popular for the care of elderly women with dementia. In 2001 Traviss sold Rockhaven to a large hospital corporation. However, by 2006 they found the upkeep too costly and sold it to developers who planned to scrap the lot and build condos. The community stepped in to stop the demolition and in 2008 the City of Glendale purchased Rockhaven for about $8.25 million with the intent to open the property to the public for use as a community park. In February 2016, the site was being considered by the City of Glendale for \\"adaptive reuse.\\" As of March 2016, the site is being considered for use as a mental health facility or a shopping center.\\" Historic Designation The California State Historical Resources Commission gave unanimous approval to list the Rockhaven Sanitarium to the California Register of Historical Resources on April 18, 2016. Despite objection by the City of Glendale, the Friends of Rockhaven successfully nominated the Rockhaven Sanitarium for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.Federal Register, 81 FR 33268, May 25, 2016 Friends of Rockhaven The Friends of Rockhaven is a 501(c)(3) charity organized to protect the buildings and legacy of Rockhaven Sanitarium and ultimately with the hopes to set aside Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District as a public park and community center.

Financial companies are able to overcome geographical obstacles and reach customers across the globe by connecting with their customers on a more personal level by using social media as a real-time platform of communication. Being an integral part of everyday life, social media and technology have also led to the development of a new industry, financial technology (fintech). Social media has become a core marketing channel for some companies, especially online peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) companies as well as small business lenders. Large traditional firms are also embracing social media as a way to market their products and services. Although these larger firms fear that they may be \\"too boring\\" for these innovative platforms due to their more traditional business models with compliance restrictions and FINRA regulations, companies like Chase, Charles Schwab, and American Express have shown great success in leveraging social media to their advantage. Especially after the financial crisis of 2008, financial companies utilize social media to try to gain back the trust of their customers. However, social media can present risks to a financial firm. Aside from FINRA regulations, companies also have to worry about oversharing, viral negative comments, and the risk of becoming a dumb pipe.  Global platform  Using technology, companies can interact with customers regardless of their geographic location. While companies are able to connect with more people, their branding strategy has shifted from customized to standardized. Prior to the outbreak of technology, most banks used customized branding where they targeted only customers in their regions. However, businesses can now use technology to operate past their geographic location and maintain a consistent image across multiple countries with standardized branding. By being able to extend a consistent brand reputation across a wider geographic location, financial services companies can take advantage of economies of scale in advertising cost, lower administrative complexity, lower entry into new markets, and improved cross- border learning within the company. Many argue that electronic banking has made customers feel more distant from their banks due to lack of human to human interaction. Instead of going to a local branch and interacting with a teller, customers can now do most of their banking online and even though mobile devices. Social media has provided a way for companies to once again connect with their customers on a personal level. The financial services sector uses social media platforms to create the value that was once found physically in local branches. For example, through their Facebook page, a bank may post a snapshot of one of their employees with a brief blurb about his/her job duties and values. This strategy replicates the human to human interaction a customer would receive at a local branch and humanizes larger financial institutes.Blake, B. (2016, July 18). Personal interview.  Marketing   P2P lending  Social media is a core marketing channel for online P2P lenders as well as small business lenders. Since these companies operate exclusively online, it makes sense for them to market online primarily through social media channels. They are able to grow and find new lenders and buyers by utilizing social networks.  Large companies  While social media may not be the central marketing focus for traditional financial institutions, it has become more relevant in recent years. Using social media, financial services companies are able to reach their most valuable customers. According to consulting company Gallup, customers that interact with their bank using social media are 12% more likely to be mass affluent and 18% more likely to be emerging affluent. Besides just reaching their customers and providing service through social media, companies are also able to use data gathered from social media to improve their sales and marketing techniques. Companies that have excelled at marketing through social media include: * American Express: As a leader in institutional social media marketing, American Express manages 3 separate Twitter accounts and 5 separate Facebook pages. Additionally, they also allow customers to link their American Express cards with their social media accounts, such as Facebook, and receive deals based on their social media activity. * Barclays: Aside from maintaining the usual Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts, Barclays has also launched Pingit, a mobile application for mobile transfer using Twitter handles. * JPMorgan Chase: By mastering useful and relevant content, JPMorgan Chase is able to grap the interest of their followers on social media. This is done through short articles that they link in Facebook posts and Tweets that tell a personal story. These articles provide value for their customers that are also easily shared and can therefore reach potential customers.  New products and services  Social media has created entirely new products for the financial services sector, revolutionizing products and developing new industries such as fintech through the merging of social technology and financial services. Fintech is a way to streamline financial services and make them easier to use and access. Since this industry is more novel than the established financial services sector, fintech companies are generally startups. Although these companies are popping up all over the world, fintech companies are the most prominent in China, where digital banking, investing, and lending have become mainstream. According to consulting firm Accenture, 390 million people in China have registered to use mobile banking. This figure is more than the population of the United States. Albeit not as popular in the U.S., the most prominent American fintech company, Venmo, blends technology and financial services together on a social platform. Other financial technology companies: * Lending Club * Bitcoin * OnDeck * Funding Circle * TransferWise * Kabbage * Avant * Prosper * Zopa  Risks  Due to the real-time nature of social media, financial services companies must be on constant alert for potential issues so they can be mitigated before any serious damage control is necessary. Any negative experience a customer has can easily be shared online and if it ends up going viral, those comments could likely have a detrimental effect on the company‚Äôs stock price and reputation. On the other hand, any positive experience a customer has can also be shared online. However, positive experiences are much less likely to become viral.  Customer privacy  Customer privacy is important especially in financial services companies. It is critical that customer information such as a bank account number is kept private. However, this information can be leaked if for example, a customer is unhappy with a bank‚Äôs service, they may tweet at the bank expressing their frustrations and include their name and account number. This situation would be bad for both the customer as well as the bank.  Dumb pipe  Although dumb pipes mostly refer to telecommunication companies, now that fintech companies are gaining more of the financial services‚Äô market share, there is fear that banks may also become dumb pipe companies. In regards to the telecommunication sector, an example of a dumb pipe company would be a service provider like Verizon. Before smartphones, primarily Apple‚Äôs iPhone, became popular, companies like Verizon once controlled everything on a phone from the applications to the ringtones available. However, Apple took over and decided to focus solely on the phone and its interface instead of its wireless service. Consumers became loyal to Apple due to interface exposure and less loyal to their wireless providers, like Verizon. If a customer moved to a different area where AT&T;‚Äôs signal was stronger than Verizon‚Äôs, he/she would easily switch providers while keeping their iPhone, ultimately making telecommunication companies dumb pipes. The same thing that happened to the telecommunication industry is now happening to the financial services sectors. Customers are becoming loyal to the interfaces created by fintech companies and merely connecting their bank accounts to fintech programs. Essentially, there is nothing stopping the consumer from switching their bank and continuing to connect their accounts to services provided by fintech companies. The main concern for financial services companies is that by becoming a dumb pipe, they lose significant value.

The British converted her to a fireship and expended her in 1800 in an attack at Dunkirk Roads. Capture Admiral John Jervis's squadron was off the coast of Portugal on 24 May 1797 when a brig-corvette flying Spanish colours, was seen approaching. St Vincent made a signal for and to fly Spanish colours too, and to run alongside her. Their quarry did not realize her mistake until they raised English colours, by which time it was too late. The Spanish brig, outnumbered and outgunned, struck her colours without firing a shot. She was Nuestra Senora del Rosario, armed with 20 guns and carrying a crew of 100 men under the command of Don Juan Antonio de Carega. Royal Navy service Rosario was paid off in October 1797, but in November she came under the command of C. Hubert. From May 1798 to August 1799 Rosario was at Sheerness, fitting as a \\"temporary\\" fireship. During this time, in June, Commander James Carhew commissioned her as a fireship. Rosario participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in August-October 1799. On 28 August 1799, she was with the British fleet that captured the Dutch hulks Drotchterland and Brooderschap, and the ships Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector, in the New Diep, in Holland. A partial pay-out of prize money resulted in a payment of 6s 8d to each seaman that had been in the fleet that day. She is also among the vessels listed as participating in the proceeds of the Vlieter Incident on 30 August when a large part of the navy of the Batavian Republic, commanded by Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, surrendered to the British navy on a sandbank near the Channel known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen. Between 27 June and 8 July 1800, Rosario participated in the Raid on Dunkirk. This was an operation to capture the French frigate D√©sir√©e from Dunkerque harbour and burn other vessels. Contrary winds and a succession of unfavourable tides afforded no opportunity of making the attack until 7 July. Captain Inman, of was in charge of the operation. He sent , under Patrick Campbell, against the easternmost vessel, and loosed his four fireships, Rosario, , , and against the westernmost vessels. Dart captured D√©sir√©e on 8 July. Even though their captains remained on the fireships until the four were engulfed in flames, the three frigates that were their targets cut their cables and escaped down the Inner Channel within the Braak Sand. D√©sir√©e was subsequently purchased into the Service. The officers and crews of many British vessels, Rosario among them, shared in the proceeds of the capture. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Capture of the Desiree\\" to all surviving claimants from the action.

On 17 June 2019, the British Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that from 2020, a new resettlement scheme would be introduced, bringing the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme and the Gateway Protection Programme into a single programme with an initial quota of 5,000 people. The government stated that \\"the new programme will be simpler to operate and provide greater consistency in the way that the UK government resettles refugees\\". The start of the UK's new resettlement scheme in 2020 will also see all those arriving to the UK via Community Sponsorship counted in addition to the government's own resettlement targets.

In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum barometric pressure of , before striking eastern China. On May 22, 1901, the Manila Observatory in the Philippines (then a territory of the United States) was renamed the Philippine Weather Bureau, whose successor eventually became the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. January-July There were two storms tracked in January. On February 2, a storm was observed northwest of Borneo in the South China Sea. It moved to the west and later to the west-southwest, dissipating on February 5 between Borneo and Vietnam. There was a storm in April and another two in May. On May 14, a tropical cyclone was observed just east of Samar, an island in the east- central Philippines. Estimated to have reached typhoon intensity, the storm moved westward through the Visayas archipelago, producing a barometric pressure of 971 mbar (28.68 inHg) aboard a ship. The storm curved northeastward in the South China Sea, striking Taiwan on May 20. The storm proceeded through the Ryukyu Islands and was last noted on May 23. There were two storms in June. The first was observed on June 1 into the following day, moving northeastward while remaining east of Taiwan. A typhoon formed east of Luzon on July 12. It moved westward, crossing Cagayan and Ilocos before entering the South China Sea. The system intensified and crossed Hainan, ultimately making landfall on northern Vietnam on July 16, where it soon dissipated. At Haiphong, winds reached 140 km/h (85 mph), and the minimum pressure fell to 967 mbar (28.56 inHg). De Witte typhoon Originating near the Caroline Islands, a typhoon was observed on July 30 to the southeast of Okinawa. It moved west-northwestward, entering the East China Sea on August 1. That day, the Russian steamer De Witte encountered the typhoon's rough waves and high winds, which damaged the ship's railings. On August 2, while the ship was about 80 km (50 mi) north of Taiwan, a large wave washed overboard and flooded the engine room; this forced the crew to evacuate into two boats, and after two days they were rescued. Known as the De Witte typhoon, the storm continued to intensify until reaching a peak late on August 2, when a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar (27.17 inHg) was recorded. At its peak, the typhoon had an elliptical eye, moving west-northwestward at , with gale-force winds extending 565 km (360 mi) from the center. On August 3, the storm struck eastern China, near the border of Chekiang and Hokkien provinces. It rapidly weakened and dissipated over land. The trajectory of the storm and nearby stations provided an opportunity to study the mechanics of intense tropical cyclones' movements. Ishigaki Island, part of the Ryukyu Islands, recorded peak winds of while the storm passed to the north. In addition to wrecking the De Witte, the typhoon also damaged two other boats. Onshore mainland China, the typhoon flooded the region around Wenzhou several miles inland due to increased levels along the Ou River. On Lingkun Dao near the city, the storm destroyed an embankment, killing many people. Regional officials later provided coffins for the deceased, as well as rice and money for survivors. Heavy damage occurred around Wenzhou. August-December A tropical cyclone was observed in the South China Sea on August 15.

It was founded in 1806 by several prominent women, most notably Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. The organization has recently received greater awareness because of Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit Broadway musical Hamilton in which Eliza Hamilton expresses that she is \\"proudest of\\" establishing \\"the first private orphanage in New York City.\\" Graham Windham, Eliza Hamilton's centuries-old \\"living legacy,\\" has evolved from an orphanage to a family and youth development organization that assists over 4,500 local children each year. It has won awards, distinctions, and honors for its work. History Graham Windham was founded in 1806 when Isabella Graham, the President of the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children, decided to take care of six orphans rather than placing them in the local almshouse where children were often forced to work for food and shelter. Graham then enlisted the help of her daughter, Joanna Bethune, and friend, Eliza Hamilton. Together, they established the Orphan Asylum Society in the City of New York and began their child welfare institution in Greenwich Village. In 1835, a separate child welfare institution, the Society for the Relief of Half-Orphan and Destitute Children, later known as Windham Child Care, was established to help widowed parents care for their children. Throughout the nineteenth century, both of these organizations continued developing new programs to serve New York's most vulnerable children and families. In 1977, the Orphan Asylum Society (the Graham Home for Children) and Society for the Relief of Half-Orphan and Destitute Children (Windham Child Care) merged to create Graham Windham. In 2006, Graham Windham celebrated its two hundred years of service with a Bicentennial Ball attended by notable figures including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Laura Bush, George Pataki, and Senator Chuck Schumer. At a 2016 benefit held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Graham Windham honored Lin-Manuel Miranda, his father Luis A. Miranda, Jr., Hamilton actors Phillipa Soo and Morgan Marcell, and the historian and biographer Ron Chernow. They were all honored for their support of Eliza Hamilton's legacy. Graham Windham's historical archives contain over two hundred years of documents and have been part of the New York Historical Society's collection since 2011. Programs and services Graham Windham provides services to over 4,500 children and families affected by abuse and neglect in New York City's low-income neighborhoods. Their programs include family foster care, adoption, child abuse prevention through family strengthening and parenting programs, behavioral supports, after-school and youth development, college and career access and support, and mental health services. They provide services across 13 sites in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Harlem, and Westchester County. In Westchester, they operate The Graham School, a residential school providing comprehensive and individualized academic and therapeutic supports for students who have struggled in other settings. Graham SLAM Graham SLAM (Support, Lead, Achieve, and Model) is a Graham Windham programs that offers participants support until the age of 25 ‚Äì even if they are no longer part of the child welfare system. The program coaches and guides children and adolescents in the foster care or juvenile justice systems (or at risk of entering the system) through high school, college or vocational school, and their search for a living-wage career. , around 200 young people participate in Graham SLAM, and Graham Windham estimated that expanding services to 1,000 individuals would be possible at a cost of an additional $6 million. Community support services * Graham Windham runs a \\"Bridges to Health\\" initiative, which provides home-based services, workshops, and trainings to children in foster care who struggle with emotional and behavioral disorders, chronic health issues, and developmental delays. Foster parents can select from thirteen home-based services provided by healthcare professionals, and children receive Bridges to Health support throughout their childhoods ‚Äì even if they are no longer part of the foster care system. Graham Windham is the second-largest provider of home-based child health services in New York State. * Graham Windham also runs mental health clinics for children in Harlem, the Bronx, and Brooklyn which provide mental health services for nearly 450 children, adolescents, and parents each year. * Graham Windham operates Beacon and Cornerstone Activity Centers at two public schools in Manhattan and the Bronx as well as a public housing development in Manhattan. During the school year, the programs provide tutoring, extracurricular activities, and assistance with admission to competitive schools and colleges. During the summer, Graham Windham runs day- camps and helps students find summer jobs. Foster care and prevention One of Graham Windham's major goals is ensuring that children are either reunited with their families or are placed into loving foster families. Their foster care program (established in 1949) provides Family Foster Care, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, adoption services, Foster Parent Support, Family Success Programming, and ongoing Parent Peer Support through their Forever Families Initiative. Graham Windham also helps families develop the skills and supports they need to help children thrive by providing general preventive case management services in the Bronx and Harlem, specialized preventive case management for families in Brooklyn with substance abuse and mental health conditions, and Brief Strategic Family Therapy in Harlem. These programs help families at \\"critical junctures\\" keep their children safe, healthy, and thriving. Graham Windham uses Solution-Based Casework to guide its \\"family strengthening programs\\" in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. These programs strive to address \\"underlying conditions that can lead to child abuse and neglect\\" and encourage parents to connect with other community organizations. The Graham School The Graham School is an accredited K-12 public school that serves \\"300 at-risk day and resident students from the New York City metropolitan area\\" and emphasizes emotional support, family stability, and intensive personalized instruction. Established in 1902 on a campus located in Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County, New York, the Graham School works in partnership with the on-site Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District (established in 1967) to provide educational opportunities and therapeutic services to students who have experienced difficulty in previous school settings. (established in 1967) . The Graham School has developed a therapeutic and mentoring culture using Collaborative Problem Solving and a sustained focus on family. Graham Windham and Hamilton Although Graham Windham has been serving local families since 1806, the organization has recently received increased attention and funding due to the popularity of Hamilton.  Media and attention  Graham Windham CEO Jess Dannhauser has said that the nonprofit began a partnership with Lin- Manuel Miranda and the Hamilton cast in 2014. The partnership began when Miranda made a surprise donation to Graham Windham after learning about the organization through Twitter. Since then, the Hamilton cast has held benefits and fundraisers for Graham Windham and has launched new initiatives in collaboration with the nonprofit. Dannhauser has estimated that Graham Windham's connection to Hamilton has generated new donations \\"well into the six-figure range.\\" Dannhauser has also suggested that a continued surge in donations may allow Graham Windham to expand its Graham SLAM program from serving 200 to 1,000 students.  Hamilton-related initiatives  * Eliza's Story is a website that connects Eliza Hamilton's story in Hamilton with Graham Windham's work today. It explains that Graham Windham, through its centuries-old commitment to children and families, tells Eliza's story and embodies her legacy. The page's headline references the Hamilton song \\"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story?\\" * The Eliza Project is an initiative started by Hamilton actress Phillipa Soo in partnership with Graham Windham. Through the program, Soo plans to provide students at the Graham School with acting, dancing, and rap workshops. According to Soo, the core mission of \\"The Eliza Project\\" is \\"to use the arts as a means of expression, as an outlet for personal experience, and to uplift the creative spirit.\\" * \\"Share Your Stories\\" is an initiative led by Hamilton assistant dance captain Morgan Marcell and other cast members. The initiative is a pen-pal program between cast members and students at the Graham School. According to Marcell, the program encourages students to take \\"authorship over their own lives. On Nov. 6, 2017, Marcel screened her short documentary, ‚ÄúSharing Our Stories: The Eliza Project‚Äù during a donation ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The donation included a portrait of Mrs. Alexander Hamilton (Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton) by Daniel P. Huntington from Graham Windham and an 18th ‚Äìcentury style green silk suit worn by Lin- Manuel Miranda in the Hamilton musical. Marcel has provided the Smithsonian the rights to use the film to educate audiences about the work of Eliza Hamilton and how her legacy continues to help children today as part of its Philanthropy Initiative.

It may have been one storey higher. It is a so-called fortified church and was built to serve multiple uses. Several such churches, that could be used for many purposes as places of worship, defense and also storage were during this time built along the east coast of Sm√•land and on √ñland island. It is one of only eight medieval round churches in Sweden to survive to this day. It is located not far from Hagby Church, another round church with a similar history which probably pre-dates Voxtorp Church and may have served as a source of inspiration. The church building was altered during the 14th century, when the current choir and probably also sacristy were built. In 1667 the annular thin arch collapsed. The thin vault was then replaced with a flat roof. In 1895, the medieval armory in the south was demolished and replaced with an armory in the west. At the same time, the flat roof was torn down and replaced by a plaster dome. In 1958 the church suffered damage following being hit by lightning.

Motivation  Difficulty is considered a key predictor of behavior in psychology and is included in most recognized models of behavior change, such as the theory of planned behavior. Most of these models rely on people's perceptions and estimates of behavioral difficulty. That is, difficulty is considered to be subjective and person-dependent. Obviously, perceived difficulty varies by individual. A more objective measure of difficulty is desirable, e.g., for environmental or energy policy, because people may misperceive the difficulty of behaviors, possibly because affected by mood or current circumstances.  The Campbell Paradigm  The Campbell paradigm was proposed by Kaiser et al. as a model of behavior change with person-independent difficulty. The model treats the likelihood of individual behavior as a function of attitude and of the difficulty of engaging in this behavior. The more demanding these barriers are, the more favorable attitude towards a general goal, such as environment protection. The relation between difficulty of behaviors, attitudes and behaviors can be computed using a one-parameter logistic Rasch model and yield the proportion of persons that engage in a given behavior.

There is historically a small Punjabi community in the country, mainly consisting of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus. History Punjab lies to the east of the Pashtun region and has shared borders with Afghanistan at various points in history. For several centuries, dynasties centered in modern Afghanistan expanded towards Punjab, such as the Kushans, Kidarites, Hephthalites, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khaljis and Durranis. Other kingdoms common to both regions include the Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Kabul Shahis. In his 1857 review of J.W. Kaye's The Afghan War, Friedrich Engels describes Afghanistan as \\"an extensive country of Asia\\" which \\"formerly included... a considerable part of the Punjab.\\" In the 19th century, the Sikh Empire originating in Punjab made a series of incursions towards the Afghan frontiers, capturing large swathes of territories to the Khyber Pass. Afghan Sikh history is considered to stretch back 200 to 500 years. Not all Sikhs are of Punjabi origin however; a small minority include locals whose ancestors adopted Sikhism during Guru Nanak's 15th century expeditions to Kabul. In the 18th century, Hindu Khatri merchants from Punjab settled in Afghanistan and dominated regional trade. The Sikh and Hindu population in Afghanistan may have numbered as much as 250,000 in the 1940s. Both communities were particularly well-represented in business and government positions. The reign of Zahir Shah was considered prosperous. Some of them were wealthy landowners. In 1947, some Sikhs from Potohar in northern Punjab arrived in Afghanistan while fleeing violence during the partition of India. Demographics The population of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan stood up to 100,000 prior to the 1990s. The Soviet invasion in 1979 and the ensuing Afghan civil wars sparked a mass exodus and the community declined drastically. Most migrated to Pakistan or India, while others resettled in North America and Europe. The current population is around 3,000. The majority live in Kabul. During the Taliban regime, Sikhs and Hindus were forced to wear yellow arm bands for identification as well as hang yellow flags over their homes. Some discrimination still persists as they are often barred from government jobs, viewed as immigrants or threatened for ransom because they are considered rich. Culture Most of the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus adopted Afghan customs and assimilated into the local culture, speaking Pashto or Dari. However, Punjabi is still spoken by some at home. There have been efforts to teach Punjabi to the younger generation, as it is also the language of Sikh religious texts. The Afghan government opened two Punjabi schools in Kabul and Jalalabad, facilitating the Sikh community.

Ming improved new technologies in many industries one of the main two were the rebuilding of the great wall of China and the engineering of the grand canal, which created economic development. Overall agriculture production rose than ever before due to technological discoveries. The technological inventions reached the military by making new and more powerful weapons. In the agriculture sector, farmers started using new ways to increase output. By using water-powered crop rotation methods and plowing, increasing the efficiency of farming. Especially that the population was increasing, and the soil quality was declining. Allowing farmers to cultivate large lands to cultivate cash crops. The manufacturing industry became more advanced and was involved in producing different products, compared to the Song Dynasty. Iron was produced at a rate which no previous dynasty was able to achieve. The Ming used the Han policies and privatized many industries, like tea and salt. Chinese industry was propelled by powerful and wealthy merchants. Ming helped with income equality by canceling any forced labor and increasing wages of labor class in manufacturing industries in all factories. There were over 300 factories run by wage labor forces. Increasing production in these factories. Commerce and Trade, the rebuilding of the great wall of China and the canal river allowed the trade to increase. Building new bridges, wider roads for better transportation routes.

Vermont Route 244 passes through the camp property, separating its upland areas from its waterfront. Its major facilities are located in the waterfront area, while residences (including large tents and cabins) are across the road, scattered on the hillside to the northwest. In addition to water-based sports, outdoor activities include tennis and horse riding, while indoor craft and other activities are conducted in buildings sprinkled around the campus. Many of the buildings are architecturally distinctive blends of Adirondack Rustic and Hawaiian bungalow style. with History The original Aloha Camp, located on nearby Lake Morey, was founded in 1905 by Harriet and Edward Gulick, both of whom grew up in missionary families with a history of service. The camp was named \\"Aloha\\" from the Hawaiian word meaning \\"welcome\\" (among other definitions). Edward Gulick was born and raised in Honolulu, and it is from this upbringing that the camp acquired its Hawaiian touches, which extend to the names of some of the buildings. The first camp was a great success, and the Gulicks acquired this property and opened the camp in 1915. It is the only one (out of four camps now operated by the Aloha Foundation) that is not based on a preexisting farmstead.

Cady founded the music department at the University of Michigan, now the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance. He became known for his pedagogical theories while working with John Dewey at the University Elementary School, today's University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and later at The Cornish School, now Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle.

Academic career  Oberlin and Michigan  Returning to the United States, Cady taught harmony and piano at the Oberlin College Conservatory from 1874 to 1879. He was appointed Instructor in Music at the University of Michigan in 1880, and was promoted to Acting Professor of Music in 1885. Cady is credited with founding the Department of Music at Michigan and championing music as an integral part of the university curriculum. He was, in fact, the first in the United States to teach music as a major subject for the degrees of bachelor of arts and master of arts. His later association with John Dewey in the formation of the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago suggests a relationship with the philosopher when the latter joined the faculty at Michigan in 1886. Cady resigned his academic post in 1888 when Albert A. Stanley of Leipzig was appointed head of the department, which a few years later was split off from the university proper as the University School of Music.Shaw, Wilfred. The University of Michigan.

At The Cornish School  Cady taught a normal (teacher education) class in Los Angeles in 1911 that was attended by piano instructor Nellie Cornish. She writes that she was deeply impressed by his opening lecture, which argued that the education of music students should include the ‚Äúallied arts.‚ÄùCornish, Nellie C.

There has been a long history of violent conflict between the indigenous Waimiri-Atroari people and newcomers from other parts of Brazil. Since the 1960s there have been many efforts to \\"civilise\\" the Waimiri-Atroari to avoid problems with the BR-174 highway, which cuts across the territory, and with tin mines and the huge Balbina Dam. The territory is now considerably smaller, but there have been improvements in living standards. Location The territory has an area of , divided between the states of Amazonas and Roraima. It lies to the northwest of the massive reservoir of the Balbina Dam and to the east of the Rio Negro. The reserve contains the basins of the Jauaperi and Camana√∫ rivers and their tributaries, the Alala√∫, Curia√∫, Pardo and Santo Antonio do Abonari rivers. The BR-174 federal highway from Manaus to Boa Vista runs through the reserve from south to north. Background The first recorded European contact with the Waimiri- Atroari was when the botanist Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues travelled through various villages in the region in 1884. He was followed by woodsmen looking for animal pelts, Brazil nuts, rosewood, rubber and other natural resources. The intruders were attacked by Indians armed with bows and arrows. In response, the government mounted military expeditions in which many Indians were killed. A rough estimate of the population at the start of the 20th century is 2000‚Äì6000. Al√≠pio Bandeira of the Indian Protection Service (SPI) travelled in the Jauaperi River region in 1911 and established the first Indian attraction station on the river in 1912, where he made the first friendly contacts with people then called the Uaimirys. However, gatherers of natural products continued to invade the territory and the cycle of attacks on the gatherers and government reprisals continued. Entire villages were destroyed. The SPI was replaced by the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (National Indian Foundation ‚Äì Funai) in 1967. Gilberto Pinto Figueiredo of Funai began friendly contacts with the indigenous people to prepare them for construction of the BR-174 highway across their land, then was replaced by Italian priest Giovanni Calleri in an effort to speed up the process. Calleri led an expedition of ten people into the territory. All but one member were killed, and Figueiredo was reappointed. Funai established the Waimiri-Atroari Attraction Front (FAWA) in 1970 with the goal of speeding up integration of the Indians into Brazilian society. The Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Reservation was delimited by decree 68.907 of 13 July 1971. Development projects BR-174 BR-174 in the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory The Roirama and Amazonas state governments decided to build a highway between Manaus and Caracara√≠ in the late 1960s, and asked the SPI to speed up pacification of the Indians whose territory the highway would cross. The highway project was taken over by the federal government and expanded to become highway BR-174 from Manaus to Boa Vista. The task was assigned to an army construction battalion. The section of the BR-174 running through the territory was built between 1972 and 1979. The army ignored Funai's guidelines for dealing with the Waimiri-Atroari and tensions with the Indians mounted. In 2014 the Brazilian Truth Commission published Funai estimates that the Waimiri-Atroari population fell from about 3,000 in 1972 to 1,000 in 1974. It appears to have been the goal of the military regime to eliminate the Waimiri-Atroari and other indigenous peoples. Pitinga mine In the 1970s the Amazon Radar Project detected deposits of cassiterite (tin ore) on the reservation. Prospectors of Minera√ß√£o Taboca, a subsidiary of the Paranapanema heavy civil construction company, found traces of cassiterite in 1979 in tributaries of the Pitinga River. Paranapanema, assisted by Funai and the National Department of Mineral Production, managed to have the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Reservation downgraded in 1981 to the Temporary Restricted Area for the Attraction and Pacification of the Waimiri Atroari Indians, with a reduced area that excluded the cassiterite deposits. Presidential decree 86.630 of 23 November 1981 removed from the reserve for the tin mining operations. The Pitinga mine began operations in 1982. Paranapanema extracted tin from alluvial deposits. The property was later acquired by the Peruvian company Minsur, which in 2014 had plans to develop the lower deposits, thought to be the largest undeveloped tin mine in the world. Balbina Dam Balbina Dam in December 2008 Work on the Balbina Dam began in 1979. Presidential decree 85.898 of 13 April 1981 declared about to be land of public utility, including part of the Indian Reserve. About of land formerly occupied by the Waimiri-Atroari was flooded. The project destroyed a huge area of forest, since the Uatum√£ River flows through a very flat area. The amount of power generated was disappointing since the river does not deliver high volumes of water. According to the National Institute for Amazonian Research, the huge, stagnant reservoir is a \\"methane factory‚Äù. The dam releases more greenhouse gas than any coal-fueled power plant with comparable power output. Downstream from the dam the acidic and polluted water from decomposing vegetation destroyed fish. Tucuru√≠ transmission line The route chosen in 2014 for the Tucuru√≠ transmission line, bringing electrical power from Manaus to Boa Vista, follows the BR-174 federal highway. of the line would cross the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory. In February 2016 a federal judge issued an injunction that prohibited work on the line until the Waimiri-Atroari indigenous people had been consulted. He said IBAMA had ignored the requests of the indigenous people and forced through the project without consultation, as required by the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. No public hearings had been held in the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory. A leader of the indigenous people said could Funai not speak on their behalf concerning the project. Construction would involve hundreds of workers entering the territory. In March 2016 a federal judge dismissed the case, saying there had been undue judicial interference in the licensing process for the project that was of a national strategic nature and that would be undertaken entirely on federal land along the BR-174. Social and administrative changes (1970‚Äìpresent)  The Waimiri-Atroari attacked the Indian Posts in 1973‚Äì74 in an attempt to drive out the intruders, who had brought sickness that killed many of the people. Figueiredo and the entire staff of the attraction station was killed by the Indians in 1974. After this the people withdrew from the posts, but later some young men whose parents had died in the epidemics returned to the posts. In 1978‚Äì82 the inhabitants were moved into three large settlements near to Indian Posts by Funai workers and young \\"captains\\" of the Waimiri-Atroari. Later some of them were moved again to new settlements established by FAWA. Starting in 1984 some of the Waimiri- Atroari moved to locations further from the Indian Posts. The Attraction Front responded by setting up new Indian Posts in these places. The population had dropped to 374 people by 1988 due to the effect of foreign diseases and the frontier war. The Northern Corridor Project (Projeto Calha Norte) was defined in 1985 by the National Security Council with the stated aim of occupying the northern frontier of Brazil with military outposts to defend against socialist regimes to the north, Colombian guerrillas and drug traffic. The project, which became active in the late 1980s, also aimed to improve highways, add hydroelectric capacity, build centres of economic development and improve social services. The Waimiri-Atroari territory is mostly in the \\"Interior Nucleus\\" part of the project zone. The Waimiri Atroari Program to mitigate the impact of the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam was proposed in 1987, covering health, education, environmental protection, agriculture and security and historical memory. Eletronorte agreed to fund the program, which was administered by Funai, and in 1989 the Waimiri Atroari Indigenous Territory was officially established. Paranapanema and Eletronorte had much greater influence than Funai, which was expected to conform to the Calha Norte requirements. This included increasing control over the Indians and preventing ethnologist and missionaries from entering the territory. The Funai workers organised the Indians into agricultural projects. In 1996 the Indians were given R$1.7 million in compensation for the environmental damage caused by paving BR-174. BR-174 was totally paved in 1997. As of 2016 the Indians continue to block the highway from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. each day to reduce the risk of vehicles hitting wild animals and Indians, who hunt by night. They are being sued over the blockade by the Roraima government. The most recent estimate of the population (2014) is 1,749. The people in the territory now have access to education, medical and dental services, and have a fast-growing population.

The IEM emphasizes a strong collaborative and interdisciplinary tradition, spanning history, archaeology, medieval languages] (including Arabi), art history, manuscript studies and musicology. The centre's research and teaching activities focus primarily on the society, culture, and institutions of the westernmost region of the Iberian Peninsula between 700 and 1500, and its framing in the wider backdrop of Europe.  Governance  The IEM's internal structure resembles that of most academic research institutions in Portugal. It is modeled on guidelines set by the Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT). The centre is overseen by a steering committee that is chaired by Maria Jo√£o Branco, and advised by a general assembly and an external audit commission. It is divided into two broad research clusters that together reflect the centre's current research rationale: * Images, texts and representations * Territories and powers: A global perspective. The IEM's core membership includes more than forty integrated researchers in addition to dozens of associated researchers, whose primary affiliations are NOVA and similar academic institutions. Activities Activities revolve around advanced research in medieval studies in the form of individual and collaborative projects. Annually since 2001 the IEM has published the peer-reviewed e-journal Medievalista Online, as well as a book series on medieval topics in Portuguese, French and English. IEM has often been a partner to public institutions in Portugal for activities such as the curation of exhibitions.

It opened on 21 November 1936 and closed on the outbreak of the Second World War. The line through the station remained in use for excursions until 1962 and for freight until 1964; it was lifted in 1965. The LMSR closed the Llanberis branch to regular passenger services in 1930, though frequent Summer excursions continued to run. In 1934 the company reinstated a regular Saturdays only train specifically to serve Caernarfon market. In may parts of Britain \\"Market Trains\\" were an established part of local commerce and social life in a way which has passed into history. Llanberis station was not in the centre of Llanberis, so the company built the halt half a mile from the terminus specifically for this market traffic. The halt opened on 21 November 1936, from which time the market trains used the halt instead of Llanberis station. The halt consisted of an unlit single wooden platform on trestles, with a very small wooden waiting shelter at its southern end. It was accessed by a gravel footpath which continued over the tracks to the lakeside by a foot crossing.

It was built in the 17th century, and it has a Renaissance design attributed to the architects Vittorio Cassar and Tommaso Dingli. The church fell out of use when St Helen's Basilica replaced it as Birkirkara's parish church in the 18th century. Its roof and dome collapsed in the 19th century, and the church remained in ruins until it was restored in the second half of the 20th century. It became a parish church once again in 2005. History The Parish Church of St. Mary is located outside the historic centre of Birkirkara, and it was built on a hill so as to be protected from corsair attacks. In the medieval period, a church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and St. Helen existed on the site of the present church. A cemetery and two small chapels were found in the vicinity. Some of the graffiti, dating to the Hospitallers period, on the side fa√ßadeJournal of Mediterranean Studies Construction of the present church began in the early 17th century, probably in 1615 or 1616. Work on the church continued throughout the century, and the interior was almost completed by 1646. The dome was finished in around 1656, while the belfry was built in around 1679. Bullet marks, dating to the French occupation of Malta, on the side of the church The church in 1846, ten years before the collapse of the dome The church fell out of use in the late 18th century, after the St Helen's Basilica was blessed in 1782. Bishop Vincenzo Labini visited the church in 1787, and he found it in a state of disrepair, with the roof in danger of collapsing. The doors and windows of the church were barred, and it was only used for funerals. Part of the roof collapsed by 1830, and the dome and the rest of the roof were destroyed in an earthquake on 24 June 1856. The belfry was in danger of collapsing by 1894. On 3 December 1910, the first committee for the restoration of the church was established. Restoration actually began on 7 October 1969, and the roof of the nave was rebuilt by 1972. Works continued throughout the following decades until the 1990s, although restoration is still not complete. The church became a parish once again in 2005. It is now the third parish of Birkirkara, along with those of St. Helen and St. Joseph the worker There are currently some structural problems with the church, and there are several cracks within its walls. Despite this, the risk of collapse is considered remote. The church is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture View of the Parish Church of St. Mary The Parish Church of St. Mary is an example of Renaissance architecture. The church is commonly attributed to the architects Vittorio Cassar and Tommaso Dingli. There is no documentary evidence of Cassar's involvement and this attribution is disputed since he was probably dead when work on the church began, but Dingli's involvement is well-established. The church's fa√ßade has Corinthian pilasters, and the cental bay has an arched main doorway flanked by columns on either side. The door is topped by five escutcheons containing coats of arms, including those of King Philip II of Spain, Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt, Bishop Baldassare Cagliares and the parish priest Don Filippo Borg. The stonework around the doorway and the coats of arms is very ornate, and it is probably influenced by the Spanish Plateresque style. Each of the two side bays contains three empty niches. The church's interior is ornate, with sculpture forming an integral part of the building. Further reading *Clarification in video.

Historically, it was known as 1A Complete. People in this class have no sitting balance, and are tetraplegics. They may be able to perform limited actions with one hand. They lack sitting balance, and have limited head control and respiratory endurance. The process for classification into this class has a medical and functional classification process. This process is often sport specific.  Definition  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F1 class. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level C6. In the past, this class was known as 1A Complete. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\"These athletes have no hand function, are unable to use the muscles that straighten their elbows, and their hands remain in contact or close to the pushing rim with the power coming from their elbow flexion. Neurological level: C6\\" Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have no grip with non-throwing arm. (Use 'resin' or adhesive-like substance for grip.)\\" Sports recommended for people in this class include swimming, billiards, shooting and bowls.  Neurological  Disabled Sports USA defined the neurological definition of this class in 2003 as C6. The classification neurologically can include tetraplegics with spinal lesions level C5/C6. The location of lesions on different vertebrae tend to be associated with disability levels and functionality issues. C5 is associated with elbow flexors. C6 is associated with wrist flexors.  Anatomical  Disabled Sports USA defined the anatomical definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have functional elbow flexors and wrist dorsi-flexors. May have elbow extensors (up to power 3) but usually do not have wrist palmar flexors. May have shoulder weakness. Have no sitting balance.\\" People with C4 lesions have head control, and limited respiratory endurance. People with C5 lesions have abduction of the arms, and flexion of the arm. People with C6 lesions have abduction and flexion of the arms, and wrist extension.  Functional  leftThe location of lesions on different vertebrae tend to be associated with disability levels and functionality issues. People with C4 lesions can control electronic devices using a mouth controlled joystick. People with a lesion at C5 or C6 have an impairment that effects the use of their hands and lower arm. People with C5 can perform some actions with one of their arms, and can propel a wheelchair with modified rims that make it easier to do. People with C6 can have a weak grasp with their wrist. They can roll over in bed. They have some independence in that they can eat and groom themselves without assistance. They may also be able to transfer themselves to a wheelchair. In terms of motor functions, people in this class who are C4-C6 tetraplegics may have issues with their biceps, deltoids, rhomboids and rotor cuffs. They may have an absence of sensation in their hands, wrists and forearms. People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 81% compared to people without a disability. The functional characteristics for this class at the 1990 Stoke Mandeville Games had this class scoring a 0 - 3 for triceps on the MRC scale, with severe weakness of the trunk and lower limbs. People with spinal injuries at T6 or higher are more likely to develop Autonomic dysreflexia (AD). It also sometimes rarely effects people with injuries at T7 and T8. The condition causes over-activity of the autonomic nervous system, and can suddenly onset when people are playing sports. Some of the symptoms include nausea, high blood pressure, a pounding headache, flushed face, profuse sweating, a lower heart rate or a nasal congestion. If left untreated, it can cause a stroke. Players in some sports like wheelchair rugby are encouraged to be particularly on guard for AD symptoms.  Governance  In general, classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. From the 1950s to the early 2000s, wheelchair sport classification was handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Some sports have classification managed by other organizations. In the case of athletics, classification is handled by IPC Athletics. Wheelchair rugby classification has been managed by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation since 2010. Lawn bowls is handled by International Bowls for the Disabled. Wheelchair fencing is governed by IWAS Wheelchair Fencing (IWF). The International Paralympic Committee manages classification for a number of spinal cord injury and wheelchair sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Some sports specifically for people with disabilities, like race running, have two governing bodies that work together to allow different types of disabilities to participate. Race running is governed by both the CPISRA and IWAS, with IWAS handling sportspeople with spinal cord related disabilities. Classification is also handled at the national level or at the national sport specific level. In the United States, this has been handled by Wheelchair Sports, USA (WSUSA) who managed wheelchair track, field, slalom, and long distance events. For wheelchair basketball in Canada, classification is handled by Wheelchair Basketball Canada.  History  Early on in this classes history, the class had a different name and was based on medical classification and originally intended for athletics. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. During the late 1960s, people oftentimes tried to cheat classification to get in classified more favorably. The group most likely to try to cheat at classification were wheelchair basketball players with complete spinal cord injuries located at the high thoracic transection of the spine. Starting in the 1980s and going into the 1990s, this class began to be more defined around functional classification instead of a medical one.  Sports   Athletics  Visualization of where on the spinal cord an injury exists to be classified as T51. Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in F51. Field events open to this class have included club and discus, but not the javelin. The shot put used by this class weighs less than the traditional one at . The club used by this class weighs . Athletes in this class who good trunk control and mobility have an advantage over athletes in the same class who have less functional trunk control and mobility. This functional difference can cause different performance results within the same class, with discus throwers with more control in a class able to throw the discus further. In the United States, people in this class are allowed to use strapping on the non-throwing hand as a way to anchor themselves to the chair. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw.

It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3) and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the club throw.  Cycling  Functional mobility range of an H1 classified cyclist Competitors from this class compete in H1 provided they are tetraplegia C6 or above and severe athetosis/ataxia/dystonia, tetraplegic with impairments corresponding to a complete cervical lesion at C6 or above or have a similar dysfunction. People in this class can use an AP2 recumbent, which is a competition cycle that is reclined at 30 degrees and has a rigid frame. This classification can also use an AP3 hand cycle which is inclined at 0 degrees and is reclined on a rigid competition frame. Tetraplegics have reduced respiration rates of 55‚Äì59% less compared to paraplegics when they are engaged in rigorous handcycling. In track events, SP2 women in H2 have faster laptimes than SP1 men in H1. Factoring is used in cycling to allow multiple classes and genders to compete against each other. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H2 men are 77.22% and H2 women are 67.73%. When H3 men are set at 100%, H2 men are 70.40% and H2 women are 69.64%. When H4 and H5 women are set at 100%, H2 men are 88.04% and H2 women are 77.22%. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H1 men are 56.64% and H1 men are 49.68%. When H3 men are set at 100%, H1 men are 58.24% and H1 women are 51.08%. When H4 and H5 women are set at 100%, H1 men are 64.58% and H1 women are 56.64%.  Swimming  Swimmers in this class compete in a number of IPC swimming classes. These include S1 and S2. People with spinal cord injuries in S1 tend to be tetraplegics with complete lesions below C5. These S1 swimmers have no hand or wrist flexion so are unable to catch water. Because of a lack of trunk control, they are unstable in the water and have hip drag. As they have no leg and back control, their legs are normally drag in the water in a flexed position. They normally swim the backstroke using a double arm technique. They start in the water with assistance for initial propulsion. People with spinal cord injuries in S2 tend to be tetraplegics with complete lesions below C6, or tetraplegics with complete lesions below C7 who have additional paralysis in their plexus or in one arm. These S2 swimmers have no hand or wrist flexion so are unable to catch water. Because of a lack of trunk control, they are unstable in the water and have hip drag. As they have no leg mobility, their legs drag. They normally swim the backstroke as they lack head control to breathe effectively for the freestyle. They start in the water, sometimes with assistance for initial propulsion. For swimming with the most severe disabilities at the 1984 Summer Paralympics, floating devices and a swimming coach in the water swimming next to the Paralympic competitor were allowed. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A (SP1, SP2), and 1B (SP3) in the 25m breaststroke.  Wheelchair fencing  Generally, people in this class who were covered by the old 1A wheelchair sport class compete in the wheelchair 1A class. People in this class have no sitting balance and have an impairment in the arm they use to fence with. Their weapon is fixed to their hand during competition with strapping. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 1A and 1B are combined, competing as Category C.  Other sports  A sport open to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW1. This class is for people who have all four of their limbs impacted. Another sport F1 sportspeople are eligible to participate in electric wheelchair hockey. The sport has one class and is open to anyone with a spinal injury above T1. Rowing is another option. Rowers in this class may be able to grasp the oar with their hand but have little control of their hands. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as Q1, for people with lesions at C4-C6.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople.Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation that may be required my include x-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

He was re-elected six times, serving until his death shortly before the special session in 1963. In 1956 Harry C. Stuart assisted the Massive Resistance policy of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd over integration of Virginia's public schools by introducing an interposition resolution, asserting Virginia's sovereignty against encroachment by the federal government. That reacted against the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education (and companion cases including one from Prince Edward County, Virginia) in 1954 and 1955. Though Virginia' official response to Brown was a commission under State Senator Garland Gray to study options, Gray, Harry C. Stuart and U.S. Senator Byrd (and others) became radicalized. When the legislature finally met in August 1956, it debated a radicalized segregationist version of the Gray Commission plan, which became known as the Stanley Plan. That in part proposed to fund segregation academies through tuition grants, and was sponsored by Harry C. Stuart in the Virginia Senate as well as delegate H. Stuart Carter of Washington County and Bristol in the House of Delegates, although opposed by his cousin state senator Stuart B. Carter.Robbins L.

Definition  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F2 class. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level C7. In the past, this class was known as 1B Complete, 1A Incomplete. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\" These athletes have limited or no hand function. Power for pushing now comes from elbow extension, wrist extension and active chest muscles. Their head may be forced backwards (by the use of neck muscles), producing slight upper trunk movements even though they do not have use of their trunk muscles. Neurological level: C7-C8.\\" Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have difficulty gripping with non-throwing arm. [...] These athletes may have slight function between the digits of the hand.\\" Recommended sports for people at C7 include archery and table tennis.  Neurological  Disabled Sports USA defined the neurological definition of this class in 2003 as C7. People in this class are often tetraplegics level C7/C8 or higher incomplete lesion.  Anatomical  left The location of lesions on different vertebrae tend to be associated with disability levels and functionality issues. C7 is associated with elbow flexors. C8 is associated with finger flexors. Disabled Sports USA defined the anatomical definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"\\"Have functional elbow flexors and extensors, wrist dorsi-flexors and palmar flexors. Have good shoulder muscle function. May have some finger flexion and extension but not functional.\\" People with lesions at C7 have stabilization and extension of the elbow and some extension of the wrist.  Functional  People with a lesion at C7 have an impairment that effects the use of their hands and lower arm. They can use a wheelchair using their own power, and do everyday tasks like eating, dressing, and normal physical maintenance. People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 79% compared to people without a disability. People with spinal injuries at T6 or higher are more likely to develop Autonomic dysreflexia (AD). It also sometimes rarely effects people with injuries at T7 and T8. The condition causes over-activity of the autonomic nervous system, and can suddenly onset when people are playing sports. Some of the symptoms include nausea, high blood pressure, a pounding headache, flushed face, profuse sweating, a lower heart rate or a nasal congestion. If left untreated, it can cause a stroke. Players in some sports like wheelchair rugby are encouraged to be particularly on guard for AD symptoms.  Governance  In general, classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. From the 1950s to the early 2000s, wheelchair sport classification was handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Some sports have classification managed by other organizations. In the case of athletics, classification is handled by IPC Athletics. Wheelchair rugby classification has been managed by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation since 2010. Lawn bowls is handled by International Bowls for the Disabled. Wheelchair fencing is governed by IWAS Wheelchair Fencing (IWF). The International Paralympic Committee manages classification for a number of spinal cord injury and wheelchair sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Some sports specifically for people with disabilities, like race running, have two governing bodies that work together to allow different types of disabilities to participate. Race running is governed by both the CPISRA and IWAS, with IWAS handling sportspeople with spinal cord related disabilities. Classification is also handled at the national level or at the national sport specific level. In the United States, this has been handled by Wheelchair Sports, USA (WSUSA) who managed wheelchair track, field, slalom, and long distance events. For wheelchair basketball in Canada, classification is handled by Wheelchair Basketball Canada.  History  Early on in this classes history, the class had a different name and was based on medical classification and originally intended for athletics. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. During the late 1960s, people oftentimes tried to cheat classification to get in classified more favorably. The group most likely to try to cheat at classification were wheelchair basketball players with complete spinal cord injuries located at the high thoracic transection of the spine. Starting in the 1980s and going into the 1990s, this class began to be more defined around functional classification instead of a medical one.  Sports   Athletics  Visualization of where on the spinal cord an injury exists to be classified as T52. Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in F52. The class differs from T53 because T53 sportspeople have better trunk function and better function in their throwing arm. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon events in the United States, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 100m, Discus, 800m. They throw from a seated position, and use a javelin that weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . In the United States, people in this class are allowed to use strapping on the non-throwing hand as a way to anchor themselves to the chair. Athletes in this class who good trunk control and mobility have an advantage over athletes in the same class who have less functional trunk control and mobility. This functional difference can cause different performance results within the same class, with discus throwers with more control in a class able to throw the discus further. leftA 1999 study found for people in the F2, F3 and F4 classes in the discus, elbow flexion and shoulder horizontal abduction are equally important variables in the speed at which they release the discus. For F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers, the discus tends to be below shoulder height and the forearm level is generally above elbow height at the moment of release of the discus. F2 and F4 discus throwers have limited shoulder girdle range of motion. F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers have good sitting balance while throwing. F5, F6 and F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2, F3 and F4. F2 and F4 discus throwers have greater average angular forearm speed than F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F2 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle less than that of other classes. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A (SP1, SP2) and 1B (SP3) in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the club throw. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the discus. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between men in 1A and 1B in the javelin.

It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A, 1B and 1C in the discus. It found there was little significant difference in performance in distance between women in 1A, 1B and 1C in the club throw.  Cycling  Functional mobility range of an H2 classified cyclist F2 sportspeople can participate in cycling. Competitors from this class compete in H2 provided they are a tetraplegic C7/C8 with severe athetosis/ataxia/dystonia, or a tetraplegic with impairments corresponding to a complete cervical lesion at C7/C8 or above. This classification can use an AP2 recumbent, which is a competition cycle that is reclined at 30 degrees and has a rigid frame. This classification can also use an AP3 hand cycle which is inclined at 0 degrees and is reclined on a rigid competition frame. Factoring is used in cycling to allow multiple classes and genders to compete against each other. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H3 men are 97.25% and H3 women are 85.30%. When H3 men are set at 100%, H3 women are 87.71%. When H4 and H5 women are set at 100%, H3 women are 97.25%. In track events, SP2 women in H2 have faster lap times than SP1 men in H1. SP3 men in H3 are significantly faster than SP2 women in H2.  Swimming  Swimmers in this class compete in a number of IPC swimming classes. These include S1, S2, S3, SB3 and S4. Swimming classification is done based on a total points system, with a variety of functional and medical tests being used as part of a formula to assign a class. Part of this test involves the Adapted Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. For upper trunk extension, C8 complete are given 0 points. With classified S1, these swimmers have no hand or wrist flexion so are unable to catch water. Because of a lack of trunk control, they are unstable in the water and have hip drag. As they have no leg and back control, their legs are normally drag in the water in a flexed position. They normally swim the backstroke using a double arm technique. They start in the water with assistance for initial propulsion. People with spinal cord injuries in S2 tend to be tetraplegics with complete lesions below C6, or tetraplegics with complete lesions below C7 who have additional paralysis in their plexus or in one arm. These S2 swimmers have no hand or wrist flexion so are unable to catch water. Because of a lack of trunk control, they are unstable in the water and have hip drag. As they have no leg mobility, their legs drag. They normally swim the backstroke as they lack head control to breathe effectively for the freestyle. They start in the water, sometimes with assistance for initial propulsion. S3 swimmers tend to have 91 to 115 points, and, for people spinal cord injuries, are tetraplegics with complete lesions below C7 or an incomplete tetraplegic below C6. These S3 swimmers have leg drag when swimming as a result of their hips staying below the surface of the water during a race. Their hand usage is such that they cannot use them effectively to catch water. Because of their disability, they normally start in the water. They make turns by pushing off with their arms. People in SB3 tend to be incomplete tetraplegics below C7, complete paraplegics around T1 - T5, or complete paraplegics at T1 - T8 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6. These rods impact their lumbar function and their balance. S4 swimmers tend to be tetraplegics with complete lesions below C8 but have good finger extension, or they are incomplete tetraplegics below C7. These S4 swimmers are able to use their hands and wrists to gain propulsion in the water but have some limits because of lack of full finger control. Because they have no to minimal trunk control, they have leg drag. Their starts are most frequently in the water, and they make turns and start by pushing off the wall using their hands. For swimming with the most severe disabilities at the 1984 Summer Paralympics, floating devices and a swimming coach in the water swimming next to the Paralympic competitor were allowed. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m freestyle.

It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A (SP1, SP2), and 1B (SP3) in the 25m breaststroke.  Other sports  One of the sports open to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW1. This class is for people who have all four of their limbs impacted. Rowing is another option. Rowers in this class may be able to grasp the oar with their hand but have little control of their hands. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as Q2, for people with lesions at C7-T1. Ten-pin bowling is another sport open to people in this class, where they compete in TPB8. People in this class do not have more than 70 points for functionality, have normal arm pitch for throwing and use a wheelchair. This class is eligible to participate in electric wheelchair hockey. The sport has one class and is open to anyone with a spinal injury above T1. Another sport open to this class is wheelchair fencing. Generally, people in this class are classified as 1B. They lack flexion in their fingers, and the weapon has to be strapped to their hand. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 1A and 1B are combined, competing as Category C.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. A sample medical classification form. Sportspeople would need some form of this sent to a classification panel. Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation that may be required my include x-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

Cycling  Cycling classification for spinal cord injuries for H1, H2, H3 and H4 F3 sportspeople can participate in cycling. Competitors from this class compete in H3. This class is divided into two subclasses, both of which SP3 cyclists can be classified into. H3.1 cyclists from this are paraplegics with impairments corresponding to a complete lesion from T1 to T3. H3.2 cyclists are paraplegics with impairments corresponding to a complete lesion from T4 to T10. Factoring is used in cycling to allow multiple classes and genders to compete against each other. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H4 women are 87.71%. When H3 men are set at 100%, H4 women are 90.19%. In track events, SP3 men in H3 are significantly faster than SP2 women in H2. SP3 women are about 4 seconds faster than SP4 women per lap. SP3 and SP4 men are within 1 second of each other time wise per lap.  Rowing  Rowing is one of the sporting options open to people in this class. Currently, people with a spinal cord injury at T12 level compete in AS. This class is for people who use their arms and shoulders to row. Rowers in this class may be able to grasp the oar with their hand but have little control of their hands. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as Q2, for people with lesions at C7-T1.  Swimming  Swimmers in this class compete in a number of IPC swimming classes. These include S3, SB3, S4 and S5. Swimming classification is done based on a total points system, with a variety of functional and medical tests being used as part of a formula to assign a class. Part of this test involves the Adapted Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. For upper trunk extension, C8 complete are given 0 points. People in SB3 tend to be incomplete tetraplegics below C7, complete paraplegics around T1 - T5, or complete paraplegics at T1 - T8 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6. These rods impact their lumbar function and their balance. S4 swimmers tend to be tetraplegics with complete lesions below C8 but have good finger extension, or they are incomplete tetraplegics below C7. These S4 swimmers are able to use their hands and wrists to gain propulsion in the water but have some limits because of lack of full finger control. Because they have no to minimal trunk control, they have leg drag. Their starts are most frequently in the water, and they make turns and start by pushing off the wall using their hands. S5 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below T1 to T8, or incomplete tetraplegics below C8 who have decent trunk control. These swimmers have full use of their arms and are able to use their arms, hands and fingers to gain propulsion in the catch phase of swimming. Because they have minimal trunk control, their hips tend to be a bit lower in the water and they have leg drag. They either start in the water or start from a sitting dive position. They use their hands to make turns. For swimming with the most severe disabilities at the 1984 Summer Paralympics, floating devices and a swimming coach in the water swimming next to the Paralympic competitor were allowed. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A, 1B, and 1C in the 25m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A, 1B, and 1C in the 25m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A, 1B, and 1C in the 25m backstroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A, 1B, and 1C in the 25m freestyle. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 1A, and 1B in the 25m breaststroke.  Wheelchair basketball  The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games. The original wheelchair basketball classification system in 1966 had 5 classes: A, B, C, D, S. Each class was worth so many points. A was worth 1, B and C were worth 2. D and S were worth 3 points. A team could have a maximum of 12 points on the floor. This system was the one in place for the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Class A was for T1-T9 complete. Class B was for T1-T9 incomplete. Class C was for T10-L2 complete. Class D was for T10-L2 incomplete. Class S was for Cauda equina paralysis. This class would have been part of Class A or Class B. From 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor. The system was designed to keep out people with less severe spinal cord injuries, and had no medical basis in many cases. This class would have been IB or IC. The wheelchair basketball classification system used during the 1980s was mostly functional, but had medical lesion based elements as a guideline. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the floor at any time. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. This class would have been Class 1 at 1 or 1.5 points. They would probably be 1 point players under the current classification system.  Wheelchair fencing  Wheelchair fencing is another sport open to people in this class. Generally, people in this class are classified as 1B. They lack flexion in their fingers, and the weapon has to be strapped to their hand. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 1A and 1B are combined, competing as Category C.  Other sports  One of the sports available to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW1 for people with loss of arm function. They can also be ARW2. This class is for people who have limited to good trunk function and normal functioning in their arms. It includes paraplegic archers, while ARW1 includes tetraplegic archers. People in this class participate can participate in sit skiing. In the United States, domestic competitions have used different classification than the one used internationally. Two groups are used instead of LW10 to LW12. Group 1 is for people from T5 to T10. Group 2 is for people with lesions above T5. Table tennis is another option. Players in this class compete typically compete in Grade 5, though it largely depends on the functioning of the rest of the lower body. This could result in them being put into Grade 3, Grade 4 or Grade 5. The cut off for Grade 5 typically depends on hip functionality. Ten-pin bowling is another sport open to people in this class, where they compete in TPB8. People in this class do not have more than 70 points for functionality, have normal arm pitch for throwing and use a wheelchair. This class is also eligible to participate in electric wheelchair hockey. The sport has one class and is open to anyone with a spinal injury above T1.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. A sample medical classification form. Sportspeople would need some form of this sent to a classification panel. Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation that may be required my include X-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

Historically, it was known as 1C Incomplete, 2 Complete, or Upper 3 Complete. People in this class have normal upper limb function, and functional issues with muscles below the nipple line. There are comparable F4 classes in a number of sports. For athletics, these are T54 and F54. In cycling, these are H4 or H5. Swimming classes include S3, SB3, S4 and S5.

Definition  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F4 class. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level T1- T7. In the past, this class was known as 1C Incomplete, 2 Complete, or Upper 3 Complete. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\"These athletes have normal upper limb function as well as backward movement of the trunk, often with rotation movements of the trunk. They may use the trunk movements to steer around curves, and usually do not have to interrupt the pushing stroke rate around curves. When stopping quickly, the trunk moves toward an upright position. They are able to use their abdominals for power, particularly when starting, but also when pushing.

T6 is associated with abdominal innervation beginning.  Anatomical  People with a lesion at T6 have an impairment that effects the muscles in their body below the nipple line.  Functional  F4 sportspeople may have good sitting balance and some impairment in their dominant hand. Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have no sitting balance. [...] Usually hold onto part of the chair while throwing. Complete Class 2 and upper Class 3 Athletes have normal upper limbs. They can hold the throwing implement normally. They have no functional trunk movements.Incomplete 1C Athletes who have trunk movements, with hand function like F3.\\" People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 85% compared to people without a disability. People with spinal injuries at T6 or higher are more likely to develop Autonomic dysreflexia (AD). It also sometimes rarely effects people with injuries at T7 and T8. The condition causes over-activity of the autonomic nervous system, and can suddenly onset when people are playing sports. Some of the symptoms include nausea, high blood pressure, a pounding headache, flushed face, profuse sweating, a lower heart rate or a nasal congestion. If left untreated, it can cause a stroke. Players in some sports like wheelchair rugby are encouraged to be particularly on guard for AD symptoms.  Governance  In general, classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. From the 1950s to the early 2000s, wheelchair sport classification was handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Some sports have classification managed by other organizations. In the case of athletics, classification is handled by IPC Athletics. Wheelchair rugby classification has been managed by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation since 2010. Lawn bowls is handled by International Bowls for the Disabled. Wheelchair fencing is governed by IWAS Wheelchair Fencing (IWF). The International Paralympic Committee manages classification for a number of spinal cord injury and wheelchair sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Some sports specifically for people with disabilities, like race running, have two governing bodies that work together to allow different types of disabilities to participate. Race running is governed by both the CPISRA and IWAS, with IWAS handling sportspeople with spinal cord related disabilities. Classification is also handled at the national level or at the national sport specific level. In the United States, this has been handled by Wheelchair Sports, USA (WSUSA) who managed wheelchair track, field, slalom, and long distance events. For wheelchair basketball in Canada, classification is handled by Wheelchair Basketball Canada.  History  Early on in this classes history, the class had a different name and was based on medical classification and originally intended for athletics. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. During the late 1960s, people oftentimes tried to cheat classification to get in classified more favorably. The group most likely to try to cheat at classification were wheelchair basketball players with complete spinal cord injuries located at the high thoracic transection of the spine. Starting in the 1980s and going into the 1990s, this class began to be more defined around functional classification instead of a medical one.  Sports   Athletics  Visualization of where on the spinal cord an injury exists to be classified as T54. left Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in T54 and F54. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. Athletes in this class who good trunk control and mobility have an advantage over athletes in the same class who have less functional trunk control and mobility. This functional difference can cause different performance results within the same class, with discus throwers with more control in a class able to throw the discus further. Wheelchair racers in this class frequently are much faster than their able-bodied counterparts. F4 athletes throw from a seated position, and use a javelin that weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . There are performance differences and similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F4 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F3 to F9 throwers. For people in the F2, F3 and F4 classes in the discus, elbow flexion and shoulder horizontal abduction are equally important variables in the speed at which they release the discus. For F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers, the discus tends to be below shoulder height and the forearm level is generally above elbow height at the moment of release of the discus. F2 and F4 discus throwers have limited shoulder girdle range of motion. F2 to F4 discus throwers have good sitting balance while throwing. F5, F6 and F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2, F3 and F4. F2 and F4 discus throwers have greater average angular forearm speed than F5 to F8 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999). Discus throwing performances and medical classification of wheelchair athletes.

Cycling  Cycling classification for spinal cord injuries for H1, H2, H3 and H4 Competitors from this class compete as H4 or H5. H4 is for paraplegics with impairments corresponding to a complete lesion from T11 or below. H5 is for paraplegics with impairments corresponding to a complete lesion from T11 or below. Both H4 and H5 classifications can use ATP3 knee-seat cycle that is forward leaning on a rigid frame. Factoring is used in cycling to allow multiple classes and genders to compete against each other. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H5 women are 87.71%. When H3 men are set at 100%, H5 women are 90.19%. In track events, SP3 women are about 4 seconds faster than SP4 women per lap. SP3 and SP4 men are within 1 second of each other time wise per lap.  Swimming  Swimmers in this class compete in a number of IPC swimming classes. These include S3, SB3, S4 and S5. Swimming classification is done based on a total points system, with a variety of functional and medical tests being used as part of a formula to assign a class. Part of this test involves the Adapted Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. For upper trunk extension, T1 - T5 complete are given 1 - 2 points while T6 - T10 are given 3 - 5 points. People in SB3 tend to be incomplete tetraplegics below C7, complete paraplegics around T1 - T5, or complete paraplegics at T1 - T8 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6. These rods impact their lumbar function and their balance. People in SB4 tend to be complete paraplegics below T6 to T10, complete paraplegics at T9 - L1 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6 which affects their balance, or incomplete tetraplegics below C8 with decent trunk function. S5 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below T1 to T8, or incomplete tetraplegics below C8 who have decent trunk control. These swimmers have full use of their arms and are able to use their arms, hands and fingers to gain propulsion in the catch phase of swimming. Because they have minimal trunk control, their hips tend to be a bit lower in the water and they have leg drag. They either start in the water or start from a sitting dive position. They use their hands to make turns. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A (SP1, SP2), 1B (SP3), and 1C (SP3, SP4) in the 25m breaststroke. It found there was little significant difference in performance times between women in 1A, and 1C in the 25m backstroke.

It found there was little significant difference in performance times between men in 2, 3 and 4 in the 25 m butterfly.  Wheelchair basketball  The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games. The original wheelchair basketball classification system in 1966 had 5 classes: A, B, C, D, S. Each class was worth so many points. A was worth 1, B and C were worth 2. D and S were worth 3 points. A team could have a maximum of 12 points on the floor. This system was the one in place for the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Class A was for T1-T9 complete. Class B was for T1-T9 incomplete. Class C was for T10-L2 complete. Class D was for T10-L2 incomplete. Class S was for Cauda equina paralysis. This class would have been part of Class A or Class B. From 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor. The system was designed to keep out people with less severe spinal cord injuries, and had no medical basis in many cases. This class would have been IC, II or III. The wheelchair basketball classification system used during the 1980s was mostly functional, but had medical lesion based elements as a guideline. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the floor at any time. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. This class would have been Class 1 at 1 or 1.5 points. Under the classification system currently in place, players from this class would likely be a 1 point player.  Wheelchair fencing  Wheelchair fencing is an option for F4 sportspeople. Generally, people in this class are classified as 2. People in this class generally are a paraplegic type D1 - D9, scoring less than 4 points on Type 1 and Type 2 function tests. They may have a minimal impairment in their dominant fencing hand, but otherwise have good sitting balance. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, this class is referred to as Category B. In some sports, such as wheelchair fencing, they may have good sitting balance and some impairment in their dominant hand.  Other sports  One of the sports open to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW2. This class is for people who have limited to good trunk function and normal functioning in their arms. It includes paraplegic archers, while ARW1 includes tetraplegic archers. People in this class participate can also participate in sit skiing. In the United States, domestic competitions have used different classification than the one used internationally. Two groups are used instead of LW10 to LW12. Group 1 is for people from T5 to T10. Group 2 is for people with lesions above T5. Rowing is another sporting option for F4 sportspeople. Currently, people with a spinal cord injury at T12 level compete in AS. This class is for people who use their arms and shoulders to row. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as Q2, for people with lesions at C7-T1 or P1 for people with lesions at T2-T9. Ten-pin bowling is another sport open to people in this class, where they compete in TPB8. People in this class do not have more than 70 points for functionality, have normal arm pitch for throwing and use a wheelchair.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. A sample medical classification form. Sportspeople would need some form of this sent to a classification panel. Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation required may include x-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. During functional and medical classification, a number of tests may be run for people in this class. For the trunk rotation test, people in this class are expected to have no abdominal function. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

A 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics.

Currently, people with a complete spinal cord injury at T12 level or incomplete at T10 compete in AS. This class is for people who use their arms and shoulders to row. They have decreased balance while rowing. They row largely using their arms and shoulders to gain propulsion in the water They are required to use a chest strap, a knee strap, pontoons on their boat and short oars to prevent overlap. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as P1 for people with lesions at T2-T9 or P2 for people with lesions at T10-L4.  Swimming  Swimmers in this class compete in a number of IPC swimming classes. These include SB3, S4, SB4, SB5, S5 and S6. Swimming classification is done based on a total points system, with a variety of functional and medical tests being used as part of a formula to assign a class. Part of this test involves the Adapted Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. For upper trunk extension, T6 - T10 are given 3 - 5 points. People in SB3 tend to be incomplete tetraplegics below C7, complete paraplegics around T1 - T5, or complete paraplegics at T1 - T8 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6. These rods impact their lumbar function and their balance. People in SB4 tend to be complete paraplegics below T6 to T10, complete paraplegics at T9 - L1 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6 which affects their balance, or incomplete tetraplegics below C8 with decent trunk function. S5 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below T1 to T8, or incomplete tetraplegics below C8 who have decent trunk control. These swimmers have full use of their arms and are able to use their arms, hands and fingers to gain propulsion in the catch phase of swimming. Because they have minimal trunk control, their hips tend to be a bit lower in the water and they have leg drag. They either start in the water or start from a sitting dive position. They use their hands to make turns. People in SB5 tend to be complete paraplegics below T11 to L1 who cannot use their legs for swimming, or complete paraplegics at L2 to L3 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6 which affects their balance. S6 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below T9 to L1 and where their leg function does not assist them in swimming. S6 swimmers of this type have effect arm cycling and can use their hands and fingers to gain propulsion during the catch phase. Their hips may ride slightly lower in the water, but their legs are not in a V position. They may start either in the water or from a sitting dive position. They turn using their hands.

Wheelchair basketball  The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games. The original wheelchair basketball classification system in 1966 had 5 classes: A, B, C, D, S. Each class was worth so many points. A was worth 1, B and C were worth 2. D and S were worth 3 points. A team could have a maximum of 12 points on the floor. This system was the one in place for the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Class A was for T1-T9 complete. Class B was for T1-T9 incomplete. Class C was for T10-L2 complete. Class D was for T10-L2 incomplete. Class S was for Cauda equina paralysis. This class would have been part of Class A, Class B, Class C or Class D. From 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor. The system was designed to keep out people with less severe spinal cord injuries, and had no medical basis in many cases. This class would have been III or IV. The wheelchair basketball classification system used during the 1980s was mostly functional, but had medical lesion based elements as a guideline. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the floor at any time. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the court at a time. People in this class would have been Class II as 2 or 2.5 point players. Under the current classification system, people in this class would likely be a 2 point player.  Wheelchair fencing  Generally, people in this class are classified as 2 or 3. Wheelchair fencers from this class who are classified as 2 generally are a paraplegic type D1 - D9, scoring less than 4 points on Type 1 and Type 2 function tests. They may have a minimal impairment in their dominant fencing hand, but otherwise have good sitting balance. Fencers classified as 3 are paraplegics from D10 to L2, scoring between 5 and 9 points on Type 1 and Type 2 function tests. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 3 and 4 are combined, competing as Category A. 2 is referred to as Category B.  Other sports  One of the sports open to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW2. This class is for people who have limited to good trunk function and normal functioning in their arms. It includes paraplegic archers, while ARW1 includes tetraplegic archers. Ten-pin bowling is another sport open to people in this class, where they compete in TPB8. People in this class do not have more than 70 points for functionality, have normal arm pitch for throwing and use a wheelchair. People in this class participate can participate in sit skiing. In the United States, domestic competitions have used different classification than the one used internationally. Two groups are used instead of LW10 to LW12. Group 1 is for people from T5 to T10. Group 2 is for people with lesions above T5.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. A sample medical classification form. Sportspeople would need some form of this sent to a classification panel. Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation that may be required my include x-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. During functional and medical classification, a number of tests may be run for people in this class. For the trunk rotation test, people in this class are expected to have abdominal function. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

Definition  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F6 class. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level L2 - L5. Historically, this class has been known as Lower 4, Upper 5. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\"These athletes also put the shot and throw the discus and javelin. They have very good balance and movements in the forward and backward plane, with good trunk rotation. They can lift their thighs off the chair and press the knees together. Some have the ability to straighten and bend their knees. Neurological level: L2-L5.\\" Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have very good balance and movements in the backwards and forwards plane. Have good trunk rotation. Can lift the thighs, i.e. off the chair (hip flexion). Can press the knees together (hip abduction). May have the ability to straighten the knees (knee extension). May have some ability to bend the knees (knee flexion).\\"  Neurological  The neurological definition of this class is L2 - L5. The location of lesions on different vertebrae tend to be associated with disability levels and functionality issues. L2 is associated with hip flexors. L3 is associated with knee extensors. L4 is associated with ankle doris flexors. L5 is associated with long toe extensors.  Anatomical  People with lesions at L4 have issues with their lower back muscles, hip flexors and their quadriceps. People with lesions at the L4 to S2 who are complete paraplegics may have motor function issues in their gluts and hamstrings. Their quadriceps are likely to be unaffected. They may be absent sensation below the knees and in the groin area.  Functional  People in this class have good sitting balance. People with lesions at L4 have trunk stability, can lift a leg and can flex their hips. They can walk independently with the use of longer leg braces. They may use a wheelchair for the sake of convenience. Recommended sports include many standing related sports. People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 88% compared to people without a disability.  Governance  In general, classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. From the 1950s to the early 2000s, wheelchair sport classification was handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Some sports have classification managed by other organizations. In the case of athletics, classification is handled by IPC Athletics. The International Paralympic Committee manages classification for a number of spinal cord injury and wheelchair sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Some sports specifically for people with disabilities, like race running, have two governing bodies that work together to allow different types of disabilities to participate. Classification is also handled at the national level or at the national sport specific level. In the United States, this has been handled by Wheelchair Sports, USA (WSUSA) who managed wheelchair track, field, slalom, and long distance events. For wheelchair basketball in Canada, classification is handled by Wheelchair Basketball Canada.  History  Early on in this classes history, the class had a different name and was based on medical classification and originally intended for athletics. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. During the late 1960s, people oftentimes tried to cheat classification to get in classified more favorably. The group most likely to try to cheat at classification were wheelchair basketball players with complete spinal cord injuries located at the high thoracic transection of the spine. Starting in the 1980s and going into the 1990s, this class began to be more defined around functional classification instead of a medical one.  Sports   Athletics  Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in F56. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. F6 athletes throw from a seated position, and the javelin they use weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . There are performance differences and similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999).

These include S5, SB5, S7 and S8. People in SB5 tend to be complete paraplegics below T11 to L1 who cannot use their legs for swimming, or complete paraplegics at L2 to L3 with surgical rods put in their spinal column from T4 to T6 which affects their balance. S7 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below L2 to L3. When swimming, they are able to do an effect catch phase because of good hand control. They can use their arms to get power and maintain control. Their hips are higher in the water than lower numbered classes for people with spinal cord injuries. While they have no kick movement in their legs, they are able to keep their legs in a streamlined position. They use their hands for turns. They either do a sitting dive start or start in the water. S8 swimmers with spinal cord injuries tend to be complete paraplegics with lesions below L4 to L5. When swimming, they are able to kick but limited use of their ankles means that their propulsion from kicking can be limited. They normally do diving starts from the platform but are not able to get full power because of limited use of their legs. They do leg turns but have limited propulsion power off the wall. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics.

Under the current system, they would likely be classified a 3 point player. if they are L2 to L4. They are likely to be classified a 4-point player if they are L5 to S2.  Wheelchair fencing  Generally, people in this class are classified as 3 or 4. Wheelchair fencers from this class who are classified as 3 are paraplegics from D10 to L2, scoring between 5 and 9 points on Type 1 and Type 2 function tests. For class 4, fencers tend to have a lesion below L4. They tend to score at least 5 points on Type 3 and Type 4 of the function test. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 3 and 4 are combined, competing as Category A.  Other sports  One of the sports open to people in this class is archery. People in this class compete in ARW2. This class is for people who have limited to good trunk function and normal functioning in their arms. It includes paraplegic archers, while ARW1 includes tetraplegic archers. Rowing is another sport open to people in this class. Currently, people with complete spinal cord injury at L3 level or incomplete lesion at L1 compete in TA. This class is for people with trunk and arm function. In 1991, the first internationally accepted adaptive rowing classification system was established and put into use. People from this class were initially classified as P2 for people with lesions at T10-L4. Ten-pin bowling is another sport open to people in this class, where they compete in TPB8. People in this class do not have more than 70 points for functionality, have normal arm pitch for throwing and use a wheelchair.  Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. A sample medical classification form. Sportspeople would need some form of this sent to a classification panel. Classification is often sport specific, and has two parts: a medical classification process and a functional classification process. Medical classification for wheelchair sport can consist of medical records being sent to medical classifiers at the international sports federation. The sportsperson's physician may be asked to provide extensive medical information including medical diagnosis and any loss of function related to their condition. This includes if the condition is progressive or stable, if it is an acquired or congenital condition. It may include a request for information on any future anticipated medical care. It may also include a request for any medications the person is taking. Documentation that may be required may include X-rays, ASIA scale results, or Modified Ashworth Scale scores. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. A 0 is for no muscle contraction. A 1 is for a flicker or trace of contraction in a muscle. A 2 is for active movement in a muscle with gravity eliminated. A 3 is for movement against gravity. A 4 is for active movement against gravity with some resistance. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. During functional and medical classification, a number of tests may be run for people in this class. For the trunk rotation test, people in this class are expected to have abdominal function and lower limb function demonstrated by having hip flexors and abductors. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

Historically, it has been referred to as Lower 5. It is characterized by people having their lower limb muscles strength and function impacted. People in the SP7 class generally have good sitting balance and some trunk movement backwards and forwards. One side may be stronger than the other. Classification into this class is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS). after having been originally handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Classification may also been done by an international sporting body, a national sports organization, or a national sport specific organization. Comparable classes for F7 include F57 in athletics, S5 or S10 in swimming, LTA in adaptive rowing and 4 point player in wheelchair basketball. The process for classification into this class has a medical and functional classification process. This process is often sport specific.  Definition  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F7 class. F7 is wheelchair sport classification, that corresponds to the neurological level S1- S2. Historically, this class has been called Lower 5. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\" These athletes also have the ability to move side to side, so they can throw across their body. They usually can bend one hip backward to push the thigh into the chair, and can bend one ankle downward to push down with the foot. Neurological level: S1-S2.\\"  Neurological  The neurological definition of for this class is S1 - S2. The location of lesions on different vertebrae tend to be associated with disability levels and functionality issues. S1 is associated with ankle plantar flexors.  Anatomical  People with a lesion at S1 have their hamstring and peroneal muscles effected. Functionally, they can bend their knees and lift their feet. They can walk on their own, though they may require ankle braces or orthopedic shoes. They can generally change in any physical activity. People with lesions at the L4 to S2 who are complete paraplegics may have motor function issues in their gluts and hamstrings. Their quadriceps are likely to be unaffected. They may be absent sensation below the knees and in the groin area.  Functional  Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have very good sitting balance and movements in the backwards and forwards plane. Usually have very good balance and movements towards one side (side to side movements) due to presence of one functional hip abductor, on the side that movement is towards. Usually can bend one hip backwards; i.e. push the thigh into the chair. Usually can bend one ankle downwards; ie. push the foot onto the foot plate. The side that is strong is important when considering how much it will help functional performance.\\"  Governance  In general, classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), having taken over this role following the 2005 merger of ISMWSF and ISOD. From the 1950s to the early 2000s, wheelchair sport classification was handled International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF). Some sports have classification managed by other organizations. In the case of athletics, classification is handled by IPC Athletics. The International Paralympic Committee manages classification for a number of spinal cord injury and wheelchair sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Some sports specifically for people with disabilities, like race running, have two governing bodies that work together to allow different types of disabilities to participate. Classification is also handled at the national level or at the national sport specific level. In the United States, this has been handled by Wheelchair Sports, USA (WSUSA) who managed wheelchair track, field, slalom, and long distance events. For wheelchair basketball in Canada, classification is handled by Wheelchair Basketball Canada.  History  Early on in this classes history, the class had a different name and was based on medical classification and originally intended for athletics. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. This period was also one that saw people oftentimes trying to cheat classification to get in classified more favorably. Starting in the 1980s and going into the 1990s, this class began to be more defined around functional classification instead of a medical one.  Sports   Athletics  Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in F57. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. F7 throwers compete from a seated position. The javelin they throw weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . There are performance differences and similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F7 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F4 to F9 throwers. A 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999).

F7 swimmers competing as S10 tend to have lesions at S1 or S2 that has minimal effect on their lower limbs. This is often caused by polio or cauda-equina syndrome. Swimmers in this class lack full propulsion in their kicks because of a slight loss of function in one limb. They do a standing start and kick turns, but get less power than they might otherwise because of the leg impairment. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics.

Wheelchair basketball  The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games. The wheelchair basketball classification system used during the 1980s was mostly functional, but had medical lesion based elements as a guideline. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the floor at any time. Wheelchair basketball was one of the earliest sports available to people in this class. From 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used in wheelchair basketball. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor. The system was designed to keep out people with less severe spinal cord injuries, and had no medical basis in many cases. This class would have been V. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. In this system, this class became Class III as 4 or 4.5 point players. Under the current classification system, they would likely be classified as a 4 point player.  Other sports  One of the sports available to people in this class is adaptive rowing. In this sport, people with incomplete spinal cord injury at S1 compete in LTA. They have use of their legs, arms and trunk. Another sporting option is wheelchair fencing. Wheelchair fencers from this class who are classified as 4. For class 4, fencers tend to have a lesion below L4. They tend to score at least 5 points on Type 3 and Type 4 of the function test. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 3 and 4 are combined, competing as Category A.

This class was historically merged in the 2000s with. The class was largely used in the United States for domestic competitions during the 2000s for standing wheelchair athletes. Initially, following changes made to the classification system internationally in this period, they were classified as F59 for international purposes. Their class was then changed following international classification. Their new classification was then used domestically. Domestically, they were moved to the F9 class because of a perceived lack internationally to have a standing wheelchair class.  Sports   Athletics  Under the IPC Athletics classification system, this class competes in F42, F43, F44, and F58. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. For F8 javelin throwers, they can throw the javelin from a standing position and they use a javelin that weights . Performance wise, a 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999).

Born in Uzunu, Giurgiu County, his parents were Anghel Cartojan and Maria (n√©e Petrescu). He graduated from Bucharest's Saint Sava National College in 1902. He then enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University, where Ioan Bianu was one of his professors, and graduated in 1906. Early on, he developed an interest in early Romanian literature and in researching the manuscripts of the Romanian Academy Library, where he worked from 1906 to 1912. At the same time, he was a teaching assistant. From 1912 to 1914, Cartojan attended speciality courses in Berlin, and in 1920 obtained a doctorate with a thesis about the Alexander romance in Romanian literature. Named an instructor in Bianu's department in 1921, he rose to associate professor in 1923 and, in 1930, was made full professor in the department of the history of early Romanian literature. In 1941, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy.

It is largely used as a national classification in the United States for athletics only, and replaced the standing F8 class. It is the only one of the nine wheelchair sport classes that is for standing competitors. The class has been governed by Disabled Sports USA, Wheelchair Sports, USA and USA Track and Field. Sports open to this class include athletics, wheelchair softball and cycling.  Definition  F9 is a standing wheelchair sport class used in the United States. It is sometimes referred to as Standing F8. This is a standing class for people with neurological disorders, the only one of the nine wheelchair sport classes for standing competitors. The level of spinal cord injury for this class is largely confined to the sacral region, or involves people who have incomplete lesions at a slightly higher level. This means they can sometimes bear weight on their legs. In 2003, Disabled Sports USA defined this class as, \\"Is a standing class but not more than 70 points in the lower limbs. Able to maintain Balance when in a challenged standing position. Internationally this class would compete in the 42,43,44 class with other ambulatory classes. Justification: Internationally there is no longer a wheelchair standing class.\\" In some competitions, F8 and F9 classes have been merged as F9, or they compete as F42, F43, or F44.  Governance  The F9 class is a domestic wheelchair sport class, used almost exclusively in the United States. This class was governed by Disabled Sports USA and Wheelchair Sports, USA during the 2000s. It was later governed by USA Track and Field.  Sports   Athletics  Under the IPC Athletics classification system, the F9 class competes in F42, F43 and F44. F9 competitors were moved out of the international F50s classes because there was no longer a perceived need for a standing wheelchair class. Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In javelin, F9 throwers throw the javelin from a standing position and use a javelin that weighs . A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F9 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F4, F5, F6, F7, F8 and F3 throwers. Throwers or all types in this class use a stopboard, making them the only wheelchair class that requires the use of one. In junior events in the United States, the F9 class does not participate in the pentathlon, while F3 to F8 do.  Other sports  On a junior level in the United States, other sports this class can participate in on a national level include wheelchair softball. The classification is also used in cycling in the USA.

Prosch's father, Johannes Henrik William Prosch (died 1843) was a secretary in the Danish War Chancery and his mother, Caroline Sophie (n√©e Brement) was French. In 1837 Prosch was a student at the Metropolitan School in Copenhagen and by 1843 he had taken his medical exams. Between 1843 and 1846 Prosch was employed by the University as a prosector, i.e. a preparer of specimens for dissection in the University's Zoological museum. In 1847 he joined the Flaaden as the ship's doctor on a voyage to Madeira. Guinea, Venezuela and the Caribbean. In 1848 he was the ship's doctor on the frigate Havfrue (\\"Mermaid\\") in the First Schleswig War. After the war practiced as a doctor in Copenhagen and was a teacher of natural history, in which capacity he published the book \\"L√¶rer i Naturhistorie, i hvilken Egenskabin\\" 1851, which at the time was widely used as a school textbook. He dealt equally diligently with the study of natural history, comparative anatomy and physiology. His scientific reputation was such that in 1852 he gained a teaching post in hygiene studies at Veterinary and Agricultural University, where in 1858 he was appointed associate professor of Dietetics and Animal Husbandry, being promoted to professor a year later. he made several journeys abroad to study German and English breeds of farm animals and he was to have a significant impact on Danish agriculture in the late 19th century.
