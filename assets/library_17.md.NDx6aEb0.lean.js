Genevieve, which in turn was named for the Catholic saint Genevieve, the patron saint of Paris.The State Historical Society of Missouri: Ste.Genevieve County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_sainte_genevieve.html History The area of Ste. Genevieve Township was the site of the earliest European settlement in Missouri dating back to the early 1700s. The French colonial settlers partially came from Lower Louisiana, Quebec in Canada, and France. These Creole Habitants farmed the rich bottomlands along the Mississippi River, particularly the Grand Champ bottom, while coureur des bois trapped and traded furs. The local economy provided food and goods for the needs of the Upper Louisiana colony and New Orleans. Transportation to New Orleans was made by boat, while local transportation moved on local roads or traces. The King's Road or Kingshighway (French: le Chemin du Roi or Rue Royale) was begun in 1779 and connected the communities and outposts on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The area known today as Ste. Genevieve Township was split between two French colonial districts: Ste. Genevieve District and New Bourbon District. Upper Louisiana was transferred to the United States in 1804, and in 1824 the state of Missouri was carved from the territory. With the creation of Missouri subsequently came the establishment of Ste. Genevieve County. Ste. Genevieve Township was one of two original townships in the county.

Retrieved 24 November 2013. During the Spanish Civil War she was the only African American nurse working in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion.Salaria Kea, \\"Doing Christ's Duty\\" in Jim Fyrth and Sally Alexander, Women's Voices from the Spanish Civil War. London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1991. (p. 151-4)  Early life  Kea was born on 13 July 1917 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Her father was a gardener at the Ohio State Hospital for the Insane in Columbus where he was stabbed to death by a patient when Salaria was a baby. After his death the Kea family moved to Akron. Kea's mother returned to Georgia, leaving Salaria in the care of her three older brothers. Salaria wanted to pursue a career in nursing, but racial segregation policy of the day inhibited this goal in Ohio. She was forced to move on to New York City in 1930, where she graduated the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing in 1934. As a student she managed to end the segregation in the Harlem Hospital's staff dining room and was also able to improve the working conditions of African American nurses. After her graduation Kea stayed in New York and became the head nurse of Seaview Hospital. During her employment at Seaview she became politically active with the American left, eventually joining Communist Party USA in 1935.  Spanish Civil War  During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935 Kea and her fellow nurses started raising money to send medical supplies to Ethiopian troops. She was also anxious to work as a nurse in Ethiopia but the emperor Haile Selassie did not accept foreign volunteers. In 1936 she applied to join the American Red Cross to assist Midwest flood victims, but was rejected because of her ethnicity. Following the outbreak if the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Kea lectured across the United States to raise funds for the Second Spanish Republic. During this time Kea developed strong anti-fascist views. Kea decided to volunteer to serve in the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War and joined the American Medical Bureau working with the Abraham Lincoln Battalion in March 1937. After her arrival in Spain, Kea helped establish a field hospital at Villa Paz near the Spanish capital Madrid. She was captured by the Spanish Nationalist Army but managed to escape with the help of International Brigade soldiers after being held for six weeks. In Villa Paz, Kea met an injured Irish soldier, John Patrick O’Reilly, whom she later married. In early 1938, Kea was transferred to different units in Aragon, Lerida and Barcelona and was herself injured in a Nationalist bombing raid. Her wounds were so severe that she was sent back to the United States in May 1938. The same year, Kea wrote her Spanish memoirs While Passing Through. They were published as a pamphlet named Salaria Kea: A Negro Nurse in Republican Spain.  World War II and later years  In 1940 John O’Reilly was allowed to immigrate the United States. He was soon drafted to serve in the military during World War II. In the beginning of 1944 Kea started working as a volunteer nurse for the United States Army as part of the first group of African American nurses the Army was allowed to recruit. In the United States Kea and O’Reilly experienced strong racism. In Akron they experienced personal threats and property damage, and Kea often referred to her time in the International Brigades as the best days of her life since they were free from discrimination. After the war the O'Reilly family lived in New York, where Kea worked in several hospitals coordinating staff desegregation. In 1973 the couple retired to Akron where Kea died on 18 May 1990.

Catalogue of the Lepidoptera Phalaenae in the British Museum, Volume 7. Taylor & Francis, London Although it was described at the start of the 20th century, the moth and its habits were little known. It turns out that the adults have vestigial mouthparts and do not feed before they die, but the larvae fed on species of Agapanthus. However, although the larvae are voracious feeders, the species seems to have done so little harm as to have escaped notice, presumably because of natural control by parasitoids. Early in the 21st century however, it emerged as a serious horticultural pest of popular species of Agapanthus in regions where neither the moth nor the plants occurred spontaneously. It seems that the moth had been translocated accidentally in horticultural stock and that the natural enemies had not been imported at the same time. Its very voracity combined with its monophagous feeding habits have however suggested that it might prove to be a valuable biological control of invasive Agapanthus in countries such as New Zealand.M.D. Picker and M.

EEZ are not areas of sovereignty, but are areas of certain sovereign rights and functional jurisdiction. Since the Peanut Hole was not in the Russian EEZ, any country could fish there, and some began doing so in large numbers in 1991, removing perhaps as much as one million metric tons of pollock in 1992. This was seen by the Russian Federation as presenting a danger to Russian fish stocks, since the fish move in and out of the Peanut Hole from the Russian EEZ. (This situation is called a \\"straddling stock\\".) In 1993, China, Japan, Poland, Russia and South Korea agreed to stop fishing in the Peanut Hole until the pollock stocks recover, but without an agreement on how to proceed after that, while the United Nations Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement, which became effective in 2001, created a framework intended to help implement cooperative management of straddling stocks. The Russian Federation petitioned the United Nations to declare the Peanut Hole to be part of Russia's continental shelf. In November 2013 a United Nations subcommittee accepted the Russian argument, and in March 2014 the full United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf ruled in favor of the Russian Federation.

That company has changed its name and its business is unrelated to the original. The brands were bought by Halewood International Ltd and are presently best known for ginger beers manufactured at Halewood's plant in Liverpool. John Crabbie & Company (Wines) Limited was incorporated in May 2006 and changed its name to John Crabbie & Company Limited the following July. Background Crabbie's traces its founding to 1801 when Miller Crabbie was a merchant in Edinburgh. The business was inherited by his son John Crabbie (1806 – 1891) who went on to found John Crabbie & Co. In the mid-19th century, John Crabbie acquired a former porter brewery located between Yardheads and Great Junction Street in Edinburgh's port of Leith. Over the ensuing years the premises were extended mainly to provide bonded warehouses for Crabbie's whisky business. The company was also engaged in gin rectifying and the production of fruit-based cordials. Of these, Crabbie's was best known for its green ginger wine which was continued to be made in Leith until the 1980s when John Crabbie & Co was acquired by another Leith distiller and blender, Macdonald & Muir, and production of green ginger wine was transferred to Broxburn, West Lothian. Macdonald & Muir had acquired the Glenmorangie Distillery in 1918 and renamed itself The Glenmorangie Company in 1996. In 2007, it sold the brand to the present owners, Halewood International. Preserving its links with Leith, John Crabbie & Company Limited is in the present day a dormant company with a company address in Mitchell Street, Leith. However, production of Crabbie's ginger beer takes place in Liverpool, England. Distribution Crabbies advertisement on a bus in the UK Since 2011 Crabbie's has been distributed in Australia through Woolworths Liquor, Beer Wine Spirits and Dan Murphy's grocery stores. In 2012, Crabbie's began distribution in the United States through St. Killian company Variations In the UK, Crabbie's is available in flavours such as Original, Scottish Raspberry, IPA and Stout, with a Spiced Orange variant also available in the United States. Outside of the UK and the United States, other variations might be found in speciality shops. In the United States, Crabbie's is sold as a malt beverage, and is not gluten free. The discovery that the American version of Crabbie's is not gluten free caused much alarm and controversy among the celiac and gluten intolerant community as Crabbie's was originally marketed as gluten free in the United States. In the UK, it is a gluten free product. in May 2019 Crabbie's changed their Ginger Beer recipe to contain 5% actual beer so it now contains Wheat and Barley but still maintains its Gluten Free label as the new gluten containing ingredients have a gluten level of less than 20 ppm. The product is no longer suitable for anyone with a Wheat or Barley intolerance. Sponsorship Crabbie's is a sponsor of both international and grassroots rugby, with sponsorships of Wales & Scotland, and Rugby Union clubs Ospreys, Newport Dragons, Scarlets, Cardiff Blues, Edinburgh Rugby, Glasgow Warriors, Newcastle Falcons, Northampton Saints, Yorkshire Carnegie, Richmond, Esher, Caldy, Southport and Rugby League club St Helens. Crabbies are the headline sponsor for Bournemouth 7s Festival who are the World's Largest Sports and Music Festival taking place with over 400 teams in the last bank holiday weekend in May.

(2008) Natural systems analysis. In: B. Rogowitz and T. Pappas (Eds.), Human Vision and Electronic Imaging. Proceedings SPIE, Vol 6806, 68060M This process has been modeled in several different ways that are guided by different concepts.  Debate over role of attention  One major dividing line between theories that explain natural scene perception is the role of attention. Some theories maintain the need for focused attention, while others claim that focused attention is not involved. Focused attention played a partial role in early models of natural scene perception. Such models involved two stages of visual processing.Evans, K. & Treisman, A. (2005). Perception of Objects in Natural Scenes: Is it really attention free? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31(6), 1476-1492. According to these models, the first stage is attention free and registers low level features such as brightness gradients, motion and orientation in a parallel manner. Meanwhile, the second stage requires focused attention. It registers high-level object descriptions, has limited capacity and operates serially. These models have been empirically informed by studies demonstrating change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink. Such studies show that when one's visual focused attention is engaged by a task, significant changes in one's environment that are not directly pertinent to the task can escape awareness. It was generally thought that natural scene perception was similarly susceptible to change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink, and that these psychological phenomena occurred because engaging in a task diverts attentional resources that would otherwise be used for natural scene perception. = Evidence against the need for focused attention = The attention-free hypothesis soon emerged to challenge early models. The initial basis for the attention-free hypothesis was the finding that in visual search, basic visual features of objects immediately and automatically pop out to the person doing the visual search.See 2. Further experiments seemed to support this: Potter (as cited by Evans & Treisman, 2005) showed that high-order representations can be accessed rapidly from natural scenes presented at rates of up to 10 per second. Additionally, Thorpe, Fize & Marlot (as cited by Evans & Treisman) discovered that humans and primates can categorize natural images (i.e. of animals in everyday indoor and outdoor scenes) rapidly and accurately even after brief exposures. The basic idea in these studies is that exposure to each individual scene is too brief for attentional processes to occur, yet human beings are able to interpret and categorize these scenes. Weaker versions of the attention-free hypothesis have also been targeted at specific components of the natural scene perception process instead of the process as a whole. Kihara & Takeda (2012) limit their claim to saying that it is the integration of spatial frequency-based information in natural scenes (a sub- process of natural scene perception) that is attention free.Kihara, K. & Takeda, Y. (2012). Attention-free integration of spatial frequency-based information in natural scenes. Vision Research, 65, 38-44. This claim is based on a study of theirs which used attention-demanding tasks to examine participants' abilities to accurately categorize images that were filtered to have a wide range of spatial frequencies. The logic behind this experiment was that if integration of visual information across spatial frequencies (measured by the categorization task) is preattentive, then attention-demanding tasks should not affect performance in the categorization task. This was indeed found to be the case. = More recent evidence reasserting the need for focused attention = A recent study by Cohen, Alvarez & Nakayama (2011) calls into question the validity of evidence supporting the attention-free hypothesis. They found that participants did display inattentional blindness while doing certain kinds of multiple-object tracking (MOT) and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks.Cohen, M.A., Alvarez, G.A., & Nakayama, K. (2011). Natural-scene perception requires attention. Psychological Science, 22(9), 1165-1172. Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene perception was impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this dual- task impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing the absence of a need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention. In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task involved viewing eight black moving discs presented against a changing background that consisted of randomly colored checkerboard masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and counting the number of times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last checkerboard, and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed anything different, as well as presented with six questions to determine whether they had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously. The authors varied the difficulty of the task (i.e. how demanding the task was) by increasing or decreasing the speed of the moving discs.  Models  These are some of the models that have been proposed for the purpose of explaining natural scene perception. = Evans' & Treisman's hypothesis = Evans & Treisman (2005) proposed a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets of unbound features of target categories in a parallel manner, and then use these features to discriminate between scenes that do or do not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it. An example of such a feature would be outstretched wings that can be used to tell whether or not a bird is in a picture, even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans & Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the visual processing hierarchy up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations. This hypothesis is consistent with the results of their study in which participants were instructed to detect animal targets in RSVP sequences, and then report their identities and locations. While participants were able to detect the targets in most trials, they were often subsequently unable to identify or localize them. Furthermore, when two targets were presented in quick succession, participants displayed a significant attentional blink when required to identify the targets, but the attentional blink was mostly eliminated among participants only required to only detect them. Evans & Treisman explain these results by with the hypothesis that the attentional blink occurs because the identification stage requires attentional resources, while the detection stage does not. = Ultra-rapid visual categorization = Ultra-rapid visual categorization is a model proposing an automatic feedforward mechanism that forms high-level object representations in parallel without focused attention. In this model, the mechanism cannot be sped up by training. Evidence for a feedforward mechanism can be found in studies that have shown that many neurons are already highly selective at the beginning of a visual response, thus suggesting that feedback mechanisms are not required for response selectivity to increase.Fabre-Thorpe, M., Delorme, A., Marlot, C., & Thorpe, S. (2001). A limit to the speed of processing in ultra-rapid visual categorization of novel natural scenes. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 13(2), pp. 171-180. Furthermore, recent fMRI and ERP studies have shown that masked visual stimuli that participants do not consciously perceive can significantly modulate activity in the motor system, thus suggesting somewhat sophisticated visual processing.See 9. VanRullen (2006) ran simulations showing that the feedforward propagation of one wave of spikes through high- level neurons, generated in response to a stimulus, could be enough for crude recognition and categorization that occurs in 150 ms or less.VanRullen, R. (2007). The power of the feed-forward sweep. Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 3(1), 167-176. = Neural-object file theory = Xu & Chun (2009) propose the neural-object file theory, which posits that the human visual system initially selects a fixed number of roughly four objects from a crowded scene based on their spatial information (object individuation) before encoding their details (object identification).Xu, Y. & Chun, M.M. (2009). Selecting and perceiving multiple visual objects. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 13(4), 167-173. Under this framework, object individuation is generally controlled by the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), while object identification involves the superior IPS and higher-level visual areas. At the object individuation stage, object representations are coarse and contain minimal feature information. However, once these object representations (or object-files, to use the theory's language) have been 'set up' during the object individuation stage they can be elaborated on over time during the object identification stage, during which additional featural and identity information is received. The neural-object file theory deals with the issue of attention by proposing two different processing systems. One of them tracks the overall hierarchical structure of the visual display and is attention-free, while the other processes current objects of attentional selection. The current hypothesis is that the parahippocampal place area (PPA) plays a role in shifting visual attention to different parts of a scene and incorporating information from multiple frames in order to form an integrated representation of the scene. The separation between object individuation and identification in the neural object-file theory is supported by evidence such as that from Xu's & Chun's fMRI study (as cited in Xu & Chun, 2009). In this study, they examined posterior brain mechanisms that supported visual short-term memory (VSTM). The fMRI showed that representations in the inferior IPS were fixed to roughly four objects regardless of object complexity, but representations in the superior IPS and lateral occipital complex (LOC) varied according to complexity.See 12. = Natural scene statistics =  References  Perception Psychological concepts ","title":"Natural scene perception"},{"id":"41175371","text":"Francis Patrick Gomez (17 August 1878 – 17 March 1954) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

In the Pacific Northwest Temperate Rainforest, it does not grow south of Prince of Wales Island, beyond that boundary is the Vancouver groundcone habitat. It does not contain chlorophyll, so it must be parasitic to obtain nutrients. It specializes on Alnus species, but can parasitize off of other trees and shrubs such as on Betula (birch), Salix (willow), Vaccinium (blueberry), Picea (spruce), and Chamaedaphne (leatherleaf shrub). This organism is likely to be found at mid elevations alongside rivers and streams, where moisture is abundant. This species propagates itself through water flow. In some places bears are known to have eaten the starchy roots, or tubers, of this plant. Morphology Boschniakia rossica grows between 6–12 inches, with two or three stems per individual. It has tall slender stalks. The roots grow horizontally from a main bulbous mass. It can vary from very dark maroon to reddish brown in color. This is a perennial plant, and flowers every summer. It can produce up to 300,000 seeds. B. rossica very much looks like a pine cone growing up out of the ground.

There are many ways to phylogenetically classify B. rossica, but scientists from Ohio State University have determined that the family Orobanchaceae is estimated to have originated about 52.2 million years ago. The strongest bootstrap support is for terminal clades. The most parsimonious tree of Boschniakia forms a grade with Conopholis and Epifagus as well as other species of Orobanche. In this tree, Lindenbergia and Schwalbea are sister taxa. These are still hypotheses, and further research is being conducted.

Life Boone was born on 30 June 1799. In 1812 he was sent to Charterhouse School, and in 1816 he became a student of Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1817 he obtained a Craven scholarship. With an ordinary degree, he took his B.A. 24 May 1820. Thomas Mozley, in a discursive chapter of his Reminiscences, speculated that the teaching of John Russell at Charterhouse had a negative effect on Boone, considered a brilliant student as a young man.Thomas Mozley, Reminiscences chiefly of Oriel College and the Oxford Movement (1882), pp. 200–4; archive.org. Soon after Boone left Oxford, he was offered a seat in the House of Commons by an owner of a pocket borough, but declined the offer. He lectured in London, on the \\"union and mutual relation\\" of art and science; and took his degree of M.A. 4 March 1823. For some years he was a master at Charterhouse; but having taken holy orders he accepted in June 1832 the appointment of incumbent of St. John's Church, Paddington. Here he remained until his death on 26 March 1859; that year he was appointed \\"select preacher\\" at Oxford, but was prevented by illness from taking up the duties. A brass was erected to his memory in the chancel of St. John's. Works =Early works= While an undergraduate, Boone won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse on The Foundation of the Persian Empire, and in 1817 the Newdigate for English verse on the subject of \\"The Farnese Hercules\\".The Christ Church Newdigate Prize Poems, Oxford 1823, pp.21-6 In 1820 he received the chancellor's prize for the Latin essay. He published Men and Things in 1823: a Poem in three Epistles with Notes, in which he showed admiration for George Canning. Boone wrote The Oxford Spy in Verse, the first four \\"dialogues\\" of which appeared in 1818, the fifth and last in 1819. This anonymous satire on Oxford University life created a sensation at the time of its publication. The criticisms it articulated, from the students' point of view, of the university and its tuition, were well-informed, and reflected what some senior members took to be undergraduate concerns. They were also close to points raised at the time in the Edinburgh Review, in their concern for modernisation of the syllabus. =Journal editor= In June 1822 the first number of The Council of Ten was published, a monthly periodical of which Boone was the editor and almost the sole contributor; it lasted a year. Boone was editor of the British Critic and Theological Review. Appointed in 1834, he decided to sharpen the theological focus of the periodical, also cutting back on its function as journal of record for the clergy. He advocated a broad coalition of Protestants, giving immediate offence (according to Edward Churton, in correspondence with Arthur Philip Perceval).Esther Rhoades Houghton and Josef L. Altholz, The \\"British Critic\\", 1824–1843, Victorian Periodicals Review Vol. 24, No. 3 (Fall, 1991), pp. 111–118, at pp. 112–3. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20082542 Boone then came under pressure from the Tractarians, to include their reviews. By 1837 his position was made untenable by John Henry Newman. Boone's attempt to remain above the fray in the row over Renn Dickson Hampden had earned him the partisan Newman's enmity. Newman, also, was being urged into a divisive approach that would see tractarian contributions as distinctive and noticeable in the Review. In a slow-motion coup, the \\"mild\\" liberal views associated with Boone were pushed out, despite the efforts of Henry Handley Norris of the controlling Hackney Phalanx representing High Church orthodoxy, and Churton. =Sermons and theoretical works= Boone also wrote: * An Essay on the Study of Modern History, 1821. * National Education: a Sermon, 1833. * The Educational Economy of England, Part i. on the External Economy of Education; or the Means of providing Instruction for the People, 1838. * The Need of Christianity to Cities: a Sermon, 1844. Connected with Charles Blomfield's efforts to expand Anglican church provision, this sermon has been called a \\"jeremiad\\" against contemporary urban life, attacking its \\"foul luxuriance\\". * One, Manifold, or, System; Introductory Argument, open letter addressed to Raikes Currie, 1848. * Sermons on Various Subjects and Occasions, with a Brief Appendix on the Modern Philosophy of Unbelief, 1853. * Two Sermons on the Prospect of a General War, 1854. * The Position and Functions of Bishops in our Colonies; a Sermon, 1856. * Sermons chiefly on the Theory of Belief, 1860.

Greene is an American experimental psychologist, neuroscientist, and philosopher. He is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. Most of his research and writing has been concerned with moral judgment and decision- making. His recent research focuses on fundamental issues in cognitive science.  Education and career  Greene attended high school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He briefly attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania before transferring to Harvard University. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Harvard in 1997, followed by a Ph.D. in philosophy at Princeton University under the supervision of David Lewis and Gilbert Harman. Peter Singer also served on his dissertation committee. His 2002 dissertation, The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Truth About Morality and What to Do About It, argues against moral-realist language and in defense of non-realist utilitarianism as a better framework for resolving disagreements. Greene served as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton in the Neuroscience of Cognitive Control Laboratory before returning to Harvard in 2006 as an assistant professor. In 2011, he became the John and Ruth Hazel Associate Professor of the Social Sciences. Since 2014, he has been a Professor of Psychology.  Dual-process theory  Greene and colleagues have advanced a dual process theory of moral judgment, suggesting that moral judgments are determined by both automatic, emotional responses and controlled, conscious reasoning. In particular, Greene argues that the \\"central tension\\" in ethics between deontology (rights- or duty-based moral theories) and consequentialism (outcome-based theories) reflects the competing influences of these two types of processes: > Characteristically deontological judgments are preferentially supposed by > automatic emotional responses, while characteristically consequentialist > judgments are preferentially supported by conscious reasoning and allied > processes of cognitive control. In one of the first experiments to suggest a moral dual-process model, Greene and colleagues showed that people making judgments about \\"personal\\" moral dilemmas (like whether to push one person in front of an oncoming trolley in order to save five others) engaged several brain regions associated with emotion that were not activated by judgments that were more \\"impersonal\\" (like whether to pull a switch to redirect a trolley from a track on which it would kill five people onto a track on which it would kill one other person instead). They also found that for the dilemmas involving \\"personal\\" moral questions, those who did make the intuitively unappealing choice had longer reaction times than those who made the more emotionally pleasant decision. A follow-up study compared \\"easy\\" personal moral questions to which subjects had fast reaction times against \\"hard\\" dilemmas (like the footbridge problem) to which they had slow reaction times. When responding to the hard problems, subjects displayed increased activity in the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal lobes—areas associated with cognitive processing—as well as the anterior cingulate cortex—which has been implicated in error detection between two confusing inputs, as in the Stroop task). This comparison demonstrated that harder problems activated different brain regions, but it didn't prove differential activity for the same moral problem depending on the answer given. This was done in the second part of the study, in which the authors showed that for a given question, those subjects who made the utilitarian choices did have higher activity in the anterior DLPFC and the right inferior parietal lobe than subjects making non-utilitarian choices. These two studies were correlational, but others have since suggested a causal impact of emotional vs. cognitive processing on deontological vs. utilitarian judgments. A 2008 study by Greene showed that cognitive load caused subjects to take longer to respond when they made a utilitarian moral judgment but had no effect on response time when they made a non-utilitarian judgment, suggesting that the utilitarian thought processes required extra cognitive effort.  Moral Tribes  Drawing on dual-process theory, as well as evolutionary psychology and other neuroscience work, Greene's book Moral Tribes (2013) explores how our ethical intuitions play out in the modern world. Greene posits that humans have an instinctive, automatic tendency to cooperate with others in their social group on tragedy of the commons scenarios (\\"me versus us\\"). For example, in a cooperative investment game, people are more likely to do what's best for the group when they're under time pressure or when they're primed to \\"go with their gut,\\" and inversely, cooperation can be inhibited by rational calculation. However, on questions of inter-group harmony (\\"us versus them\\"), automatic intuitions run into a problem, which Greene calls the \\"tragedy of commonsense morality.\\" The same ingroup loyalty that achieves cooperation within a community leads to hostility between communities. In response, Greene proposes a \\"metamorality\\" based on a \\"common currency\\" that all humans can agree upon and suggests that utilitarianism—or as he calls it, \\"deep pragmatism\\"—is up to the task. = Reception = Moral Tribes received multiple positive reviews. Thomas Nagel critiques the book by suggesting that Greene is too quick to conclude utilitarianism specifically from the general goal of constructing an impartial morality; for example, he says, Kant and Rawls offer other impartial approaches to ethical questions. Robert Wright calls Greene's proposal for global harmony ambitious and adds, \\"I like ambition!\\" But he also claims that people have a tendency to see facts in a way that serves their ingroup, even if there's no disagreement about the underlying moral principles that govern the disputes. \\"If indeed we’re wired for tribalism,\\" Wright explains, \\"then maybe much of the problem has less to do with differing moral visions than with the simple fact that my tribe is my tribe and your tribe is your tribe. Both Greene and Paul Bloom cite studies in which people were randomly divided into two groups and immediately favored members of their own group in allocating resources -- even when they knew the assignment was random.\\" Instead, Wright proposes that \\"nourishing the seeds of enlightenment indigenous to the world’s tribes is a better bet than trying to convert all the tribes to utilitarianism -- both more likely to succeed, and more effective if it does.\\" Greene's metamorality of deep pragmatism has recently been criticized by Steven Kraaijeveld and Hanno Sauer for being based on conflicting arguments about moral truth.  Awards and distinctions  Greene received the 2012 Stanton Prize from the Society for Philosophy and Psychology. In 2013, Greene was awarded the Roslyn Abramson Award, given annually to Harvard faculty \\"in recognition of his or her excellence and sensitivity in teaching undergraduates\\".

It is a passage of ducts, laid along the axis of main air stream to minimize the lateral velocity components caused by swirling motion in the air flow during entry. The cross-section shapes of these \\"honeycombs\\" may be of square, circular and regular hexagonal cells.  A low-cost handmade flow straightener  A low-cost flow straightener can be constructed using drinking straws, as they have low cost and good efficiency. The MythBusters television show used such a construction for their wind tunnel, as did an experimental wind tunnel at MIT (Maniet). The straws should be cut to equal size and placed in a frame.  Effectiveness of honeycomb  The effectiveness of honeycomb, in reducing the swirl and turbulence level, is studied by simulating the flow field using standard k-ε turbulence model in commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD is the most precise and economical approach to estimate the effectiveness of a honeycomb. Computational model A computational domain of honeycomb is created as shown in Fig. 1 We know computationally, it is very difficult to provide the realistic non-uniform flow at the entry of honeycomb as experienced in the experiments. Such random inlet conditions would essentially simulate the realistic case in which air can enter the honeycomb from any direction and at any level of turbulence. Therefore, special domain is designed for introducing practical inlet condition Computational domain of honeycomb Meshing of Computational Models The solid model of honeycomb is meshed in GAMBIT 2.3.16. As shown in Fig. 2. A structured rectangular mesh is used for the simulation with square honeycomb configuration. Governing equations for mass and momentum conservations for subsonic flow along with the equations for turbulence and porous flow are solved for the honeycomb using commercial CFD. RANS type RNG k-ε model is used for the turbulence modeling. Meshing of Computational Models Boundary Conditions The separate domain created upstream of the honeycomb is provided with various inlet conditions to arrive at the disorderly motion at the exit, which should be given as an inlet to the honeycomb cells. This essentially simulates the more realistic case that the flow can enter into the honeycomb from any direction. Specifications of this inlet along with other necessary boundary conditions are mentioned here. Flow at the inlet of the honeycomb shall necessarily have turbulent and swirling motions. Therefore, in order to incorporate these requirements, a separate fluid domain is constructed. 3D Geometry used to create turbulence at the inlet of honeycomb with meshing Top and bottom circular faces are considered as inlet to this domain to get a flow field with higher magnitude of lateral velocity. This domain is provided with vertical and horizontal cylinders as an obstruction to the inlet to produce sufficient swirling at the exit of this section. A tetrahedral mesh as shown in Fig. 3 with tetrahedral elements is generated for this geometry. The number of nodes are 1,47,666. Three faces of this configuration are specified as inlets with velocity boundary conditions. Fluid velocity at these inlet faces has been so taken that averaged mean velocity at the outlet is 1 m/s, which is in the operational wind tunnel. A pressure outlet boundary condition is used at exit of the settling chamber where pressure at outlet is set to zero for gauge pressure. It is always possible to predict the entire flow field by meshing whole fluid domain; however simulation for the prediction of entire flow field using symmetry boundary condition. This approach reduces the mesh requirement and computational efforts. Therefore, symmetry boundary is used at the periphery of the computational domain. Variation of turbulence intensity with position in 3D model Variation of turbulence intensity with position in honeycomb structure All the solid boundaries in the computational domain are specified as viscous walls with no-slip wall boundary condition. Turbulence intensity profile at the exit of turbulence model is shown in Fig. 4. This figure shows the turbulence intensity and which is maximum at the center (30%) and at the walls is around 16-18%, now this profile is incorporated inside the honeycomb as shown in Fig. 2, the profile of turbulence intensity comes out from the honeycomb is shown in Fig. 5. In this profile we can see that the turbulence intensity is reduced from 30% to 1.2% at the center and 16% to 3.5%, it means the honeycomb effectiveness is very high which is around 96%.

Tom Carney and Royal Cambodian naval officers at the Ream Navy Base during CARAT 2012 Ream Naval Base Ream Naval Base is a facility operated by the Royal Cambodian Navy on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand in the province of Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The base, which covers approximately 190 acres, is located on a peninsula just southeast of the provincial capital, Krong Preah Sihanouk. Since 2010 the base has been the site of annual joint Cambodian- United States training and naval exercises under the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) program.\\"US, Cambodian Navies Kick off CARAT 2012\\". Story Number: NNS121023-01Release Date: 10/23/2012 8:31:00 AM. Accessed 24 Nov 2013 History With the concentration on ground fighting during the Cambodian Civil War, the government's navy was neglected. At the time of the coup that placed Lon Nol in charge of the government in 1970, the Ream Naval Base was in a very run-down state with one pier in horrible condition, no effective logistical support system and very little internal repair capability.Cambodia Navy - History at GlobalSecurity.org, Accessed 24 Nov 2013 By 1974, Lon Nol's government and the Khmer National Navy (MNK) had vastly improved the base by implementation of a number of actions: procurement of 20 newly constructed radar equipped PCFs (Swift Boats); stationing of four PBRs (River Patrol Boats) in the Kompong Som (Sihanoukville) port area; overhauls of all of the heavy craft in inventory; procurement of a newly overhauled floating drydock the base; substantial upgrade of the Ream Repair Facility equipment; installation of an effective supply support system; and the completion of a modern pier facility and support complex for the base. This newly remodeled and refitted base allowed the Khmer National Navy to effectively assume the patrol and surveillance of the Cambodian coastline which had previously been outsourced to the South Vietnamese Navy (VNN) by the fledgling Khmer Republic. Further plans for an electricity generation plant and procurement of larger, better armed patrol craft were not completed before the fall of the Republic to the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Since the ouster of the Khmer Rouge in 1979 and the eventual establishment of the current constitutional monarchy, the government in cooperation with its allies has made the facility a relatively modernized naval base currently commanded by Rear Admiral Ouk Seyha, the deputy commander of the Royal Cambodian Navy. Alleged Chinese naval base In July 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese PLA navy had secretly secured exclusive access to about one- third of the base for up to 30 years, giving Beijing a new southern flank on the South China Sea, and only its second overseas naval foothold, after a base in Djibouti opened in 2017. Such hosting of foreign armed forces would be against the Cambodian constitution as well as the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements that ended the Cambodian Civil War.Deal for Naval Outpost in Cambodia Furthers China’s Quest for Military Network, Wall Street Journal, 22 July 2019Cambodia, China ink secret naval port deal: report, Asia Times, by David Hutt, 22 July 2019 The existence of the agreement was denied by Cambodian authorities who called it \\"fake news\\", although not by Chinese authorities who notably remained silent. China's alleged presence on Ream Naval Base was condemned by Sam Rainsy, former Leader of the Opposition of Cambodia and the last leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party before its dissolution by the Supreme Court of Cambodia. In an article for Foreign Affairs, Rainsy described the Chinese presence as a \\"grave threat to regional stability\\" and characterized it as part of an overarching plan by the Chinese government to militarize Cambodia's coast in combination with ambitious infrastructure projects in neighboring Koh Kong Province. In October 2020, Vice-Admiral Vann Bunlieng said that dredging work was being undertaken around the base, in order to accommodate larger vessels, in a project supported by the Government of China. The expansion is being undertaken by the China Metallurgical Group Corporation. One of two U.S.-funded buildings on the base was demolished in September 2020.

The term encompasses both the testing of a \\"biogenetic hypothesis\\" (conjectured course of a biosynthesis in nature) through execution of a series of reactions designed to parallel the proposed biosynthesis, as well as programs of study where a synthetic reaction or reactions aimed at a desired synthetic goal are designed to mimic a one or more known enzymic transformations of an established biosynthetic pathway. The earliest generally cited example of a biomimetic synthesis is Sir Robert Robinson's organic synthesis of the alkaloid tropinone. 500px A more recent example is E.J. Corey's carbenium-mediated cyclization of an engineered linear polyene to provide a tetracyclic steroid ring system, which built upon studies of cationic cyclizations of linear polyenes by the Albert Eschenmoser and Gilbert Stork, and the extensive studies of the W.S. Johnson to define the requirements to initiate and terminate the cyclization, and to stabilize the cationic carbenium group during the cyclization (as nature accomplishes via enzymes during biosynthesis of steroids such as cholesterol). In relation to the second definition, synthetic organic or inorganic catalysts applied to accomplish a chemical transformation accomplished in nature by a biocatalyst (e.g., a purely proteinaceous catalyst, a metal or other cofactor bound to an enzyme, or a ribozyme) can be said to be accomplishing a biomimetic synthesis, where design and characterization of such catalytic systems has been termed biomimetic chemistry. Synthesis of proto-daphniphylline Proto- Daphniphylline is biosynthesized from squalene (a) Key precursors A and B for the synthesis of proto-daphniphylline. (b) Mechanisms for converting dialdehyde A to proto-daphniphylline. Proto-daphniphylline is a precursor in the biosynthesis of a family of alkaloids found in Daphniphyllum macropodum. It is of interest due to its complex molecular structure making it a challenging target for conventional organic synthesis methods due to the fused ring structure and the spiro carbon centre. Based on a proposed biosynthesis pathway of proto-daphniphylline from squalene, Clayton Heathcock and co- workers developed a remarkably elegant and short total synthesis of proto- daphniphylline from simple starting materials. This is an example of how biomimetic synthesis can simplify the total synthesis of a complex natural product. The key step in Heathcock's synthetic route involves a cyclization of acyclic dialdehydes A or B to form proto-daphniphylline. Both dialdehydes (A or B) have carbon skeletons analogous to squalene and can be synthesized from simple starting materials. Treating A or B with a sequence of simple reagents containing potassium hydroxide, ammonia, and acetic acid led to the formation of proto-daphniphylline. Six σ-bonds and five rings were formed in this remarkable step. It was proposed in the original report that hydroxyldihydropyran intermediate C was first formed when the dialdehyde starting material (A) was treated with potassium hydroxide. A 2-aza-1, 3-diene intermediate (D) was generated from the reaction of intermediate C with ammonia. An acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction formed intermediate E which was further converted to the final product under the reaction conditions.

He was elected mayor in February 2011 for a three-year term as mandated by the newly instated Decentralization Act. He was reelected on February 1, 2014.  Early life  The eldest of seven siblings, Abdulla Sodiq grew up in Randooga’ndu, Hithadhoo, a part of Addu Atoll. Sodiq studied at Nooraanee School and continued his secondary school education at Malé English School. He went on to complete his higher education at the University of South Australia (Applied Chemistry & Chemical Technology, BSc.).  Political activism and imprisonment  After returning to the Maldives, Sodiq began teaching at the Southern Secondary School, the first secondary school in Hithadhoo. During this time, Sodiq and his colleagues started important community projects in Addu Atoll such as a preparatory school for students with learning difficulties. Sodiq is also a founding member of the NGO Maavahi. The organization was formed to encourage debate and activism on sustainable socio- economic development in a harmonized and protected ecosystem. An outspoken critic of former-president Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom, Sodiq was one of the pioneers of the opposition political movement in Addu following the political uprising of 2004. He was imprisoned during the incarceration of political activists at the time, and was released after 74 days in prison. Sodiq started his political career as the vice-president of the Maldivian Democratic Party’s (MDP) chapter in Seenu Hithadhoo.  Atoll councillor  Sodiq was soon appointed an atoll councillor of Addu City, Maldives following the presidential election of 2008. Since then, Sodiq has worked to create development opportunities for Addu Atoll. One of his most noteworthy accomplishments during his term in office was to lobby for legislation to grant city status to Addu City, Maldives and create the legal framework for the management of municipal funds and development planning by a city council for Addu Atoll. The improved efficiency of operating local municipalities (atolls and islands) through this reformed process removed political and administrative obstacles.  Mayoralty  Abdulla Sodiq assumed office as the first mayor of Addu City on February 24, 2011. President Mohamed Nasheed's decision to hold the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in Addu City facilitated investments in public infrastructure including the construction of Hithadhoo district's main road (divehi: ބޮޑުމަގު), which spanned up to 4.5 km and the renovation of street-lights in Addu City. The government also completed the construction of the Equatorial Convention Center (ECC) in Addu City exclusively to host the 17th SAARC summit in the Maldives. The Government's effort in instating Addu City was part of its plan to showcase a model for development in the SAARC region and place Addu City on the world map. Among other projects that have been initiated during Sadiq's term in office are the Hulhumeedhoo Harbor and Sewerage Project, Feydhoo Harbor Project, and the Feydhoo and Maradhoo Road Construction Project with the assistance of the Government of Sri Lanka.

Its form varies according to the nature of the surface on which it grows. In limestone and other calcareous substrates it excavates channels and chambers while on other types of rock it encrusts the surface or forms massive structures. It is native to the eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Description Cliona viridis is an excavating sponge and on calcareous substrates, the mass of the sponge is largely unseen beneath the surface with just the osculi (exhalent openings) and ostioles (inhalent pores) projecting. The osculi are a few millimetres wide and are yellowish-green or light brown with pale rims. The ostioles are grouped together on flat-topped, sieve-like protuberances which may be white, yellow or brownish-green. The colour is due to the zooxanthellae which are present in the tissues. The exterior appearance of this sponge in its later growth stages is a smooth mosaic-like surface composed of a firm, tough material. Beneath this surface are galleries excavated by the sponge which are up to in diameter. The whole sponge may be a globose structure some in diameter. Distribution Cliona viridis is found in the East Atlantic, the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands, the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. It has also been reported from the Caribbean Sea but this may have been a misidentification. It is found in shallow water and at depths down to about , in well-lit areas and in semi-dark cave entrances. Cliona viridis is a common sponge and is the dominant species of sponge in the shallow sublittoral zone in some parts of its range. It is less frequently found in deeper water and there it largely grows on coralline algae. Biology In the first stage of growth, Cliona viridis needs a calcified substrate on which to grow and into which it can bore. This can be limestone or a mollusc shell such as that of the edible oyster (Ostrea edulis). In its encrusting and massive stages it can grow over silicaceous rocks into which it is unable to bore. Although the tissues normally contain zooxanthellae, a photosynthetic symbiont, the sponge is not reliant on this and can grow in total darkness. Like other sponges, Cliona viridis maintains a current of water through its structure. It draws water in through its ostioles and filters out food particles such as bacteria and other micro-organisms. During the passage of the water through the sponge, oxygen diffuses into the tissues and waste products diffuse out. The water is then expelled through the osculi. Cliona viridis is oviparous, that is to say the eggs are fertilised internally, sperm being drawn into the interior of the sponge with the incoming water flow. The eggs are then ejected into the water column via the outgoing water stream. There is some degree of synchronisation of the reproductive process as a larval bloom was observed to take place in June during a study undertaken in the Mediterranean. The larvae are planktonic and have limited dispersal ability. When they settle on the seabed they develop into juvenile sponges in about two weeks. Zooxanthellae are already present at metamorphosis, having probably been transmitted during maturation of the oocytes.

Only one was built. Design and development The Supergrifo design began as an attempt to improve upon the Grifo but evolved into a much higher performance aircraft. The two models shared the same fuselage apart from the introduction of an enclosed cockpit but its wing was entirely new and of much greater span. It was a braced high-wing monoplane, its single spar wing having a centre section, covering about one third of the span, which was rectangular in plan and had slight dihedral. The rest of the wing was strongly tapered to rounded wing tips; there was no sweep on the leading edges but the trailing edges were forward swept. There was no dihedral on these outer panels, making the Supergrifo slightly gull winged. Ailerons almost filled their trailing edges. The increase of span to increased the aspect ratio by 60% to just over 20:1. The wing was centrally mounted over the fuselage on a pedestal, which dropped rapidly away to the upper fuselage behind the trailing edge, and braced on each side by a pair of parallel faired struts from the lower fuselage to the ends of the wing central panel. The Supergrifo's fuselage was a ply covered wooden hexagonal structure with deep sides. The cockpit, placed immediately ahead of the pedestal, was covered with a multi-transparency canopy attached to the cockpit rim and lifting off in one piece. All the tail surfaces were straight tapered and straight tipped, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and carrying unbalanced elevators. The fin was small but mounted a large, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel, working in an elevator cut-out and provided with a protecting tail bumper. The Supergrifo's landing skid, equipped with rubber shock absorbers, reached aft to the rear wing strut. The Supergrifo first flew in 1935. Only one was built. It competed in the Second Italian National Gliding Competition, held at Asiago in August 1938. There, Adriano Mantelli won the City of Vicenza prize for a flight to that city lasting 219 minutes and gaining en route.

It was founded in 1990 and is part of Hadan Group, which has been specializing in cosmetics since 1979. History In 1990, a group of Russian researchers studied the effects of space travel on astronauts. Part of their clinical research was to address the effects of sagging skin, which resulted in developing Premier’s first products. In the same year Premier's Center for Research was established together with its current owners, and five skincare products were developed. In 1994, Premier’s first products received awards in the cosmetic field in Europe. In 1997, Premier launched its own skincare line in Israel and later abroad. By 1999, Premier Cosmetics held the largest share of cosmetics exports from Israel to Japan, and is currently one of the biggest cosmetics exporter from Israel. Current skincare products Premier’s skincare products are based on Dead Sea mud, which is believed to have benefits for deep cleansing and stimulation of the skin, combined with Dead Sea water and minerals, that are said to improve the metabolism, stimulate blood circulation and aid in the natural repair of cells. Premier's skincare ranges include: First skincare line produced by the company, which includes bestselling products such as the award-winning Miracle Noir Mask. “Biox” skincare (2007), described as a non-surgical and affordable alternative to cosmetic procedures. “Ageless Future” skincare (2008) which is described as a cosmetic line which revives cellular metabolism. “Quartz Gem” skincare (2012), an anti-aging products enriched with Rose Quartz powder. In 2013, this line won the “Cosmopolitan Best of the Best” award. “Supreme” skincare(2013), a high-end anti-aging range aimed for the luxury market.

Controversy =BDS= Although Dead Sea Premier Cosmetics' laboratories and suppliers operate within Israel's undisputed territories, the company has become a target for boycott-of-Israel campaigns, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Most economic boycotts against Israel target businesses running from within the disputed occupied territories, but some campaigners do not always distinguish between the two regions.. BDS does not currently enlist Premier Dead Sea on its list of brands to boycott. =Selling Tactics= Unconnected to any economic boycotts of Israel is the international concern over the pervasive use of aggressive and often deceptive sales tactics by employees of so-called Dead Sea Cosmetics retailers at shopping malls worldwide. As a leading brand of Dead Sea skincare, this reflects heavily on the company's business even when uninvolved directly. =Dead Sea Cosmetics Issues= In a January 2010 cable wired from the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to federal law enforcement agencies — and then picked up and published by WikiLeaks — a laundry list of alleged financial shenanigans is described in connection with Dead Sea Cosmetics.

He batted and threw right handed.Gutiérrez, Daniel; Alvarez, Efraim; Gutiérrez (h), Daniel (2006). La Enciclopedia del Béisbol en Venezuela. LVBP, Caracas. Mora spent ten years in baseball, while playing from 1954 to 1963 for several teams in the Minor Leagues, Mexican Baseball and the Venezuela League. Although he never appeared in a Major League game, Mora teamed with major league figures and earned their respect by doing what he needed to do to win a game. A versatile utility man, Mora was able to play all infield positions and in the outfield corners, but he did not hit well. The 5'7\\" 157-pound ballplayer posted a career .229 average in four different leagues. Further, while he played 235 games and collected 157 hits and 32 RBI in 687 at bats, he never hit a home run.La Enciclopedia del Béisbol en Venezuela As a result, he was used mostly by his slick glove and great instincts of the game, especially in the late innings, yet he would achieve notoriety in the final years of his career. Early life Born in Maracaibo, Zulia; Mora was scouted while playing sandlot ball in his homeland. By the time he also played for a local semi-pro team, being respected in the league as a steady player whom managers could use in almost any position, and for being enthusiastic, positive, and hard working player. He then signed a contract to play in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during the 1954–1955 season. Professional career =1954–1957= Mora was assigned to the Santa Marta BBC, a lousy team managed by former big leaguer Red Kress, which had entered the league as a replacement for the departed Sabios de Vargas. Mora appeared in 21 of the 51 games of the team, batting .250 (5-for-20) with two doubles, two runs and three stolen bases, while playing as a backup infielder, and outfielder for Dave Pope and Joe Frazier.Santa Marta (1954–1955) The franchise never reached a high level of popularity, failing to encourage a significant fan support, and would be replaced by the Industriales de Valencia in the 1955–1956 season.Industriales de Valencia Team History After that Mora played three seasons for Valencia from 1955–1956 through 1957–1958. In between, he played briefly for the Leones del Caracas in the 1957–1958 tournament. Throughout this period, he hit .230 (29-for-126) with two triples and nine RBIs, while scoring 13 runs. He also played in 10 postseason games for the Industriales. In the 1957–1958 championship series, he scored a run as a pinch runner. Then, he hit .194 (6-for-32) with one double and two runs in the 1958–1959 first round. During the same period Mora played for the Havana Sugar Kings of the International League in 1957. By then, the Sugar Kings were the Triple-A affiliate team of the Cincinnati Reds, and played their home games at Gran Stadium in Havana, Cuba. Several talented Latin players who eventually made it to the Major Leagues donned the Sugar Kings uniform, including the Venezuelan infielders Elio Chacón and Pompeyo Davalillo, whom Mora backed up at shortstop and third base, respectively.1957 Havana Sugar Kings Mora appeared in 24 games, hitting .250 (12-for-48) with six doubles, six runs, 20 RBIs and two stolen bases. =Career highlight= Mora had his most productive season in the Venezuelan League while playing for the Indios de Oriente in 1957–1958. He batted a career-high .339 with four runs, four RBIs and three stolen bases, as the Indios won the pennant. As the league champions, the team represented Venezuela in the 1959 Caribbean Series played in Caracas. But Mora soon became an unexpected hero, when he hit .417 (10-for-24) in the Series, to tie teammate Camaleón García for the batting title. Mora also posted a .583 slugging average, batted two triples, drove in four runs, and scored four times. Even though the Venezuela's team finished second in the Series, Mora and García made the All-Star team, as did their fellows Babe Birrer and Norm Cash. This was the first time in Caribbean Series history in which four Venezuelan players made the All-Star team in the same year.Nuñez, José Antero (1994). Serie del Caribe de la Habana a Puerto La Cruz. JAN Editor. =1959–1963= A few weeks after his Caribbean Series heroics, Mora joined the Charlotte Hornets of the South Atlantic League in 1959. The Hornets played as a Class-A team in the Washington Senators Minor league system. It was a brief stint for Mora, who collected two hits in 23 at-bats for a .087 average, appearing in just eight games. He then joined the Licoreros de Pampero during the VPBL 1959–1960 season, appearing for them in 27 games, while batting .226 (24-for-106) with four doubles, one triple, 12 runs and seven RBIs. Mora also saw action with the Diablos Rojos del México of the Mexican League in 1960, but his statistics are incomplete because there are no records available. He returned to Oriente for two VPBL seasons from 1960 to 1962. He averaged .211 (43-for-204) in both seasons, including seven doubles, two triples, 30 runs, nine RBIs and three stolen bases in 72 games. Mora played his last VPBL season for the 1962–1963 Tiburones de La Guaira. As always, he contributed with his fine glove work, opportune batting and good base running, hitting .220 (22-for-100) with two doubles, 11 runs, two RBIs and two steals in 36 games. This time he also served as fielding and running instructor for the team, nurturing and inspiring future big leaguers as Dámaso Blanco and Luis Salazar, among other rookies.Tiburones de La Guaira (1962–1963) Late life After retiring at age 30, Mora continued using his baseball experience and life lessons to bring personal growth to young people.

Description  Praia do Castelo or Castle Beach is in fact made up of one main beach and several small satellite beaches and coves. The main beach is small and made up of gold sand and is long and is sheltered by high jagged cliffs. Spreading in each direction from the main beach are several small coves, interspersed by rocky outcrops. The beach gets its name from the Watchtower which once stood here. The watchtower was built in the mid-16th century to monitor this stretch of the coast for attacks by Barbary pirates coming from North Africa. The remains of this watchtower can be found close to the access point to the beach. = Access = On the cliff top there is a small car park which is reached from the resort village of Sesmarias along a small lane which is signposted Praia do Castelo with a brown Tourist sign (Rua da Torre Velha). From the car park the beach is reached by descending a set of wooden steps which also gives access to the beach bar and restaurant. The cliffs which back the beach are subject to erosion and it is recommended that great care be taken whilst below as there is a possibility of falling rocks and stones. = Facilities = There are toilets and a shower. During the summer season the beach is patrolled by lifeguards who also man a medical post. Also in the summer season there are Loungers, and parasols which can be hired. There is also a public telephone. Gallery File:AG69 25 November 2007 Praia do Castelo.JPGView to the west from the cliffs above Praia do Castelo.

Biography Ohara was born in what is now Nagaoka, Niigata as the third son of Tanaka Keijiro, a former samurai, the son of an impoverished former samurai, but was later adopted by Ohara Tomotada, a former samurai from Aizu Domain, and took the Ohara surname. One of his early classmates was the future diplomat Matsudaira Tsuneo. He graduated from the law school of Tokyo Imperial University in July 1902 and received a posting to the Ministry of Justice (Japan) as a public prosecutor. He served in that capacity for the next few years with the Shizuoka District Court, the Tokyo District Court and the Chiba District Court, and made a name in several trials involving high-profile corruption scandals, notably the Ōura scandal and Siemens scandal, as well as in the High Treason Incident, where he was the lead interrogator for prosecuting Kanno Sugako. Ohara was appointed as Deputy Minister of Justice under Yoshimichi Hara in the Tanaka administration, serving in the same post under the subsequent Hamaguchi, Inukai and Saito administrations. Under the Okada administration, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Justice from 1934 to 1936. One of his first actions was to poll several bar associations on the need for judicial reform, including the simplification and streamlining of legal procedures. Rohl. History of law in Japan. Page 818 During his tenure, he presided over a number of crisis, including the Teijin Incident, and February 26 Incident. On being informed of the failure of the rebels to assassinate Prime Minister Okada by the prime minister's chief secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu, he quickly urged Okada to visit the Imperial Palace for safety and to secure the support of Emperor Hirohito against the rebellion. These actions earned him the wrath of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, which refused to sanction his continuation as Justice Minister under the Hirota administration. He strenuously opposed the actions of his successor, Suehiko Shiono in 1937 and 1938 and was not given a post in the first Konoe administration or the Hiranuma administration, but returned to the cabinet in August 1939 under the Abe administration as both Minister of Welfare and Home Minister. However, his disagreements over the enforcement of Japan's increasingly totalitarian application of the Peace Preservation Laws against “thought crimes”, speaking out against police abuse of power and bureaucratic incivility to the general populace Mitchell. Janus-Faced Justice. Pages 101-102 alienated him from the supporters of his rival Shiono, and he resigned in January 1940. Ohara returned to the government of Post- occupation Japan under the 5th Yoshida administration in June 1954 as Minister of Justice as well as Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission. He retired in December 1954. References * Hall, John Whitney. The Cambridge History of Modern Japan. Cambridge University Press (1988). * Rohl, Wilheim. History Of Law In Japan Since 1868.

It consists of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. It represented the first formal agreement between the United States and Iran in 34 years. Implementation of the agreement began 20 January 2014. The Joint Plan of Action and the negotiations under it which followed eventually led to an April 2015 framework agreement and then a July 2015 final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Background The nuclear program of Iran has been a matter of contention with the international community since 2002, when an Iranian dissident group revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency, charged with monitoring and ensuring peaceful nuclear activities, referred the matter of Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council in February 2006, after finding that Iran had not been in compliance with its duties as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). For what the IAEA judged to be continued non-compliance, the UN Security Council has voted four times since 2006 to impose limited economic sanctions against Iran. In its resolutions, the Council required Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities. Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations, has emphasized that the resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and \\"are legally binding under international law, adding further legal force to the argument that Iran has no legal right whatsoever to enrich uranium\\". In addition, the United States and European Union have voluntarily imposed additional sanctions against Iran, targeting its natural resource exports (particularly oil and natural gas), petrochemical, aerospace and automotive industries, banking system, and access to international finance. Iran held a presidential election in June 2013 that was won by Hassan Rouhani, his campaign promised moderation and constructive engagement with the international community over its nuclear program and reverse Iran's international isolation. Rouhani was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005. In addition, the Associated Press reported in November 2013 that officials in the Obama administration had been in contact secretly with Iranian officials throughout 2013 about the feasibility of an agreement over the Iranian atomic program. The report said that American and Iranian officials met face-to-face five times in Oman. The secret meetings, personally authorised by U.S. President Barack Obama, were launched in March 2013 in Muscat, while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in power. Obama informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of these talks when Netanyahu visited the White House on 30 September 2013. In parallel with the implementation of the P5+1 interim agreement IAEA and Iran have agreed on a framework for cooperation that includes practical measures that to resolve questions about Iran's nuclear program, including activities that may be related to nuclear weapons.

Previous talks between Iran and the P5+1, chaired by European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton, were held in the Kazakh city of Almaty on 26–27 February and 5–6 April 2013, in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 17–18 March, and in Geneva on 7–8 November 2013 all without agreement. The sides agreed to meet again on 20 November. The 20 November negotiations were attended at the foreign minister level by the participant countries. The talks opened with a short introduction from Lady Ashton and the leader of the Iranian delegation, foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, before the sides began bilateral discussions. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, were present for the Geneva talks but were not announced. They stayed at a separate hotel and entered through service doors. Burns and Sullivan were key members of the back channel that President Obama sent to Oman to meet with Iranian officials. Burns was reported to be \\"in the driver's seat\\" of the American negotiating team, even though it was officially being led by Kerry and Wendy Sherman. Burns had met secretly with Iranian officials as far back as 2008, when then-President George W. Bush dispatched him. Agreement provisions The interim Geneva Accord was signed between P5+1 countries and the Islamic Republic of Iran on 24 November 2013. The deal consists of the short-term freezing of key parts of the Iranian nuclear program in exchange for a decrease in sanctions, as both sides work towards a long-term agreement. The agreement makes the following stipulations on the Iranian nuclear program: * All uranium enriched beyond 5% will either be diluted or converted to uranium oxide. No new uranium at the 3.5% enrichment level will be added to Iran's current stock. * No new centrifuges will be installed or prepared for installation. * 50% of the centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment facility and 75% at the Fordow enrichment facility will be left inoperable. Iran will not use its advanced IR-2 centrifuges for enrichment. * Iran will not develop any new uranium enrichment or nuclear reprocessing facilities. * No fuel will be produced, tested, or transferred to the Arak nuclear power plant. In addition, Iran will share design details of the reactor. * The IAEA will be granted daily access to Natanz and Fordow, with certain sites monitored by 24-hour cameras. The IAEA will also have access to Iran's uranium mines and centrifuge production facilities. * Iran will address IAEA questions related to possible military dimensions of the nuclear program and provide data expected as part of an Additional Protocol. In exchange, Iran will receive relief from sanctions of approximately US$7 billion (£4.3 billion) and no additional sanctions will be imposed. The agreement sets a six-month time frame for a more comprehensive follow-up agreement between Iran and the P5+1 negotiators to formalize Iran's nuclear relationship with the world. In addition, sanctions on Iran's auto industry, as well as sanctions on associated services will be suspended. License for the supply and installation in Iran of spare parts for safety of flight for Iranian civil aviation and associated services will be permitted. According to nonproliferation expert David Albright, the blending down of Iran's 20% enriched uranium will lengthen the time required for a nuclear \\"breakout\\" from 1–1.6 months to 1.9–2.2 months. The terms do not bar Iran from manufacturing components for their nuclear facilities off-site, as long as none of those components are installed. One western diplomat said the impact of this \\"loophole\\" would be very minor and could serve as a test of Iranian intentions. The minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced that Iran has no intentions to increase the capacity of the Arak site, \\"but construction will continue there\\". =Fissile materials= The NPT refers to the \\"inalienable right\\" to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in conformity with the treaty's nonproliferation provisions. Those provisions obligate non-nuclear states not to acquire (or seek or receive assistance to manufacture) nuclear weapons, and to place all their nuclear material under IAEA safeguards. Safeguards alone cannot provide assurance about a country's future intent, raising concerns that an Iranian enrichment facility under safeguards today could be used as the basis for break-out from non-proliferation commitments in the future. Iran asserts that the NPT guarantees a right to enrichment of uranium. Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei insisted that the right to enrich was a \\"red line\\" for the Iranian side. In the past, United States and Europeans argued that Iran should forfeit its right to enrich, despite NPT provisions, due to its secret nuclear activities and failure to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards. The interim agreement represents a compromise, and is silent as to whether or not Iran has a right to enrich uranium. It refers to Iran's \\"right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\\" and in its first phase allows Iran to continue some enrichment activities. Regarding a comprehensive long-term solution, the text states \\"This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution could involve a mutually defined enrichment program with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the program,\\" but a footnote makes clear that \\"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\\" According to Iran expert Ray Takeyh the agreement showed that uranium enrichment is \\"respected in practice but not acknowledged just yet.\\" A senior U.S. official said \\"the United States has not recognized a right to enrich for the Iranian government, nor do we intend to. The document does not say anything about recognizing a right to enrich uranium.\\" More generally, a senior U.S. official said \\"we do not believe any country – not just Iran – has a right to enrichment. The Article IV of the NPT, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, is silent on the issue. It neither confers a right nor denies a right.\\" According to an editorial in the Washington Post, the published text means that the United States and other powers \\"have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely.\\" The document says the final deal will \\"have a specified long-term duration to be agreed upon,\\" and after it expires, \\"the Iranian nuclear program will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT.\\" International reception Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated that the agreement ensures Iran's right to enrich. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the American negotiation team, responded saying that: \\"There is no inherent right to enrich,\\" and that \\"And everywhere in this particular agreement it states that they could only do that by mutual agreement, and nothing is agreed on until everything is agreed on.\\" Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov also stated that the agreement recognized Iran's right to enrichment, so long as the program is under IAEA control. Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman agreed with this assessment of the language in the agreement, although he was displeased by it. Arab nations Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Authority have come out in favor of the temporary agreement. Lebanon also hailed the agreement, while emphasizing that Israel should also sign the NPT and rid itself of its nuclear weapons arsenal. Turkey, India and Pakistan have also welcomed the framework agreement. In a reference to Israel's arsenal of nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia and Qatar both advocated a comprehensive solution to Iran's nuclear issue which would leave the entire Middle East free of nuclear weapons. Reaction from Israeli government politicians was negative. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the accord a \\"historic mistake,\\" and intelligence minister Yuval Steinitz compared it to failed nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Considering the way Washington handled the deal with Iran The Jerusalem Post questioned whether Netanyahu would \\"place Israel's security in the hands of US guarantees\\". Leader of the opposition Isaac Herzog criticized Netanyahu's reaction as bad for Israel's relations with the United States, although Herzog also said that Obama was partly to blame for not communicating more closely with Israel. Former Israeli military intelligence chiefs Amos Yadlin and Aharon Ze'evi-Farkash also criticized Netanyahu's reaction as damaging to U.S. relations. The former head of the Israeli National Security Council Yaakov Amidror argued the agreement failed to achieve anything significant and came to the conclusion that it \\"represents a failure, not a triumph, of diplomacy\\". Al Jazeera argued that Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Iran, welcomed the agreement. The Saudi cabinet released a statement which read, in part: \\"The government of the kingdom sees that if there was goodwill, this agreement could represent a preliminary step towards a comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear program\\" and could eventually lead \\"to the removal of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, from the Middle East and the Arab Gulf region\\". The Daily Telegraph reported that Nawaf Obaid, a senior advisor to the Saudi royal family, criticized the way the deal was achieved: \\"We were lied to, things were hidden from us\\". Reaction from the U.S. Congress was mixed. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Peter King were sharply critical of the agreement. Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Adam Smith were more positive. Speaker John Boehner and Democrat Eliot Engel were cautious. Reactions from Canada were \\"skeptical\\", with Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird saying Iran \\"has not earned the right to have the benefit of the doubt.\\" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hailed the interim agreement as the potential \\"beginnings of a historic agreement.\\" Hezbollah published a declaration and stated this is a triumph for Iran.حزب الله: اتفاق ايران النووي،انتصار نموذجي وإنجاز عالمي نوعي Al-Alam The American Israel Public Affairs Committee reacted skeptically to the agreement and urged preparation of sanctions legislation in Congress in case it failed, but fell short of calling for new sanctions immediately. Other non-partisan pro-Israel groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, were cautiously welcoming of the agreement after being briefed by White House officials.

Implementation The representatives of the interim agreement parties announced that implementation of the interim agreement would begin on 20 January 2014. Iran's negotiator, Araghchi disclosed in an interview that certain elements of the interim agreement are fleshed out in a secret 30-page \\"side agreement\\" or \\"nonpaper.\\" He said it included information about the operation of a joint commission to oversee the interim agreement's implementation. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf denied later that there was any secret agreement. The text of the implementation agreement was not released to the public. US National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said that this is because the EU is not making the document public.\\" The White House released a summary of technical understandings related to the implementation of the agreement on 16 January. President Barack Obama welcomed the announcement and said: \\"Beginning 20 January, Iran will for the first time start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantling some of the infrastructure that makes such enrichment possible.\\" The Iranian official, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi noted that unilateral interpretations must be prevented and said: \\"the use of the word 'dismantle' by Obama was not appropriate.\\" Implementation began on 20 January 2014, IAEA interim report confirmed that Iran had begun scaling back major nuclear activities, the first steps to implement the interim deal. The report followed by the partial lifting of sanctions by the United States and the EU. Iran's first payment of sanctions relief, of $550 million, is scheduled to be transferred on 1 February. Iran is also scheduled to receive five additional payments of $550 million through the end of July 2014, as well as $900 million in two installments for the dilution of its enriched uranium. European shipping and insurance companies will also be allowed to conduct business with Iranian oil shipments to six countries currently waived from facing U.S. sanctions.

The agreement provided for the improvement of water and electrical power supply, the return of refugees to their homes and the opening of transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting Croatian Army- controlled areas near towns of Nova Gradiška and Novska. It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the Croatian- and RSK-controlled portions of Sector West. The agreement was named after Daruvar, the site of its signing. The Daruvar Agreement, mediated by the head of the United Nations (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, was negotiated in secrecy. When the central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the arrangement, the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested. The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area. Background In November, Croatia, Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) agreed upon the Vance plan, designed to halt combat operations in the Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. Besides the ceasefire, the plan entailed protection of civilians in specific areas, designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs), and UN peacekeepers in Croatia—United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992. Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted, the European Community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992, while the Serb- and JNA-held areas within Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UNPROFOR, did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarisation of the UNPAs, ceasefire maintenance, monitoring of local police and creating conditions for return of internally displaced persons and refugees. Those comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from the RSK-controlled territory, and 20,000 Serbs who fled the areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991. A part of western Slavonia, encompassing an area extending approximately , was designated as the UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan. Unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled only a part of the area—approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south—centred on the town of Okučani. The RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV would attack the area to control the motorway. In response, the UNPROFOR developed Operation Backstop aimed at defending against the HV attack, assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway. Cooperation schemes Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas fragmented the market for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area to the south of the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area. Their efforts resulted in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK-held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian-controlled areas, and the supply of potable water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West. Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities. The scheme involved up to 2,500 refugees who would be allowed to rebuild their homes, funded by the Austrian government. The funds, in the amount of 1.3 million dollars, were obtained through Michael Platzer, Special Assistant to the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna. =Formal agreement= Veljko Džakula, a signatory of the Daruvar Agreement Fischer attempted to gain wider support for the cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that such a move would prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non- commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation. On behalf of the RSK local authorities, the agreement was signed by Veljko Džakula, Dušan Ećimović, Milan Vlaisavljević, Mladen Kulić, Đorđe Lovrić and Milan Radaković. At the time, Džakula held the position of deputy prime minister, while Ećimović was a government minister in the RSK. Signatories on behalf of the Croatian local authorities were Zlatko Kos, Zdravko Sokić, Ivan Volf, Vladimir Delač and Želimir Malnar. Fischer signed the agreement as a witness. According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia testimony given by Džakula at the trial of Milan Martić, Ivan Milas was present at the signing of the agreement as a representative of the Government of Croatia, accompanied by Joško Morić, Croatian Deputy Interior Minister. According to Džakula, no effort was made to conceal the signing of the agreement, even though the negotiations beforehand were kept secret. Aftermath The central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the agreement through a report filed by the 18th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina on 26 February, eight days after it was signed. The main opposition to the agreement came from Milan Martić, the RSK Interior Minister. Leadership of the ruling Serb Democratic Party accused Džakula of handing the RSK territory to Croatia. The RSK leadership considered the Daruvar Agreement tantamount to admission of economic unfeasibility of the RSK and an act of treason. District council of the RSK-controlled western Slavonia condemned the agreement because it was enacted only in the Croatian language, and failed to note the existence of the RSK or its administrative divisions. Džakula and Ećimović were sacked from their government positions, and from the positions of regional authority in the RSK-held western Slavonia. The other three RSK signatories were dismissed from their official posts as well. At local elections held in May 1993 to fill the vacated posts, Džakula was elected to serve as the Mayor of Pakrac municipality. On 21 September, Džakula and Ećimović were arrested, and taken to Knin prison and then to Glina while the investigation was in progress. On 3 December, they were released only to learn that the arrest of the two, and Kulić, was ordered days later. In order to evade the arrest, the three fled the RSK to Serbia. On 4 February 1994, Džakula was abducted in Belgrade by the RSK agents and taken back to the RSK. The RSK's response to the agreement ended Fischer's efforts. Moreover, Fischer, Zabala and Platzer were criticised by the UN, citing their excessive assertiveness in the matter. Fischer left Croatia, and Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. The Zagreb–Belgrade motorway was reopened in December 1994 through an agreement between the governments of the RSK and Croatia. However, a series of armed incidents in late April 1995 led to a Croatian military intervention and the capture of the portion of Sector West previously controlled by the RSK in Operation Flash in early May.

Lehar was the second most intense tropical cyclone of the 2013 season, surpassed by Cyclone Phailin, as well as one of the two relatively strong cyclones that affected Southern India in November 2013, the other being Cyclone Helen. The origins of Lehar can be tracked back to an area of low pressure that formed in the South China Sea on 18 November. The system slowly drifted westwards and entered the Bay of Bengal, where it quickly consolidated into a depression on 23 November. It moved west-northwest into an improving environment for further development before the system was named Lehar on 24 November, after it had developed into a cyclonic storm and passed over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands into the Bay of Bengal. Lehar gradually intensified further into a very severe cyclonic storm, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), reaching its peak on 26 November, with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of and a minimum central pressure of . Moving along a generally west-northwestward path in the following days, the storm passed over an area having cooler waters and a moderate vertical wind shear. The storm's low-level circulation center (LLCC) started losing its structure, triggering a weakening trend. Lehar rapidly weakened to a Depression on 28 November and its fully exposed LLCC made its second landfall over the coast of Andhra Pradesh near Machilipatnam. The same day, it was last noted as a well marked low pressure area over Andhra Pradesh. Extensive preparation was done in the wake of the storm by the authorities of the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, including the evacuation of 45,000 people in low-lying areas. The storm's rapid weakening before landfall led to no reported fatalities and minimal damage. Meteorological history On 19 November 2013 the Japan Meteorological Agency reported that a tropical depression had developed, about to the west of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the next few days the system moved towards the west- northwest and moved into an extremely favourable environment, for further development while located over the Malay Peninsula during 21 November. The system was subsequently last noted by the JMA during the next day, as it crossed 100°E and moved into the Andaman Sea. There, it developed a well- defined low-level circulation center (LLCC). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) on the system, assuming that it would intensify further as it moves into warmer sections of the Bay of Bengal. Tracking westward at over , the system gradually intensified over the next 24 hours. Early on 23 November, the JTWC classified the system as a Tropical Storm, designating it with 05B. A couple of hours later, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) started tracking this system as a Depression. It was initially assigned the code BOB 07. Early the next day, the IMD reported that BOB 07 had reached deep depression status, and immediately afterwards, they upgraded BOB 07 into a cyclonic storm, naming it Lehar. Being located in an area of moderate vertical wind shear of around , convection gradually consolidated around the LLCC, though being slightly displaced towards the northwest. Later that day, Lehar developed a weak microwave eye-like feature. Lehar made its first landfall south of Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar, early on 25 November. However, it maintained strength. The cyclone strengthened further and developed strong radial outflow, compensating the moderate vertical wind shear in the region. Following this development, the IMD upgraded Lehar to a Severe Cyclonic Storm. The JTWC also upgraded the system to a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone on the SSHS with winds of over . However, multispectral satellite imagery showed that a deep central dense overcast was obscuring the low level circulation. The JTWC had poor confidence in the storm's position and couldn't exactly locate its center. Lehar continued to track in a westerly direction just along the periphery of a subtropical ridge. Early on 26 November, the IMD upgraded Lehar to a Very Severe Cyclonic storm. Meanwhile, they have warned the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha of heavy rainfall and strong winds. Animation of Lehar crossing the coast of India Under the steering influence of the subtropical ridge, Lehar continued to track in a west-northwesterly direction. The storm maintained a peak 1-minute average sustained windspeed of . On passing over cooler waters and experiencing moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the storm started losing intensity. Though deep convection persisted along its well-define center, microwave imagery depicted drier air, restricting moist inflow along the southwestern periphery of the system. On 27 November, the convection around the storm's center started losing its structural organization. A scatterometer pass indicated the elongation of the LLCC with weakening wind field. Thereafter, Leher rapidly weakened into a Depression and made landfall south of Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh on 28 November. Increased frictional forces led to the degeneration of the storm into a well-marked low pressure area, while it moved inland. Preparations and Impact =Andaman and Nicobar Islands= The cyclone affected the Andaman Islands with heavy rain and gusts. It caused flooding, land slides, road blockage, uprooting of trees and damage to buildings. More than two dozen fishermen went missing and almost all of them were rescued by the Coast Guard and police. In Little Andaman, more than 2000 people were evacuated and kept in Onge-tikrey community hall there. In the nearby Havelock Island, about 1500 people got shelter in the panchayat community hall.http://www.andamansheekha.com/2013/11/27/cyclonic-storm-leher-leaves- andaman-paralysed/ Mayabander and Port Blair recorded heavy rainfall of 243 mm and 213 mm respectively in 24 hours as the cyclone made landfall.https://www.webcitation.org/6LQrm5zCj?url=http://210.212.167.212/weather_forecasting/Images/d-1r.pdf Four flights originating from Chennai bound to Port Blair were cancelled due to the cyclone on 25 November while winds hit the islands. =Andhra Pradesh= Lehar as a depression, shortly before landfall The Government of Andhra Pradesh had arranged four military choppers while the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) deployed 15 teams across the state while another 15 were being arranged for rescue and relief operations immediately after the storm. The four choppers were kept at Visakhapatnam. The state's chief minister Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy told the district collectors of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari districts to evacuate all the people living in low-lying areas to higher ground. Local state health officials were warned of a potential outbreak of diseases due to extremely heavy rainfall brought by the storm. On 27 November, the state government started evacuations across East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts. About 45,000 people were evacuated in total from the districts of Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari and West Godavari. Because the storm rapidly weakened into a minimal depression before landfall, no fatalities or significant damage to property due to cyclone-related events were reported. =Odisha= The Government of Odisha asked all fishermen to return to the coast and then evacuate to safer places on 25 November. The director of the Bhubaneswar Meteorological Centre asked the ports of Paradip and Gopalpur to hoist danger signals in preparation for the storm.

Meiktila, Burma, 1945 The Army Film and Photographic Unit was a subdivision of the British armed forces set up on 24 October 1941, to record military events in which the British and Commonwealth armies was engaged. During the war, almost 23 percent of all AFPU soldiers were killed in action; the AFPU was disbanded in 1946. History At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Ministry of Information controlled and censored publicity related to all military and civil actions. Separately, the Director of Public Relations, War Office dealt specifically with the affairs of the British army. It was quickly realised that the front line was no place for untrained photographers and cameramen and a call was made to recruit soldiers who had pre-war professional experience with cameras and cine film. Under Lt. Col. Hugh St. Clair Stewart, Pinewood Studio was selected as the headquarters of the new unit called the Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) as well as the RAF Film Unit and the Crown Film Unit, who produced propaganda films for the Ministry of Information. It was here that soldiers could be trained in recording events at the front. From this establishment, photographers and cameramen travelled with various regiments to record the British army in action. AFPU Number 1 Unit - North Africa In early 1942, 30 cameramen were sent to Cairo, Egypt to form AFPU's Number 1 Unit. This group, led by Major David MacDonald (a former GPO Film Unit member) first recorded (using Canadian-made 35 mm DeVry cine cameras and 120 Super Ikonta stills cameras) the retreat forced by the German Afrikakorps under General Rommel and then the offensive following the First Battle of El Alamein. It was at the start of the Alamein offensive that Sergeant Billy Jordan , skilfully filmed the opening artillery barrage. Footage of the North African campaign was used in the making of Desert Victory which won a best war documentary Academy Award in 1943. During the North African Campaign, the AFPU Number 1 Unit of 32 men, suffered four killed, seven wounded and six captured. AFPU Number 2 Unit Unit Number 2 covered the campaigns through Tunisia (from which the 1944 documentary Tunisian Victory was made) and then through the landings on Sicily and Italy. AFPU Number 5 Unit - Europe Sergeant W A Greenhalgh, Army Film and Photographic Unit, with his jeep during Exercise 'Fabius', Hayling Island, Hampshire, 6 May 1944 (IWM H38276) AFPU Number 5 Unit was formed during 1943, of 36 volunteers drawn from various regiments and led by Major Hugh Stewart. AFPU cameramen and photographers accompanied various army units in all theatres of action, including the Commandos, the Chindits, paratroopers, Special Air Service, Special Boat Squadron and the Long Range Desert Group. Ten AFPU members were attached to the main divisions during the Normandy landings in June 1944. Their recordings made during the campaign saw cameramen amongst the first waves ashore and then in the fighting inland. AFPU recorded battles during the Italian campaign and across Western Europe including Monte Casino, Liberation of Paris, Arnhem, the Rhine Crossing and the discovery of Belsen Concentration Camp. AFPU Number 9 Unit - Far East In the Far East campaign, Number 9 Unit recorded the army in action in Burma and later made the documentary Burma Victory. Film stock The AFPU used 35 mm black and white mute cine film, roughly long and lasted approximately (at per second). Sound effects and commentary were added later to recordings to prepare them for use as newsreels. Archive The photographs and film recorded by members of the AFPU are archived by the Imperial War Museum. Memorial A memorial at Pinewood Studios records those members of AFPU that were killed in action. The memorial also includes members of the RAF No. 1 Film Production Unit and there is also a memorial to AFPU members at the National Memorial Arboretum.

History =Beginnings= World Duty Free Group was created after the Autogrill Group, the old parent company, acquired and integrated the business lines of Aldeasa, World Duty Free and Alpha Group, which were complementary in terms of market segment and geographical regions. Aldeasa began retailing in Spanish airports in 1976. Alpha Airport Shopping has had a presence in airports in the United Kingdom in different guises since the very early days of airport retailing in 1955, while World Duty Free was founded by Heathrow Airport Holdings (BAA) to run tax and duty free operations in all its airports in the United Kingdom. =Expansion and consolidation= In the decade following the abolition of duty free within the EU in 1999, the three separate businesses, Aldeasa, Alpha and World Duty Free Europe, were acquired by the Italian company Autogrill S.p.A. After acquiring Aldeasa (50% in 2005 and the remaining 50% in 2008) and World Duty Free Europe(2008), Autogrill Group started a process to integrate them with the Alpha Group Travel Retail division (acquired in 2007). This process led to the set up in 2011 of the new World Duty Free Group, which controlled all Autogrill Group’s Travel Retail and Duty Free business. The company became one global organization in 2011, formed of European airport retailers Aldeasa and WDF, and the experience in the industry dates back to the 1950s. In September 2013, Autogrill completed the transfer of the US Travel Retail Division from HMS and its subsidiarie Host International to WDFG. = Demerger and listed= On 6 June 2013, the Shareholders of Autogrill approved the project of proportional partial demerger whereby Autogrill S.p.A. transferred the Travel Retail and Duty Free business to its wholly owned subsidiary World Duty Free S.p.A. (parent company of World Duty Free Group), the beneficiary, by assigning to the latter the entire shareholding in the Group’s Travel Retail and Duty Free business. On 30 August 2013 World Duty Free S.p.A. filed an application for the listing of its ordinary shares on the Mercato Telematico Azionario (electronic stock market) organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. On 1 October 2013, World Duty Free has listed on the Borsa Italia in Milan, marking the culmination of the demerger process from parent group Autogrill. = Discrimination against Chinese customers = In February 2018, a World Duty Free shop in Heathrow Airport triggered outcry in China and been criticised by state-run media after apparently being caught discriminating against the country’s passengers. The accusations emerged after an employee at retailer World Duty Free alleged they had seen the store offer 20 percent VIP discount vouchers to customers spending £79 or more, while telling passengers travelling to China they had to spend £1,000 to qualify. World Duty Free Group World Duty Free Group operates in more than 550 stores and duty-free shops in 20 countries. It is present with a substantial international presence in the European airport retail heartlands of Spain and United Kingdom and in the Middle East, North America, Latin America. In November 2013, World Duty Free Group won the tender to operate 11 stores at Helsinki Vantaa Airport – the retailer’s first business in the Nordic region. Thanks to it, WDFG operates four duty free and duty paid store, including two walkthrough shops, offering the core categories of beauty, liquor, tobacco and confectionery. The group operates around 2,500sq m for the core categories. It also operates seven specialty stores, totaling approximately 600sq m, focused on luxury product categories. WDFG operations started at Helsinki Airport in March 2014. The first of the newly renovated shops opened in 2015. In November 2014 Eugenio Andrades was appointed CEO, following the announcement of former CEO José Maria Palencia’s resignation. In November 2015, the company was taken over by Dufry and shares in the group were delisted from the MIB.

Founding members Didier Van Coppenolle (guitarist) and Bart Brion (drummer) decided to join forces, writing their first songs, embracing a unique blend of groovy Thrash Metal with Hard Core elements. The band is considered as one of the last of its generation still active in Belgium. Trouble Agency was born in the ashes of 80s Thrash Metal bands Cyclone and Decadence.http://www.metal- archives.com/bands/Trouble_Agency/13931 Biography =Formation and early career (1993-2008)= The original Trouble Agency lineup consisted of Didier Van Coppenolle (ex-Brain Cancer and Necrosis), Bart Brion (ex-Decadence) with Kalle Vanlint (ex-Cyclone & Decadence) on guitars, bassist Alain Fabry (ex- Necrosis), and Serge Van Bossele on vocals. The band would record ‘Alone’(1996) and ‘Angry’(1998), their first two demos, joined by Pascal Haneuse on drums and Didier Meeus on vocals. Trouble Agency then releases a first studio demo called ‘Bite Into Life’ (2002), which was recorded and produced by Xavier Carrion (ex-Cyclone & Channel Zero) and features Jamal Obeidat on drums. Larry Van De Rostyne (ex-Decadence) joins the band on lead guitars in 2003. This lineup was the longest to last and also released its first studio album 'Moneycracy' (2006). =Transition (2008-2012)= The band's commitment to self-releasing their albums and remaining independent from any local or major labels, hadn't allowed any popular breakthrough of their first releases, despite being well received by the public. Jamal Obeidat's departure from the band in 2008 would open a breach in the lineup, as bassist Alain Fabry and singer Didier Meeus would leave Trouble Agency shortly after. Though Trouble Agency never broke up, the most important lineup changes, occurring around 2010, wouldn't affect the band's inspiration or style. Trouble Agency recruited drummer François De Bock (ex- Breathstealer) and as a three-piece, released the totally self-recorded demo LP ‘The Last Shot’ (2011) with mastermind Didier Van Coppenolle assuming rhythmic guitars as well as vocals and Larry Van De Rostyne on both lead guitars and bass.http://www.troubleagency.be/band.htm =New era (2012-present)= The addition of Simon Mouawad on bass would definitely put Trouble Agency back on the tracks, allowing them to bounce back and recruit long time friend Kevin Nolis (ex- Breathstealer and Wasted Years) on vocals during early 2013. The band announced to be working on the release of a full-length studio recording late 2013.http://www.troubleagency.be Acknowledgement Trouble Agency's music was described as being similar to crossover and thrash metal acts Sacred Reich, D.R.I., Destruction and Annihilator by the Dutch Aardschok Magazinehttp://aardschok.com/ and the French Metallian Magazine.http://www.metallian.net/site/ Through the years Trouble Agency has shared stages with acts as Exodus, Destruction, Immortal, Anvil, Hyades, Onslaught and Paradox and has headlined the Metal Blast festival held at the Botanique in Brussels.http://www.botanique.be/en/artist/metal-blast-stormy- night-atroxentis-dollsex-breathstealer-trouble-agency-arkangel-soulbleed-m They played at Wacken Open Airhttp://www.wacken.com/en/woa2014/main- bands/billing-2014/bands-2014/trouble-agency-2014/ 2014's edition.

The project was designed to build a hydroelectric power station at Peendimedu waterfall, 8 kilometres deep inside the forest from Pooyamkutty. It was started in the 1980s and abandoned in 1990s. The project was initially designed to make an installed capacity of 1000MW, similar to Idukki dam, then changed to 210MW and subsequently abandoned due to environmental and financial issues by the government of India. Private buses are used as the first medium of transportation from the nearest town Kothamangalam which pass through Pooyamkutty and lead to Manikandamchal followed by Vellaramkuthu. Manikandamchal is fully occupied by farmers and Vellaramkuthu is by 'Adivasi' people. Manikandamchal bridge connects Pooyamkutty to Manikandamchal which was built in 2002, considered as a great addition by farmers staying in Manikandamchal, Vellaramkuthu and Kallelumedu. This is the one and only possible way to access the nearest town. Many of the locations used in the Mohanlal movies Pulimurugan and Shikkar are filmed at Pooyamkutty.

From 15 September 1675 to 13 August 1676Note: at that time, Sweden was operating under the Julian Calendar. Unless otherwise stated this article uses the Gregorian Calendar for all dates. an anti-Swedish coalition comprising Brandenburg-Prussia, the neighbouring imperial princedoms of Lüneburg and Münster, and the Kingdom of Denmark, conquered the Duchies of Bremen and Verden. Bremen-Verden, a remote outpost of Sweden's Baltic Sea empire, was the third Swedish imperial fief in North Germany granted under the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, alongside Swedish Pomerania and the Barony of Wismar. Following its conquest it remained in allied hands until the end of the war in 1679, but was then fully returned to Sweden in the wake of the Treaties of Nijmegen. For the major warring parties of Sweden, Brandenburg and Denmark, this theatre of war in northwest Germany was only of secondary significance.  Background  After France had invaded the General States in 1672 as retribution for the outcome of the War of Devolution, an alliance formed up against her. The conflict escalated into the Dutch War. In order to relieve her increasingly stretched forces, therefore, France urged its traditional ally, Sweden, to go to war against her enemies, who, in addition to the States General, included the House of Habsburg and the Electorate of Brandenburg. At the end of 1674, a Swedish army under the imperial commander, Carl Gustav Wrangel, invaded the Margraviate of Brandenburg which was militarily almost unprotected, while the Brandenburg army under Elector Frederick William I found itself at war with France. In a short summer campaign in 1675, Frederick William succeeded in defeating the Swedish army and pushing it back to Swedish Pomerania. Encouraged by the Brandenburg victory, on 17 July 1675 the imperial ban was imposed on the Swedish king in his capacity as an imperial prince in Pomerania, Mecklenburg and Bremen-Verden. A Reichsexekution was declared by the Holy Roman Empire against Sweden. The Westphalian and Upper Saxon Circles were charged with the enforcement of the ban against the Swedes. A little later came the declaration of war by Denmark on Sweden. In this large-scale war, the Allies, Denmark and Brandenburg, initially intended to conquer the Swedish possessions in northern Germany, then turn use their full might in the theatres of war in Scania. But with the conquest of Bremen-Verden, located on the southern border of Denmark, Sweden would have secured a potential springboard against Denmark.Henning Eichberg, p. 534 Another political power factor was that it would give the Swedes opportunities to recruit mercenaries. The war planning that took place on the Swedish homeland envisaged military victory being achieved through the deployment of the Swedish fleet which was likely to defeat the Danish fleet in the Baltic Sea, thus relieving Sweden's North German possessions, so it could then, in a further step, land on Zealand, the heart of the Danish kingdom. Sweden's chances in the Duchy of Bremen-Verden, therefore, lay principally in the strength of her own fleet, which was to have ensured a military victory by dispatching additional troops from the motherland. However, since the Swedish fleet could not sail due to delays in equipment, Bremen-Verden was not reinforced and had to rely on its in-place forces. Sweden's forces in the Duchy of Bremen-Verden were numerically weak and distributed across several fortified bases. The bulk of the Swedish army was in Stade, Carlsburg and seven other small fortresses. They would only be able to oppose large scale offensive operations with delaying tactics. The Swedish defence plans were based on siege warfare. The number of the fortified places would force her potential opponents, to fight a series of arduous, small sieges, but it also fragmented the troops available to the defenders and prevented them from forming a mobile field army.Henning Eichberg, p. 535.  Diplomatic preparations  Christoph Bernhard von Galen – temporarily the supreme commander of the allied army The Roman Catholic Prince-Bishop of Münster, Christoph Bernhard von Galen, who was intent on extending his power and who, until 22 April 1674, sided with France in battle against the Netherlands, signed an agreement on 7 June 1675 with the imperial court in Vienna that obliged him to supply 9,000 troops \\"to the Emperor and for Imperial Service\\". As a result of this obligation, the bishop was made to participate in the war against Sweden.Ersch/Gruber: Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste. Section 1, Part52 (G – Gallatin), p. 334. On 11/21 September 1675 a treaty of neutrality was signed between the Allies, the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, Denmark and Brandenburg on the one hand and John Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg on the other. Brunswick-Lüneburg, which hitherto had been on the Swedish side, therefore, agreed to remain neutral in the upcoming fight against Sweden. That treaty between the four allies was signed primarily because it was in the political interests of the imperial princes involved, rather than in discharge of their obligation to defend the circle or empire. Thus the execution of the imperial ban was carried out by the respective territorial armies, while the circle troops took no significant part in the fighting.Henning Eichberg, p. 488.

August – Surrender of the Swedes in Stade } The campaign began on 15 September 1675 in the southwest of the Swedish territory when, according to the reports of the Theatrum Europaeum, about 10,000 menTheatrum Europaeum, S. 725. – according to other records 4,000 men – of the Prince-Bishop of Münster passed through Haselünne and invaded the Swedish Amt of Wildeshausen. They continued their advance to the River Weser unimpeded. On 25 September at Bremen, Münster's artillery fired across the Weser. A Brandenburg force of 1,600 infantry and 700 cavalry under Major General Freiherr von Spaen, coming from Westphalian territory, also arrived in Bremen at the end of September.Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preußischen Armee – vom 15. Jahrhundert bis 1914, Biblio Verlag, Osnabruck, 1967, p. 230. The Danes participated with 2,500 men under the orders of Count Gustavus Adolphus of Baudissin. The Münster troops under Prince-Bishop von Galen marched from neutral Bremen to the fortress of Langwedel on the Weser, capturing it on 27 and 28 September. With that, the way into the state of the former Prince-Bishopric of Verden was open. Verden upon Aller itself fell into Allied hands on 27 September. Münster forces suddenly invaded the town and established themselves at one of the town gates. After Verden the town of Rotenburg was conquered, falling after some resistance. From there the marching column pressed on immediately towards Ottersberg, which was taken on 3 October 1675 by the now seasoned troops of the Prince-Bishop of Münster. The roughly 140 man Swedish garrison were taken prisoner. The Allied army then marched in a northeasterly direction with Buxtehude as their objective, reaching it on 12 October. Buxtehude was well fortified, had plenty of food and munitions and, according to the Theatrum Europaeum, a garrison of nearly 400 men. A siege appeared inevitable. After occupying an important eminence in front of the town that same day, the Allies drew up all their artillery of 14 mortars and 37 cannon into battery positions. Shelling commenced on the morning of 13 October, setting fire to over 60 houses. On 14 October a total of 100 mortar bombs and 60 artillery shells were fired into the town from howitzers and mortars, again wreaking much damage, but without causing a single fatality. On 15 October, fire was lifted in order for the trenches necessary for an assault on the town to be prepared and in order to launch an all-out attack. View of Bremervörde in 1653 1653 copperplate by Matthäus Merian Because the shelling had already resulted in heavy damage, the Buxtehude commandant, Hamelton, was forced to surrender the town having been implored by its citizens and his German mercenaries who had learned of the pronouncement of the Imperial Ban on Sweden. The garrison was permitted to withdraw to Stade taking its belongings and side arms. On 16 October the Allies entered the town, 24 cannon and their munitions falling into their hands as a result. After the fall of Buxtehude several Allied regiments pushed forward towards Bremervörde. On 25 October the siege of Bremervörde Fortress began. After three days of heavy shelling the mercenaries, who were mainly German, refused to render military service for the garrison. The Allies sent a trumpeter into the town as a parlimentaire. He threatened the garrison that all German combatants would be executed when the fortress was captured. The threat was based on the fact that they had used their weapons in the service of an outlaw against the Holy Roman Empire. In view of the situation, the Swedish commander had no choice but to surrender the place. The Swedish officers and men were given free passage with all their possessions and weapons, whilst most of the Germans transferred to the Allied side. As the result of a previous agreement amongst the Allies, the town had been promised to the Lüneburg troops who entered Buxtehude with 500 men. At this time on the fortresses of Carlsburg and Stade remained in Swedish hands. = Brandenburg and Danish landing operations = The Swedish Empire around 1660 with its 2 North German possessions In parallel with the advance of Münster, Brandenburg and Danish troops, there were two unsuccessful landing attempts by Danish and Brandenburg forces, that were repulsed by the Swedes with heavy losses. The first landing operation, at the end of September, was carried out near Carlshagen by a Brandenburg formation under Admiral Simon de Bolfey, in order to conquer the strategically important Carlsburg Fortress on the Weser.Page 2 (pdf file; 46 kB). This Swedish fortress had been first constructed in 1672 with the task of controlling the mouth of the Weser. Approaching from the River Elbe, a Brandenburg squadron of seven ships appeared, with a landing force of 534 men; together with the ships' complements, the whole force comprised about 800–900 men.Theatrum Europaeum, p. 726. On 28 September, the troops were landed near Lehe, north of Carlsburg. Because the Swedish commander of Carlsburg, which was relatively strongly defended by about 800 soldiers, refused to surrender, the Brandenburg admiral, de Bolfey, had his troops erect earthworks in front of the town and, on 30 September, opened fire with several salvoes from his ships' guns. However, on the same day the landing force pulled back from its positions in front of the fortress, in the course of which 30 Brandenburg soldiers switched sides to join the Swedes. Encouraged by the statements of these deserters, on 1 October the Swedes launched an attack with 200 men, but had to withdraw with losses after a brief fight. In order to relieve Carlsburg Fortress, 13 squadrons of cavalry were dispatched there from Stade under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Sidon. The Brandenburgers, who were now clearly outnumbered, were informed by scouts of the approaching force. They lifted the siege and embarked on the ships again on 2 October. Due to unfavourable winds, the ships, now loaded with the infantry, found themselves close to the shore as the Swedish reinforcements arrived. Consequently, they were attacked by the Swedes and, after resisting a short time, had to capitulate to superior forces. Total losses suffered by the Brandenburg force during this operation came to 314 men, the majority taken prisoner. Roughly at the same time, a Danish flotilla landed six companies of infantry under Lieutenant Colonel Harwich on the territory of Land Wursten. But after their successful defence of Carlsburg, the Swedish units under Sidon attacked these Danish mercenaries. After several battles on 4 October, the Swedes succeeded in defeating the Danes and taking 400 of them prisoner. Of these, 200 were then taken into Swedish service and ordered to reinforce the garrison at Carlsburg. The other prisoners were held (untergesteckt) in Stade. The main body of the Swedish troops returned to Stade on 7 October. The naval blockade of Carlsburg was lifted and the seven Brandenburg ships repaired instead to the River Elbe in order to cut off the seaward supply route to the town of Stade. By contrast, Carlsburg was besieged again in late October, despite the Swedes previous successful defence of the town. = Allied change of command = In October about 3,000 men of the Principality of Lüneburg under the command of Duke George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg arrived in the theatre of war from the Rhineland. As the appointed circle colonel of the Lower Saxon Circle, the duke took overall command of the now 12,000 strong Allied army.von Eichart: Geschichte der königlich hannoverschen Armee, p. 397. In the headquarters of Prince-Bishop von Galen in Rotenburg a secret treaty was signed on 14 October, wherein the Prince-Bishop, Duke George William and Duke Rudolph Augustus of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel agreed to provide mutual support to one another in the ensuing campaign. Furthermore, a provisional division of the conquests was negotiated that excluded Denmark and Brandenburg. In the aftermath of this campaign there was considerable disagreement and distrust, as the Protestant federated princes did not want to give the Roman Catholic Prince-Bishop von Galen too much influence in a Protestant Imperial Circle. = Attacks on Stade, the Siege of Carlsburg, Swedish raids = The Swedish statthalter of Bremen-Verden, Field Marshal Henrik Horn (1618–1693) from: Theatrum Europaeum, Vol. 11, 1682 On 4 November the Allies advanced on Stade, the HQ of the Swedish regional government of Bremen-Verden. The Stade garrison under Field Marshal Henrik Horn, the Swedish governor general of the Duchy, had 5,624 soldiers and 600 militia at his disposal.Henning Eichberg, p. 504. Theatrum Europaeum, Vol. 11, gives the number as 3,000. In the face of the threat, Horn had the town thoroughly prepared for defence. To prevent the desertion of German mercenaries in Stade upon arrival of the Allies, the marshal used material incentives and propaganda. Since Sweden had been declared an enemy of the Empire and Emperor Leopold I, in declaring the Mandata Avocatoria, had ordered that all subjects of the Holy Roman Empire had to renounce Swedish service, German mercenaries were deserting the Swedish forces in droves. So, at the beginning of November, Horn had the former Buxtehude commander, Hamelton, publicly executed for surrendering the fortress in Stade prematurely. All German mercenaries in Stade had to publicly reswear their oath of allegiance to the Swedish crown. By adopting this brutal approach, Field Marshal Horn was able to discipline his garrison force for the time being and ensure its serious defence. Repeated attacks on the fortress of Stade on 6 and 7 November 1675 were unsuccessful, and the Allies could not agree on continuing the siege of the town because of its stubborn resistance and the onset of winter. Finally, on 9 November, the Allies withdrew their troops into winter quarters. The hitherto captured forts remained under Allied occupation, in order to maintain the blockade of Stade. The Brandenburg troops left the theatre of war heading for the Duchy of Cleves and Principality of Minden. The Swedes took advantage of the lull around their garrisoned fortresses to temporarily wrest back the initiative. They repeatedly carried out raids and sent out foraging parties. Individual companies went upriver to Buxtehude, Cranz and Altona, and downriver to Bielenberg and Kollmar, burning and pillaging. Their exploits included the destruction or capture of several Danish and Dutch ships on the Elbe. In early January, Colonel Sydau, with about 400 dragoons and 400 infantrymen, led another Swedish expedition to Freiburg/Elbe in Kehdingen against about 500 entrenched Münster soldiers under Lieutenant Colonel Lamsdorff. Following the failure of a frontal assault by the Swedes, Sydau ordered his dragoons to circumvent the position and attack the rear of the Danish position. After the dragoons had taken their assault position in the village as per their orders, a Swedish attack was launched on the earthworks from all sides. The Münster troops sustained heavy losses, gave up the position and fled. Pursued by Swedish cavalry, 260 were captured. By contrast, the Swedes lost just 50 men in the Battle of Freiburg on the Elbe. Among the prisoners, were 15 mercenaries who had originally joined up for Swedish service, but had changed sides after the fall of Bremervörde. They were made an example of: one of the deserters was quartered in Stade as a deterrent, five were hanged and nine were branded.Theatrum Europaeum, p. 864 and Henning Eichberg, p. 506. This successful phase for the Swedes came to an end when Carlsburg, which had been besieged since the end of October, capitulated. A lack of ammunition, food and soldiers resulted in the surrender of the fortress on 22 January by its commander, the Frenchman, Colonel Jean Mell, to the united Münster, Danish and Lüneburg siege troops. The Swedish garrison, still about 380 strong (of which 200 were unfit to fight), were given free passage. At the surrender of the fortress 80 cannon fell into the hands of the Allies. In accordance with the treaty a mixed Münster and Lüneburg garrison took over.Ersch/Gruber: Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste. Section 1, Part 52 (G – Gallatin), p. 335.  Allied disagreements  Because the Prince-Bishopric of Münster and the Duchy of Lüneburg had agreed in advance to exclude Denmark and Brandenburg from the future division of Bremen-Verden, there were serious arguments amongst the Allies, which affected and endangered the continuation of hostilities against Sweden. For example, the Prince-Bishopric of Münster demanded the former Prince-Bishopric of Verden (later Verden duchy), the Ämter (\\"districts\\") of Wildeshausen, Burg, Bremervörde, Ottersberg and Thedinghausen The rest was to be annexed by Lüneburg-Celle. Denmark and Brandenburg, on the other hand, argued for an equal distribution of Allied conquests. Denmark demanded Carlsburg and Stade, and thus the control of the Weser and Elbe estuaries, in order to be able exchange them later in return for the deployment of auxiliary troops from Münster and Lüneburg for the Pomeranian War (Swedish-Brandenburg War). This dispute involving conflicting territorial claims escalated to such an extent that it threatened to come to open war between the Allies. The General States endeavoured to mediate between the parties to this situation, so as not to jeopardize the war against France. They therefore sent ambassadors, initially van der Tocht and, later, Amerongen, to Bremen for the negotiations. The statthalter (\\"governor\\") of the Netherlands, William III of Orange, proposed that all fortresses in Bremen-Verden should be slighted, to negotiate the final apportionment of territory at the peace congress in Nijmegen and to transfer provisional administration of both duchies to Lüneburg-Celle and Münster. Brandenburg and Denmark were expressly entitled to retain their rights to territorial interests in Bremen-Verden if, contrary to expectations, they did not achieve \\"compensation\\" in Swedish Pomerania and Scania.Georg Reimer: Urkunden und Actenstücke zur Geschichte des Kurfürsten Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg, 1866, p. 447. Although Brandenburg's envoy wanted to reach a provisional breakdown of the areas in question in the Hague, on 28 March he gave his approval to the treaty because he saw no other way to achieve an end to the dispute between the Allies, something which was essential for the continuation of the campaign. Although the Elector of Brandenburg did not ratify the decision of his envoy, he dropped his objections to the deployment of Lüneburg auxiliaries to Bremen-Verden in the light of the favourable progress being made in the war against Sweden in Swedish Pomerania.Georg Reimer: Urkunden und Actenstücke zur Geschichte des Kurfürsten Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg, 1866, p. 448. Nevertheless, the Elector secured Denmark's support in a secret agreement in early 1677 that Brandenburg should get \\"at least one fifth of territory to be divided in Bremen-Verden.\\"Theodor von Moerner: Kurbrandenburgs Staatsverträge von 1601 bis 1700, 1867, p. 393.  Siege of Stade, 1676  Stade around 1640 Copperplate by Matthäus Merian The ongoing dispute over the distribution of Bremen-Verden amongst the allies delayed the onset of the siege of Stade until spring 1676. The Allies agreed the terms on 28 April and 8 May in Bremervörde. This envisaged the attack on the last Swedish possession to be carried out with 16,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. The conquered fortress was to be filled equally by troops from Denmark, Brandenburg, Lüneburg-Celle and Munster.von Eichart:Geschichte der königlich hannoverschen Armee, p. 398. In early April the Lüneburg commander, Lieutenant General Chauvet, implemented measures to blockade the town. As a consequence, there were almost daily skirmishes and Swedish raids with varying degrees of success. At the same time, the besiegers began to build earthworks. Stade had access to the sea by virtue of its location at the mouth of the Schwinge, a tributary of the Elbe. Part of the Swedish fortifications also included a fieldwork that guarded the mouth of the Schwinge in Stadersand. Under its protection, several Swedish ships were able to reach the town, providing much needed supplies during the course of the siege. So to prevent access to Stade from the sea and thus tighten the stranglehold of the siege, the Allies decided to seize the Schwinge fieldwork. To this end, they called for artillery from Glückstadt and also brought in two 18-gun Lüneburg ships into the mouth of the Schwinge. All Swedish attempts to disrupt the preparations were repulsed. The Allies drew closer and closer to the hill and established a battery that opened a continual fire on the Swedish position. On 23 April the Swedes carried out a new raid with 300 horsemen, but were again driven back after initial success, with a loss of 46 men, according to contemporary sources.Theatrum Europaeum, p. 865. On 4 July, the Allies completed their earthworks and shelled the Schwinge position so heavily that its roughly 100-man-unit capitulated. Drawing of the Schwinge fieldwork near Stade With the loss of the Schwinge fieldwork, the resupply of Stade from the sea was no longer possible. When three Swedish warships, held up by unfavourable winds, and six other transport ships loaded with supplies, reached the mouth of the Schwinge, they were shelled by Allied batteries stationed on the banks of the Schwinge estuary. The Swedish fleet had to withdraw from Stade and, after a few raids into the area around the Elbe, they left. Cut off from all resupply, the situation in the fortress of Stade deteriorated considerably. An outbreak of shigellosis reduced the strength of the garrison to around 3,000 soldiers. With the deterioration in the material situation, moral amongst the besieged fell. Twice there were mutinies amongst the Swedish soldiers which could only be put down with the use of repressive measures. The desertion of German mercenaries now grew to such an extent that active defence with patrols and raids was no longer possible.Henning Eichberg, p. 504. In June, the earthworks on the Allied side were so far advanced that they reached the town moats. However, the town was not shelled, because they intended to starve its citizens and not storm it in order to protect their own forces. Countermeasures by the Swedish garrison consisted of flooding the surrounding area by opening the locks on the river. However, their besiegers succeeded in draining the water through two channels to the Elbe. As the supply situation in the town became ever more critical, the Stade citizens and the garrison's governor general, Horn, were forced to negotiate with their besiegers. The negotiations began on 13/23 July. However, they were delayed at the behest of population who, despite the tougher conditions preferred to be garrisoned by Protestant Lüneburg troops rather than Catholic Munster forces. As a result of the surrender negotiations, the town was to be occupied by nine Lüneburg companies under General Chauvet. The German mercenaries had to terminate their Swedish service. In the early morning of 13 August 1676, Field Marshal Horn, with 10 cannon and 800 Swedish soldiers, pulled out. The 1,400 German mercenaries were either detained (untergesteckt) or released.Henning Eichberg , p. 508 The last Swedish bastion in Bremen-Verden was now in Allied hands.  Aftermath  Following the conquest of Stade, 3,000 Lüneburg troops under the command of Major General von Ende were sent to Swedish Pomerania to support the local Brandenburg troops. The rest went at the end of September, with some Münster troops, to fight the French at Wetzlar on the River Lahn. During the occupation of Stade, Prince-Bishop von Galen led a re-Catholicization of the area he controlled, and Catholic services were reintroduced in many places. At the end of the war, Bremen-Verden remained in Allied possession. Denmark left 3,000 men as garrison troops in the Duchy of Bremen. The plans for the division of Bremen-Verden were dashed when Lüneburg-Celle concluded a peace treaty in Celle on 28 January 1679. Lüneburg undertook to leave all its occupied territories after the conclusion of the general peace treaty. After French troops had invaded Westphalia, the new Prince-Bishop of Münster, Ferdinand of Fürstenberg returned all his conquests to Sweden in the Peace of Nijmegen on 29 March 1679. The Prince-Bishopric of Münster was only allowed to keep the Amt of Wildeshausen as a pledge until the payment of a war indemnity of 100,000 Reichstalers by Sweden. This payment was not made until 1699. France promised the Bishop of Munster that they would work for the preservation of the newly created Catholic institutions in the Duchy of Bremen and Principality of Verden.Wilhelm Kohl: Germania sacra: Historisch- statistische Beschreibung der Kirche des alten Reichs, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, 1999, , p. 277. Verden, Langwedel and Rotenburg were cleared of Münster troops on 14 January 1680, Bremervörde followed on 15 January and Ottersberg and Carlsburg on 17 January. The departure of Lüneburg soldiers from Stade was delayed until 10 March 1680.Peter von Kobbe: Geschichte und Landesbeschreibung der Herzogthümer Bremen und Verden, 1824, p. 288.

The bank was affected by Decree- Law N°3 of 2015, which required banks with assets more than €8 billion to transform from Cooperative societies (S.C.) to Società per Azioni (from one person one vote to one share one vote). In 2016 the controlling stake in Cassa di Risparmio di Saluzzo was acquired from the banking foundation of CR Saluzzo.

His was a crucial role in ending the political career of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Biography Originally from County Sligo, Gilmartin grew up on a small farm at Lislary, near Grange. He left Ireland for England in 1957 and developed a mechanical engineering business in Luton serving local car makers such as Vauxhall Motors. Often wrongly referred to as a builder, Gilmartin in fact had never been involved in building, but had a great talent for putting together development schemes in the United Kingdom and introducing institutional investment to get them off the ground. Property development and corruption Motivated by concern that beggars there were Irish like himself, he returned to Ireland in the late 1980s and, there, encountered corruption from politicians while attempting to create 20,000 jobs through the development of two shopping areas in the Bachelors Walk and Quarryvale areas of Dublin, the latter of which subsequently became the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, a development which bears no relation to the multi-purpose retail, technology, and social development envisaged by Gilmartin. Gilmartin was subjected to demands for money by politicians, and was repeatedly obstructed when he refused to pay them. Politicians and the public relations industry attempted to discredit him when he tried to speak out. Comparing the Fianna Fáil political party to the Mafia, Gilmartin found himself under threat, \\"You could end up in the [River] Liffey for that statement.\\" This incident followed a meeting Gilmartin was invited to with the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey and several Cabinet colleagues in Leinster House. After the meeting, which was denied by all bar one of those who met him, a demand was made for IR£5 million, which Gilmartin refused. Gilmartin, when he returned to give evidence, was dismissed and ridiculed by a succession of those present, and was subjected to a very hostile cross-examination by lawyers for the then- current Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. However, the meeting was very clearly recalled by former Cabinet minister Mary O'Rourke (herself ostracised by some party colleagues as a result), thus proving Gilmartin correct. After being forced by AIB Bank to cede control of 60% of his development company to them and Cork developer Owen O'Callaghan, Gilmartin's experience became even worse. Gilmartin suspected O'Callaghan's associate, Frank Dunlop, as being a conduit for payments to politicians, the latter paid to stall the rezoning of the lands Gilmartin had assembled until he had handed over control. Contemporaneous bank memorandums and multiple witnesses attested to Gilmartin's complaints of corruption, particularly in relation to large round- figure, invoiceless and VAT-free payments to a company called Shefran Ltd., payments to which Gilmartin repeatedly queried and received no answers (it later becoming apparent that it was merely a cover for payments to Dunlop to disperse to politicians). The Tribunal report found that AIB were fully aware of, and facilitated, these payments, yet were complicit in keeping Gilmartin in the dark. Gilmartin was made bankrupt in the United Kingdom on foot of what he alleged was false information provided to the British Inland Revenue by Dunlop. Left without money, and his wife having collapsed, her Multiple Sclerosis finally disabling her due to incessant stress, Gilmartin was incensed by O'Callaghan's flaunting of payments to politicians, particularly by a cheque for IR£10,000 to Councillor Colm McGrath, and alleged boasts of other payments. It was subsequently established by the Tribunal that two IR£10,000 payments, one to McGrath, and one to Liam Lawlor, were written up in O'Callaghan's accounts as 'expenses', and subsequently falsely written up in the accounts of the company he shared with Gilmartin as Gilmartin's own expenses, Gilmartin being expected to fund expenses they knew he would never have sanctioned. Gilmartin continued to believe that payments to senior politicians were made and never revealed. Return to Britain Gilmartin returned to Britain after his forced exit from his own project. However, false allegations made by former government minister and European Union Commissioner Pádraig Flynn against Gilmartin's mental health while Flynn appeared on The Late Late Show live on RTÉ Television led to Gilmartin's agreement to co- operate with the Mahon Tribunal. Gilmartin exposed the corrupt former Government Press Secretary, Frank Dunlop, who Gilmartin always suspected of being a bag-man for corrupt payments from developers to politicians. It was Gilmartin's evidence which led to Dunlop being forced to admit his role in a corruption ring on Dublin County Council, with several politicians being paid for their votes in favour of, or against, rezoning of lands in County Dublin. His testimony was instrumental in exposing the former Assistant City and County Manager, George Redmond, and the powerful West Dublin TD, Liam Lawlor, both of whom obstructed his project when he refused their demands for money. Gilmartin's testimony included allegations that the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern had taken money from Cork developer Owen O'Callaghan (leading to Ahern's appearance before the Tribunal, and subsequent resignation) and that Flynn had tried to have Gilmartin give an IR£50,000 cheque to the Fianna Fáil political party to stop the activities of corrupt officials and politicians trying to thwart Gilmartin after he refused to pay them. Gilmartin had already gone to the Gardái, who were found to have told him to 'F*** off back to England', and later admitted not even questioning those named by Gilmartin because they were politicians. He had also complained to government ministers and Dublin Corporation officials, but had received little help, except requests for donations to the governing party, Fianna Fáil, which Gilmartin had repeatedly refused until he realised that he was set to lose everything. Thus, under much pressure, he relented, and gave a cheque to Flynn, then the Fianna Fáil Treasurer, for the party. The donation, which was meant for Fianna Fáil, was later found not to have been passed on to the party by Flynn. Gilmartin was subjected to an unprecedented campaign of vilification by government ministers, prominent journalists and commentators, and wealthy business interests, when he returned to Ireland to give evidence to the Mahon Tribunal about his experiences in trying to get his development off the ground. The stress sustained contributed to him needing quadruple bypass surgery. The Tribunal found his evidence to be truthful, and accepted that much of what he alleged was, in fact, true. The final Tribunal report was held to be a complete vindication of him, despite the efforts of powerful people to portray him as a malevolent fantasist. Gilmartin moved to County Cork, where he died as a result of heart failure in November 2013. Hundreds turned out in Grange, Co. Sligo, and at Urris, Co. Donegal, to pay their respects.

Named Midget, it was designated Type C and numbered 41 on the Cape Government Railways (CGR). The locomotive was delivered with an open cab, roofed, but not enclosed. To offer better protection to the crew, a spectacle plate and enclosed sides were added at some point soon after it entered service. Service =Cape Government Railways= The engine Midget was placed in service on the Avontuur branch out of Port Elizabeth, where it was employed on construction work and as shunting engine. It was also used to haul short two- coach passenger trains, based on the light railways premise that a light engine on low-volume passenger service would reduce running costs by 50% compared to larger locomotives. Type C on light passenger service The locomotive is reputed to have worked light two-carriage suburban passenger trains on the Walmer branch in Port Elizabeth at half the cost of the Type A and Type B locomotives. It was therefore possible to cater for traffic which, with the larger engines, would have been unremunerative. =South African Railways= When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, Natal Government Railways and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, the locomotive was renumbered to no. NG20 on the South African Railways (SAR), with the letters NG identifying it as a narrow gauge locomotive in the SAR registers. In 1921, it was sold to the West Rand Consolidated Mines in Krugersdorp. Preservation Upon eventually being withdrawn from service at the mines, the engine Midget was placed in storage until the Crown Mines Museum was established south of Johannesburg. The locomotive was restored, renamed Taffy and worked at Gold Reef City, as the museum was later named, until it was eventually retired once more and placed on static display at the museum. Illustration The following pictures show the engine Taffy in service at Gold Reef City in January 1982.

Mehterhane'den Bando'ya. Cem Yayımevi, Istanbul. pp 149–156.  Biography  Hanesyan was born on December 30, 1911 in Constantinople [now Istanbul] in the Ottoman Empire. He attended Esayanhttp://www.esayan.com/ Lyceum and then Robert College. He was graduated in 1931. Alongside his academic pursuits, Hanesyan took lessons in violin and theory from composer Haroutioun Sinanian. At the invitation of the local YMCA, he and his sister, pianist Anahid Hanesyan, presented a joint recital on May 29, 1932, launching a career in music. In 1944, Hanesyan joined the local symphony formed under the direction of composer Cemal Reşit Rey and remained with the ensemble until his retirement in 1972. During his tenure with the orchestra, he had many opportunities to play chamber music with Edgar Manas, Ekrem Zeki Ün, Lico Amar, Ferdi Statzer and Hüseyin Sadeddin Arel. Many of the public concerts were recorded and later broadcast on the Istanbul Municipal Radio Station. Following his retirement from the orchestra, Hanesyan established his own chamber orchestra in 1973 and performed many of his compositions in Istanbul and elsewhere. He recorded an LP, featuring some of his instrumental music and vocal compositions sung by soprano Alis Manukyan. Hanesyan composed some 50 works, most of them published in Istanbul, and some in Paris by Max Eschig.http://www.durand-salabert-eschig.com/ His musical vocabulary is plain, often tonal and centered. The pulse of his music is reminiscent of folk rhythms. They are mostly instrumental—a number of them for viola, the composer’s chosen instrument. The German-Armenian conductor Rolf Agop championed Hanesyan’s works and programmed them in various German cities. Harutyun Hanesyan died on March 7, 1987.

The story is set in the Stone Age and follows the Hedenhös family. Barna Hedenhös is mostly known as a book series, but Almqvist also made an (albeit limited) animated television series about the Hedenhös family that was broadcast on SVT in 1972. Additionally, Almqvist made a comic version of the Hedenhös books for the comic book Tuff och Tuss during the 1950s; the comic version was later remade for the Pelle Svanslös children's comic book in the 1970s. Story The books tell the story of the Swedish family Hedenhös, consisting of the father Ben, mother Knota, and their two children Sten and Flisa, and their dog Urax. The family also has a horse called Hårfagre and a cow called Mura. The books contain both actual events and fantasy episodes. In all of the stories, the Hedenhös family invents or comes up with things that are known in the modern world today. As an example, the Hedenhös family moves to an island they call \\"Stockholmen\\" - the implication being that it was the Hedenhös family that established and was the first to live in present-day Stockholm, Sweden. Another example is that the Hedenhös family launches the \\"Urlympiska spelen\\" (\\"Protolympic Games\\") and takes part in it, thus being revealed to be a predecessor to the modern Olympic Games. Racism accusations Some of the Barna Hedenhös books have been accused of being racist. For example, dark- skinned people in the books are referred to by terms that are considered offensive today. In 2013 Bonnier Carlsen temporarily halted its re-release of the books as Barna Hedenhös upptäcker Amerika (The Hedenhös Children Discover America) since the 1950 publications refer to Native Americans as \\"rödskinn\\" (\\"red skins\\"). A new text was inserted in the section concerning the first interactions between the Hedenhös family and the Native American tribe, so it would not cause offence. Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar In 2013 it was revealed that Barna Hedenhös would be the 2013 feature on the SVT Christmas calendar TV series for children, broadcast by Sveriges Television, and would premiere on 1 December on SVT. The series was named Barna Hedenhös uppfinner julen (The Hedenhös Children Invent Christmas).

He was an art collector and patron, known for his patronage of Caravaggisti artists, including Jusepe de Ribera and Dirck van Baburen. Jusepe de Ribera, Allegory of Sight (1615/16), oil on canvas, Museo Franz Mayer, Mexico City, Mexico Biography Originally from Zaragoza, Cussida was in Rome by at least 1596, when he is a regular customer of the bank Herrera & Costa. He is known to have had a wife, Giulia Martinez, by whom he had two sons, Gianfrancesco (or Giovan Francesco) and Luigi, who became a Carmelite friar. By 1602 he was serving as diplomat in the service of Philip III (ruled 1598-1621) and then Philip IV (ruled 1621-1665). One of his duties was the procurement of art work for their majesties. Pietro Cussida died in Rome in October 1622. He had gained a remarkable collection of paintings, which he left, along with his palace on the Via del Corso to Gianfrancesco, who died on 23 August 1623 and left the collection to his daughter Laura Cussida (1622-1692), a minor. Laura's guardian, Nicolò Gavotti, eventually inherited the paintings and the family palazzo. Art collection It was through Cussida's patronage that Van Baburan painted the Entombment, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane and Christ on the Road to Calvary for the Chapel of the Pietà of the Church of San Pietro in Montorio. Van Baburen shared the commission (ca. 1617) with David de Haen, who is now believed to have done the lunettes in the Chapel. De Haen was a guest at the Cussida palazzo on the Via del Corso in 1621. Between 1615 and 1616, he commissioned Jusepe de Ribera to paint allegories of the Five Senses, a commission Ribera probably completed in Naples. It was the discovery of the 8 March 1624 inventory of Gianfrancesco Cussida (Archivio Storico Capitolino, Rome), Cussida's son, that led to the attribution of the works to Ribera that had previously been thought to be by the Master of the Judgement of Solomon.

To disseminate and advance knowledge by providing instructional and research facilities in tribal art, tradition, culture, language, medicinal systems, customs, forest based economic activities, flora, fauna and advancement in technologies relating to the natural resources of the tribal areas. To collaborate with national and international universities and organisations, especially for undertaking cultural studies and research on tribal communities. To formulate tribal centric development models, publish reports and monographs and to organised conferences and seminars on issues relating to tribes and to provide inputs to policy matters in different spheres. To take appropriate measures for promoting the members of tribal communities capable of managing, administering and looking after their own needs by access to higher education through a university of their own. To disseminate and advance knowledge by providing instructional and research facilities in such other branches of learning as it may deem fit. To take appropriate measures for promoting innovations in teaching learning process in inter-disciplinary studies and researches and to pay special attention to the improvement of social, educational and economic conditions and welfare of the scheduled tribes within the Union of India.

Bennet has been described by the Menton Tourist Board as the \\"Inventor of the Menton resort\\". Bennet studied medicine in Paris, and after working as a doctor for 25 years contracted tuberculosis. Bennet went to the small coastal village of Menton in the South of France, close to the Italian border in 1859, wanting to \\"...die in a quiet corner, like a wounded denizen of the forest\\". Bennet's health greatly improved, and visited Italy the next year, but found the \\"unhygienic state of the large towns of that classical land undid the good previously obtained\\". He returned to Menton and started a medical practice, and completely healed, returned to England in the Summer to see his patients. His routine would be to spend Winter in Menton, and take a holiday in April and May, to study the Mediterranean climate and vegetation, traveling to Genoa, in Italy, before returning to England in the Summer. A monument to Bennet in Menton. Menton was connected by rail to Paris in 1869, which greatly increased the Alpes-Maritimes popularity as a destination for visitors. The construction of a rail link in 1861 between Nice and Ventimiglia, in Italy, meant that the coastal road could be avoided, which had previously been subjected to dangerous mudslides. Bennet still advised his patients to come to Menton by road to \\"enjoy the wonderful spectacle.\\" At the foothills of the Alps, Menton was sheltered from the winds, cold and heavy rain that characterised the regions weather. Enjoying a winter in mild weather provided a psychological boost for Bennet's patients, he wrote that they were \\"so charmed by the sun, the spectacle of nature and vegetation, they almost forgot their troubles.\\" Bennet described the attractions of Menton and the South of France to his patients, finding that invoking the \\"...beauties of nature, the magnificence of the sun ...the intoxication of the ever-changing sea, they were able to face the long and difficult journey to the south\\". Bennet felt that the hot and dry climate of the French Riviera as well as a proper diet cured tuberculosis sufferers. With the publication of Bennet's books, Menton's popularity as a destination greatly increased. His books were translated into German, and published in the United States. From \\"two or three hotels\\" in Menton in 1861, over 30 hotels had been built by 1875. Notable patients of Bennet's included Robert Louis Stevenson and Queen Victoria. Bennet bought a ruined tower with land on the hills above Menton, creating an eight-acre garden. He would also travel to San Remo and Marseille to meet experts in horticulture. Bennet's garden was even visited by Queen Victoria and her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice. A street, Rue J.H. Bennet is named after Bennet in Menton, and a monument was erected to Bennett in Menton's Rue Partouneaux.

Young is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium pace. On 26 May 2013, Young made his first-class debut for Ireland against Scotland. He made his One Day International debut against Scotland in September 2014, taking 5 wickets for 45 runs. He made his Twenty20 International debut against Scotland on 18 June 2015. In December 2018, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract by Cricket Ireland for the 2019 season. In January 2020, he was one of nineteen players to be awarded a central contract from Cricket Ireland, the first year in which all contracts were awarded on a full-time basis. Early and domestic career Young was born in Derry on 4 April 1990. He played for Bready Cricket Club in the North West Senior League as a medium pace bowler. After playing for the Ireland national under-19 cricket team at the 2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup where he took nine wickets, Young was given a one- year contract by Sussex for 2010. A series of injuries prevented him from making a significant impression, and much of his cricket for Sussex came for the county's second team. He made his first-class debut in an ICC Intercontinental Cup for Ireland against Scotland in late 2013, taking four wickets in the first innings and two in the second during an innings victory for Ireland. Early the following year, a few months after being released by Sussex, Young was contracted as an \\"A\\" category player for Ireland, the highest level of contract, and he made his one-day debut for the side shortly thereafter, albeit not in a full international match. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Belfast Titans in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. International career Young made his One Day International debut for Ireland in September 2014, and became the ninth player to take five wickets on ODI debut. That remains his best performance for Ireland in ODIs. In Ireland's 2015 ICC Intercontinental Cup victory over the United Arab Emirates, Young recorded his best match figures in a first-class match, collecting four wickets in the first innings and three in the second, during a large victory for his side. In May 2018, Young was added to Ireland's Test squad for their match against Pakistan, but he was not selected to play. In June 2019, he was named in the Ireland Wolves squad for their home series against the Scotland A cricket team.

Collection of Duke of Bedford, Woburn Abbey. Sir William Le Neve (1600?–1661) was an English herald and genealogist. Life Le Neve was the son and heir of William Neve of Aslacton, Norfolk, by his first wife, the daughter of John Aldham of Shimpling; his father died in 1609. Le Neve was appointed Mowbray herald extraordinary, under a warrant dated 24 June 1622 . He was then York herald, 25 November 1625; Norroy King of Arms, December 1633; and Clarenceux King of Arms, 23 June 1635, having been knighted at Whitehall Palace on 23 April 1634. In 1640 he was in correspondence with Sir Christopher Hatton. In 1625, Le Neve went to France with Henry St George to France, to bring back the future Queen Henrietta Maria. In 1639, Le Neve and George Owen were attached to the Earl Marshal, the Earl of Arundel, for the First Bishops' War. In 1642 Le Neve was sent by Charles I, on the day before the battle of Edgehill, to the parliamentary army under the Earl of Essex, with a proclamation. This mission is now described as intelligence work. Le Neve was deprived of his proclamation, and taken to Essex blindfolded, where his protests were found amusing. There is an account of the brusque treatment he received from Essex in the Earl of Clarendon's History. Le Neve was deprived of his position in 1646, when Arthur Squibb was made Clarenceux herald. He was declared to be a lunatic in October 1658, and Sir Edward Walker was empowered to execute his office. Again in 1661 he was found to be insane. Le Neve died at Hoxton, on 15 August 1661, and was buried at St. Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He was not married. An antiquarian and collector, he bought works from the library of William Dethick.

V. Stereoelectronic Effects: the Bridge between Structure and Reactivity. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK, 2016. http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118906349.html is an effect on molecular geometry, reactivity, or physical properties due to spatial relationships in the molecules' electronic structure, in particular the interaction between atomic and/or molecular orbitals. Phrased differently, stereoelectronic effects can also be defined as the geometric constraints placed on the ground and/or transition states of molecules that arise from considerations of orbital overlap. Thus, a stereoelectronic effect explains a particular molecular property or reactivity by invoking stabilizing or destabilizing interactions that depend on the relative orientations of electrons (bonding or non-bonding) in space. Founded on a few general principles that govern how orbitals interact, the stereoelectronic effect, along with the steric effect, inductive effect, solvent effect, mesomeric effect, and aromaticity, is an important type of explanation for observed patterns of selectivity, reactivity and stability in organic chemistry. In spite of the relatively straightforward premises, stereoelectronic effects often provide explanations for counterintuitive or surprising observations. As a result, stereoelectronic factors are now commonly considered and exploited in the development of new organic methodology and in the synthesis of complex targets. The scrutiny of stereoelectronic effects has also entered the realms of biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry in recent years. A stereoelectronic effect generally involves a stabilizing donor–acceptor (i.e., filled-empty, 2-electron 2-orbital) interaction. The donor is usually a higher bonding or nonbonding orbital and the acceptor is often a low-lying antibonding orbital as shown in the scheme below. Whenever possible, if this stereoelectronic effect is to be favored, the donor–acceptor orbitals should have (1) a small energy gap and (2) be geometrically well disposed for interaction. In particular, this means that the shapes of the donor and acceptor orbitals (including π or σ symmetry and size of the interacting lobes) must be well-matched for interaction; an antiperiplanar orientation is especially favorable. Some authors require stereoelectronic effects to be stabilizing. However, destabilizing donor-donor (i.e., filled-filled, 4-electron 2-orbital) interactions are occasionally invoked and are also sometimes referred to as stereoelectronic effects, although such effects are difficult to distinguish from generic steric repulsion. Important phenomena in which stereoelectronic effects and orbital alignment may play an important role (or may even be dominant) include the anomeric effect and hyperconjugation. The term stereoelectronic effect should not be misused to refer to a simple combination of steric and electronic effects. File:Tim Project Image 1.gif Trend of different orbitals Take the simplest CH2X–CH3 system as an example; the donor orbital is σ(C–H) orbital and the acceptor is σ*(C–X). When moving from fluorine to chlorine, then to bromine, the electronegativity of the halogen and the energy level of the σ*(C–X) orbitals decreases. Consequently, the general trend of acceptors can be summarized as: π*(C=O)>σ*(C–Hal)>σ*(C–O)>σ*(C–N)>σ*(C–C), σ*(C–H). For donating orbitals, the nonbonding orbitals, or the lone pairs, are generally more effective than bonding orbitals due to the high energy levels. Also, different from acceptors, donor orbitals require less polarized bonds. Thus, the general trends for donor orbitals would be: n(N)>n(O)>σ(C–C), σ(C–H)>σ(C–N)>σ(C–O)>σ(C–S)>σ(C–Hal). File:Tim Project Image 2.gif Stereoelectronic effect can be directional in specific cases. The radius of sulfur is much larger than the radius of carbon and oxygen. Thus the differences in C–S bond distances generate a much amplified difference in the two stereoelectronic effects in 1,3-dithiane (σ(C–H) → σ*(C–S)) than in 1,3-dioxane(σ(C–H) → σ*(C–O)). The differences between C–C and C–S bonds shown below causes a significant difference in the distances between C–S and two C–H bonds. The shorter the difference is, the better the interaction and the stronger the stereoelectronic effect. File:Tim Project Image 3.gif Influence on stability If there is an electropositive substituent (e.g. –SiR3, –SnR3, –HgR, etc.) at the β-position of carbocation, the positive charge could be stabilized which is also due largely to the stereoelectronic effect (illustrated below using –SiR3 as an example). The orientation of the two interacting orbitals can have a significant effect on the stabilization effect (σ(C–Si) → empty p orbital), where antiperiplanar (180°) > perpendicular (90°) > syn (0°). File:Tim Project Image 4.gif Influence on conformation =Gauche effect= One structural consequence of acyclic systems due to the stereoelectronic effect is the gauche effect. In 1,2-difluoroethane, despite the steric clash, the preferred conformation is the gauche one because σ(C–H) is a good donor and σ*(C–F) is a good acceptor and the stereoelectronic effect (σ(C–H) → σ*(C–F)) requires the energy minimum to be gauche instead of anti. File:Tim Project Image 5.gif This gauche effect has a profound effect in bio- chemical research. In (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline fragment, the gauche interaction favors one the conformer that can bind selectively to the active site of pVHL, a domain in collagen, one of the most abundant animal protein structures and can lead to proteasomal degradation of HIF-α subunit. File:Tim Project Image 6.gif =Special effects of fluorine substituent= Stereoelectronic effects can have a significant influence in pharmaceutical research. Generally, the substitution of hydrogen by fluorine could be regarded as a way to tune both the hydrophobicity and the metabolic stability of a drug candidate. Moreover, it can have a profound influence on conformations, often due to stereoelectronic effects, in addition to normal steric effects resulting from the larger size of the fluorine atom. For instance, the ground state geometries of anisole (methoxybenzene) and (trifluoromethoxy)benzene differ dramatically. In anisole, the methyl group prefers to be coplanar with the phenyl group, while (trifluoromethoxy)benzene favors a geometry in which the [C(aryl)–C(aryl)–O–C(F3)] dihedral angle is around 90°. In other words, the O–CF3 bond is perpendicular to the plane of the phenyl group. File:立体电子效应述图-ZQK.png Further studies illustrate that even for only one or two hydrogen atoms in a methyl group being replaced by a fluorine atom, the distortion in the structure can also be significant, with the [C(aryl)–C(aryl)–O–C(H2F)] dihedral angle in the energy minimized structure being around 24° and the [C(aryl)–C(aryl)–O–C(HF2)] dihedral angle 33°. Influence on reaction selectivity =Reductive cyclizations= Although the energy difference between coplanar anisole and its isomer is quite large, the rotation between the O–CH3 bond becomes favorable when the electronic properties of methoxy group on aromatic rings need to be altered to stabilize an unusual intermediate or a transition state. In the following reaction, the regioselectivity could be rationalized as the out-of-plane rotation of the O–C bond which changes the methoxy group from an in-plane donor group to an out-of-plane acceptor group. File:Tim Project Image 8.gif The intermediate of the above reaction is the di-anion and the stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes this intermediate over the other one is the fact that the anionic charge at the para position could delocalize to the oxygen atom via orbital interaction: π(benzene) → σ*(O–CH3). File:Tim Project Image 9.gif =Hydrogenation = Even remote substituents on the benzene ring can affect the electron density on the aromatic ring and in turn influence the selectivity. In the hydrogenation of ketones using CBS catalysts, the ketone coordinates to the boron atom with the lone pair on the oxygen atom. In the following example, the inductive influence of the substituents can lead to differentiation of the two sp2 lone pairs on the oxygen atom. The relevant stereoelectronic interaction in the starting material is the nO → σ*(Ccarbonyl–Caryl) interaction. The electron-withdrawing substituent on the benzene ring depletes the electron density on the aromatic ring and thus makes the σ*(Ccarbonyl–Caryl(nitro)) orbital a better acceptor than σ*(Ccarbonyl–Caryl(methoxy)). These two stereoelectronic interactions use different lone pairs on the oxygen atom (the one antiperiplanar to the σ* in question for each), leading to lone pairs with different electron densities. In particular, the enhanced depletion of electron density from the lone pair antiperiplanar to the 4-nitrophenyl group leads to weakened ability for that lone pair to coordinate to boron. This in turn results in the lone pair antiperiplanar to the 4-methoxyphenyl binding preferentially to the catalyst, leading to well-defined facial selectivity. Under optimized conditions, the product is formed with excellent levels of enantioselectivity (95% ee). 500x500px Influence on thermodynamics =Influence on equilibrium= The stereoelectronic effect influences the thermodynamics of equilibrium. For example, the following equilibrium could be achieved via a cascade of pericyclic reactions. File:Tim Project Image 10.gif Despite very similar structures, one of the two isomers is strongly favored over the other because of a stereoelectronic effect. Since the σ*C-C orbital adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group is lower in energy and is therefore a better acceptor than the σ*C-C orbital adjacent to the methoxy, the isomer in which the nO(σ) lone pair is able to donate into this lower-energy antibonding orbital will be stabilized (orbital interaction illustrated). Another example of the preference in the equilibrium within the area of pericyclic reaction is shown below. The stereoelectronic effect that affect the equilibrium is the interaction between the delocalized “banana bonds” and the empty p orbital on the boron atom. File:Tim Project Image-Add-3.gif =Influence on resonance structures= In another case, the stereoelectronic effect can result in an increased contribution of one resonance structure over another, which leads to further consequences in reactivity. For 1,4-benzoquinone monoxime, there are significant differences in the physical properties and reactivities between C2-C3 double bond and C5-C6 double bond. For instance, in the 1H NMR, 3J23 higher than 3J56. The C2-C3 double bond also selectively undergoes Diels–Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene, despite the increased steric hindrance on that side of the molecule. These data illustrate an increased contribution of resonance structure B over structure A. The authors argue that the donation from nN to σ*C4-C3 orbital lengthens the C4–C3 bond (C4 is the carbon bearing the nitrogen substituent), which reduces the p-p overlap between these two atoms. This in turn decreasing the relative importance of structure A which has a double bond between C4 and C3. File:Tim Project Image 11.gif Application in asymmetric Diels–Alder reactions In the asymmetric Diels–Alder reactions, instead of using chiral ligands or chiral auxiliaries to differentiate the side selectivity of the dienolphiles, the differentiation of face selectivity of the dienes (especially for cyclopentadiene derivatives) using stereoelectronic effects have been reported by Woodward since 1955. A systematic research of facial selectivity using substituted cyclopentadiene or permethylcyclopentadiene derivatives have been conducted and the results can be listed as below. File:Tim Project Image-Add-4.gif The stereoelectronic effect affecting the outcome of the facial selectivity of the diene in Diels–Alder reaction is the interaction between the σ(C(sp2)–CH3) (when σ(C(sp2)–X) is a better acceptor than a donor) or σ(C(sp2)–X) (when σ(C(sp2)–X) is a better donor than an acceptor) and the σ* orbital of the forming bond between the diene and the dienophile. File:Tim Project Image 16.gif If the two geminal substituents are both aromatic rings with different substituents tuning the electron density, the differentiation of the facial selectivity is also facile where the dienophile approaches to the diene anti to the more electron-rich C–C bond where the stereoelectronic effect in this case is similar to the previous one. File:Tim Project Image 17.gif The ring opening of cyclobutene under heating conditions can have two products: inward and outward rotation. File:Tim Project Image 18.gif The inward rotation transition state of the second shown below is relatively favored for acceptor R substituents (e.g. NO2) but is especially disfavored by donor R substituents (e.g. NMe2). File:Tim Project Image 19.gif Stereoelectronic effect versus steric clash Sometimes, stereoelectronic effects can win over extreme steric clash. In a similar cyclobutene ring-opening reaction, the trimethylsilyl group, which is very bulky, still favors the inward rotation. The stereoelectronic effect, which is the interaction shown above when the acceptor orbital is the σ*(Si–CH3), appears to be a more predominant factor in determining the reaction selectivity against the steric hindrance and even wins over the penalty of the disrupted conjugation system of the product due to steric clash. Furthermore, the acceptor orbitals are not limited to the antibonding orbitals of carbon-heteroatom bonds or the empty orbitals; in the following case, the acceptor orbital is the σ*(B–O) orbital. In the six- membered ring transition state, the stereoelectronic interaction is σ(C–X) → σ*(B–O).

Thanks to its many cycle tracks, Copenhagen is considered to be one of the world's most bicycle- friendly cities. The metro and S-train systems are key features of the city's well-developed public transport facilities. Since July 2000, the Øresund Bridge has served as a road and rail link to Malmö in Sweden. The city is also served by ferry connections to Oslo in Norway while its award-winning harbour is an ever more popular port of call for cruise ships. Roads The Øresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden. Copenhagen has a large network of toll- free motorways and public roads connecting different municipalities of the city together and to Northern Europe. As in many other cities in Europe traffic is increasing in Copenhagen. The radial arterial roads leading to Copenhagen city centre are critically congested during peak hours. In October 2011, heated, political talks of plans about road tolls around Copenhagen in order to combat the car congestion and improve the air quality arose. Discussions were abandoned in February 2012 due to disagreement of the physical locations of the toll road boundaries and political deadlock. Cycling Cycling to work Copenhagen is known as one of the most bicycle- friendly cities in the world. Every day 1.1 million km are bicycled in Copenhagen. 45% of all citizens commute to work, school or university by bicycle and it is municipal policy that this number should have gone up to 40% by 2012 and to 50% in 2015. The city's bicycle paths and cycle tracks are extensive and well used. Bicycle paths are often separated from the main traffic lanes and sometimes have their own signal systems, giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate. The municipality is also developing a system of interconnected green bicycle routes, greenways, the aim being to facilitate fast, safe, and pleasant bicycle transport from one end of the city to the other. The network will cover more than and will have 22 routes when finished. The city provides public bicycles which can be found throughout the downtown area. Copenhagen's well-developed bicycle culture is reflected in the use of copenhagenize to describe the practice of other cities adopting Copenhagen-style bike lanes and bicycle infrastructure. In 2007, Copenhagen-based Danish urban design consultant Jan Gehl was hired by the New York City Department of Transportation to re-imagine New York City streets by introducing designs to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists. In recognition of Copenhagen's emphasis on bicycling, the city was chosen by the Union Cycliste Internationale as their first official Bike City. Bike City Copenhagen took place from 2008 to 2011 and consisted of large cycling events for professionals as well as amateurs, culminating in the 2011 UCI Road World Championships. Public transportation Copenhagen Metro () is a 24/7 rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. The system opened between 2002 and 2007, and has two lines, M1 and M2. The AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro cars supplements the larger S-train rapid transit system, and is integrated with DSB local trains and Movia buses. Through the city center and west to Frederiksberg, M1 and M2 share a common line. To the south-east, the system serves Amager, with the M1 running through the new neighborhood of Ørestad, and the M2 serving the eastern neighborhoods and Copenhagen Airport. The Metro has 22 stations, of which 9 are underground. In 2011, the Metro carried 54.3 million passengers.Statistics page from official Metro website. The City Circle Line () or M3, an expansion of the Copenhagen Metro, was opened in 2019. The Nordhavn branch of line M4 opened in March 2020 with talks of plans for three additional lines M5, M6 and M7 A separate metro line, Øresundsmetro, connecting Copenhagen with Malmö is under consideration. Scematic map of S-trains and Metro in and around Copenhagen The S-train () network is a metrolike urban rapid transit network mainly serving the urban Copenhagen area. It connects the city centre and inner boroughs with the outer boroughs of Copenhagen. As of January 2009 there are of dual track and 84 S-train stations, of which eight are in neighbouring towns outside greater Copenhagen. The system has four main lines, and their tracks are fully separated from all other traffic. Parts are underground, other parts elevated, and some parts run in cuttings. Each line operates at a frequency of six trains per hour throughout the day. Through the city centre, however, where three of the four lines converge, trains can be as often as every two or three minutes. The fourth line, Ringbanen, takes another path through the city and has an operating frequency of 12 trains per hour. Some notable S-Train stations in central Copenhagen are Hovedbanegården (will get Metro service as well), Valby, Nørreport (with Metro access), Østerport (will get Metro service as well), Nørrebro (will get Metro service as well) and the typical junctions Ny Ellebjerg (will get Metro service as well), Danshøj, Flintholm (with Metro access), Ryparken, Svanemøllen and Hellerup. The S-Train system is the main rail transport in Copenhagen. In the 1990s it was decided to complement the S-Trains with a Metro system. Regional trains The regional trains are equally important for transport within the Metropolitan Area of Copenhagen. Important lines are for instance along Kystbanen (The Coast line) to Helsingør (Shakespeare's Elsinore with Kronborg Castle), to Copenhagen Airport, and to Roskilde. If the S-Train runs parallel, the distances between regional train stations are longer than where only regional trains are available. The regional trains also run outside the Metropolitan area (which also equals the ticket system area for all public traffic within Copenhagen). For travel outside this area, a different type of ticket must be purchased. The regional trains continues to western and southern Zealand as well as to the islands Falster and Lolland. Labeled as Øresundstog, they continue to Scania and some other Swedish provinces. The Copenhagen-Ringsted Line will be inaugurated (Danish indviet) May 2019. Local trains There are also three different system of local trains in the northern and southernmost suburbs. These run on unelectrified tracks, and are not available in the central parts of the city. Most local train lines begin at stations where S-train or regional trains end. The local trains are included in the ticket system of the Metropolitan area. Trams Between 1863-1972 Copenhagen had an excellent tram network. At its most extensive, the network had more than twenty lines.https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/hjaelp-til-billetter/billetter-og- kort/periodebilletter/citypass-english/experience-with-city- pass/https://www.magasinetkbh.dk/indhold/historie-sporvogne-i-kobenhavn Light rail A planned light rail connecting the outer suburbs is expected to become operational in 2025. = City Pass, central Copenhagen urban transit stations = The one figured ticket fare zones 1-4 constitutes an area known as the \\"City Pass\\" area.

Another 5 Metro stations of the Harbour line (M4) are under constructions and are scheduled to open in 2024. In the opposite end of that line (in the North), is an extension planned, but not decided. Still many attractions and inner city boroughs will still lack a nearby station, like Copenhagen Zoo, Copenhagen Opera and old block build districts like Hellerup, Brønshøj, and the densely populated Inner Nørrebro as well as the national hospital Rigshospitalet. =Domestic and international trains= Copenhagen Central Station provides Copenhagen with Intercity and Express trains across Denmark, as well as services to several international destinations. Re-tog regional trains (stops at major stations within the Greater Copenhagen area) connect the main parts of Zealand to the capital. Intercity trains run half-hourly from Copenhagen during daytime and serve as a link between the major cities and towns in Denmark, including Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, Esbjerg, Randers, Kolding, Horsens, and Roskilde - the 10 biggest cities outside Copenhagen. Direct international trains connect to Stockholm, Hamburg and Berlin several times a day, and a EuroNight train served destinations as far as Prague, Amsterdam and Basel, but closed in November, 2014. Trains to southern and western Sweden depart every 20 minutes. (A special ticket fare system exists between the Copenhagen local traffic area and the most southern part of Sweden, Skåne county.) =Tickets= There are 193 rail stations where most of them have connecting bus services. This link shows all lines, stations and fare zones. The Copenhagen local traffic area is divided in 95 zones. Zones 1, 2 and 3 make up the city core of Copenhagen. The same ticket is valid for travel on bus, train, and metro networks. Ticket machines are installed at all stations, and tickets can also be bought on buses and at ticket counters located at major stations. A ticket price inside the Copenhagen local traffic area is distance-dependent and always between two and nine zones (a nine zone ticket goes for all zones). The fine for not having a valid ticket is 750DKK. Rejsekortet (lit. \\"the travel card\\") is an electronic ticket system for Danish public transport. The system is a collaborative work between DSB, HUR, Ørestadsselskabet, and various regional bus companies. It is similar to the Oyster card used in Greater London in England. The system will replace the current zone ticket system. Instead, fares will be calculated from the distance made from the beginning of the journey to the end, as the crow flies, so as to give a better correlation between price and distance travelled.

Online user-friendliness and customer service have also taken criticism. =Airports= Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, the largest in Scandinavia Copenhagen Airport (), officially, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup (; ) is the main airport serving Copenhagen. It is the largest in Scandinavia and the 17th largest in Europe. Located in Kastrup on the island of Amager, it has efficient connections to downtown Copenhagen via metro and regional trains. Its location also makes it the most important international airport for large parts of southern Sweden. Copenhagen Airport is a major hub for SAS and Norwegian, and along with around 60 other airlines, it offers frequent flights to most major cities throughout Europe, as well as intercontinental flights to the United States, China, Thailand, northern Africa and United Arab Emirates. Roskilde Airport (), officially, Copenhagen Airport, Roskilde (); is located west of Copenhagen with two runways with ILS equipment. It is primarily used for general aviation traffic, flight schools, business jets and occasional charter flights, but can be used by medium jets - although not always at full take-off weight. Plans for expanding Roskilde Airport have been approved, making it more suitable for regular flights of medium jets, such as those operated by most low-cost airlines and charter operators. However, a lack of firm commitment from airlines has postponed the expansion indefinitely. A seaplane operates 4 times daily between Copenhagen harbour and Aarhus harbour. =Harbour= The Copenhagen container terminal Copenhagen has four lines of waterbuses, known as the Copenhagen Harbour Buses, serving ten water bus stops; four on the Amager-side and six on the Zealand-side of the harbour, from Sluseholmen in the South to Holmen in the North. Copenhagen is served by ferry lines to Oslo in Norway (called \\"Oslobåden\\") with a daily connection. There is a ferry from Køge to Bornholm or alternatively by train to Ystad with connection to fast ferry to Bornholm. The harbour of Copenhagen has largely lost its industrial importance. In 2001, Copenhagen Harbour as an organisation merged with the harbour in Malmö to create Copenhagen-Malmö Port. It has several functions, the most important being as a major cruise destination. In 2007 a record 286 cruise ships with 420,000 cruise passengers visited Copenhagen. 120 of these ships either started or ended the cruise in Copenhagen. In 2012 these numbers grew further to 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers. As a result of the growth in the cruise industry facilities are being expanded and improved. At the World Travel Awards in 2012, Copenhagen Port was once again named Europe's leading cruise port after receiving the award every year since 2008. =Intercity bus= Copenhagen does not have an intercity bus terminal. Most national and international buses that run through the central city have their main stop in Copenhagen at Ingerslevsgade, adjacent to the DGI-byen complex near Copenhagen Central Station. These include buses for Nettbuss express, Swebus Express, Flixbus and Eurolines.\\"Bus terminal Ingerslevsgade\\", VisitDenmark (accessed 2014-01-27).

It was established in 774, covering the islands that are now occupied by Venice. Throughout its existence there was tension between the diocese, the Patriarchate of Grado to which it was nominally subordinate, and the Doge of Venice. Eventually in 1451 the diocese and the patriarchate were merged to form the Archdiocese of Venice. History =Foundation= The diocese has its origins in the Patriarchate of Aquileia, founded during the Roman Empire. Hilarius of Panonia is recorded as bishop of Aquileia from about 276–285. As the empire fell into decline, Aquileia was sacked in turn by Visigoths (403), Huns (452) and Lombards (659). During these times of trouble some of the people would take refuge on the offshore islands. By 630 an independent Patriarch of Grado was established on the island of Grado. The islands of Venice had originally been subject to the Diocese of Padua. In 774 Pope Adrian I and John IV, Patriarch of Grado, authorized the establishment of an episcopal see on the island of Olivolo; the island is now called San Pietro di Castello. The bishopric was established in 774–775 by the Duke of Malamocco, who gave it his protection. Its cathedral was dedicated to Saint Peter. The Bishop of Olivolo was subordinate to Grado and had jurisdiction over the islands of Gemini, Rialto, Luprio and Dorsoduro, the main islands of the city of Venice. The bishopric, taken from the Diocese of Malamocco (Methamancus), formed a small new state, the nucleus of the state of Venice. =Olivolo= The first bishop was Obelerius. He was invested and enthroned by the doge, and consecrated by the Patriarch of Grado. In 798 the doge nominated Cristoforo as his successor. Giovanni, patriarch of Grado, refused to consecrate Cristoforo due to his youth. Giovanni was killed for his disobedience and his successor consecrated Cristoforo. From his name, which is Greek, Cristoforo may have been Byzantine. At that time Italy was the seen of a struggle between the Lombards and Byzantines, and many in Venice were loyal to Byzantium. The Franks rose to power in the last half of the 8th century, and in 800 Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Emperor. In 802 a faction that was friendly to the Franks came to power in Malamocco, and sent the Doges Giovanni and Maurizio II into exile, along with the bishop of Olivolo. In 810 a Byzantine fleet helped restore the party that favored Byzantium, and Angelo I Participazzo was made doge. An attempt by the Franks to conquer the Venetian Lagoon failed, and after long negotiations it was agreed that Venice fell in the Byzantine sphere, while Venetian merchants could trade throughout the western empire. The Doge made his seat on the island of Rialto, and with the surrounding islands including Olivolo the new state started to take the name of Venetiae. In the ninth century the relics of saints Sergios and Bacchus were placed in the cathedral at Olivolo by the pro-Greek faction. The church of San Pietro di Castello was built by Orso Participazio, the fourth bishop of Olivolo. It was burned down several times. In 828, the second year of the Doge Giustiniano Participazio, the Caliph had ordered that the Christian churches of Alexandria, Egypt, be pulled down so their marble columns could be used for his palace. The body of Saint Mark the Evangelist was smuggled out from the church of Saint Mark to Venice. To discourage the \\"Saracens\\" from examining the coffin, it was filled with pork. When the ship reached Olivolo island in Venice, the saint made signs that showed he did not want to be placed in the custody of the bishop. Instead, he was taken to the Doge's chapel, and planning began to create a magnificent new temple suitable for such important relics. The motives for the robbery of the saint's body were in part to establish the importance of the city of Venice, as opposed to the sees of Grado and Olivolo, relative to the patriarchate of Aquileia. In 853 Orso, bishop of Olivolo, left his property to his sister Romana, She was to guard it from future bishops who might not be worthy. He decreed that if his successor mismanaged the property of the diocese, after his death she should have the power to ordain the basilica of St. Laurence to whomever she chose. The new state fought off challenges from Croats, Saracens and Hungarians, and under Pietro II Candiano (932–939) began to expand on the mainland. Under Pietro IV Candiano (959–976) the Great Council of Venice appeared, a body that included the bishops of the Venetian territories and that approved all laws. The Latin cities of the Istrian and Dalmatian coast, threatened by Slavs, placed themselves under the authority of Venice, and the Byzantine emperor consented to the Doge assuming the title of Duke of Dalmatia. In 1001 the bishop Peter Martuseo, of the Quinta Bella family, built the church of San Agostino. In 1046 Bishop Domenico Gradenigo and Patriarch Orso Orscolo participated in the council of bishops in Saint Mark's called by the Doge Domenico Flabanico. The council made important decisions about organization and worship, including a decision that a priest could not be consecrated before the age of thirty, except in extraordinary circumstances. =Castello= In 1074, the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello. Enrico Contarini was the first to hold this title. He was the son of the Doge Domenico Contarini. In 1084 the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in his Golden Bull recognized the full independence of Venice, along with freedom from tributes, trade restrictions and customs duties. The Doge Vitale Michiel (1096–1112) held back from participating in the First Crusade until he saw the amount of loot that the Genoese and Pisans were bringing back from Palestine. In 1099 Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of the fleet of about 200 ships that Michiel sent to assist in the crusade in the Levant. The fleet sailed to Rhodes, where it wintered. The emperor of Byzantium asked the Venetians not to proceed, but the bishop overcame any who were inclined to listen to this request. In the spring of 1100 the fleet went on to Myra in Asia Minor, where they obtained the remains of Saint Nicholas, his uncle Nicholas and Saint Theodore the Martyr. They went on to the Holy Land, then returned to Venice, which they reached on 6 December 1100. With this acquisition, the Bishop obtained a patron saint to rival the Doge's Saint Mark. Bishop Giovanni Polani (1133–1164) was a kinsman of the Doge of Venice, Pietro Polani (r. 1130–1148). Polani became engaged in a dispute with Enrico Dandolo, the Patriarch of Grado. Eventually these clashes, which also involved the Doge, would culminate in the exile of the patriarch. In 1139, encouraged by Dandolo, the clergy of the ancient church of San Salvatore in central Venice decided to become canons regular under the rule of St. Augustine. Polani was furious at what he saw as an attempt to take this important parish away from his control, and placed it under interdict. In response, Dandolo placed it under his metropolitan protection. On 13 May 1141 Pope Innocent II lifted the interdict, placed San Salvatore under his personal protection and sent to canons to instruct the congregation in the rule. The Republic of Venice began its golden age under the Doge Enrico Dandolo (1192–1205). Under him the French crusading army was used to bring Trieste and Zara under Venetian sway, and then to obtain a large part of the Latin Empire of Constantinople along the east coast of the Adriatic, most of the Peloponnesus and settlements in the Sea of Marmora, the Black Sea and the Aegean. The relationship between the bishop, the patriarch and the doge was complex. The bishops of Olivolo, and then Castello, were technically suffragans of the Patriarch of Grado. From the middle of the 11th century the patriarchs took up residence for most of the time at San Silvestro, Venice, while the bishop was based at San Pietro on the east of the city. An important role was played by the primicerio, based in Saint Mark's, who represented the Doge and the city government. The primicerio invested the bishops, abbots and patriarchs. From the twelfth century the patriarch had a throne in Saint Mark's, which changed its role from the Doge's chapel to the state church. In 1225 the Bishop Marco II Michel gained the exemption of the clergy from lay jurisdiction except when real property was involved. In 1230 Michiel challenged the rights of the Doges over Saint Mark's. In an effort to standardize the rites and ceremonies, in the mid-13th century the Bishop Pietro Pino (1235–1255) made an Ordinary for the year's divine offices and holy ceremonies, with the concurrence of all the parish priests and the canons of San Pietro di Castello. This became the rule of the diocese from that date. Bishop Jacopo Albertini (1311–1329) supported Louis of Bavaria, whom he crowned as King of Italy in 1327, and was therefore deposed. Under Bishop Nicolo' Morosini (1336–1367) the dispute between the clergy and Government concerning the mortuary tithes was settled. This dispute flared up again under Bishop Paolo Foscari (1367–1375) and was ended only in 1376. During the Western Schism (1378 to 1418) Venice always adhered to the Roman claimant. Around 1418 Bishop Marco Lando (1417–1426) prescribed adoption of elements of the Roman Rite in conformity with Rome. On 8 October 1451 the diocese was suppressed and its territory transferred to the newly created Patriarchal See of Venezia, or Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice.\\"Translatio patriarchalis Ecclesiae Graden. ad civitatem Venetiarum, cum suppressione tituli eiusdem Ecclesiae Gradensis\\", in: Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio, vol. 5 (Turin: Franco et Dalmazzo, 1860), pp. 107–109.

Their eldest son, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães, was educated in two of the most exclusive schools in Brazil at that time, the Colégio do Santuário da Serra do Caraça (in the state of Minas Gerais) and the Colégio Pedro II (in the state of Rio de Janeiro), where he studied with some of the most prominent figures of Brazilian national politics, such as Joaquim Nabuco and Rodrigues Alves. However, after Francisco Carlos de Magalhães lost a considerable part of his wealth, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães had to move to Araraquara, São Paulo, in order to start working as a commercial representative. Colégio do Santuário da Serra do Caraça Once in Araraquara, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães married D. Leôncia de Freitas Magalhães, the daughter of Justino Correia de Freitas and Anna de Arruda, from the traditional Arruda family of Araraquara. Carlos Baptista de Magalhães became a very important land owner, banker, businessman and politician and, in partnership with the family of his wife, founded the Estrada de Ferro Araraquara (Araraquara Railway) in 1895, becoming its first president. He was also a town councilor and led a monarchial uprise in the region, known as Revolução do Sertãozinho (Sertãozinho Revolution). Nonetheless, a few years after he assumed the presidency of the Partido Republicano Paulista - PRP (Republican Party of São Paulo). Through his mother's family, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães is connected to the most traditional families of São Paulo, among which one can identify the Arrudas, the Laras, the Alvarengas, the Prados, the Taques, the Proenças, the Barros, the Pires, the Cubas and the Moraes de Antas.TOLEDO, Roberto Pompeu de, A Capital da Solidão: Uma história de São Paulo das origens a 1900, Editora Objetiva, 2003, Rio de Janeiro – RJ, Brasil These families, which rank among the first in Brazilian soil, descend from Portuguese gentry and are connected to the Portuguese, French, Aragonese, Castillan and Navarrese royal families. Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães had two sisters, Maria Dulce de Magalhães (Nicota), married to Valdomiro Pinto Alves, and Maria Elisa de Magalhães (Zilota), married to Sebastião Lebeis. Waldomiro was the son of Antonio Alves Pereira de Almeida and Gertrudes Eufrozina Pinto. Sebastião Lebeis (Rio Claro, 1874 – São Paulo 1936) was the son of Guilherme Lebeis and Escolástica de Arruda Botelho. = Lineage = Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães married Ernestina Reis de Magalhães (Rio de Janeiro, 1876 – São Paulo, 1968), the daughter of José Monteiro Reis and Adelaide Monteiro Palha, from Rio de Janeiro. They had eight children: Maria José (who died before she was one year old), Carlos (1903 – 1985), Oswaldo (19?? – 1974), Ernestina (1908–2000), Maria Cecilia (1911–1999), Paulo (1913 – 1996), Adelaide (1917) and José Carlos (1921–2002). Carlos Reis de Magalhães, Oswaldo Reis de Magalhães, Paulo Reis de Magalhães and José Carlos Reis de Magalhães were the managers of the Itaquerê Company, which had been founded by Nhonhô Magalhães and concentrated the majority of his estates. Beyond this occupation, Paulo Magalhães was the president of several national and multinational companies, such as Alpargatas, Philips and Rhodia (company) and José Carlos de Magalhães became a Brazilian ornithologist, whose researches were made at the Barreiro Rico Farm. Carlos married Marieta Lion and had two daughters. Oswaldo married Jandira Rondon and didn't have any child. Paulo married Marina Bastos and had five children. Ernestina married Roberto de Paiva Meira and had two children. Maria Cecilia married Antonio Ângelo Maria Duprat, viscount of Duprat, and had three children. Adelaide married Nestor Sacramento Rocha and had two daughters. José Carlos married Cecília Alves and had five children. In spite of being tightly connected to the countryside, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães bought a house in the early 1910s, located in Higienópolis (a wealthy neighborhood in São Paulo central area) and moved in with all his family. A few years later he decided to build a new house in the same avenue, but he died in 1931, before seeing the achievement of his last project. He was 56 years old when died of cancer.  Businesses  = Farms = Nhonhô started his professional life as a farm manager, helping his father with the administration of the family properties. When Carlos Leôncio was around twenty years old he started developing new farms in Matão, in order to sell them afterwards to foreign investors.  Cambuí Farm  The best investment of Nhonhô's life was the Cambuí (or Cambuhy) farm. In 1911 he bought a huge portion of land (around 605 square kilometers, or 233.6 square miles), an area in which are located today three towns (Matão, Nova Europa and Gavião Peixoto). In this estate, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães created the Companhia Agrícola e Pastoril d'Oeste de São Paulo - CIAPOSP, sold in 1924 to an English investment group for half a million pounds, or more than ten times what he had paid when he bought the farm. This was the highest value paid for any property in Brazil until then. This English group, called Brazilian Warrant Co, established the Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates Limited.CASALECCHI, José Ênio, Da Companhia Industrial, Agrícola e Pastoril D\`Oeste de São Paulo à Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates, 1976, Araraquara – SP, Brasil. The estate that had been sold to the English investment group was formed by 19 farms (Cambuí, Alabama, Boa Vista, Santa Josefa, Retiro, Palmas, Guanabara, Niterói, Água Sumida, São João, Flórida, Califórnia, Arizona, Contribuição, Mato Grosso, Barreiro, Virgínia, Tamandaré and Pedregulho), which had in total 3 million coffee trees and approximately 15 thousand cows. These farms were connected by 300 kilometers of roads and 70 kilometers of railways with ten railway stations (Toryba, Teixeira Leite, Cambuhy, Uparoba, Gavião Peixoto, Nova Paulicéia, Nova Europa, Matão, Ponte Alta e Santa Josefa). The Cambuí farm had more than 3 thousand employees and produced around 3,5 million kilos of coffee per year.CASALECCHI, José Ênio, Da Companhia Industrial, Agrícola e Pastoril D\`Oeste de São Paulo à Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates, 1976, Araraquara – SP, Brasil.  Itaquerê farm  Nhonhô kept a small (but yet considerable) part of the Cambuí farm, where he established the Itaquerê farm. The name of this estate comes from the Itaquerê river, which crosses the farm. The property had 21.5 square miles and it was built to be a model of diversified production, even if coffee continued to be its main output. Carlos Leôncio also built a sugar mill (which was operated by the Companhia Açucareira Itaquerê, today called Usina Santa Fé) and a small hydroelectric power plant. Both plants are still in operation and the power plant still uses all the original machinery from 1928. The Itaquerê farm was sold by Carlos Leôncio's heirs to the Malzoni family, which changed the name of the property to Santa Fé.  Barreiro Rico Farm  Another farm that belonged to Nhonhô was the Barreiro Rico, which was bought in 1926 and which is located in Anhembi, alongside the Tietê River. This farm of 74.75 square miles produced wood and bred nelore. The breeding of this type of cattle started in 1935, making the Barreiro Rico one of the first breeding farms still in activity in Brazil. At the beginning Nhonhô himself was the responsible for the management of the farm (from 1926 to 1931), but after that his sons Oswaldo (from 1931 to 1958) and José Carlos (from 1958 to 2001) administrated the estate.

P. Ragavesh. The film is based on South Korean film 4th Period Mystery released in 2009. The film stars G. V. Prakash Kumar and Sri Divya, with the former also composing the film's music. The film was released on 13 May 2016. Plot Shiva (G. V. Prakash Kumar) is the best student at his school. His rival Nithin (Shariq Hassan), the son of a leading film star and a spoiled brat, takes any and every opportunity to knock him down both verbally and physically, and the two are known enemies amongst the other students. One day, Nithin burns Shiva's thesis, and when Shiva finds out, he assaults Nithin in front of the whole school until the school management intervenes. Later, Shiva returns to his class to fight Nithin once again, but this time he finds him dead, with his neck stabbed repeatedly with a sharp pencil. Shiva removes the bloody pencil from Nithin's neck just as his classmate and love interest, Maya Srinivasan (Sri Divya) shows up, catching him in a most incriminating position. Fortunately for him, she not only believes his innocence, but also offers to help him to solve the mystery and catch the real killer – a task made particularly urgent by the fact that in 40 minutes, the rest of the class will return and the body will be discovered. The suspects are many: the school driver with whom Nithin has a fight over an open wall behind the school; a local goon who enters the school through the open wall to meet his girlfriend, only to be driven out by Nithin; the chemistry teacher Sridhar (Thirumurugan), whose romantic relationship with his colleague Nandhini (Suja Varunee) ends after Nithin secretly records an intimate video of the two and blackmails Nandhini with that video to do what he says; and Nithin's ex-girlfriend Indhulekha (Shamily Sukumar), whose 8-year-old friend Divya is accidentally killed by Nithin when she tries to break up with him and is constantly harassed and blackmailed by Nithin not to report to the school management or the police about the murder. In the end, Maya and Shiva catch the real killer, who is also a staff at the school and father of Divya. It is also shown that Maya and Shiva are united.  Cast  * G. V.

The film features newcomers Chandran, Anandhi and Vincent in the lead roles, while D. Imman composed the film's music. The film, set against the backdrop of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, released on 25 December 2014. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Tholi Premalo in 2016. Plot The story revolves around two friends who work hard, and spend their money travelling around the country. On one such trip, they accidentally help a pair of lovers elope, without realising it. The family of the eloped young lady get angry, and suspect them of being friends of the eloped young man. They take the two friends home, and try to beat them to get the truth out them. One of the two friends falls for a girl named Kayal, who is working in the house, and he speaks of his love in front of everyone. After the eloped young lady is brought home, and it is proven that the two friends were not involved in planning the elopement, they are allowed to go.

He gathered real-life stories of survival and intertwined them into his script. The film was announced at a launch event at Leela Palace on 11 September 2013 with Prabhu Solomon announcing a fresh cast while revealing D. Imman would be composer and a debutant Vetrivel Mahendran would be cinematographer. Chandran was cast after sending his pictures to Prabhu Solomon, unaware if it was for the lead role. He got a reply the following day confirming he would be the lead actor, and subsequently lost fifteen kilograms to fit the character. Telugu actress Rakshita was rechristened as Anandhi for the film, and was selected after auditioning twice before impressing Solomon. The shoot of the film commenced in Ponneri in September 2013 and the team announced that scenes would be shot all across India including scenes at Kanyakumari and Ladakh. Scenes were shot for several days underwater, with the team often doing up to ten hours a day in knee-length depths of water. The film completed shoot after 85 days in May 2014, with the director announcing that post-production would be extensive as a result of impending VFX works. After filming finished, Prabhu Solomon revealed that the film's climax would show the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and noted that the film would be dedicated to victim's families. During the music release of the film in November 2014, Prabhu Solomon revealed more details about the production of the film. He noted that the climax was shot first to ensure graphic works depicting the tsunami could have as much time spent on it as possible. He went on to add that it was his costliest production till date and the film was made at a cost of 15 crore, with the special effects, notably the use of 7.1 Atmos mix for the climax, being particularly expensive. Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Thamizh. =Critical reception= The film opened on 25 December 2014 to critical acclaim and won positive reviews. Rediff gave 3 stars out of 5, calling Kayal \\"a sweet and endearing tale of love with characters that touch your heart, haunting locales, beautiful music and emotions that are simple and true. A thoughtfully-written script packed with honest emotions, plenty of humour, potent dialogues and excellent performances make Kayal worth a watch\\". Sify called the film a \\"feel-good love story\\" and went on to add that it has \\"some terrific visuals, great music and stunning climax. Prabhu Solomon has delivered an irresistible love story between an innocent girl and a free spirited young man set against the backdrop of Tsunami\\". The Hindu's Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"The central emotion..., the great love between Aaron and Kayal, is too wispy to warrant all this drama, which is constantly underlined by a score that just won’t stop. We’re meant to feel their pain, their pining, but all we feel is the film straining to be an epic\\". The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"The first half of Kayal has some of the better aspects you find in a Prabu Solomon film...However, the director's bad habits start creeping in midway into the film and things start getting implausible and heavy-handed\\", going on to state that \\"the use of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which is the backdrop the director has chosen to tell this story, feels exploitative as the tragedy that followed hardly registers on screen\\". Indiaglitz.com, while giving it also 3 out of 5, wrote, \\"the movie got loads of positives and it is watchable for sure, but it also makes the viewer think, how long will Prabhu Solomon takes the same route to achieve success?\\" Cinemalead rated a 3.5 out of 5 and reviewed,\\" Kayal is a technically well-made film, which was equally backed up by some awesome performances. A hat trick for Prabhu Solomon.\\" Soundtrack The film's music was composed by D. Imman, who collaborated with Prabhu Solomon following previous successful albums in Mynaa (2010) and Kumki (2012). The audio was launched on 13 November 2014 at Sathyam Cinemas with the principal cast and crew in attendance, alongside special guests Arya, Sivakarthikeyan, Amala Paul and Anjali. The album opened to positive reviews from critics, with Behindwoods.com stating that the \\"Imman — Prabhu combo strikes gold yet again\\", while acknowledging that \\"expectations were high\\".

Enrolling for Civil War military service, he mustered in on April 26 as a private with Company G of the 7th New York Militia. After honorably completing his Three Months' Service, he mustered out with his unit on June 3.

On January 28, he was advanced to the rank of sergeant. Serving initially as part of the brigade led by Brigadier-General Daniel Sickles, which was part of the division commanded by Brigadier-General Joseph Hooker, he and his regiment were reassigned to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division of the U.S. Army's III Corps in March, and ordered to duties associated with the Siege of Yorktown.

History The Wołodkowicz (Wolodkowicz) family is an ancient noble family originating from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Scholars argue whether the family name derives from Wolodko (born 1420), grandson of Gedymin Grand Duke of Lithuania (1275-1341) or from his descendant Grand Duke Wolodko. Marcin Wołodkowicz (1510-1595), the son of Wolodko and his wife Racza, is the common ancestor of all members of the Wołodkowicz family. He was ambassador of the Great Duchy of Lithuania in Moscow from 1573 and Governor of Minsk from 1588. He was married with Rajna princess Drucka-Horska. Marcin Wołodkowicz had eight children, most of which had high positions in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As a result, thereof the family became far more numerous in the 17th century; its members mainly residing in the districts of Nowogródek and Minsk. During the 17th and 18th centuries members of the Wołodkowicz family played an important role in public life. Apart from political and governmental positions, members of the Wołodkowicz family held positions in the army and in the Roman Catholic church. Stanislaw Wołodkowicz played an important role in the defense of Vitebsk during the war between the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth and Moscow. He was taken prisoner and sent into exile to Kazan in 1655. The founder of the French line of the Wołodkowicz family, Henry (1765-1825), took part in the 1794 uprising of Tadeusz Kościuszko and emigrated to France. He was aide-de-camp of Napoleon, served as a general in the French army and from 1806 he was appointed commander of the Polish Legion of the Grande Armée. During the Napoleonic war against Russia, he was exiled to Siberia and after having received amnesty, he moved to St. Petersburg where he died. He was awarded the Légion d'honneur and his name 'Henry' is immortalized in the Triumphal Arc in Paris. Alexander Wołodkowicz (1806-1861) headed the rebels in the Vileika district during the uprising against Russia of 1830–1831. After the defeat he emigrated to France. He was buried in Paris, but his heart was brought home and placed in the church of Radoszkowice, the ancestral tomb of the Wołodkowicz family. Jakub Wołodkowicz was rector of the Jesuit collegium in Polotsk, Anna abbess of the Benedictine monastery in Minsk and Felicjan (1697-1778) Metropolitan of Kiev. Members of the Wołodkowicz family founded several monasteries and churches, such as a monastery and a seven domed church in Grozovo, a monastery in Nowodwortsi, the Carmelite church in Minsk, the cathedral of Chelm, a church in Zary, a church in Radoszkowice and a Russian-orthodox church in Chashniki. There are several branches of the Wołodkowicz family: *\\"Gałąź Nowodworska\\" (Branch of Nowy Dwor) *\\"Gałąź Iwanska\\" (Branch of Iwansk) *\\"Gałąź Francuska\\" (French branch), After a failed third petition in 1903 to Nicholas II to regain lost lands in Belarus, Nicholas II regranted the title of prince from which they had been stripped, due to the implication of general Henry Wołodkowicz in the 1794 uprising. With the exception that the title of prince may also be inherited through the female descendents, which resulted in the fusion of the names Pairier and Wolodkowicz to Pairier de Wolodkowicz. Furthermore, the French line also has the right to retain the title of Count granted to General Henri Wolodkowicz by Napoleon I.Autobiographic Novel, \\"Printemps gris\\" ,written by Willy de Spens d´Estignols, Edtitions de la table ronde 1974 *\\"Gałąź Ukrainska\\" (Ukrainian branch) *\\"Gałąź Galucyska (Galician branch) Many members of princely and other great aristocratic Polish and Russian families have members of the Wołodkowicz family as one of their ancestors, such as Drucki- Horski, Drucki-Podbereski, Pac, Podhorski, Polubinski, Puzyna, Reytan, Radziwill, Sapieha and Tyszkiewicz. In the 19th century the branch of Iwansk became the most prominent of all branches of the Wołodkowicz family. Iwansk together with neighboring villages was bought by Tadeusz Wołodkowicz in 1774. This was to become the main, though not the oldest, domain of this branch of the family. Owing to entrepreneurship and fortune the wealth of the Iwansk branch further increased during the next generations. Two years later Iwansk was inherited by his brother Wincenty (1761-1838) chamberlain of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, who passed his properties to Emanuel Ignacy. Last owner of Iwansk was the son of Emanuel Ignacy, Wincenty Wołodkowicz (1846-1927). In 1917 his estates (Iwansk, Kopciowicze, Czaszniki, Solomerecze, Wojsznarowo, Podolanka, Stare Siolo, Krasne Siolo, Imszarki, Slobodka, Hatsyanava, Fedzki, Tovpentsy, Naviny, Vishanki, Pachaevici, Demidovichi, Prystoi, Medvedsk, Krasnitsa, Punki, Smolance and Deksniany) made about 100.000 hectares, and included more than 20 towns and villages, as well as a paper mill ('Skinia'), mills, distillery plants, breweries, a brickyard and a glass factory. Iwansk had a famous stable of horses, which won prizes at races in Moscow and St. Petersburg. During the revolution of 1917 Wincenty Wołodkowicz escaped to Poland, where he died in Bydgoszcz in 1927. Coat of arms The Wołodkowicz family uses the \\"Radwan\\" arms, with on top a dove holding a golden ring.

Life The son of George Owen of Henllys, by his second wife, he was conceived out of wedlock, and born at Henllys in Pembrokeshire. He was appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant in place of John Bradshaw on 28 February 1626, and was promoted to the post of York herald by signet in December 1633, and by patent 3 January following. Owen attended the Earl of Arundel in the First Bishops' War of 1639, and, according to Anthony Wood, was despatched on a mission in the king's service to Wales in following year. He was with the retinue of Charles I at Oxford in 1643, where, on 12 April, he was created D.C.L., and he subsequently accompanied the king when the royal forces moved to invest Gloucester on 10 August. At some point after early 1645, Owen was asked to act as deputy to the Clarenceux King of Arms, William Le Neve, who had been sent abroad. Owen then went over to the parliamentary side, being confirmed as York herald. Officiating at events of the new regime, he was nominated successive as Clarenceux and Norroy King of Arms; but was on bad terms with Sir Edward Bysshe, the Garter King of Arms. In 1660 Owen was reappointed York herald, and held the office until he resigned it in 1663, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law, John Wingfield. With Elias Ashmole, he directed the funeral in London of Bryan Walton, on 5 December 1661. He died in Pembrokeshire 13 May 1665. Works Owen has been widely confused with his father, and with George ap Owen ap Harry, called George Owen Harry. Owen's own heraldic work includes his grant of a coat-of-arms in 1654 to Colonel Philip Jones, now preserved at Fonmon Castle, Glamorganshire, and the illuminated \\"Golden Grove Pedigree Parchment Roll\\", dated 1641, of the pedigree of the Vaughans, Earls of Carbery.

They released their debut album Letherette through their current label Ninja Tune in 2013, and have previously released material on Ho Tep Records. History Friends from childhood, they grew up together in Wolverhampton, UK, where they are still based. The name of the act was originally the name of an old track by Andy, which the pair thought suited their music. They first came to note when they remixed Bibio's 'Lover's Carvings' for his album The Apple and the Tooth, released on Warp in 2009. Subsequently, they released two EPs on Eglo Records subsidiary Ho Tep. The pair provided a mixtape for BTS radio in 2010 which showcased some of their influences alongside a number of their own tracks. It became one of the most talked about and downloaded guest mixes of BTS radio that year. In 2012, they contributed a remix to the vinyl version of Bonobo's Black Sands Remixed album, and in the same year were signed by Ninja Tune Records. Their music has been played on BBC Radio 1 by Benji B and BBC Radio 6 Music by Lauren Laverne and Tom Ravenscroft. Style Letherette's musical style often draws comparisons to Hip Hop artists (such as Madlib, J Dilla and MF Doom) and French House acts (like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe and Breakbot). Their musical production involves heavy use of sampling but also incorporates live instrumentation ranging from \\"guitars to synthesisers and various percussion instruments\\". In an interview with DJ Magazine they talk extensively about their use of sampling, including the comment \\"we've always loved the idea that you can take the naffest track imaginable [and] sample certain parts to transform it into something you think is amazing. It's like you uncover a secret, in a way. The track was always there within the details of the record, and you unlock it with sampling.\\". The pairs music is often described as playful and fun, with Souncrash stating \\"Fun is what sets Letherette apart\\", and Dazed & Confused saying that they \\"bound between sounds characteristic of Warp and Roule but do so with a metaphorical piña colada in their hands\\". Live Describing their live-set in an Interview with The Independent they said \\"We use laptops with a couple of midi-controllers and a mixer. We just play, remix and rework tracks live. We take existing tracks and break them all down to their separate parts, then just semi improvise ways to play them with added effects and whatever else we decide to use on the night.\\". They have supported Clark and Bibio, and performed with Bonobo, Gold Panda, Nosaj Thing, Illum Sphere and FaltyDL. As of 2013 they have being collaborating with Clayton Welham to create an immersive visual show. Festival appearances have included MUTEK Montreal, the Bonobo Roundhouse Festival and Soundwave Croatia. They have also made two Boiler Room appearances. Discography =Album= Letherette The pair released its debut full-length album on Ninja Tune on 15 April 2013.

It is a non-selective school in an area with selective schools, so the students enter the school with lower previous achievement than average. Most are White British with a below-average proportion of students are from minority ethnic groups. The proportion of students who receive support through the pupil premium is higher than average, and about a quarter of Year 7 students receive catch-up funding for students who failed to attain the nationally expected level in English or mathematics at the end of Key Stage 2. The school has a specially resourced unit, the Tydeman Centre, for 90 students who have statements of special educational needs for speech, language and communication needs.

Their work has been mired in allegations of sexual abuse and workplace harassment. Based in Toronto, ASL19 was founded in 2012 with the support of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Since the arrest of ASL19's director and documentation of the organisation's workplace abuse in 2017, the University of Toronto has sought to distance themselves from the organisation. In a November 2017 statement to Toronto's Metro News a university spokeswoman stated: \\"ASL19 has collaborated with Citizen Lab on research projects in the past and allowed its staff, including Karimzadeh Bangi, to make use of its facilities in 2012-14. Citizen Lab has not recently engaged in any such efforts with either ASL19 or Mr. Bangi. ASL19 is a completely separate and distinct organization.\\"  Controversy  = Workplace Abuse and Arrest of Director= In November 2017 the arrest of ASL19's founder and director Ali Karimzadeh Bangi on charges of sexual assault and forcible confinement came to light. Shortly afterwards it was announced Bangi had stepped down from ASL19. The organisation has attempted to distance themselves from Bangi, alleging his abusive behaviour was not replicated in the workplace and the rest of the organisation's leadership were unaware. An in-depth investigation by The Verge and an open letter from former female employees who documented workplace abuse and harassment proved the abuse and mismanagement went beyond Bangi. Testimonies and a freedom of information request from Ontario courts proved that allegations of abuse and sexual assault by Bangi within the workplace predated his 2017 arrest while other ASL19 managing staff were often complicit in covering up the abuse. In one case the organisation sought out a non- disclosure agreement as early as 2015 to cover up allegations of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace. Digital rights organisation Access Now terminated their partnership with ASL19 for their RightsCon summit series in December 2017. Access Now stated they will only reengage with ASL19 once they \\"feel confident that any reports of misconduct have been investigated and there has been an appropriate response.\\" The Rights Con code of conduct team has yet to change this policy.

The Liberal vote was split as their candidate, Christopher Palles, was considered by Catholics as a \\"priest- hunter\\" for his prosecution of clergy as Attorney-General and denounced by Protestants for his views on education along denominational lines. The election was won by the Irish Conservative Party's Charles Lewis who secured a 174-vote majority. The election was the first Irish election to the British Parliament to be held by secret ballot.  Background  Richard Dowse was a Liberal Party politician who was first elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for the Londonderry City constituency at the 17 November 1868 general election. A lawyer, Dowse had been appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in February 1870, an appointment that, under the law of the time, triggered a ministerial by-election. Dowse stood in the by-election of 15 February and received 680 votes, defeating a challenge from Robert Baxter of the Irish Conservative Party, who received 592. This was considered unusual in a time when such by-elections were becoming increasingly uncontested. Dowse later became Attorney-General for Ireland and on 1 November 1872 Dowse was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer, necessitating his resignation from the House of Commons. A by-election was held on 27 November 1872 to select a new member.  Candidates  Christopher Palles, pictured later in his career Joseph Biggar The Liberal Party selected Christopher Palles, who had succeeded Dowse as Attorney-General, as their candidate. Palles had previously served as Solicitor-General for Ireland, in which role he had prosecuted Catholic clergy; this upset some of his fellow Catholics who decried him as a \\"priest- hunter\\" and a \\"government hack\\". He also upset many Presbyterians (Protestants) with his support for segregation of education along denominational lines. The Ballymoney Free Press considered that the Liberal Party made a mistake in selecting Palles. The Irish Conservative Party characterised him as the candidate of Irish Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Paul Cullen. Palles eventually received the support of Francis Kelly, the Bishop of Derry, though the church initially chose to remain impartial in the by- election. The Irish Conservative Party's candidates were Charles Lewis and Bartholomew McCorkell. Lewis had been nominated first and as a Presbyterian solicitor had been selected to capitalise on the conflict within the Liberal Party on the education issue. The local association disagreed with the decision of the Conservative Central Office to select Lewis and chose McCorkell, a local merchant, as their candidate. The Home Rule League put up Joseph Biggar as their candidate. It was clear that Biggar had little chance of winning the seat, but his candidature threatened to further split the Catholic Liberal vote.  Results  The election seems to have been fought largely on the issue of education. The election was the first parliamentary election in Ireland to be held as a secret ballot, introduced by the Ballot Act 1872. Lewis won the seat for the Conservatives, overturning the 88-seat majority won by Dowse in 1870. Lewis secured 696 votes, Palles 522, Biggar 89, and McCorkall 2. The result was regarded as a major setback for the Liberals in Ulster, who were reduced to two members in that province. It showed evidence that the party was liable to split in areas where Protestants felt their interests were at risk, with some voting with the Conservatives. The failure of Biggar to make an impact is considered evidence that, despite the fears of some contemporaries, so-called Fenian flying columns of voters had little effect.

It was the first UK Parliamentary election that was held by secret ballot held shortly after the Ballot Act of 1872 ended the old practice of open voting had come into effect. There was considerable interest in the outcome, many observers believed that support for the rival politicians may be drastically different as voters were able to make their choice in secret. However, the election results were reflective of the political preference of the constituency prior to the Ballot Act. One of the main arguments made in support of voting by ballot was that it would put a stop to the riots and disorders so prevalent at previous elections. The Pontefract election conclusively proved that secret voting reduced riotous behaviour. Hugh Childers was re-elected on 15 August 1872 following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

The byelection was held due to the resignation of the incumbent MP of the Liberal Party, William Henry Gregory, as he became Governor of Ceylon. It was won by the Home Rule candidate John Philip Nolan but this was overturned on petition.http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm Nolan beat his opponent, William Le Poer Trench, the third son of the Earl of Clancarty, winning by a large majority. Of the 4,686 available electors, who were chiefly Catholic, 2,823 voted for Nolan and 658 for Le Poer Trench. Le Poer Trench appealed the result, claiming on petition that there was widespread intimidation during the election campaign. The local Catholic bishops and clergy had strongly supported Nolan, chiefly because the Clancartys were active in proselytism. The trial of the Galway County election petition was held before Judge William Keogh, a Catholic and former MP for the pro Home-Rule Independent Irish Party. The trial started on 1 April and ended on 21 May 1872. Keogh found that Nolan had been elected by the undue influence and intimidation. In his report stated that he found 36 persons guilty of undue influence and intimidation, including the Archbishop John MacHale, the Archbishop of Tuam, the Bishop of Clonfert, Patrick Duggan, and the Bishop of Galway, John McEvilly, and twenty-nine named priests, the majority of Catholic parish priests in the constituency. They were held to have used all influence to overthrow all free will. A special case decided that notices put up by Le Poer Trench alerting voters to Nolan's previous involvement in treating were sufficient to inform voters that he was disqualified. The findings were that there was an undue election as there had been treating, undue influence and that the candidate was disqualified as he had previously been guilty of corrupt practices. As a result, Captain Nolan was unseated on 13 June, the seat going to Captain Le Poer Trench.2 O'M & H 46; HCP 1872 268 p. 20-85 The judgement caused an uproar; the judge was threatened with removal from the bench and his reputation never recovered. Nolan retook the seat at the 1874 election. He remained MP after the 1885 constituency reforms as MP for Galway North until 1895.

Chrysosporium keratinophilum is one of the more commonly occurring species of the genus Chrysosporium in nature. It is easily detected due to its characteristic \\"light-bulb\\" shape and flat base. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is most commonly found in keratin- rich, dead materials such as feathers, skin scales, hair, and hooves. Although not identified as pathogenic, it is a regular contaminant of cutaneous specimens which leads to the common misinterpretation that this fungus is pathogenic. Description Chrysosporium keratinophilum colonies grow rapidly at 25 °C approximately 60–100 mm in 21 days. Colonies can be flat or folded, dry, powdery, or velvety with a white- or cream-coloured center The colony surface is dotted with droplets of clear or brown exuded liquid. The hyphae are septate and the conidia are hyaline, broad-based and one-celled. The conidia are large, smooth to slightly rough-walled, sometimes slightly curved and occasionally septate. The conidia are broadly \\"light-bulb\\" shaped with an abruptly flattened smooth base. Colonies grow to about 30 mm in diameter in one week and are flat with a powdery to suede-like texture. The colony reverse is also cream-coloured. Chrysosporium keratinophilum produces abundant aleurioconidia that resemble the microconidia of dermatophytes; however, the conidia of C. keratinophilum are considerably larger. Chrysosporium keratinophilum has been associated with two closely related sexual states: Aphanoascus keratinophilus and Aphanoascus fulvescens. Habitat and distribution Chrysosporium keratinophilum is often referred to as a keratinophilic fungus in reference to its affinity for growth on keratin-rich non-living materials such as skin scales and hairs separated from the host. Chrysosporium keratinophilum produces a keratin-degrading enzyme that functions at 90 °C. Its process of digestion occurs in two stages, requiring keratin to be chemically altered to a structureless form before it is digested. The method of hair digestion is carried out with perforating bodies. Chrysosporium spp. are asexual states of fungi in the genera Aphanoascus, Nannizziopsis, and Uncinocarpus. The fungus commonly grows on feathers, hooves, hair and other dead matter. It is rarely found on human skin and more commonly found in soil in temperate areas, plant material, dung and on birds. A study on keratinophylic fungi in the water sediments of India, by Katiyar and Kushwaha, found C. keratinophilum in sediments of catch basins and sewage sludge in India and Poland. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is associated to mud sludge structure, high humidity, volatile solids, low carbon nitrogen ratios and tolerance to heavy metals. Together, these give C. keratinophilum a high long-term survival probability in superficial water which may present an exposure risk, especially to people in India who bathe in these waters. Apart from inhabiting water sediments, a study in Egypt identified and isolated the teleomorph of C. keratinophilium, Aphanoascus fulvescens, in half of samples gathered from floor dusts in university student housing, demonstrating its regularity in indoor environments. Similarly, Bahkali and Parvez found C. keratinophilum to be widespread mold in house dust from homes in Saudi Arabia. In a study of 29 sandpits from kindergarten schools and public parks in the West Bank of Jordan, Shtayeh found that over half of the fungal isolates from these materials contained fungi known to cause disease. Amongst the non- pathogenic fungi found, Chrysosporium keratinophilum was the most common dermatophyte relative. A study looking at species diversity of keratin- degrading fungi in different soil types by Bohacz and Korniłłowicz-Kowalska, determined the most frequently isolated species was C. keratinophilum. Together with its teleomorph, Aphanoascus fulvescens, it constituted nearly half of all isolations. The frequency of this fungus was positively correlated with the content of humus, nitrogen, CaCO3 and phosphorus in the soils, and the fungus demonstrated high tolerance for pH (e.g., from pH 4.5–9.5). Chrysosporium keratinophilum accounted for nearly two thirds of isolations of keratinophilic fungi from phaeozem (the upper-layer, humus-rich soil horizon) and over half of keratinophilic fungi from cambisol. Increased populations of C. keratinophilum were found at higher pH. Isolation Generally, the hair- bait technique has been used to selectively isolate keratinophilic fungi from soil. However, because of the poor keratinolytic activity of Chrysosporium spp., some of these fungi are not adequately isolated from soils by using this conventional technique. Therefore, by utilizing the higher temperature tolerance of some Chrysosporium spp, a selective technique to isolate C. keratinophilum, C. indicum, and C. tropicum has been developed. By implementing a pre-incubation treatment of keratin baited soil samples at 38 °C, the fast-growing, competitive and thermosensitive strains are eliminated, thereby reducing the competition and allowing C. keratinophilum and other thermotolerant species to continue to grow. Antagonistic activity In a study by Singh an co-workers, eighteen fungi were isolated from soil and tested for their antagonistic interactions. The maximum inhibition of Microsporum equinum, M. fulvum, M. gypseum and M. racemosum was caused by multiple fungi, including C. keratinophilum. On the other hand, staling products of C. lucknowense accelerated the growth of many fungi, including C. keratinophilum. Another study tested C. keratinophilum for its anti- dermatophyte activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton flocossum. In their study, C. keratinophilum inhibited T. rubrum, T. tonsurans and T. mentagrophytes, but not M. gypseum and Microsporum nanum. Pathogenicity Members of the genus Chrysosporium have weak pathogenic potential, with human and animal infection reported for only a few taxa. Experimental studies have shown inoculation of this fungus on guinea pig skin to produce erythematous scaling lesions which disappear after 3–5 weeks; however, no apparent invasion of the hair shaft occurs. In white mice, after inoculation, granulomas with necrotic centers can be observed, although conidia of the fungus appear to remain intact. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is one of several soil organisms that is occasionally isolated from skin and nails. Isolation of this species from clinical specimens is generally from human onychomycoses, the mycotic superficial invasion of keratinized tissue of the nail plate. In practice, C. keratinophilum is interpreted to be an infrequent contaminant of keratinaceous clinical specimens, such as hair, skin and nails, with no clinical significance. A pathogenic role for C. keratinophilum is unlikely; however, its ability to remain viable for weeks on skin may suggest pathogenic potential. However, a critical component in limiting its pathogenic potential is its inability to grow at 37 °C, which is the human body temperature discouraging the possibility for this fungi to be infectious to humans. The first report of onychomycosis caused by C. keratinophilum in animals was reported by Pin and his colleagues. The seven Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus) they observed had swollen, abnormal claws from which Chrysosporium keratinophilum was repeatedly identified in culture, suggesting that the fungus may factor in disease. In another experimental study, C. keratinophilum showed pathogenic potential in the white mouse, remaining viable in the peritoneal cavity for up to two months. It is possible that C. keratinophilum can cause more generalized infections in a weakened mammalian host.  Biotechnological applications = Leather tanning = Chrysosporium keratinophilum produces a thermostable, keratinolytic alkaline protease when grown in medium containing keratin. When grown in a medium that lacked keratin, it had no enzymatic function indicating the inducibility of the enzyme. The keratinolytic protease had maximum activity at pH 9.0 and a temperature maximum of 90 °C, whereas many other fungi, such as T. mentagraphytes, Microsporum gypseum, T. rubrum, had maximum activity below pH 9.0. Alkaline proteolytic keratinases are important for leather tanning as a ready means of removing hair from hides. = Bioremediation = Waste removal from slaughterhouses is sometimes ploughed into nearby fields becoming a potential health risk since controlled keratin decomposition by anaerobic bacteria produces large quantities of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Current studies are demonstrating the usefulness of the proteases produced by C. keratinophilum in bioremediation of this keratinic waste. = Caffeine degradation = In another study comparing caffeine degradation by four different fungi, Nayak and her colleagues found that C, keratinophilum produces the highest rate of caffeine degradation both in the presence and absence of a nitrogen source. This finding suggests that C. keratinophilum may have commercial use for the decaffeination of coffee pulp, and in the process, it could provide nutrient supplement for animal feed or improved substrates for bioethanol production.

The tournament had previously been held annually since 1961, though only involving south-east Asian nations. It was New Zealand's first international tournament and it was to become Australia's first honour in international football. The Australian team toured south-east Asia before and after the tournament, winning all ten matches, and eight of the team went on to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, but their achievement in Saigon was largely overlooked back home. Matches at Cong Hoa Stadium and training at an army base adjacent to a minefield were conducted under armed guard, and the teams also trained on their hotel roof. The tournament was held during monsoon season and many matches were rainy and muddy. Attendance was around 20,000 - 40,000 per match. There was unrest at some matches involving Australia: tear gas was deployed for the semi-final against Malaysia and security had to break up a brawl between the teams and the team had rocks thrown at them after they beat the hosts; the vice-president of South Vietnam had promised his team a bonus at half-time to no avail. The final nearly did not take place after Australian military personnel were kept from being spectators until the team threatened a boycott. Despite the previous hostility, the local crowd supported Australia over South Korea in the final. The coach of the Australian team had agreed to let them keep their tracksuits if they won. The players complained about the food and conditions at their hotel, Caravelle Hotel also known as the Golden Building, where all the teams stayed, and one Australian player was non-fatally electrocuted by a power socket. There may have been a foiled plot to bomb the building. One of the New Zealand team fell ill and had to stay behind in hospital for three weeks when his team flew home.
