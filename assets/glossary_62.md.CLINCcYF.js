She was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1986, and a Doctor of Science degree by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1994. At the beginning of her career, Butovskaya undertook a study of the social ecology of non-human primates, as well as studies of children's social behavior. This work brought her widespread recognition. In the 1990s, Butovskaya undertook comparative field research across two cultural groups: Kalmyk people and Russian people, working in the areas around Moscow, in the Tula region, Elista, and the village of Iki-Chinos in Kalmykia. Her study examined how children were socialized with respect to aggressive and peacemaking behavior, by studying interactions between children at play outdoors. She stated based on her research that children were able to cope with conflict among adults by the age of 6‚Äì7. Butovskaya later moved to studying the anthropology of beggars in urban Russia, and eventually to a cross-cultural study of begging in Moscow, Prague, and Budapest. She is also studying the movement of urban pedestrians.

His post-mortem notes on Kalicho are unusually detailed for their time and provide insights into contemporary medical knowledge and the attitudes of the English towards indigenous people. Early life Dodding was born around 1540 in the historic county of Westmorland, England. He was educated at Trinity College, University of Cambridge, of which he became a fellow, and was awarded his BA in 1562 or 1563 and his MA in 1566. Career Dodding was granted a licence to practise physic by the University of Cambridge in 1573, and was created M.D. in 1576. In the following year he appears to have been in practice at Bristol. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians on 25 June 1584 and practiced medicine until his death in 1592.  Kalicho, Arnaq, and Nutaaq An anonymous 1578 illustration believed to show Kalicho (left), and Arnaq and Nutaaq (right) Martin Frobisher took three Inuit native Americans to England in 1577 after his second expedition to find the North West passage, a man, Kalicho, a woman, Arnaq, and Arnaq's son Nutaaq. All died soon after their arrival in Bristol in October 1577.A male had also been taken to England after Frobisher's first voyage making the number he took to England four.1906,0509.1.29. British Museum. Retrieved 28 November 2017.1906,0509.1.30. British Museum. Retrieved 28 November 2017. Kalicho and Arnaq may not have known each other before they were captured by Frobisher and the names used for them in England may not have been their real Inuit names. After Kalicho became unwell, Dodding initially advised bloodletting in order to quench \\"the fire of the inflammation\\" but this was refused by Kalicho. In the last hour of Kalicho's life, Dodding observed that his speech, appetite and pulse all declined but near the end he began to talk fairly lucidly again and sang a song that had been heard when he was first removed from Baffin Island. His last words were a phrase that he had learned in England, \\"God be with you\\" and then, on 7 November 1577, about one month after his arrival in England, he died. A post-mortem examination of Kalicho was performed by Dodding in Bristol on the day of Kalicho's death. He noted broken ribs which had not knitted together, lung injury and resulting putrefaction, all probably caused by the effects of Kalicho being thrown to the ground by a Cornish wrestler in the skirmish in which he was captured. His large stomach, as a consequence of being liberally fed, was attributed to \\"misguided kindness\\". Dodding also noted numerous indications of brain injury and in a departure from normal medical practice, commented on Kalicho's fear of the English which was hidden by his normally \\"cheerful features\\". The report, dated 8 November, described Alden T. Vaughan as \\"unusually complete\\", was written in Latin and translated into English three times. Dodding insisted that Arnaq watch Kalicho's burial at St Stephen's Church, Bristol, and she was shown recovered human bones to demonstrate to her that the English were not cannibals. Dodding was unsure how to interpret Arnaq's lack of reaction to Kalicho's body, attributing it to either extreme stoicism or simply indifference. Soon after, Arnaq too contracted a disease, probably measles, and died. On 12 November 1577, she was also buried at St Stephen's. A nurse was retained to take the infant Nutaaq to London to show to Queen Elizabeth but he died soon after arrival, probably also from measles, and before the Queen could see him. Dodding's notes, which have been corroborated from paintings of the captives and contemporary accounts, provide insights into medical knowledge and practice in the sixteenth century and the attitudes of the English to indigenous people, but his personal attitude to the three captives is unclear. He was well trained and does not appear to have been cruel or callous but after Kalicho died, he expressed regret not at the man's death, but at the loss for the second time of the opportunity for Queen Elizabeth to see the captured people. Death Dodding was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street, London, on 11 April 1592.Munk's Roll: Volume I: Edward Dodding. Lives of the Fellows, Royal College of Physicians.

Built in the mid-19th century, and extensively altered in 1896, it is a good local example of a period building with a Beaux Arts cast-iron facade. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Stackpole, Moore, and Tryon Building is located on the south side of Hartford's downtown area, at the southeast corner of Asylum Avenue and Trumbull Street. It is a timber-framed structure with a mainly brick exterior. It is covered by a flat roof with a projecting bracketed cornice, and has a rounded corner featuring curved windows. Most upper-floor windows are set in rectangular openings with brownstone sills and lintels, but a grouping of windows around the building corner have been replaced by a cast-iron facade with large picture windows. The ground-floor storefronts have largely been modernized, although elements of the cast-iron facade are also evident there. The building's exact construction date is unknown, but is believed to be mid-19th century. Its present appearance dates to a major renovation conducted in 1896 under the auspices of architect Isaac A. Allen Jr. The cast iron facade elements were provisioned at that time by the Phoenix Iron Works of Hartford, which also supplied elements for the Connecticut State House and buildings at Trinity College. The building was for many years home to a clothing retailer, known for most of the 20th century as Stackpole, Moore, and Tryon; it presently houses a bank on the ground floor. At the time of the building's listing on the National Register in 1978, it had been in continuous ownership by the same family for more than 120 years.

Built in 1858, it is one of the town's few surviving 19th-century district school buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Southwest District School is located in a rural-residential area of southwestern Bloomfield, on the east side of Simsbury Road (Connecticut Route 185) a short way south of its junction with High Hill Road. It is set close to the road on a very small parcel of land. It is a single-story stone structure, with a gabled roof. The stone appears to be locally quarried rock, cut in random sizes and shapes, with square-cut corner blocks. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with sandstone sills and lintels. The street-facing gable facade has two windows, while the south-facing facade has the entrance at the left end, and three windows to its right. The door opens into a small vestibule, which has had a closet partitioned off the far end, with the balance of the building occupied by the classroom. The vestibule is finished in tongue-and-groove wood boards, while the main chamber is plastered, with wide moulding. The school was built in 1858 by David Grant, who was listed in local census records as a farmer. The school was built to serve the predominantly rural agricultural families of the area, and remained in operation until 1922, when the town closed the last of its district schools. The school's stone construction was fairly typical of rural construction in the area, where a number of farmhouses were also built out of locally quarried materials.

History The Cotabato Regional and Medical Center was established in 1916 as the Cotabato Hospital which had a capacity of 12 beds in a house in the then municipality of Cotabato. The hospital was transferred to PC Hill and was funded by the Insular Government. On October 7, 1917, Dr. Vicente Kierulf became the head of the hospital. He was the first civilian District Health Officer of Cotabato province. The hospital gradually expanded its capacity to 150 beds. The hospital has been closed in 1942 after a series of burning and in 1944 when American Forces started bombing the town of Cotabato. In February 1973 Health Secretary Clemente Gatmaitan issued DOH-DO No. 60-B, s.1973 upgrading Cotabato Hospital to a 200 bed capacity facility and accredited it as a Tertiary, Teaching, and Training hospital. Gatmaitan approved the acquisition of a new site in 1975 which had an area of from the Canizares Estate. Construction of new buildings were started in 1980 and completed and occupied in November 3, 1983. By virtue of Republic Act 8316, the hospital was again upgraded into a 400-bed capacity medical center and named Cotabato Regional and Medical Center and was approved as Level IV Tertiary, Teaching, and Training hospital. Through the years the actual implementing be was 350 beds to 375 beds with the same budgetary allocation for 200 beds. In 1994, due to increasing demands in health services, the CRMC underwent health facility improvement with the construction of an annex where the emergency room, orthopedic ward, operating and recovery rooms, and delivery rooms are located. In 2010, the 25 bed Mental Health Unit Building for in-patient and out-patient mental health services was completed. Further health facility enhancement was accomplished by the construction of Oxygen Generating Plant and the DILANGALEN Cancer Care Center. The Emergency Room was expanded to 35-stretcher bed in 2011, with centralized air conditioning. In May 2014, the Sec. Enrique T. Ona Wing with 25 single (standard and suite) rooms and an elevator shaft was completed. With the AO 2012-0012 dated July 18, 2012 DOH new classification of hospitals and other health facilities in the Philippines, the Cotabato Regional and Medical Center is classified as a Level III Teaching and Training Hospital.

His existence is known from an inscription on a commemorative stele found in the grave area outside the Acharnian Gate in Classical Athens. Pythion's actions are significant within the context of the campaigns in 446 BC that marked the closing stages of the First Peloponnesian War , and the stele as an object in itself is significant. Stele The gravestone was found among in the necropolis outside the Acharnian Gate in Athens. It was defaced and re-purposed as building material in a modern building. A fragment from the left side broke off after antiquity and was rediscovered separately. It currently resides in the Epigraphical Museum. The text constitutes a mix of Attic and Doric word forms in Ionic lettering - it is in a non-stoichedon style. The content is composed in nine hexameters, each marked with a vertical stroke. The naming of the three Athenians tribes which Pythion saved is in prose. The original text of the inscription is published with translation, below, in R. Osborne and P. J. Rhodes Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC, Oxford University Press (2017). Translation \\"This is the memorial lying on the tomb of an excellent man, Pythion from Megara, who slew seven men and broke off seven spears in their bodies: he chose virtue and brought honour to his father among the people. This man, who saved three tribes of Athenians, bringing them from Pegae through Boeotia to Athens, brought honour to Andocides with two thousand captives (or slaves?). He harmed none of the men on earth, and went down to Hades blessed for all to see. These are the tribes: Pandionis, Cecropis, Antiochis.\\"Rhodes and Osborne, 2017, number 130, 169 Historical significance In Thucydides,Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.114.1-2 Euboea rose in revolt against the Athenians and Pericles took an army there to put it down. Megara revolted soon after and killed the Athenian garrison installed there after Megara appealed to them for help in a conflict against Corinth. Pericles was forced to return from Euboea when Attica was invaded soon after by a Peloponnesian force under Pleistoanax, an Agiad King of Sparta. The invading force stooped short of Athens, however, and returned after only reaching Eleusis. While Thucydides gives no historical account of a conflict referred to in the inscription, Diodorus Siculus mentions an Athenian force invading the Megarid and defeating the Megarians. The three tribes mentioned in the inscription were the force used in that campaign, led an unusual route to Athens via Boeotia in order to avoid Pleistoanax's invading force.Rhodes and Osborne, 2017, 170 Pagae was a harbour belonging to the Megarians in the Gulf of Corinth which Athens acquired under the agreement between the two poleis when they allied c. 461.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.103.4 The route that Pythion guided the Athens round, in order to avoid Pleistoanax's invading army, was via Aegosthena and Creusis - as discussed by N. G. L Hammond.N. G. L. Hammond, BSA 49 (1954), 113 These events formed part of the First Peloponnesian War, and are a stage in the decline of Athens' imperial ambitions in the Peloponnese. In the winter of 446 - 445 BC, soon after the events this inscription describes, Athens and Sparta (the latter the traditional ally of Megara) entered into the 'Thirty Years Peace' - a peace treaty that reassigned Megara to the Peloponnesian League and redistributed other contested areas to the Athenian and Spartan alliances. This inscription confirms Diodorus's account of a separate conflict between Athens and Megara, strengthening his historical legitimacy and weakening that of Thucydides, who leaves this expedition out. It shows, too, active Athenian action in the retention of territories gained peacefully through treaties. The Athenian Alliance was a body separate from the Delian League, an allied group of Greek-speaking states of mainly Ionic ethnicity which Athens controlled, and which Athens sought to bring Peloponnesian states into as part of a programme to expand and disrupt the Spartan hegemony of the Peloponnese. The Andocides mentioned in the inscription was the grandfather of the famous Athenian orator Andocides, and was instrumental in negotiating the Thirty Years Peace.Rhodes and Osborne, 2017, 170 The tribes of Pandionis, Kekropis and Antiochis are ordered in the inscription according to the regular order of the tribes (III, VII, X respectively).Rhodes and Osborne, 2017, 170 The weighted use of some tribes in individual conflicts, like in this case, made organisational sense but could lead to disproportionate losses for some tribes compared with the whole population of Attica. We do not know who Pythion of Megara was other than a citizen of Megara, and a saviour of three Athenian tribes. A birth date is impossible to discern, and his death could fall anywhere between 446 - 425 BC - based on the style of the lettering.Rhodes and Osborne, 2017, 170 That Pythion of Megara has a private gravestone referring to events in 446 BC is highly unusual. Private gravestones with epigrams before c. 430 BC were incredibly rare in Athens. That this stele was likely erected before 430-25 BC is significant, that it is composed of nine hexameters is more so, that it was erected for a foreigner is extraordinary. Whilst it was a private gravestone, it is suggestive of gratitude from the Athenians. The three tribes are named as the primary beneficiaries of Pythion's actions, but Athens as a whole is also an implicit beneficiary. Such an unusual gravestone confers a political meaning; perhaps in light of the Thirty Years Peace of 446-5 BC this stele was a symbol of Athenian influence and sympathy in the Peloponnese despite Sparta's hegemony there.

The 286th overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 29, 2017. The episode parodies sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States, the rise in Netflix original shows, and the threat of nuclear war. Plot A representative from Netflix speaks to Terrance and Phillip about creating a new series featuring them even though they are now both much older. At school, Cartman and Heidi Turner have a physical fight but when Kyle breaks them up he is teased by both Cartman and Heidi that he is acting like his mother, and they immediately reconcile. PC Principal holds an assembly about the bullying going on at school and introduces a new vice principal, Strong Woman. When PC Principal attempts to be assertive during Woman's speech to the assembly she asserts herself and stops Principal. At Kyle's house, everyone gathers to watch the New Terrance and Phillip Show on Netflix. Kyle starts to feel bad for the people being farted on in the show, but is dismissed by his friends, accusing him of mimicking his mother. Principal and Woman address the faculty and as Woman speaks, Principal envisions her with hearts floating around her while hearing \\"Hold My Hand\\". When the other faculty members also hear the music playing, Principal runs out of the room. After watching some Terrance and Phillip videos, Kyle goes home, removes a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt and cuts his hair. Principal sees a doctor about the music he is hearing after encountering Woman. The doctor suggests that Principal's mind makes the music because he is attracted to Woman, though he insists otherwise. Kyle visits Strong Woman in her office and wants to work with her to stop the violence he believes Canada is causing but she turns him down. When Principal asks Mr. Mackey about Strong Woman having a boyfriend, Mackey warns him about the consequences of a relationship at the workplace and decides to bring in someone from human resources to get Principal \\"back on track\\". Kyle has an interview on the news about his new group he has formed, \\"Millennials Against Canada\\" (M.A.C.), and has a debate with the Canadian Minister of Streaming who also accuses him of acting like a Jewish mother. Principal has a human resources person named Miss Heather Conduct, who resembles Mr. Mackey, address the faculty. Miss Conduct performs a role-playing session with Mr. Mackey during which they both express positive feelings towards each other. Kyle interrupts a taping of the Terrance and Phillip show with his group now wearing M.A.C. T-shirts similar to those worn by the Mothers Against Canada group in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The Prime Minister of Streaming visits President Garrison to complain about the millennials, but they get into an argument which makes Garrison decide to prepare for the worst. A military alert causes everyone at school to evacuate to the gymnasium while the National Guard surround the Terrance and Phillip studios where Kyle and his millennials are at, and Kyle asks Garrison to do something to stop what he sees as hate coming from Canada. As Principal and Woman evacuate the school, they simultaneously turn a doorknob together, touching each other's hand in the process, and the music now plays for both of them. Meanwhile, Garrison launches and detonates a nuclear bomb in Toronto, as Kyle watches the event live through the news in horror. Critical reception Dan Caffrey of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ rating, opening his review with the comment \\"Over the past year, South Park has often bitten off more than it can chew when it comes to current events. Tonight's episode takes on the fear of sexual harassment allegations in the workplace, Netflix's endless greenlighting of new series, the threat of nuclear war, and probably a few things I'm forgetting. And surprise, surprise, it's as unfocused and exhausting as it sounds.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.7 out of 10 rating, summarizing in his review \\"'Super Hard PCness' is definitely a case where the plot could have used a little more time to cook. The various plot threads in this episode don't come together as a cohesive whole. Even so, the pieces are generally entertaining enough on their own.\\" David Crow of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3 out of 5 stars rating, stating in his review \\"Overall, it's a fun episode that has a literally explosive finale, however it is on the whole akin to the opening self-deprecation. As with Terrance and Phillip farting on a cow, the show is really missing a step nowadays, and self-aware irony can only paper over this truth so much.\\" References External links *South Park Studios Episode 2109 \\"SUPER HARD PCness\\" Press Release * Canada‚ÄìUnited States relations in South Park Parodies of Donald Trump in South Park South Park (season 21) episodes Criticism of political correctness ","title":"Super Hard PCness"},{"id":"55902600","text":"Nancy Ellen Quinn (1919 ‚Äì June 2014) was an American public figure, former First Lady of Hawaii, and a prominent figure during Hawaii's transition to statehood. Quinn, the wife of Governor William F. Quinn, served as the last First Lady of the Territory of Hawaii from 1957 until 1959. She then served as the first First Lady of the new U.S. state of Hawaii from 1959 to 1962. According to Time Magazine, Nancy Quinn was the first person in the Territory of Hawaii to receive news that the bill granting Hawaiian statehood had been signed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1959. Biography Quinn was born Nancy Ellen Witbeck in 1919 in St. Louis, Missouri. She married her husband, William F. Quinn, on July 11, 1942, at a ceremony in St. Louis. The couple moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1947 when William Quinn, a lawyer, was offered a job at the Robertson, Castle & Anthony law firm; he was promoted to partner in 1950. The couple had seven children: five prior to becoming Governor in 1957 and two children while they were serving as the Governor and First Lady of Hawaii. William Quinn entered territorial politics during the 1950s. In August 1957, President Eisenhower appointed Quinn as Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, thereby making Nancy Quinn the first lady. The movement toward statehood continued to gather momentum under the Quinns. The Hawaii Admission Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1959 and signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower. Time Magazine reported that First Lady Nancy Quinn was the first person in Hawaii to receive news that President Eisenhower had signed the Admission Act into law. Nancy Quinn had received the radiogram announcing Hawaii's admission at the door of their official residence, Washington Place. She delivered the news to Governor Quinn, but not before her four-year-old daughter, Cecily, had opened the envelope. William Quinn won the 1959 Hawaiian gubernatorial election and Hawaii was admitted as the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Nancy Quinn became the first First Lady of Hawaii in the state's history. As the state and territorial first lady, Nancy Quinn balanced her official duties with raising their seven children, two of whom were born during her tenures as first lady. She lacked the budget for an social secretary for the first lady or a nurse for the children, which meant that Quinn had to organize the Governor's and First Lady's official events herself. Her work was chronicled in a biography of Governor Quinn called \\"No Ordinary Man,\\" which was authored by Mary C. Kahulumana Richards. The couple left office in 1962 following after Quinn lost re-election in the 1962 gubernatorial election. The former governor died in 2006 following complications from a fall after 64 years of marriage. Nancy Quinn remained an influential figure in Hawaiian political and civic life. In 2001, Quinn shared the Palaka Award with fellow former first ladies Jean Ariyoshi, Lynne Waihee, and Vicky Cayetano for service to Hawaii. In 2009, the state of Hawaii and the 50th Anniversary of Statehood Commission honored Quinn to mark the 50th anniversary of Hawaiian statehood. Nancy Quinn was named as one of Hawaii's \\"50 Voices of Statehood.\\" Other individuals honored alongside Quinn included U.S. Senators Daniel Akaka and Daniel Inouye, former Governor George Ariyoshi, Maui's first Mayor Elmer Cravalho, and then-Governor Linda Lingle. Nancy Quinn died in late June 2014 at the age of 95. She was survived by her seven children - Cecily Quinn Affleck, Mary Kaiulani Quinn, William Jr., Timothy, Christopher, Gregory, and Stephen; eight grandchildren; and nine great- grandchildren. She was buried beside her husband in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. An official memorial service was held in September 2014.

Ghanaian film posters, particularly hand-painted posters from the 1980s and 1990s, have become noted for their imaginative and unique artistry. They have been exhibited around the world in galleries and museums in Los Angeles, New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Chicago, and across Europe.  History  In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR, and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colorful hand-painted movie posters, often painted on recycled flour sacks. These poster paintings were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with commissioned artists and sign painters like Alex Boateng, Leonardo, Africatta, Muslim, Death is Wonder, Joe Mensah, D.A. Jasper, Stoger, Heavy J, Lawson Chindayen, Bright Obeng, Dan Nyenkumah, Sammy Mensah, and others, who crafted unique images to attract crowds into mobile cinema houses.Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpainted movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000. = Golden Age Ghanaian Movie Posters (mid 1980s-2000) = Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films or prefer to watch them at home, and with the arrival of digital print technology to Ghana around 2000, the hand- painted movie poster tradition forever changed. The time period from the mid 1980s to the late 1990s is therefore viewed as the Golden Age of Ghanaian Movie Posters when the tradition was its most robust and authentic . Most of the movie houses have had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, using printed ones instead. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left that still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like Paa Joe or Kudjoe Affutu in painting their figurative coffins, palanquins and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or LeonardoTschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Gen√®se de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier Pr√©Texte Neuch√¢tel, 2013, pp. 218-221. also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of contemporary African art where they are receiving more and more attention.Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang St√§bler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana. Ed. Heinrich-Barth-Gesellschaft, . = Contemporary and Commissioned Posters (2001-current) = After the year 2000 and the publication of Extreme Canvas, Ghanaian movie posters began to be exhibited worldwide as high art at galleries. At the same time, the mobile cinema business changed so that local audiences would more often watch movies at home and movie houses would use much cheaper mass-producible digital ads for movies. With the new international market for Ghanaian movie posters, some film poster painters continued to paint not for Ghanaian audiences, but for the international art market, while others retired from the tradition entirely. In the 2010s, there emerged a market for commissioned posters through the internet and social media, largely through the efforts of Deadly Prey Gallery in Chicago. Deadly Prey commissions posters requested by fans to be painted by artists in Ghana. Some of the commissioned artists are original artists of the tradition from before 2000, while others are newer to the genre. These newer posters have an increased emphasis on lurid, gory, and often comical representations of American cinema and TV, from Star Wars to Mrs. Doubtfire to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Contemporary commissioned posters often feature violence, dismemberment, and horror in movies in which these elements do not originally appear.  Stylistic Influences  = Origins as Sign Painters = The artists and sign painters looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable cotton canvas underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This tightly woven cloth adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints so that posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Mus√©e Dapper 2003, pp.353-379. = Coastal Style = By the coast in Accra, there emerged a more detail-driven style pioneered by Joe Mensah, Alex Boateng, Leonardo, Death is Wonder, and others. This style often highlights rippling musculature and clothing, as well as extravagant background images and explosions. = Kumasi Style = More inland, in the central region of Ghana, Kumasi, a separate hand-painted 'airbrush' style emerged. Practitioners of this style such as Africatta, Babs, and Kwaku painted lines and figures as if they were airbrush painted to emphasize more macro-size details.  Exhibitions  * 2012/13.

Fead House is a private house located at 5349 Washington Street in Lexington, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History John L. Fead was born in Bavaria, Germany in 1834. In 1852, he emigrated to America, and settled in Lexington, where an uncle had preceded him. Here he married Augusta Walthers, and settled in as a merchant. He eventually partnered with a local friend, Rudolph Andreae, to establish the first local woolen mill. By 1870, the pair had constructed a brick mill building in Lexington just south of the current location of the Fead House. Soon, Andreae sold his interest in the mill to Fead, and moved elsewhere. Over the next two decades, Lexington boomed with the growth of a shipping industry, both water-borne and overland when the railroad arrived in nearby Croswell, Michigan. By the early 1890s, Fead was wealth enough to build this large and fashionable house on the shore of Lake Huron. He lived here with his wife Augusta and their nine children. Description The house is a 2-1/2 story frame Queen Anne style house, covered with clapboard, with Eastlake detailing. The main facade has two major bays, the right one of which is narrower and recessed. The smaller bay contains a double entry door in a simple squared surround; the larger contains a bay window. A slant-roofed front porch, detailed with turned spindlework and crosswork, spans both bays. The second floor contains a similar bay window to that on the first floor, along with a double-hung sash. Another window is in the gable above. Board and batten siding is applied above the halfway point of the second floor windows. The side elevations each feature a prominent bay window, and one has a side porch similar in appearance to the main front porch. The rear features a single- story addition, original to the house.

She is remembered for her asymmetrical and figurative works. From the late 1960s, while working for Bing & Grondahl, she developed mass production models including jars and vases in abstract geometric shapes. In the early 1980s, she taught at the Jutland Art Academy. Biography Born on 5 May 1914 in Florence, Italy, Hedevig Elisabeth Birgitta Hesler was the daughter of Anne Gunhilde Andersen Hesler (1874‚Äì1946). Her mother travelled to Florence as she did not want to give birth in Denmark. Thanks to the influence of her uncles, the painter Gudmund Hentze (1875‚Äì1948) and the sculptor Svend Rathsack (1885‚Äì1941), she grew up in a cultural milieu. After completing her schooling, she studied ceramics at the School of Arts and Crafts, earning her diploma in 1935. The same year, she married the architect Hans Henrik Engqvist (1912‚Äì2003). She died on November 4, 1989, in Lyngby, Denmark. Engqvist initially worked for the potter Nathalie Krebs at her Saxbo stoneware workshop in Gladsaxe (1935‚Äì38). For the next ten years, she devoted herself to raising her three children, Lene Marie (1938) and the twins Anna Birgitte and Hedda Agnete (1943). In 1948, she established her own workshop in the family home in Lungby, soon becoming one of the more important potters in Denmark. She created both individual and mass-produced works, her creations often featuring the heads of birds or horses. She experimented with innovative glazing techniques, including Japanese raku traditions which she achieved in an over specially built on a farm in Hvalpsund in Himmerland where the family spend their holidays. After spending two more years with Nathalie Krebs (1952‚Äì54), she joined Bing & Gr√∏ndahl where she developed production models, creating bottles, jars and vases with off- white, orange and cobalt-blue patterns on a white background (1965‚Äì70). In the early 1980s, she taught at the Jutland Art Academy until she began to suffer from poor health. Engqvist exhibited widely in Denmark and abroad. A memorial exhibition was held in her honour at the Aarhus Art Academy in 1990. Lisa Engqvist died in Lyngby on 4 November 1989.

Life Harry Leslie Morris Hoffman was born in Cressona, Pennsylvania. He attended the Yale University School of Art (1893‚Äì97), studying with John Ferguson Weir. He was also a champion gymnast during his college years. He then moved to New York, where he continued his training at the Art Students' League with Frank DuMond. He also spent time in Paris studying at the Acad√©mie Julian. In the summer of 1902, Hoffman went to Old Lyme, Connecticut, to study at the Lyme Summer School of Art. Old Lyme was then a center of American Impressionism and known for its art colony. Three years later, Hoffman settled in Old Lyme, which remained his home until his death. He later helped to save Florence Griswold's house, which was a nucleus of the art colony, so that it could be converted into the Florence Griswold Museum. In 1910, he married fellow artist Beatrice Pope; they had one child. Hoffman often left New England in the winters, spending time in Georgia (1914, 1915) and the Bahamas (1916). In the early 1920s, he served as staff artist to the naturalist William Beebe on expeditions to the Galapagos Islands (1923), British Guiana, and Bermuda. Hoffman died at 92, the longest-lived of the Old Lyme colony of Impressionists. Art Early in his career, Hoffman focused on Impressionist landscapes, plein air figure studies, street scenes, and still lifes. His style was most strongly influenced by the work of fellow Old Lyme painter Willard Metcalf, though his color palette was brighter and his brushwork looser. After traveling to the Bahamas in 1916, he became interested in marine subjects and developed a special glass-bottomed bucket that allowed him to see potential underwater subjects more clearly. By the mid 1920s, he had developed a reputation for vividly colored underwater studies of fish and other marine life. Hoffman was a member of many art organizations, including the Salmagundi Club and the New York Watercolor Club. He was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1930. He won a gold medal at the Panama Pacific Exposition in 1915. His work is held by museums throughout the United States.

In the 1970s and 1980s, she was a pioneer in the field of categorical topology. Most of her work was published in Spanish, and her original contributions were not widely recognized until after her premature death. Personal Life Graciela Beatriz Salicrup L√≥pez was born in Mexico City on April 7, 1935. As a child, she attended Colegio Alem√°n, a German language primary school in Mexico City, followed by a religious secondary school for girls. A professor at Colegio Alem√°n originally encouraged her, inciting an interest in mathematics that her family did not understand or support, even sending her to see a psychiatrist for \\"extravagance, disorientation, and a bit of madness,\\" according to her friend Claudia Gomez Wulschner. When asked how the story ends, Salicrup L√≥pez states that she married him. She married the psychiatrist Armando Hinojosa Cavazos. They had three children: Ariel who pursued music, David who became an architect like his mother; and Mariana who studied ballet. Salicrup Lopez had many interests and passions, especially for music and art. She loved the opera and visiting art exhibits. She also enjoyed literature and history. Education After completing secondary school, Salicrup Lopez enrolled at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria where she studied mathematics. Salicrup L√≥pez attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) to study architecture and the German language. In 1959, Salicrup L√≥pez graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) with a degree in architecture. Ten years later, at the age of 34, she earned her master's degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Career After graduating from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1959, Salicrup Lopez worked with the anthropologist Laurette S√©journ√© on the restoration of Teotihuacan. She worked in the archaeological zone doing surveys and plans as well as directing excavations in important parts of this zone. Although Salicrup Lopez was married and with three children, she still wanted to become a mathematician, and finally enrolled in the Faculty of Sciences in 1964 to study mathematics. Between 1966 and 1968 she taught mathematics at the UNAM Faculty of Architecture. Her thesis, accepted in 1969, was on the Jiang Boju subgroup. After graduating in 1969 Graciela began teaching in the UNAM Faculty of Sciences. In 1970 she was given a position as a researcher in the UNAM Mathematics Institute, where she worked with Dr. Roberto V√°zquez, her mentor. That same year she published her first work along with her mentor. Her work was concerned with the structure of the Top category of topological spaces and with continuous functions. Her work related concepts such as reflexivity or correflexivity to those of connection and coexistence, both in Top and in certain subcategories of Top (and in some more general concrete categories). The publications she co-authored with V√°zquez were always in Spanish, so many mathematicians were not aware of her work. During this time, there was a group of important topologists including Horst Herrlich; hence, Salicrup and some fellow mathematicians arranged to take German lessons. She was elected to the Sociedad Matematica Mexicana with reciprocity to the American Mathematical Society in 1973. Legacy Plaque in the Sal√≥n Graciela Salicrup, UNAM Institute of Mathematics Shortly before her death, Graciela fell out with her mentor Roberto V√°zquez and they stopped collaborating. In the summer of 1982, she was visited by Lamar Bentley and Horst Herrlich, with whom she planned to collaborate Soon after this Graciela suffered a fall that hurt her badly. She did not recover and died on July 29,1982. The main hall of the UNAM Institute of Mathematics is named after her. Her research in categorical topology was published in 1986 by Horst Herrlich.

Spring rites Augustus Oldfield described the increase performances, Caroo, which took place in mid spring in the following terms: > At the time of the first new moon after the yams are ripe, the Watch-an-dies > begin to lay in a stock of all kinds of food, sufficient to subsist them > during the continuance of the festival. On the eve of the feast the women > and children retire from the company of the men, shouting as they go, Ow-ee, > Ow-ee, and henceforth, until the conclusion of the ceremony, the men are not > permitted to look on a female, but sometimes, when their store of food prove > insufficient, this law is a little infringed. The men thus left to > themselves rub their bodies with a mixture of charcoal, ashes, and wallaby- > fat; after which, having dug a large pit in the ground, they retire to rest, > not, however, before they are gorged with the good things provided for the > occasion. Early next morning they re-assemble and proceed to decorate > themselves with a mixture of ochre and emu-fat, dressing their hair with > fine shavings and wearing garlands of My-a-lie and A-rum-ba. This > beautifying of their persons, with frequent feastings, lasts the whole day, > but towards evening the real ceremony begins. They dance round the pit they > have dug, shouting, singing, and some few whistling (this they never do in > their common corrobories), and thus they continue all night long, each in > turn snatching a few moments for rest and gormandising. Every figure of > their dances, every gesture, the burden of all their songs, is calculated to > inflame their passions. The pit is so dug and decorated with bushes as to > represent the private parts of a female: as dance they carry the spear > before them to simulate priapus: every gesture is obscene, and the character > of the songs in vogue on such occasions may be understood from the > following, which may be translated by means of the vocabulary: ::Bool-lie neera, Bool-lie neera, :: Bool-lie neera. Wad-a-ga. > At the conclusion of the ceremonies, when, as my informant told me, Aumanno- > maddijubat-wabayadia, they place sticks in the ground to mark the scene of > their orgies, and henceforth that is a tabood place, and any looking on it, > inadvertently or not, will infallibly sicken and die. For sometime after the > feast the men who have held it wear shavings in their hair to distinguish > them as Caa-ro men.'

Over the course of his long career, spanning some forty years, he created roles in major works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and others. He was also a choreographer himself and a talented amateur painter.Debra Crane and Judith Mackrell, \\"Moncion, Francisco,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Early life and training Francisco Monci√≥n was born in Concepci√≥n de la Vega, a large city in La Vega province in the center of the Dominican Republic. His family immigrated to the United States in 1922 or 1923, when he was four years old. He did not begin dance training until he was twenty, and then it was almost by accident. In 1938, he was offered a scholarship to the recently established School of American Ballet, then engaged in recruiting male students. He accepted the offer and soon found himself in technique classes with Balanchine, Pierre Vladimiroff, and Anatole Oboukoff, undergoing the strict discipline of the Russian school of classical ballet. In 1942, while still a student, he appeared in the ensemble of Balanchine's Ballet Imperial in a production by the New Opera Company at the Majestic Theater in New York. However, as World War II was raging in Europe, he postponed his thoughts of becoming a professional dancer and enlisted in the U.S. Army. After two years of military service, he was discharged, whereupon he returned to New York and began his theatrical career.William James Lawson, \\"Moncion, Francisco,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998). Professional career Portrait of Francisco Moncion, in Sebastian Moncion's first engagement as a professional dancer was as a \\"gypsy\\" in a Broadway revival of The Merry Widow, Franz Leh√°r's famous operetta, with dances choreographed by Balanchine. When this show closed, in May 1944, he joined the marquis de Cuevas's Ballet International as a principal, creating the title roles in two major productions later that year: Edward Caton's Sebastian and L√©onide Massine's Mad Tristan, a Surrealist work with spectacular designs by Salvador Dal√≠. Of the latter, Edwin Denby wrote, \\"Besides Dal√≠, there was one other hero Friday night, Francisco Moncion, who took the part of Tristan. He carried off the most acrobatically strenuous part without a flaw, and more than that he projected the character and the story convincingly. He is a very fine dancer indeed, and a quite exceptionally imaginative one.Edwin Denby, Dance Writings, December 16, 1944 (New York: Knopf, 1986), p. 276. Following this engagement, Moncion performed briefly with Colonel de Basil's Original Ballet Russe during the early months of the 1946/47 season. He then became an original member of Ballet Society, formed by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein in 1947, and later of its successor, the New York City Ballet. During the four decades that he spent in these companies, he created a number of important roles and participated in many historic performances. At the first performance of the New York City Ballet on October 11, 1948, he danced in all three ballets on the program: Concerto Barocco, Orpheus, and Symphony in C.Nancy Reynolds, Repertory in Review: Forty Years of the New York City Ballet (New York: Dial Press, 1977). Decades later, during the troupe's 20th anniversary season he appeared in the premier of Jacques d'Amboise's Tchaikovsky Suite No. 2 in collaboration with Robert Irving and John Serry Sr..The New York Times',' December 8, 1968 p. 162The New York Times, January 10, 1969, p. 38GettyImages ‚Äì Francisco Moncion performing in the premier of Jacques d'Amboise's Tchaikovsky Suite from \\"The Life Picture Collection\\" January 1, 1969 See Caption with Date created on gettyimages.comOxford Reference \\"Overview ‚Äì Jacques d'Amboise\\" Tchaikovsky Suite (1969) on oxfordreference.com =Roles created= This is a selected list.

Role: principal dancer. =Artistic diversity= Early in his career, it became clear that Moncion would never be a true danseur noble. He lacked the elegance of bearing and refinement required for princely roles. Yet it was equally clear that he was capable of effective portrayals in many different roles as a premier danseur. He was a dashing figure in the Balanchine dances for the Broadway production of The Chocolate Soldier (1947), swirling and twirling with Mary Ellen Moylan. He was a delicately tender partner to Tanaquil Le Clercq in Jerome Robbins's meditative Afternoon of a Faun (1953), bringing a sensual, feline languor to the part. He was dramatically powerful in the title role of Balanchine's Prodigal Son, entranced by the Siren of Yvonne Mounsey and then heartbreakingly contrite as he painfully made his way home to his father. In stark contrast, he was hilariously funny as The Husband in Robbins's The Concert, smoking his cigar and flitting about the stage to butterfly music. And, of course, he was mysteriously compelling and beautiful in Orpheus, as the brooding Dark Angel, the role for which he is perhaps best remembered.Lincoln Kirstein, The New York City Ballet, With photographs by Martha Swope and George Platt Lynes. (New York: Random House, 1973). =Choreographies= In the 1950s and 1960s, Moncion experimented with choreographing works of his own. He made four for the New York City Ballet and two for other companies.William James Lawson, \\"Moncion, Francisco,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998).

Personal life Moncion's surname is well known in the Dominican Republic, as his family is connected to General Benito Monci√≥n (1826‚Äì1898), an army officer of French descent who fought in the Dominican Restoration War. Moncion's forebears certainly included Hispanics as well as French and likely black Africans as well. Most Dominicans are of mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds. In 1947, Francisco Moncion became a citizen of the United States, where he was considered a Caribbean Latino for the rest of his life. After his retirement from the stage in 1983, Moncion spent his leisure years at his home in Woodstock, New York, indulging his considerable talent for oil painting. His works were shown in several New York exhibitions. He died of cancer at his home at the age of 66.Anna Kisselgoff, \\"Francisco Moncion, 76, a Charter Member of New York City Ballet.\\" obituary, New York Times, April 4, 1985.

He is the second son of Aslam Azhar, known as the father of Pakistani television due to his pioneering work in the early years of television in Pakistan. Arieb Azhar was exposed to folk and classical Pakistani music as well to western classical music at home. He went to the Soviet Union at the age of 17 for studies but left soon, disillusioned by what he called the \\"corrupt system\\" pervasive there. He then spent 13 years of his life in Zagreb, Croatia (earlier part of Yugoslavia at the time he migrated) where he became \\"completely integrated\\" and received his higher education in Indology and philosophy while performing music. He returned to Pakistan in 2004 to reconnect with his Pakistani roots. He is at ease and fluent in both Urdu and Punjabi languages as well as in Croatian. Musical career His first album, Wajj, released in 2006, consisted of eight tracks, in which he vocalized the classical lyrics of Sufi poets like Khawaja Ghulam Farid, Bulleh Shah, Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, and even the contemporary lyrics of Sarmad Sehbai. In 2012, Azhar was to travel to the UK to work together with an eminent English folk singer Martin Simpson with the purpose of fusing Celtic and South Asian folk and classical music together to create a fusion on a 'soul' level. Arieb Azhar said in an interview in 2012, \\"Martin and I are trying to come up with music together in a very natural and organic way where we are playing off each other's music 'feel' \\". One of Arieb Azhar's interests is to mix urban and folk-based songs with lyrics from Pakistani Sufi poets while making use of other Eurasian influences he has absorbed along the way.

It is a home to one of the main campuses of Universiti Teknologi MARA. History Machang originated as a village of the same name, Kampung Machang. It was opened in 1880 by a group of settlers from Pasir Tumboh, Kota Bharu led by Senik Awang Kecik. On its inception, the territory was mainly economically agrarian with some of the population involved in commerce.  Etymology  Machang is named after the Malay name for horse mango, machang (Mangifera foetida).  Point of Interest  = Cek Mek Molek Street Murals = Opened to public in 2015, Cek Mek Molek Street is the latest artistic installation of its kind within the territory. It was a previously an unkempt back alley before it was then transformed as an open mural gallery. = Leaning Minaret of Pulai Condong Mosque = The Minaret of Pulai Condong Mosque, a local flagship structure, was designed and built by Hj. Ab. Samad bin Hj. Abdullah in year 1856 (1273H). The minaret is also known as Pulai Condong Mosque Tower from a loose English translation from the Malay language. Standing at 18 metres high and about 2.8 metres width, the minaret was built with an unroofed pole at its core which acts as an axis. The minaret was said to be made in cooperation of hundreds of men. The structure is made from chengal wood by only adze (Malay: beliung), axe and chisel. The structural integrity of the minaret is really strong considering it is still standing after Kelantan was hit by a big flood and storm in 1880 (1297H). This minaret remained in a good condition today and still serving its original purpose as a place where muezzin calls out the call for prayers. = Bukit Bakar Recreational Forest = Bukir Bakar Recreational Forest or Hutan Lipur Bukit Bakar was first opened in 1975. It covers an area of 3.14 hectares, within the Ulu Sat Forest Reserve. This recreational forest is a perfect getaway, especially for families. The facilities within the area includes a children's playground, a number of rest areas and huts, a bathing pond, a hanging bridge, and restrooms, to improve visitors' appreciation of the flowing cool waters, flora and fauna, and intense forest greeneries. The site has a free entry for guests between 7am to 7pm. Campers, on the other hand, will need to get a permission from the Recreational Forest authorities, on behalf of the Kelantan State Forestry Director. = Jeram Linang Waterfall and Recreational Forest = Jeram Linang Waterfall was one of the first to be developed by the state. Located in the Ulu Sat Forest Reserve, its cool waters always crystal clear despite the location's popularity. The state government has provided facilities including public restrooms, rest areas, Muslim prayer facilities, restaurants and car park. Visitors to Jeram Linang come not only to bathe, but also to jungle trek, and pitch their tents up for an eco-friendly vacation at the camp site provided. = Guillemard Bridge = Guillemard Bridge is a railway bridge erected across Sungai Kelantan in Kusial near Tanah Merah. The bridge is the longest railway bridge in Malaysia. The construction began in year 1920 and completed in July 1924. When it was first opened, the bridge was used by all types of vehicles including trains and motor vehicles. It was inaugurated by then Sultan of Kelantan, HRH Sultan Ismail Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Muhammad IV of Kelantan in year 1925. The name \\"Guillemard\\" was taken from Sir Laurence Guillemard who was then the British Governor of Strait Settlements and High Commissioner of Malaya. The bridge was detonated by the British troops on 12 December 1941 to slow down the advancement of Japanese military troops during the Japanese Invasion of Malaya before they retreated to Kuala Krai. Railway bridge was soon repaired and reopened to traffic on 7 September 1948. Upon the completion of a new bridge in a nearby area, Guillemard Bridge is now only used by trains and access to other vehicles is permanently closed. = Temangan Ore Mine = Temangan iron ore mine was operated by Oriental Mining Co., a Japanese company in Bukit Besi, Temangan. Once extracted, the iron ores were transported by train to Tumpat Harbour. The iron ore then put into a special container where it would be transported aboard a ship to be exported to Japan. During the Japanese Invasion of Malaya (1941-1945) iron ore production was continued by the Japanese army. After World War II, iron ore was still in production, committed by same company albeit under British government surveillance. Its production persists up to year 1965 where its operation stopped due to depletion of the mine resources. Since its closure, the Jambatan Bijih was then abandoned and it was not managed properly.

History Japan and Poland established diplomatic relations on March 22, 1919, months after Poland regained its independence in November 1918. Both countries formed a silent alliance against the Soviet Union and agreed upon sharing intelligence they obtained. The Japanese relied heavily on the new Polish secret service for training in decryption and continued their close military co-operation even after (post-invasion) German declaration of war against Poland, which was rejected by Japan for this reason (continued military co-operation). The Japanese relied on the vast Polish network of spies and allowed the Poles to openly place their agents inside embassies of its protectorate of Manchukuo. Their military cooperation was so close that the Japanese ambassador was one of the people involved in the smuggling of a Polish flag made for the London-based Polish Air Squadron. Before the war, Japan wanted Poland to join the Axis countries. At the time of the signing the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact and subsequent attack on Poland, Japan declared that from now on she would never trust Hitler anymore and would only use him for her own purposes, so as not to help Nazi Germany in the war with the Soviets at the end of the war. During World War I, the Japanese government declared war on Germany and at the same time the Japanese elite financially supported the creation of a sovereign Polish government in exchange for professionally teaching Japanese spies to break Russian codes. General Akashi traveled extensively around Europe. He and other Japanese financially supported Poles striving to break away from Russia. An important rapprochement between Japanese and Polish officers was the honorary treatment of Poles who had repeatedly hosted Japanese officers visiting or stationed at their diplomatic missions in Warsaw. In the interwar period, Japanese cryptologists visited Poland, where Polish specialists wrote the methods of Russian phrases. Onodera claimed that until 1939 the center of the Japanese intelligence aimed at Russia was located in Warsaw. \\"The Poles have taught us - said Onodera - among other things systems for compiling and analyzing materials from open sources that have been successfully interpreted by researchers.\\" Onodera convinced the Americans to Poles. As he said, the cooperation between the Japanese and Poles dates back to the Japanese-Russian war of 1905. ‚ÄúWe were united by our hatred of Russia. The foundations of our cooperation were built by: General Baron Motojiro Akashi related to the intelligence, a military attach√© in Stockholm in 1904-05 and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. \\" During World War II, despite being allied with Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan along with Italy did not diplomatically support the Nazi invasion of Poland, and the Japanese actively supported the Polish government in exile. This decision was dictated by the Japanese distrust of their Nazi allies, who had made a secret pact with the Soviet Union. Thus, the Japanese government decided to continue to rely on Polish spies even after a formal declaration of war by Poland. The declaration of war from Poland was rejected by Japanese prime minister Tojo Hideki under the pretense that the Polish government in exile was forced to issue it in compliance with its alliance to both the United Kingdom and the United States, making the declaration legally void. This ensured co-operation between the two intelligence services in gathering information on both the Soviet Union and Third Reich. The Japanese agents in Europe during World War II continued to support the Polish struggle for freedom against Soviet Union and Third Reich forces as far as the Japanese interests went, and sheltered Polish-Jewish refugees fleeing occupation from both German and Soviet forces, though at first it was done without proper authorization from the Imperial government in Tokyo. Therefore, Chiune Sugihara had to prove to the authorities that the refugees would be traveling through Japan only as a transit country to the United States and not be staying permanently, which eventually lead to him gaining full legal approval and assistance from the Government of Japan. Throughout the secret alliance, Polish agents never disclosed information about their Western allies and shared information only pertaining to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union. The Japanese poem Porando kaiko of Major and later General Fukushima Yasumasa mentions the Polish struggle for freedom. In 1910, well-known Japanese writer Nitobe Inaz≈ç dedicated his book Bushido: The Soul of Japan to the Polish nation, indicating that it was a \\"samurai\\" nation. It may seem curious to us today, given the geographical and cultural distance between the cultures, but this was a time when the Japanese admired Poles greatly for their heroism and honor. A statue of Polish anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Pi≈Çsudski stands in Japan, who was a researcher of the local culture in Japan and married an Ainu woman who was a citizen of Imperial Japan. He was also the brother of the Polish marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who established close cooperation with the Imperial Japanese government in order to jointly attack the Soviet Union. The plan failed due to the marshal's death. During Bolshevik rule in Russia, the Japanese government undertook a rescue operation to help Polish children deported to Siberia. Japanese ships transported Polish children to Tokyo, where the Japanese Red Cross gave them protection and then helped them return to Poland. Based on the rescue of Polish children from Siberia through Japan, the movie Warushawa-no Aki (English: Autumn in Warsaw) was made, directed by Hiroki Hayashi. The guardian of Polish children was played by the Japanese actress Y≈´ko Takeuchi, known for her role in the Japanese film Ring. =Modern relations= Embassy of Japan in Warsaw, Poland Japan established a relationship with the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) that represented the Soviet-controlled Polish puppet state in 1957, while at the same time continuing to be allied with the London-based Polish national government in exile, and later supported the merging of these two in 1989 to form the modern Polish state. Both share mutual interests and alliances that forged them closer to each other. The two states celebrated 90 years of relationship in 2009 and the 100th anniversary in 2019 Trade, business, and tourism between both countries continues to thrive.

It was discovered by J. Dufrenoy at the orchard of Migoule in Brive- la-Gaillarde. The tree is vigorous and erect growing with growth of 3 or more feet in a season if the conditions are right. It is a large sized chestnut tree with height reaching 60 feet or more and 25-35 feet wide. Trees can bear after 3 to 5 years. Full production in 12 - 20 years depending on the location. This hybrid can be grown in many areas where grapes are grown. It is cold hardy to -20F . In an orchard with South West orientation it can be grown up to 500 m elevation. It blooms early and is frost sensitive but can produce nuts from secondary buds. It is an early ripening variety - great for northern climates where late ripening varieties can get damaged by frost - a very dependable producer in cool regions . Precoce Migoule is sensitive to codling, susceptible to bark canker, resistant to rust. The pollen has low to medium fertility. In the Northern hemisphere, the bloom period for the male catkins is June 15-30 female flowers June 25 - July 10. It can pollinize all Castanea sativa cultivars and can get pollinated by Basalta #3, Belle Epine, Bournette, Ginyose, Marigoule, Marsol, Tsukuba, and Vignols . Phytophthora resistance is poor on its own root stock. It is better to graft Precoce Migoule onto ink disease resistant rootstock of Marsol, Maraval or Marigoule. Trees drop nuts free of the burr. Nut fall is usually mid to late September and continuing until the first week into October. Depending on the root graft, the nuts can be large (24-26 per pound, 15-18 gram/nut). Precoce Migoule is a variety of chestnuts with more than 12% double embryos, which is still commercially acceptable because of its large nuts. The color of the nuts is light mahogany. The nuts are as sensitive to kernel rot as Marron du Var and Marsol and exhibit higher sensitivity to kernel rot than Bouche de Betizac, Mardonne, Maraval and Marigoule. The flavor of the roasted nuts is variously described as good, very good to excellent. Nuts peel well and store well. Nut production is mostly for the fresh market.

He is the M. Keith Weikel Distinguished Chair in Leadership in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. His research bears on self-efficacy, confidence, and primed goals. Stajkovic co-authored papers with Albert Bandura, Edwin Locke, and Fred Luthans. Stajkovic is a contributing editor to the Journal of Applied Psychology, as well as a member of the Midwestern Psychological Association and Society for Science of Motivation.  Early life  Born in 1965 to Serbian (Yugoslavian) parents, Alex grew up in Belgrade. Alex enrolled in the University of Belgrade in 1985. In college, Stajkovic studied economics. He was president of Association Internationale des √âtudiants en Sciences √âconomiques et Commerciales (AIESEC) for the Economics Faculty in Belgrade in 1987-1988.  Education  Stajkovic graduated with a Ph.D. in organizational behavior from University of Nebraska - Lincoln in December 1996. Luthans was Stajkovic's dissertation chair. Stajkovic also earned a Master of Arts in Management from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 1993.  Academia career  In 1999 Stajkovic became an assistant professor at the Wisconsin School for Business. In 2006 he became an associate professor. From 2008 - 2013 Stajkovic held the Procter and Gamble Chair in Business, and from 2013 - 2015 he was the M. Keith Weikel Professor in Leadership. He has held the M. Keith Weikel Distinguished Chair in Leadership since 2015. A study conducted in 2018 placed Stajkovic in the top one percent of most-cited textbook authors in the field of organizational behavior.  Theories  = Core confidence = Stajkovic developed core confidence theory to help better understand employee motivation. The theory holds that ability and motivation to some extent predict performance. Other factors need to be taken into account. Stajkovic (2006) explains: > \\"What I try to add to the literature is a suggestion that skill and desire > need to be joined with confidence, a personal certainty belief that one can > handle what one desires to do or needs to be done at work\\" (p. 1209) Stajkovic states that confidence resides deep within individuals - at their core - and is not directly observable. Instead, we see it manifest in people through their hope, self-efficacy, optimism, and resilience. He advanced the view that hope, self-efficacy, optimism, and resilience represent one common core, namely, confidence, and that core confidence predicts job performance, job satisfaction, and satisfaction with life. Along with core confidence, Staikovic also defines trait core confidence as a \\"certainty can-do belief that spans across related domains of activity.\\" To support these claims, Stajkovic conducted a series of studies to analyze whether self-efficacy predicts academic achievement above and beyond personality. They analyzed the Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, agreeableness, extroversion/introversion, openness to experience, and emotional stability), which are defined as innate dispositions. They examined the predictive power of personality and self-efficacy on students' grades. Their findings ultimately concluded that \\"self-efficacy was predictive of academic achievement above and beyond personality in all of the analyses.\\" In terms of practical implications, this research reaffirmed that students can develop the skills, specifically the confidence, to succeed.Stajkovic, Alex. ‚ÄúHow to Predict Academic Achievement.‚Äù Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 28 Nov. 2017, bus.wisc.edu/knowledge-expertise/faculty- research/forward-thinking-blog/2017/11/27/how-to-predict-academic-achievement. Stajkovic has also published articles around self-regulation, which goes hand in hand with core confidence and self-efficacy. Self-regulation is connected to processes related to underlying attitudes and behaviors and how they happen. Research on self-regulation has put a focus on how core confidence plays a role in self-regulation of job performance as well as life satisfaction. The role core confidence plays in adaptive self-regulation is that the person already has the skill and motivation but is triggered psychology to enable this potential. Doubt inhibits this potential. Looking at both confidence levels, individuals with low core confidence are less likely to participate in activities if there is doubt. Individuals with high core confidence are able to overcome this doubt. Staijovic hypothesized that core confidence is positively related to higher satisfaction with life as well as higher job satisfaction. Conclusions of the study found core confidence did in fact show how impactful core confidence is both students and employees that were studied. A talk by Stajkovic that summarizes his research on confidence and its effect on job performance is available here. In a 2007 interview with Elle Magazine, Stajkovic gave insight into how to increase self-efficacy. In the interview, his advice to people seeking to grow themselves in their work is to study the habits of their peers who have similar or more advanced skills.TY - BOOK AU - Stajkovic, Alex PY - 2007/04/19 SP - T1 - Ain't no mountain high enough. Alex's interview with Elle on the role of self-efficacy in the careers of women. JO - The Elle Magazine ER - = Interaction of primed subconscious and conscious goals = In an experiment published in 2006 Stajkovic and colleagues examined the relationship between primed subconscious goals and conscious goals. Conscious goal setting theory asserts that consciously setting specific, difficult goals explains and predicts work performance. The study of conscious goal setting has been largely confined to the study of organizational behavior. Subconscious goal theory asserts that motivational goals can be activated (primed) through stimulating the subconscious mind. The study of subconscious goal activation has been the work of social psychology researchers. Stajkovic and his collaborators designed the first experiment to attempt to connect these two theories. The subjects in the experiment set conscious goals in three conditions: easy goals, do your best goals and specific difficult goals. The subjects were then subconsciously primed using achievement related words. Subjects were then given the task of listing possible uses for a coat hanger. The experiment showed that both subconscious priming and conscious goal setting had a significant effect on achievement of the difficult and do your best goals. Neither had a significant effect on attainment of an easy goal. The results also showed a significant two-way interaction between subconscious and conscious goals. In 2019, Stajkovic, with Kayla Sergent, published Cognitive Automation and Organizational Psychology; Priming Goals as a New Source of Competitive Advantage. As the title suggests, Stajkovic and Sergent posit that cognitive automation, that is, using the subconscious, to prime goals to free up working or active memory in task performance provides an opportunity for competitive advantage. Stajkovic and Sergent argue that the use of the subconscious to prime goals will produce a competitive advantage in business. The authors state the problem that the modern worker is experiencing cognitive overload in the workplace due to the complexities and demands of the same. Upon stating the problem, the authors set about providing empirical data to support their argument to show that the use of subconscious processing can provide a competitive advantage in business.

Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters, an endowed chair named after the 9th president of Cornell University.\\"Carole Boyce Davies\\", Africana Studies & Research Center, Cornell University. Among several other awards, she was the recipient of two major awards, both in 2017: the Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award from the Caribbean Philosophical Association and the Distinguished Africanist Award from the New York State African Studies Association. Boyce Davies has held distinguished professorships at a number of universities including the Herskovits Professor of African Studies at Northwestern University (2000) and was appointed to the Kwame Nkrumah Professor at the University of Ghana, Legon (2015). She is the author or editor of thirteen books, including the three-volume Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora and over a hundred journal articles and encyclopedia entries. She serves on the International Scientific Committee of UNESCO General History of Africa, Volume Nine, as the coordinator/editor of the epistemological forum on Global Blackness of the forthcoming volume on the African diaspora and is the Vice Chairperson of the African Humanities Forum (based in Mali). She has lectured on Black women's writings and experience, Black Left Feminism, and African Diaspora issues across North America, Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean, and in Brazil, Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, Australia, India, and China. She has held visiting professorships at several universities, including Beijing Foreign Studies University, China and has been a Fulbright Professor at the University of Bras√≠lia, Brazil and the University of the West Indies at St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago. As Director of African New World Studies at Florida International University, Boyce Davies developed the Florida Africana Studies Consortium and served on the Florida Commissioner of Education's Task Force for Implementing the Florida Mandate for the Teaching of African American Experience. She has been president of major academic organizations such as the African Literature Association and the Caribbean Studies Association.  Background  Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Boyce Davies studied at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (B.A. in English) and Howard University (M.A. in African Studies) and received her Ph.D. in African Literature at the University of Ibadan on Commonwealth Scholarship from the government of Trinidad and Tobago. From the mid-1980s and throughout the 1990s, she was a popular award-winning professor at the State University of New York, Binghamton. In 1997 she was recruited to build the African Diaspora Studies Program at Florida International University, serving three successful terms there until 2007, when she joined the Cornell University faculty.  Scholarship  = International Dimensions of Black Women's Writing = Boyce Davies is a leading authority on Black women writing cross-culturally. Her book Black Women Writing and Identity: Migrations of the Subject (Routledge, 1994) is a study of Black women's writing, broadening the discourse surrounding the representation of and by Black women and women of color. It explores a complex set of interrelated issues, establishing the significance of such wide-ranging subjects as: re-mapping, renaming and cultural crossings; gender, heritage and identity; African women's writing and resistance to domination; marginality, effacement and decentering; gender, language and the politics of location. She also edited the Volumes One and Two of Moving Beyond Boundaries: International Dimensions of Black Women's Writing (with Molara Ogundipe-Leslie) and Black Women‚Äôs Diasporas, a major contribution to our understanding of the issues, experiences, and concerns of Black women writing in different communities and in a wide range of geographic contexts. Covering writers from Africa, Brazil, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and such well-known authors as Zora Neale Hurston, Nadine Gordimer, and bell hooks, it contains both creative and critical writings, and by considering the area of critical writing as critical conversation, it allows writer and critic to speak with each other in the creation of the critical voice. = Recovering Claudia Jones = Trinidad-born intellectual-activist Claudia Jones (1915‚Äì1964) had long remained outside of academic consideration before Boyce Davies restored her to global, intellectual prominence. In Left of Karl Marx: The Political Life of Black Communist Claudia Jones (Duke University Press, 2008), Boyce Davies assesses the activism, writing, and legacy of Claudia Jones, a pioneering Afro-Caribbean radical intellectual, dedicated communist, and feminist. Jones is buried in London‚Äôs Highgate Cemetery, to the left of Karl Marx ‚Äî a location that Boyce Davies finds fitting given how Jones expanded Marxism-Leninism to incorporate gender and race in her political critique and activism. In 2008 the book was awarded the Letitia Woods Brown Book Award, given annually by the Association of Black Women Historians. Boyce Davies is also the editor of Claudia Jones: Beyond Containment (Ayebia Clarke Publishing, 2011), which brings together for the first time the essays, poetry, and autobiographical and other writings of Claudia Jones. = Caribbean women writers = Boyce Davies has also established herself as a major scholar of Caribbean women writers. Along with Elaine Savory Fido, she coedited Out of the Kumbla: Caribbean Women and Literature, the first collection of critical essays on Caribbean women‚Äôs literature. The book not only created a field of literary criticism which engaged the absence of women writers from the Caribbean literary canon as it established the presence of these writers historically. But by expanding the narrow terms of Western feminist discourse, it also revitalized Caribbean literature and criticism. Using the metaphor of the \\"Kumbla\\" or \\"calabash\\" used to protect precious objects, first used by writer Erna Brodber, coming ‚ÄúOut of the Kumbla‚Äù then signified a movement from confinement to visibility, articulation, and activism, a process which allowed for a multiplicity of moves, exteriorized, no longer contained and protected or dominated. = African Diaspora Studies/Decolonizing Discourses = Boyce Davies is widely recognized as a trailblazer in African Diaspora Studies. She served as the general editor of Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture (three-volume set), the only single-source collection of the most current scholarship on all aspects of the African Diaspora. Five hundred years of relocation and dislocation, of assimilation and separation has produced a rich tapestry of history and culture into which are woven people, places, and events. This authoritative, accessible work reveals the strands of the tapestry, telling the story of diverse peoples, separated by time and distance, but retaining a commonality of origin and experience. In collaboration with her former students Meredith Gadsby, Charles Peterson, and Henrietta Williams, she edited Decolonizing the Academy: African Diaspora Studies. It asserts that the academy is perhaps the most colonized space. In the 21st century, this has become even clearer now that the academy remains one of the primary sites for the production and re-production of ideas that serve the interests of colonizing powers and its disciplines have yet to be decolonized. This collection of essays argues that African diaspora theory has the possibility of interrupting the current colonizing process and re-engaging the decolonizing process at the level of the mind. In addition, it contends that this will be an ongoing project worthy of being undertaken in a variety of fields of study as we confront the challenges of the 21st century. This assertion has proven revelatory given the current prominence of decolonial discourses. = Caribbean Spaces = Both a memoir and a scholarly study, her book Caribbean Spaces: Escapes from Twilight Zones (University of Illinois Press, 2013) explores the multivalent meanings of Caribbean space and community in a cross-cultural and transdisciplinary perspective. Throughout, Boyce Davies demonstrates how Caribbean cultures circulate internationally and how a Caribbean perspective has linked her political vision to broader currents of the Black World including the Civil Rights Movement, the environmental catastrophes of Haiti, the failure of the New Orleans levies during Hurricane Katrina, and the use of modern technologies such as smartphones and global positioning systems within the Caribbean. Ultimately, Boyce Davies reestablishes the connections between theory and practice, intellectual work and activism, and personal and private space. = Black Women and Political Leadership = Currently, Boyce Davies is working on a new book project on \\"Black Women and Political Leadership in the African Diaspora\\". She has already published a number of essays in this area such as: 1. \\"First Ladies/First Wives, First Women Presidents: Sexuality, Leadership and Power in the African Diaspora\\", in Michelle Obama's Impact on African American Women and Girls, eds Paula Seniors, Michelle Duster, and Rose Thevenin (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). 2. \\"Writing Black Women into Political Leadership: Reflections, Trends and Contradictions\\", in Black Women and International Law: Deliberate Interactions, Movements and Actions, ed.

Stanlie James, Frances Smith Foster, and Beverly Guy- Sheftall (New York: Feminist Press, 2009): 392‚Äì414.]  International education  Boyce Davies has decades of experience in international education. In the English Department at Binghamton University, SUNY, she served as the co-director of its London study abroad program. As a distinguished visiting professor, she taught Black women's Writing, transnationalism and diaspora, and academic writing at Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing Foreign Studies University, University of Bras√≠lia, and the University of West Indies at St. Augustine. She has also organized and directed Teachers Institutes in New York, Miami, Florida and in the Caribbean‚ÄîGrenada and Haiti, the latter in conjunction with the Caribbean Studies Association Conference in Haiti (www.caribbeanstudiesassociation.org) and courtesy of a grant from the Kellogg Foundation.  Awards  Boyce Davies was the 2017 recipient of the Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award (Caribbean Philosophical Association) and the Distinguished Africanist Award (New York State African Studies Association).\\"Professor Boyce Davies to receive lifetime achievement award\\", Africana Studies & Research Center, Cornell University. In 2011 she was given an ICABA award as one of South Florida's most accomplished executives, professionals and Academicians. In 2008 her book Left of Karl Marx: The Political Life of Black Communist Claudia Jones (Duke University Press, 2008) won the Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Prize for the best book on African American Women's History from the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH). Her research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the Kellogg Foundation, Greene Family Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, Ford Foundation, Florida International University, American Council of Learned Societies, and SUNY - Binghamton Foundation and Caribbean Airlines.

Ma Xulun (, 27 April 18854 May 1970), courtesy name Yichu (), was a Chinese politician, activist, and linguist. He was one of the co-founders of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. Early life Ma Xulun was an early member of the Tongmenghui. He also joined the South Society founded by Liu Yazi. In 1913, Ma founded Great Republican Daily together with Zhang Taiyan, and became the newspaper's editor-in-chief. In 1913, Ma became a professor at Peking University. During the May Fourth Movement, he was elected to be the president of the Union of Peking High School and College Faculty. In 1921, Ma was appointed as director of education of Zhejiang Province. After the reforms of Beiyang Government, Ma returned to Peking and became twice Deputy Minister of Education. Ma joined Kuomintang in 1923. After the March 18 Massacre, Ma was wanted for opposing Duan Qirui, and fled to Zhejiang. There, Ma called the province governor to support the Northern Expedition against Sun Chuanfang, and was wanted again. After the Kuomintang secured Zhejiang, Ma became Zhejiang's director of civil affairs. He returned to the post of Deputy Minister of Education in 1928. After the Mukden Incident, Ma Xulun founded North China People's Union for Saving the Motherland (ÂçéÂåóÊ∞ë‰ºóÊïëÂõΩËÅîÂêà‰ºö), and Peking Cultural Society's Union for Saving the Motherland (ÂåóÂπ≥ÊñáÂåñÁïåÊïëÂõΩ‰ºö). In 1936, he persuaded Sichuan warlord Liu Xiang to avoid a civil war and support the war against Japan. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma moved to Shanghai and devoted himself to writing. After World War II In 1945, Ma Xulun co-founded the China Association for Promoting Democracy along with Xu Guangping, Zhou Jianren and Zhao Puchu. On 5 May 1946, 52 organizations formed the Shanghai Union of People's Organizations (‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂõ¢‰ΩìËÅîÂêà‰ºö), and Ma became a member of its standing committee. From 1945 to 1947, Ma also published more than 100 political commentaries on newspapers such as Wenhui Bao. In late 1947, Ma went to Hong Kong with the help of the Communist Party. In Hong Kong, Ma voiced his support for the Labor Day Slogan, which formed the basis of the future system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation led by Chinese Communist Party. Shortly after, Ma went to Communist Party controlled regions, and supported Mao Zedong's January 1949 statement on the situation of China. In June and September, he attended the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Preparatory Conference and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference First Plenary Session, and was responsible for selecting People's Republic of China's national flag, emblem and anthem. After the establishment of People's Republic of China, Ma Xulun became Minister of Education in 1949 and Minister of Higher Education in 1952. In his term, he pushed for the highly influential higher education reform of 1952, which cancelled colleges' autonomy and converted China's education system to one that more closely resembled the Soviet Union, creating a number of specialized colleges. Ma is also vice-president of the 4th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences. Works Ma Xulun was an expert in Chinese language linguistics, especially in grammatology and historical phonology.

This cluster of mostly ruined temples are co-located near the meeting point of Tungabhadra River and Krishna River at the border of Andhra Pradesh.Odile Divakaran (1971), Les temples d'ƒÄlampur et de ses environs au temps des CƒÅ·∏∑ukya de BƒÅdƒÅmi, Arts Asiatiques, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 51-101 They are close to the Alampur Navabrahma Temples of the Shaivism tradition, but completed a few centuries later by the Rashtrakutas and later Chalukyas. The Papanasi temples exhibit the Nagara architecture with a square plan. The Papavinasesvara temple is the largest of Papanasi group. It has a square plan, a phamsana superstructure with a brahmachchanda-griva sikhara, plain outer walls and rangamandapa inside. The temple is dedicated to dancing Shiva (Nataraja, Natesha). Together with the Navabrahma temples, the Papanasi group were related to the Kalamukha and Pashupata sect of Shaivism. Additional temples in this region made the site a Shaktism pitha. All of these temples featured Vaishnavism themes and narrated Hindu texts in their arts. Together these formed the Brahmeshvara Sthana tirtha (Kshetra), and before their destruction in the 14th and 15th centuries during Delhi Sultanate invasions and associated Muslim-Hindu conflict, they wielded enormous influence in regional religious life. Some historic Hindu and Buddhist literature refers to this site near Kurnool as Srisaila or Sriparvata. According to David White, this site in 12th century also became linked with the Shaivism sect called Virasaiva or Lingayats. The Papanasi temple group is not at the original location. They have been moved and restored from their ruins by the Archaeological Survey of India after 1980. They were threatened by the Srisailam hydroelectric project, but they were moved to higher grounds and a barrage built to protect them which has saved them from further damage. Excavations associated with this transplantation of the temples unearthed evidence of temple building rituals.MS Nagaraja Rao (1985), Indian Archaeology: A Review , Vol. 1982-83, ASI, pages 9-13  Location The Alampur Navabrahma temples are located in the Telangana town of Alampur, at the confluence (sangam) of two major rivers, the Tungabhadra and Krishna. It is south of Hyderabad, connected by the four-lane National Highway 44 (Asian Highway 43), and about northeast of Hampi monuments and east of Badami, the capital of the kings who are credited with building it in the 7th century.

As a grace-and-favour property, the house has been frequently occupied by members of the British royal family, as well as staff and employees. Design and location Nottingham Cottage has two bedrooms and two reception rooms, with a bathroom and small garden. It is in size. It stands near two other grace-and-favour houses, Kent Cottage and Wren Cottage. The house was designed by Christopher Wren. Its name derives from Nottingham House, the residence of the Earl of Nottingham from which Kensington Palace was expanded by William III and Mary II. Occupants Nottingham Cottage has been occupied by several people who were formerly employees of the British royal family. Upon her retirement in 1948, the house was given for life to Marion Crawford, the former governess of Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. In gratitude for Crawford's service, Queen Mary, the princesses' grandmother, decorated the house with Victorian furniture and prints of flowers for her. Crawford described the house as a dream \\"of seasoned red brick...with roses round the door\\". Crawford left the cottage in 1950 in the aftermath of her selling stories about the royal family to newspapers. Her departure from the cottage was made public knowledge by John Gordon, the editor and chief columnist of The Sunday Express, in the newspaper's Hardcastle column in an attempt to pressure her to provide more stories and articles to him. Before Crawford, Nottingham Cottage had been home to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and his wife, Princess Alice. Later occupants included Sir Miles Hunt-Davis (the Private Secretary of the Duke of Edinburgh) and his wife Anita, Lady Hunt-Davis, and Robert Fellowes (who served as Private Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II) and his wife Lady Jane Fellowes (sister of Diana, Princess of Wales). Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, lived at Nottingham Cottage for two and a half years after leaving Anglesey, where Prince William had been stationed as a helicopter pilot. The couple lived there with the infant Prince George for a few months after his birth, before moving in October 2013 to Apartment 1A in Kensington Palace. The ceilings of the home are very low, and Prince William had to stoop to avoid hitting his head on them. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger brother of Prince William, moved into the house following his brother's departure. Harry proposed to Meghan Markle whilst roasting a chicken in the home. After their wedding in May 2018, the couple continued living at the house. In November 2018, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would move from Nottingham Cottage to Frogmore Cottage (near Windsor) in spring 2019, before the birth of their first child.

Early life Ivalo Abelsen was born in 1971 in Nuuk, Greenland. She began her basic studies at the Art School in Nuuk and then attended the Aarhus School of Architecture in Denmark for two years. Continuing her education, Abelsen went on the study in Nyk√∏bing Falster at the Teacher Training College of Design, earning her certification to teach in graphic arts and sculpture. Returning to Greenland, she earned her graduate degree from the Institute for Culture and Social History at the University of Greenland. Career Abelsen began working at the Midtgr√∏nlands Gymnasiale Skole, known familiarly as GUX-Nuuk, the state gymnasium in 2009, teaching cultural science, history and visual arts. In addition to her teaching, she won a commission that year to design postage stamps for the country. Her first issue, captured the stylized polar bear images carved by the Dorset culture in bone and was done in watercolor and ink. In 2011, she held an exhibit with Hanne Bruun at the Katuaq Cultural Center of Nuuk, with pieces focused on Greenlandic culture. Abelsen's work has also been shown at the Frederiksberg Gardens' Palace Hall, in Copenhagen; the National Museum of Greenland; the North Atlantic House in Copenhagen; and the Nuuk Art Museum. In 2014, Abelsen was selected to produce a series of four stamps focused on the importance of hunting and sealing to Greenlandic culture. Two stamps were released in that year with the following two in the series released the following year. Each pair could be placed together in a vertical presentation to depict northern and southern variations in fishing techniques and prey. The 2015 series focused on hunting and as in the previous series, could be placed side by side horizontally to provide a cohesive view of the differences of north and south. In 2017, Abelsen was dismissed from her position as a teacher at the GUX-Nuuk. Administrators stated that there was an oversupply of teachers in her field. Colleagues expressed concern that she was one of the only native-born teachers and one of the few teachers with both educational and cultural training. The case was escalated by the Greenlandic Teachers' Association, amid allegations that Danish nationals received preferential hiring, in spite of a written policy requiring Greenlandic-language speakers to be given priority. The school maintained that the curriculum drove their hiring practices.

(meaning \\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\") or Pa gur, or alternatively as Ymddiddan Arthur a Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr (\\"The dialogue of Arthur and Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr\\"). It is a fragmentary, anonymous poem in Old Welsh, taking the form of a dialogue between King Arthur and the gatekeeper Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, in which Arthur boasts of his own exploits and those of his companions, especially Cai the Fair. Pa gur is notable for being one of the earliest vernacular Arthurian works, and for alluding to several early adventures of Arthur which are now lost. Its precise age is not known and has been the subject of wide-ranging disagreement, but scholarly opinion now tends to favour a date of c. 1100. Summary Pa gur is in places a very difficult text, and translations of it vary widely. This summary is based on the version of Jon B. Coe and Simon Young (see below). The poem begins with Arthur asking the porter's name. Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr duly identifies himself and returns the question, upon which Arthur names himself and says his party consists of Cai the Fair and \\"the best men in the world\\". Glewlwyd demands Arthur vouch for them, so Arthur names his men and praises their exploits: Mabon son of Modron, Uthr Pendragon's servant; Cyscaint son of Banon; Gwyn Goddyfrion; Manawydan son of Ll≈∑r, who bore \\"pierced shields from Tryfrwyd\\"; Mabon son of Mellt; Anwas the Winged and Llwch the Windy-Handed, who have been defending Edinburgh; and finally Cai, who \\"would implore them, while he slew them, three at a time.\\" The subject now turns to Arthur himself, who is said to have fought against a witch in the hall of Afarnach, against a certain Pen Palach in the dwellings of Disethach, and against dog-heads at the mount of Edinburgh. Bedwyr Perfect- Sinew slew his enemies by the hundred, and he fought ferociously on the shores of Tryfrwyd. [It has been suggested that this passage about Arthur and Bedwyr is spoken not by Arthur but by Cai.] Arthur again praises at length Cai's prowess in battle, only to interrupt himself with the reflection that > I had servants, > it was better when they were alive. \\"Before the lords of Emrys\\", Arthur says, \\"I saw Cai at haste.\\" Not only is his vengeance heavy and his anger bitter, but > When he drank from a horn > he would drink like four. So mighty a warrior is Cai that his death can only be contrived by God himself. Cai and Llachau, we are told, \\"fulfilled battles\\". Cai attacked nine witches at the peak of Ystafngwn, and lions in Anglesey. Then follows the beginning of a description of another of Cai's adversaries, the terrible cat of Palug, against whom \\"his shield was polished\\". > Nine-score soldiers > would fall as its food; > nine-score champions‚Ä¶ The rest of the poem is lost. Date and place of origin The dating of Old Welsh texts presents great problems, even the linguistic criteria for dating them not having yet been agreed on. Pa gur is a case in point. In 1959 the great linguist Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson went no further than saying that it was probably older than the Norman period. In later years Rachel Bromwich, John Bollard and A. O. H. Jarman were agreed in assigning it to the 10th or 11th century, with Brynley Roberts tentatively narrowing that down to the 10th, though John T. Koch believed that the 9th century or even the 8th was possible. However, recent scholarly opinion has tended to favour a later date of around 1100. The question of where Pa gur was written has received less attention, but Patrick Sims-Williams has suggested south-east Wales. He argues from certain similarities to, firstly, the Vita Sancti Cadocis of Lifris of Llancarfan, a work with a Glamorgan subject and author, and secondly, an episode of the Welsh romance of Peredur set in Gloucester, near the south-east Welsh border. He also interprets the poem as including a reference to the river Ely, in Glamorgan. The character of Arthur The Arthur of Pa gur is a folk-tale figure, a wandering hero leading a band of other heroes in an irresponsible life of adventures that pit them against monsters and magical adversaries, rather like the f√≠anna of early Irish literature. His companions ‚Äì including Cai and Bedwyr, both important figures in later Arthurian legend ‚Äì each have their own qualities which they can bring to any encounter, but Arthur is a fighter in his own right, not just a commander. It has been suggested that Arthur himself has supernatural powers in the poem, specifically the ability to make himself and his men invisible, though this interpretation rests on a contested translation of a difficult line. The general tone of the poem can be seen as light-hearted. At the same time, Arthur's repeated use of the past tense in his boasts about his companions' exploits arguably give them an elegiac tone, suggesting the possibility that we should see the Arthur of the poem as a man past his glory years and living in the past with a sadly diminished following. Sources and analogues Pa gur has often been compared to the tale of Culhwch and Olwen. One general similarity lies in the use both works make of allusion to a string of stories featuring Arthur and his men, but there is also a more specific one. In Pa gur the gatekeeper Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr questions Arthur's right to be admitted; in Culhwch and Olwen, where he is Arthur's gatekeeper, he similarly demands to know Culhwch's qualifications to be let in, and later in the tale the giant Wrnach Gawr's gatekeeper admits Cai after questioning him. There is no agreement as to the relationship between these three episodes, but it is possible that the author of Culhwch was burlesquing Pa gur. Alternatively, both authors may simply be drawing on the same early Arthurian traditions. There are somewhat similar episodes elsewhere in medieval literature: in the Cambro-Latin Historia Brittonum, in the Irish tale of the Second Battle of Moytura, in the late-medieval English ballad \\"King Arthur and King Cornwall\\", and possibly even in the famous 12th-century Arthurian carvings in Modena Cathedral. But, as Patrick Sims-Williams notes, \\"such exchanges with recalcitrant porters were commonplace‚Ä¶in real life, too, no doubt\\". Cath Palug, or the cat of Palug, with whom Cai fought, also appears in the Welsh Triads. Wildcats figure in later French Arthurian romances, under the name C(h)apalu in an oral tradition reported by the 14th-century Scottish chronicler John of Fordun, where they fight Caius; and in an anonymous 15th- century English story, which tells us that Arthur vanquished some wildcats by tricking them into attacking their own reflections in his glass shield. This last stratagem doubtless explains why Cai's shield was polished when fighting the cat of Palug in Pa gur. The fight at Tryfrwyd in Pa gur seems to be identical with the bellum Tribruit, listed by the Historia Brittonum as one of Arthur's twelve battles. But whereas Historia Brittonum treats the battle as historical, in Pa gur it is entirely mythical, being fought against the werewolf Garwlwyd and an army of dog-headed monsters. The nine witches of the peak of Ystafngwn have reminded some commentators of the nine witches of Gloucester in Peredur, the similar nine witches in the first Life of St Samson (an early Breton-Latin work), and the nine maidens tending the cauldron in Preiddeu Annwn. The names of some of the characters mentioned in Pa gur, such as Manawydan son of Llyr and Mabon son of Modron, belong to the world of Welsh mythology that was also drawn on in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Finally, the \\"lords of Emrys\\" referred to in the poem could be seen as relating to the character named in the Historia Brittonum and Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae as Ambrosius (\\"Emrys\\" in Welsh), but the Pa gur poet need not necessarily have known either work: it has been pointed out that Emrys was used by Welsh poets as a synonym of Gwynedd.

As of 27 November 2017, the alert level was at its highest and evacuation orders were in place. Tectonic earthquakes from the volcano had been detected since early August 2017, and volcanic activity intensified for several weeks before decreasing significantly in late October. A second, more violent period of major activity began in late November. Agung has since had eruptions in January, June, July and December 2018 and January, February, March, April, May and June 2019. Background = 1843 eruption = Agung erupted in 1843Anwari Dilmy. ¬´Pioneer Plants Found One Year After the 1963 Eruption of Agung in Bali¬ª / Pacific Science, Volume 19, Number 4, 1965, p. 498-501 as reported by Heinrich Zollinger: = 1963 eruption = Mount Agung's 1963 eruption was among the most catastrophic volcanic events in Indonesian history. After initial explosions in the crater on 18 February of that year, lava began flowing down the mountain on 24 February, eventually traveling 7 km over the next three weeks. On 17 March, a highly explosive eruption occurred, reaching a VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) of 5 and sending lethal pyroclastic flows at high speeds down the mountain's slopes, killing at least 1,500 people. Heavy rainfall mixed with ash from the eruption in the following days caused extensive lahars which killed about 200 more people. A smaller eruption occurred on 16 May, sending pyroclastic flows down the mountain once more, killing about 200 more people. By the time the eruptions ceased in early 1964, they had claimed about 1,900 lives, marking the event as the 8th deadliest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. Since 1963, the population of Bali has nearly doubled. Mount Agung is therefore considered highly dangerous by Indonesian authorities. This concern was the primary reason behind their decision to evacuate more than 100,000 people in response to the surge in local tectonic activity in the latter half of 2017.  Major activity in 2017 =August = Volcanic earthquakes were observed from 10 August 2017 and the intensity increased in the following weeks. = September = On 30 September 2017, an increase of rumbling and seismic activity around the volcano made people raise the alert to the highest level and about 122,500 people were evacuated from their homes around the volcano. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority declared a 12-kilometer exclusion zone around the volcano on 24 September. A plume was observed on 13 September. Evacuees gathered in sports halls and other community buildings around Klungkung, Karangasem, Buleleng, and other areas. The monitoring station is in Tembuku, Rendang, Karangasem Regency, where intensity and frequency of tremors were monitored for signs of the imminent large eruption. The area experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes on 25 September, and 300 to 400 earthquakes by midday on 26 September. Seismologists have been alarmed at the force and frequency of the incidents as it has taken much less for similar volcanoes to erupt.Once tremors detected, Bali volcano can erupt within hours: Volcanologist CNA, 3 October 2017 = October = In late October 2017, the activity of the volcano decreased significantly, leading to lowering of the alert status on 29 October. The alert level remained at 3 (out of 4) until the start of the second major activity period, and plumes were observed during this time. = November =  21 November  A small phreatic eruption was reported at 09:05 on 21 November (UTC), with the top of the ash cloud reaching above sea level. Thousands of people immediately fled the area, and over 29,000 temporary refugees were housed in over 270 locations nearby.Regular bulletins are posted on the website of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency.  25 November  Ash plume from Mount Agung on 27 November 2017 A magmatic eruption began early on Saturday morning, 25 November. The eruption plume rose 1.5‚Äì4 km above the summit crater, drifting towards the south and dusting the surroundings with a thin layer of dark ash, leading some airlines to cancel flights bound for Australia and New Zealand. An orange glow was later observed around the crater at night, confirming that fresh magma had reached the surface.  26 November  Map sulfur dioxide (SO2) distribution by NASA's Aura satellite after eruption, 27 November 2017 At 23:37 on 26 November (UTC), another eruption occurred. Ngurah Rai International Airport was closed next day, leaving many tourists stranded. More than 100,000 people in a radius of the volcano were ordered to evacuate.  27 November  NASA MODIS aerial view of ash from Terra satellite, 29 November 2017 Sunday 26 November's eruption continued at a constant rate, and lahars were reported in the Selat district south of the volcano. The Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology reported that the top of the eruption column had reached an altitude of 9,144 m (5.7 miles). Ash continued to spread in a southeasterly direction, and estimates by the Pacific Disaster Center predicted that the resulting atmospheric ash exposure would affect up to 5.6 million people within the densely populated region surrounding the volcano.  29 November  Reductions in eruption intensity and wind dispersal of the ash cloud led authorities to reopen Ngurah Rai International Airport at 07:00 (UTC). Authorities also warned that the eruption volume could increase again at any time, potentially shutting down air traffic once more. Activity in 2018 =January= The volcano erupted once again on 11 January, sending plumes of smoke and ash, while Indonesia's Bali international airport was declared safe, operating normally.Volcano erupts in Indonesia's Bali, airport remains safe The eruption column was reported to rise 2.5 km above the mountain. =June= Agung erupted on 12 June, sending plumes of smoke and ash some 2,000 meters above the volcano's summit. No flights were affected from the event. On 28 June, water vapour and volcanic ash emission were detected from Mount Agung up to two kilometres into the air. The Ngurah Rai Airport was closed due to the event. =July= Agung erupted again 3 July due to a minor strombolian explosion. 700 people living near the crater were evacuated. No flights were affected. =December= On the morning of 30 December, the volcano sent ash skywards as it erupted for about three minutes, spewing white clouds of smoke and ash more than 700m into the air. Several villages in Bali were covered in a thin layer of ash, but no smoke or lava was detected coming from the volcano and no evacuation has been ordered.  Major activity in 2019 =January= Agung erupted on 10 January, producing columns of volcanic ash. The summit of the volcano was covered by thick haze during eruption and thus the height of the ash could not be seen. =February= On 22 February, volcanic ash plume that rose up to estimated 14000 ft (4300 m) altitude or flight level 140 =March= Explosive activity continues on 8 March or the day after Nyepi, with a volcanic ash plume that rose up to estimated 12000 ft (3700 m) altitude or flight level 120 and is moving at 10 kts in south east direction. Mt. Agung erupted again on 28 March. Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport operated normally despite the eruption, as the airspace above the airport was declared clear of volcanic ash based on a paper test. =April= A 2,000m high column of ash erupted out of Agung on 3 April 2019. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) maintained the volcano's alert level at \\"stay on alert\\", the third level of the four-tiered alert system. The center also set the danger zone at a 4-kilometer radius from the crater. =May= In late May 2019 an eruption spewed lava and rocks over about 3 km, with some ash fall on nearby villages and temporarily interrupting international flights. =June= Another explosion occurred at the volcano at 13 June 2019, 01:38 local time. A Vulcanian eruption ejected much incandescent material to distances of at least 700 m from the crater and generated an ash plume that rose to 30,000 ft (9000 m) altitude and drifting south over Denpasar. According to PVMBG, the eruption lasted almost 10 minutes, marking it one of the longest in the recent series of such Vulcanian explosions. A small earthquake swarm and slight inflation on 12 June 2019 preceded the eruption. Impact The 2017 eruption caused some 40,000 people to be evacuated from 22 villages around Mount Agung. It also caused surrounding airports to be closed. Lombok International Airport, on the neighboring island of Lombok, closed on 26 November, but was reopened the next morning, only to be closed again on 30 November. Lombok's airport reopened on 1 December. Ngurah Rai International Airport, located at the southern tip of the island and southwest of the volcano, closed on 27 November. More than 400 flights were canceled and about 59,000 passengers remained grounded. The airport was reopened on 29 November. This eruption also caused a decline in tourism on Bali by about 30%.

Remainder of Pushkalavati can be seen around the site of Balahisar. The city goddess was also called Pushkalwati. The term Pushkalavati (Sanskrit) is a combination of two Prakrit words Pushkara or Pushkala which mean lotus (a type of flower) and 'wati or vati', mean city so Pushkalavati mean that the Lotus City. The lotus flower, which also represented Buddha in primitive sect, is still grown in Charsadda area which is a very fertile and the city had around ponds full of lotus flowers. The Syama Jataka also took place. The legendary Hariti Devi and Panchika were born here and converted to Buddhism by Lord Buddha. In 1958 \\"S.M.

The incipit is the first line, \\"Macht hoch die T√ºr, die Tor macht weit (Make high the doors, the gates make wide). The lyrics were written by Georg Weissel in 1623, for the inauguration of the Altro√üg√§rter Kirche in K√∂nigsberg. The melody that is now associated with the text appeared first in 1704 in the hymnal by Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen. \\"Macht hoch die T√ºr\\" appears as number 1 in the current German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch (EG 1). It is also part of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob (GL 218), among others. As one of the best-known and most popular Advent songs, it was translated, into English by Catherine Winkworth in 1855 as \\"Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates\\", also to Swedish and Norwegian, among others. It was also translated to Indian languages like Telugu and Tamil.  History  The lyrics were written by Georg Weissel in 1623, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Altro√üg√§rter Kirche in K√∂nigsberg on the second Sunday in Advent that year, where he was appointed minister the following Sunday. For the service of his appointment as minister the following Sunday, he wrote \\"Such, wer da will, ein ander Ziel\\". \\"Macht hoch die T√ºr\\" appears as number 1 in the current German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch (EG 1).Evangelisches Gesangbuch.

Text  \\"Macht hoch die T√ºr\\" in the Freylinghausensches Gesangbuch, 17th edition, 1734, where the popular melody was first associated with the hymn The lyrics are in five stanzas of eight lines each. The beginning is based on the call to open the gates for the King from Psalm 24, which causes the question for which king.() This passage meant originally the celebration of the entry of the Ark of the Covenant in the Temple in Jerusalem. It was early interpreted in the Christian church as referring also to the entry of Jesus in Jerusalem, narrated by Matthew () quoting Zechariah (). Both the psalm and the gospel are recommended readings in the Protestant church in Germany for the first Sunday in Advent. The last two lines of all stanzas express praise, similar to a refrain, with the first stanza praising God, the second the Saviour, the third the Comforter, the fourth the Trinity, the final one the name of God for ever. Macht hoch die T√ºr, die Tor macht weit; es kommt der Herr der Herrlichkeit, ein K√∂nig aller K√∂nigreich, ein Heiland aller Welt zugleich, der Heil und Leben mit sich bringt; derhalben jauchzt, mit Freuden singt: Gelobet sei mein Gott, mein Sch√∂pfer reich von Rat. Er ist gerecht, ein Helfer wert; Sanftm√ºtigkeit ist sein Gef√§hrt, sein K√∂nigskron ist Heiligkeit, sein Zepter ist Barmherzigkeit; all unsre Not zum End er bringt, derhalben jauchzt, mit Freuden singt: Gelobet sei mein Gott, mein Heiland gro√ü von Tat. O wohl dem Land, o wohl der Stadt, so diesen K√∂nig bei sich hat. Wohl allen Herzen insgemein, da dieser K√∂nig ziehet ein. Er ist die rechte Freudensonn, bringt mit sich lauter Freud und Wonn. Gelobet sei mein Gott, mein Tr√∂ster fr√ºh und spat. Macht hoch die T√ºr, die Tor macht weit, eu‚Äôr Herz zum Tempel zubereit‚Äô. Die Zweiglein der Gottseligkeit steckt auf mit Andacht, Lust und Freud; so kommt der K√∂nig auch zu euch, ja, Heil und Leben mit zugleich. Gelobet sei mein Gott, voll Rat, voll Tat, voll Gnad. Komm, o mein Heiland Jesu Christ, meins Herzens T√ºr dir offen ist. Ach zieh mit deiner Gnade ein; dein Freundlichkeit auch uns erschein. Dein Heilger Geist uns f√ºhr und leit den Weg zur ewgen Seligkeit. Dem Namen dein, o Herr, sei ewig Preis und Ehr.  Melodies  It took some time until the text was connected with the melody popular today. The first music for the lyrics was a five-part choral setting by Johann Stob√§us, whom Weissel knew from their time of studies in K√∂nigsberg. Stob√§us re-published in 1642 Preu√üische Fest-Lieder auf das ganze Jahr f√ºr 5‚Äì8 Stimmen by his teacher Johannes Eccard, which was first printed in 1598. He included his setting of \\"Macht hoch die T√ºr\\" in its Erster Teil (First part).Johannes Eccard: Erster Theil Der Preussischen Fest-Lieder, Elbing 1642. Nachdruck, ed. . Breitkopf & H√§rtel 1858, pp 4‚Äì5 (Digitalisat). The melody that is now associated with the text appeared first in 1704 in a hymnal by Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen, the Freylinghausen'sches Gesangbuch (Freylinghausen's Songbook), titled Geist- reiches Gesang-Buch (Song book rich in spirit).Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen: Geist-reiches Gesang-Buch. 3.

As head of the Keramisk Malerforening (Ceramic Painters Union), she successfully pressed for better pay and working conditions for those working as artists in Den Kongelige Porcelainsfabrik and Bing & Gr√∏ndahl porcelain factories. She also campaigned internationally for women's rights. Biography Born in Vladivostok, Russia, on 7 September 1872, Thyra Beate Christiane Manicus-Hansen was the daughter of the telegraph manager Emil Anton Hansen (1827-1906) and Helene Mathilde Manicus (1840-1929). At the time of her birth, the family happened to be in Vladivostok where her father represented the Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab. He and the family later moved to France and England where Manicus-Hansen was brought up. On her father's retirement in 1892, the family finally settled in Copenhagen. In 1898, Manicus-Hansen was employed as one of the many painters at the Kongelige Porcelainsfabrik. She lived with her sister Xiane who also worked there. Despite the fact that the porcelain they decorated was produced for the royal houses of Europe, the salaries were extremely low. When the management failed to respond to their requests for improved wages, in 1905 they decided to club together, forming the trades union known as the Keramisk Malerforening, with some 80 members from the Kongelige Porcelainsfabrik and from Bing & Gr√∏ndahl. Manicus-Hansen headed the union. After a conflict, she was fired but 40 of her colleagues went on strike. The firm's management finally relented and the women were all re-engaged. Manicus-Hansen remained president of the union until 1934 and worked at the porcelain factory until 1936 when she retired on grounds of poor health. From 1909 to 1934, she was also a member of the management committee of Keramisk Forbund which she represented at the 1909 congress of the French ceramic union. With the threat of World War I, Manicus-Hansen also campaigned for the peace movement. She attended the international women's peace conference in The Hague in 1915, together with other Danish activists including Clara Tybjerg, Thora Daugaard and Andrea Brochmann. She went on to establish the Danish branch of what became the Women's International League for Peace and Freedon. Thyra Manicus-Hansen died in Copenhagen on 29 August 1954. She is buried in the Assistens Cemetery.

Origin  The exact origin of lakhori bricks is not confirmed, especially if they existed, or not, prior to becoming more prevalent in use during the Mughal India. Prior to the rise in frequent use of lakhori bricks during Mughal India, Indian architecture primarily used trabeated prop and lintel (point and slot) gravity-based technique of shaping large stones to fit into each other that required no mortar. The reason lakhori bricks became more popular during the Mughal period, starting from Shah Jahan's reign, is mainly because lakhori bricks that were used to construct structures with the typical elements of Mughal architecture such as arches, jalis, jharokas, mouldings, cornices, cladding, etc. were easy to create intricate patterns due to the small shape and slim size of lakhori bricks.Madhulika Liddle, 2015, Crimson City Regional, socio- strata and dimensional variations The slim and compact Lakhorie bricks became popular across pan-Indian subcontinental Mughal Empire, specially in North India, resulting in several variations in their dimensions as well as due to the use of lower strength local soil by poor people and higher strength clay by affluent people. Restoration architect author Anil Laul reasons that poor people used local soil to bake slimmer bricks using locally available cheaper dung cakes as fuel and richer people used higher-end thicker and bigger bricks made of higher strength clay baked in kilns using not so easily locally available more expensive coal, both methods yielded bricks of similar strength but different proportions at different economic levels of strata. =Lakhori bricks versus Nanak Shahi bricks = Mughal1700.pngMughal Empire at its largest spread during the late 17th to early 18th centuries; where lakhori bricks became popular since Shah Jahan's reign. Sikh_Empire_tri- lingual.jpgSikh Empire at its largest spread in the north-west Indian subcontinent during 1839 CE; where usage of Nanak Shahi bricks became more popular. Due to the lack of understanding, sometimes contemporary writers confuse the lakhori bricks with other similar but distinct regional variants. For example, some writers use \\"Lakhori bricks and Nanak Shahi bricks\\" implying two different things, and others use \\"Lakhori bricks or Nanak Shahi bricks\\" inadvertently implying either same or two different things, leading to confusion as if they are same, especially if these words are casually mentioned interchangeably. Lakhori bricks were used by Mughal Empire that spanned across the Indian subcontinent, whereas Nanak Shahi bricks were used mainly across the Sikh Empire, that was spread across Punjab region in north- west Indian subcontinent, when Sikhs were in conflict with Mughal Empire due to the religious persecution of Sikhs by Mughal Muslims. Coins struck by Sikh rulers between 1764 CE to 1777 CE were called \\"Govind Shahi\\" coins (bearing inscription in the name of Guru Govind Singh), and coins struck from 1777 onward were called \\"Nanak Shahi\\" coins (bearing inscription in the name of Guru Nanak).Charles J. Rodgers, 1894, \\"Coin Collection in Northern India\\".Sun, Sohan Lal, 1885-89, \\"Umdat-ut-Twarikh\\", Lahore. A similar concept applies to the Nanak Shahi bricks of Sikh Empire, i.e. Lakhori and Nanak Shahi bricks being two similar, but a different type of bricks due to the regional variations as well as political reasons. Closely related similar things may be considered separate, and on the other hand considerably different things might be considered the same, in both cases due to the social-political-religious contextual reasons, for example closely related mutually intelligible Sanskritised-Hindustani language Hindi versus Arabised-Hindustani language Urdu being favored as separate languages by Hindus and Muslims respectively as seen in the context of Hindu-Muslim conflict that resulted in Partition of India, whereas mutually unintelligible speech varieties that differ considerably in structure such as Moroccan Arabic, Yemeni Arabic and Lebanese Arabic are considered the same language due to the pan-Islamism religious movement.Yaron Matras, 2010, Romani in Britain: The Afterlife of a Language: The Afterlife of a Language, Edinburgh University Press, p.5]Julie Tetel Andresen, Phillip M.

Wyley was co-owned by James Abbott and Thomas Finchley, two businessmen in the fur trade who operated a store in the vicinity of Fort Detroit. It is not known when or how she came to be in their possession. In mid-1774, Wyley was charged with stealing a collection of items from her slave owners, including a purse containing six guineas, a handkerchief, two pairs of women's shoes, and a piece of flannel. Another of the firm's laborers, Jean Contencineau (probably an indentured servant), was also charged as an accomplice, while a third worker, Charles Landry, confessed to involvement but was let free; the two men had both stolen beaver, otter, and raccoon skins. Wyley and Contencineau were additionally charged with arson, as they were alleged to have lit a fire to cover their traces. After their arrest, Wyley and Contencineau did not face trial until mid-1776, spending that time imprisoned in Fort Detroit. The town notary and justice of the peace, Philippe DeJean, granted the pair a jury trial. They were acquitted of arson, as there was only circumstantial evidence, but found guilty of the burglary; Contencineau had testified that Wyley was the \\"mastermind\\" of their scheme. As the fort had suffered a recent spate of petty thefts, DeJean wished to make an example of them. He sentenced them to death, a decision ratified by Lieutenant-Governor Henry Hamilton. Wyley and Contencineau were publicly hanged on March 27, 1777. According to some sources, DeJean offered to pardon Wyley if she performed Contencineau's execution herself, as no one else was willing to serve as executioner.

She accompanied her husband, a volunteer who rose to the rank of colonel, throughout the war. Three of her sons were killed in the struggle. She is remembered for her willingness to sacrifice her family and herself to achieve independence from Spain, and came to be known as \\"La Generala\\". She fought alongside Jose Maria Moreles until her death. Women's Role in the War of Independence  In more urban areas, women worked as servants or street vendors, selling from food to clothes. If these women were not in the market place, they were back in their homes doing domestic housework, as in cooking and cleaning. In Spain women who did this work were considered honorable, and if women were seen as homeless or ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù, they would be placed into homes in order to be re-educated or work as prostitutes. Women who fought in the war were battling against times of oppression brought on by Spaniards, but they also fought to help the soldiers who were usually loved ones. Early years (1779‚Äì1810) Antonia Nava de Catal√°n was born in Tixtla on 17 November 1779. Her parents were Nicol√°s Nava and Mar√≠a Celestina. She married Nicol√°s Catal√°n, the oldest son of Nicolasa Catal√°n, born in Chilpancingo in 1772. They had five sons, Nicol√°s, Manuel, Antonio, Pedro and one whose name is unknown, and three daughters, Teresa, Mar√≠a and Margarita. After their marriage, they moved from Tixtla to Chilpancingo, where they settled for a short time, until Nicol√°s Catal√°n had an argument with his father, and then moved to Jaleaca. The family was living in Jaleaca when the war of independence broke out in September 1810. The war of independence put their marriage to the test until they found General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, who gave them security as to what would be the outcomes of the war. Acapulco (1810‚Äì1811) Nicol√°s Catal√°n joined General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos at the end of 1810. Antonia Nava accompanied him throughout the war. She persuaded many poor women to help the insurgents by acting as cooks and porters, and started a women's battalion. They found Morelos in the Cerro El Veladero mountains above Acapulco. Morelos had received orders from Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla to raise a rebellion in the south and take the port of Acapulco. On 4 January 1811 Morelos successfully attacked Tres Palos, taking many prisoners and much booty. Nicol√°s Catal√°n fought with distinction in this action. Nicol√°s Catal√°n became a corporal in February 1811. On 8 February 1811 Morelos advanced on Acapulco. He thought the Spanish sergeant Jos√© Gago had agreed to give up the place for money, but Gago broke his word and when they reached the Fort of San Diego they came under heavy fire. Morelos retreated. He thought Nicol√°s Catal√°n, who was at the head of the column, had been killed, but later he showed up unharmed. One of the Catal√°n sons died in El Fort√≠n in the port of Acapulco. It is said that Morelos called Antonia Nava to him so he could console her after her son had been killed by the royalists. She replied \\"I do not come to mourn. I do not regret the death of my son. I know he did his duty. I come to bring you my other four sons. Three can serve as soldiers and one, who is small, will be a drummer.\\" Ongoing struggle (1811‚Äì1817) After this, on 3 May 1811 the revolutionaries left for Chilpancingo, where Morelos prepared for the capture of Tixtla, which fell at noon on 26 May 1811. On 13 September 1813, to celebrate the Congress of Chilpancingo in which Mexico formally declared itself to be independent of Spain, Antonia Nava and Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de Nava prepared food for the revolutionaries and the people. By 1813 Nicol√°s Catal√°n was a captain. Their son Manuel Catal√°n died in Tixtla, in the Paso de Mezcala, on 21 January 1814. Nicol√°s Catal√°n was assigned to the command of Nicol√°s Bravo and in September 1816 was made Lieutenant Colonel. Along with other women, Gertrudis Bocanegra and Leona Vicario, who also fought during the Mexican War of Independence, Antonia Nava de Catal√°n, demonstrated that women were able to take part in combat rather than just do the traditional cooking, cleaning, and providing health care. Cerro del Campo (February 1817) In February 1817 the army of General Nicol√°s Bravo and his lieutenant, Don Nicol√°s Catal√°n, took refuge in a strong point in the Cerro del Campo within sight of Jaleaca. They were surrounded by the royalist forces of Jos√© Gabriel de Armijo for 50 days and suffered unbearable hunger. They agreed to sacrifice one soldier out of every ten to serve as food for the troops. The women led by Antonia Nava, with her sister-in-law Mar√≠a Catal√°n and Catalina Gonz√°lez, the wife of Nicol√°s Bautista, offered to sacrifice themselves. Catalina Gonz√°lez offered herself as the first woman to be sacrificed instead. This was refused, but the offer had roused the fighting spirit of the revolutionaries. When asked what they should do, Antonia Nava said it was better to die fighting than to sacrifice themselves, it was 11:00 at night and the enemy was sleeping. She said, \\"Give us women weapons and together we will break the siege\\". The women armed themselves with machetes and clubs and went out to fight the enemy. They escaped on 14 March 1817. After this Antonia Nava was called \\"La Generala\\". A 1910 account of the incident ends with \\"Blessed are you, O Mexican land, in whose bosom such wonderful daughters sleep!\\". Later events (1817‚Äì43) In November 1818 troops led by Pedro Ascencio and Antonia's son Nicol√°s Catal√°n, attacked Coyuca. Nicol√°s, a First Sergeant (Sargento primero), died in November 1818 at Coyuca, now called Coyuca de Catal√°n. In the last part of the war Nicol√°s Catal√°n senior was under Vicente Guerrero. He was promoted to colonel on 19 April 1820. Antonia and two of her children were present at the signing of the Plan of Iguala on 24 February 1821 and at the entrance of the Army of the Three Guarantees into Mexico City on 27 September 1821, riding next to her husband, Nicol√°s Catal√°n. Nicol√°s Catal√°n was promoted to brigadier general in 1823, and on 24 January 1828 was made commander of the state of Guerrero. The family settled in Chilpancingo. Nicol√°s Catal√°n the elder died in 1838. Antonia Nava de Catal√°n died in Chilpancingo on 19 March 1843, aged 63. The three children she had lost during the struggle are considered young heroes by the people of Guerrero. Jaleaca became Jaleaca de Catal√°n by decree 15 of 3 June 1889. Impact on Soldaderas After the Mexican War of Independence women were seen as indispensable and continued to contribute to the wars after the War of Independence, like the soldaderas that fought during the Mexican Revolution. Many male generals did not believe that women should be used in battle to the belief that they would be more useful in cooking and providing healthcare to their wounded male soldiers. The women helped keep many of the soldiers well and alive. The roles of women were less of fighting on the battlefield and more domestic work, even so, women were seen as one of the most important fighters of this battles. Antonia Nava de Catal√°n along with other women involved in the war was seen as a heroic figure that encouraged other women to join the war and bring courage to other soldiers throughout the years even during the Mexican Revolution.  Public Recognition  Statue of Antonia Nava de Catal√°n in Tixtla de Guerrero. In honor of her heroism, Tixtla De Guerrero placed a statue of her on February 15, 1987. In the Municipal Presidency of Tixtla, there is a painting where she is seen holding her son in her arms. In Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, three schools were named after her.

The bank occupied the northwest corner of the building and it remained here for forty years. The hotel occupied the southern portion of the building and then it expanded to the east with a new addition not long after its initial construction.

First isolated from washed cultivated dinoflagellates, they have been reported to have mutualistic as well as pathogenic symbioses with dinoflagellates. Cell morphology and physiology D. shibae cells are Gram-negative cocci, or occasionally ovoid rods that measure 0.3 ‚Äì 0.7 Œºm in width and 0.3 ‚Äì 1.0 Œºm in length. They are motile and have a single polar flagellum. When grown in the dark, colonies have a distinct pink or light red pigmentation, while under strong illumination they are beige. They contain bacteriochlorophyll a and the carotenoid pigment spheroidenone and have absorption spectrum peaks at 804 and 868 nm. The carotenoid leads to an extended absorption spectrum including 400 ‚Äì 600 nm. D. shibae cells use light as a supplementary energy source and don't use it to fix inorganic carbon. Colonies grown on complex agar media appear deep red in color. D. shibae is a facultative anaerobe that requires 1-7% salinity and grows between 15 and 38 ¬∞C with an optima temperature of 33 ¬∞C. Its optimal pH range is 6.5 ‚Äì 9.0. While most of the organisms in the Roseobacter clade are obligate aerobes, D. shibae is able to grow anaerobically using electron acceptors nitrate and dimethyl sulfoxide. It has a complete denitrification pathway for energy production. A variety of organic substrates including acetate, succinate, fumarate, malate, lactate, citrate, glutamate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose and glycerol can support heterotrophic growth. Like others in the Roseobacter clade, ethanol, methanol and butyrate do not support growth. D. shibae can synthesize vitamins B_1 and B_{12}, of which its dinoflagellate host is auxotrophic. Environment and ecology Members of the Roseobacter clade are widely associated with marine phytoplankton such as dinoflagellates and diatoms in the water column as well as shallow sediments. They play important roles in the carbon cycle by assimilating dissolved organic matter produced by phytoplankton and also in the sulfur cycle by removing DMS from the algal osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).Wang H, Tomasch J, Jarek M, Wagner-Dobler I: A dual-species co-cultivation system to study the interactions between Roseobacters and dinoflagellates. Frontiers of Microbiology 2014, 5:311. Their close association with eukaryotic phytoplankton is supported by phylogenomic evidence suggesting that the Roseobacter lineage diverged from other Alphaproteobacteria at the same moment as the Mesozoic radiation of phytoplankton. Traits involved in symbioses of D. shibae include flagelar synthesis and type IV secretion system under the control of N-acyl homoserine lactone intercellular signal molecules (quorum sensing). D. shibae forms symbioses with Prorocentrum minimum, a toxic red tide-forming dinoflagellate, as well as other dinoflagellates associated with toxic algal blooms. In a mutualistic association, the P. minimum provides carbon sources and some vitamins essential for growth, and while D. shibae provides vitamins B_1 and B_{12}. In co-culture, this mutualism changes to pathogenicity as the bacteria induce death in the algae cells, but algicidal compounds produced by D. shibae have yet to be identified. P. minimum has a global marine distribution, suggesting that its symbiont does as well. Genome D. shibae‚Äôs genome is 4417 kbp long, which is in line with other Roseobacter clade genomes. Included in this count are its large circular genome and five circular plasmids. The GC-content of D. shibae is 66%. Based on comparative sequence analysis of the circular plasmids, they were likely acquired through conjugation and two sister plasmids contain the vir operon encoding the type IV secretion system required for the formation of sex pili. Other traits encoded on the plasmids include degradation of aromatic compounds and carbon monoxide oxidation. As opposed to ABC transporters, the D. shibae genome suggests a preference for tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters (TRAP) for uptake of nutrients like C4-dicarboxylates, pyruvate, glutamate, sialic acid, ectoine and 2,3-diketogulonate. D. shibae‚Äôs genome encodes for 27 complete TRAP systems. Discovery and Isolation D. shibae was first isolated in 2003 with two strains, both isolated from washed single cells of cultivated marine dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum lima and Alexandrium ostenfeldii). Etymology The genus Dinoroseobacter name originates from the Greek dinos meaning whirling rotation and the first part of Dinophyceae (dinoflagellates) from which it was isolated, and Roseobacter a bacterial genus with similar traits. Shibae was named after Professor Tsuneo Shiba who discovered the marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria.

Her defense team led by John Jameson argued an affirmative defense: Celia killed Robert Newsom by accident in self defense to stop Newsom from raping her, which was a controversial argument at the time. Celia was ultimately executed by hanging following a denied appeal in December 1855. Celia's memory was revitalized by civil rights activist Margaret Bush Wilson who commissioned a portrait of Celia from Solomon Thurman.  Background  Not much is known of Celia's origins or early childhood. Robert Newsom, a yeoman farmer, acquired approximately 14 year old Celia in Audrain County in 1850 to act as his concubine after his wife had died the previous year. However, this purpose may have been masqueraded as acquiring a domestic servant for his daughter Virginia Waynescott or as a same-aged companion for his youngest child Mary Newsom. On the way back to Callaway County, Newsom sexually assaulted Celia for the first time. Newsom housed Celia separately from his other five slaves, all male, in a cabin close to the main house. Celia became involved with George, one of Newsom's four adult male slaves, and began sharing this cabin with him by the beginning of 1855. Celia had three children, at least one of which was indisputably Robert Newsom's. Sometime during Celia's incarceration, Celia delivered her third child. Earlier historians reported that this child was stillborn. More recent scholarship posits this child was sold following birth and is from whom Celia's living descendants are descended. Following her execution, Harry Newsom, one of Robert Newsom's adult sons, may have acquired one of her daughters, because a female enslaved child appears in his household in the 1860 census. According to the probate court of Callaway County, Celia's daughters were sold in the year following her execution. It is unknown where Celia's remains are interred.  State of Missouri vs. Celia, a Slave  In early 1855, Celia, approximately nineteen, conceived for the third time, and the father of the child was uncertain. At this time, George demanded Celia cut off her relationship with Robert Newsom. Celia repeatedly requested, demanded, and threatened Newsom to stop sexually coercing her.\\"Sworn Statement of William Powell\\". 25 June 1855. Retrieved 28 February 2020. On June 23, 1855, when Newsom came to her cabin that night, Celia struck Newsom twice with a large stick, killing him with the second blow.\\"Sworn Statement of Celia, a Slave\\" (PDF). 25 June 1855. Retrieved 28 February 2020. She burned his body in her fireplace while her two children slept through the confrontation. The following day, the search party consisting of the Newsom household and William Powell, a neighboring farmer, questioned first George and then Celia, who after sustained questioning, eventually confessed. Celia repeatedly denied George's involvement in the planning or execution of the murder, as well as the disposal of the body. After Celia's arrest, George was sold to another family. The State of Missouri vs. Celia, a Slave ran from June 25 to October 10, 1855. Celia's testimony does not appear in the trial records because at that time in Missouri, slaves were not allowed to testify in their own defense if their word disputed a white person's. Judge William Augustus Hall appointed Celia's defense team: John Jameson, the lead defense attorney and himself a slave owner, Nathan Chapman Kouns, and recent law school graduate Isaac M. Boulware. The defense contended Newsom's death was justifiable homicide and argued that Celia, even though she was a slave, was entitled by Missouri law to use deadly force to defend herself against sexual coercion. The defense based their argument off of the Missouri statue of 1845, which declared \\"any woman\\" could be the victim of sexual assault; the defense argued \\"any woman\\" included enslaved women like Celia. Judge Hall denied the defense's jury instruction to acquit based on the sexual assault\\"Proposed Instruction to the Jury by the Defense\\" (PDF) 9 October 1855. Retrieved 28 February 2020. and denied the jury any ability to acquit on grounds for self-defense or to find Celia justified to ward off her master's sexual advances with force or at all. Celia's jury consisted entirely of white male farmers, four of whom were slave owners, convicted Celia on October 10, 1855. Celia's defense team filed a motion for a retrial based on alleged judicial misconduct by Judge Hall; this motion was overruled by the judge, and Celia was sentenced on October 13, 1855 to be executed by hanging November 16, 1855. The defense appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, but the judge did not grant a stay of execution. Celia escaped Callaway Country Jail on November 11 and remained at large until the beginning of December in order to prevent her death before the Supreme Court could rule on her case. Harry Newsom returned Celia to the jail after she escaped. The Callaway Circuit Court ruled against Celia's stay of execution on December 18, 1855 as there was no doubt she had killed Robert Newsom, and they judged her motives irrelevant.\\"Supreme Court Order denying Celia's petition for a stay of execution pending appeal\\" (PDF). 14 December 1855. Retrieved 28 February 2020. The night before her execution, Celia gave a full confession and once again denied that anyone had helped her, including George. This confession was reported in the Fulton Telegraph and published no mention of the sexual abuse by Newsom or Celia's children by him. On December 21, 1855, Celia was hanged at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Celia through history and popular culture  Celia's trial was widely reported on. Papers hundreds of miles away reported on her arrest. William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator repeated the early supposition that Newsom's death was without motive. Mary Ann Shadd Cary's Provincial Freeman, all the way in Canada, and The New York Times reported on her execution, all without details of her case or motive. Local newspapers like the Fulton Telegraph and Brunswick Weekly Brunswicker included the details of the murder but not her motive. While no photographs, contemporary portraits, or written descriptions of Celia are known to exist, Margaret Bush Wilson revitalized Celia's memory when she learned about her case in 1940 and later commissioned Solomon Thurman in 1990 to create a portrait of Celia. Since 2004, Callawegians in Fulton, Missouri hold a public event commemorated Celia's life on the anniversary of her execution. Celia's commemoration is often used as an opportunity to raise awareness about racism, sexism, domestic violence, and the historical intersection of slavery and sexual violence in America. Both Solomon Thurman and Melton McLaurin, the author of Celia's most popular biography, have attended this event honoring Celia. Two plays have been written about Celia: * Pawley, Thomas, III.

It shows the Martyred Saint in an atypical kneeling posture which has led some scholars to believe it to be a compositional quotation of various works by other great masters whom the artist admired. The painting is currently on display in the Palencia Cathedral. An uncertain history and ownership The precise details of the provenance of this particular work are, of necessity, based largely on conjecture. Based on stylistic clues and the available documentation, scholars have dated it to El Greco's first decade in Spain, or roughly 1576-79. Many scholars have suggested that as El Greco's first major commission in Spain, the decoration of three altarpieces in the convent Santo Domingo el Antiguo (Monastery of Saint Dominic of Silos (the Old))‚Äîas indicated by a contract signed a month after that for The Disrobing of Christ which would hang in the vestry of the Cathedral at Toledo‚Äîwas obtained for him by Diego de Castilla, dean of the cathedral and father of El Greco's friend Luis it might be logically assumed that the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian was painted for the same patron. Indeed, the assumption, based on stylistic similarity and the historical timeline of the Cretan painter's career, seems to have obtained such currency that Johnathan Brown, for example, in his discussion of the Palencia Sebastian, simply notes that it was ‚Äúpossibly painted for Diego de Castilla‚Äù without further discussion.Brown, ‚ÄúEl Greco and Toledo,‚Äù 141. And yet, this assignment of patronage is not universally accepted. Providing an alternative theory of how the painting came to Palencia, Jesus San Martin Payo, based on his study of a sixteenth century manuscript by Dr. Ascencio Garcia on the history of the diocese of Palencia, suggests that the painting was originally owned by Don Juan Alonso de Cordoba the ‚Äúright arm of the bishop don Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas, patron of the chapel of San Jeronimo, and in whose sacristy‚Äù (brazo derecho del obispo don Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas, patrono de la capilla de San Jeronimo, y en cuya sacristia)San Martin Payo. ‚ÄúGestiones Realizadas Por El Cabildo De Palencia Para Encontrar y Trasladar El Cuerpo de su Patrono S. Antolin 1606-1609 Con la Vida y Martririo del Santo‚Äù [Proceedings Carried Out By The Cabildo De Palencia To Find and Relocate The Body of its Patron S. Antolin 1606-1609 With the Life and Martyrdom of the Saint], 181. the painting by El Greco can currently be found. As Juan Ramirez Zapata de Cardenas served as Bishop of the diocese from 1570 until his death in 1577, this alternative theory would indicate that the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian would actually predate El Espolio, or The Disrobing of Christ, which is generally considered the artist's first known Spanish work. The painting at Palencia Cathedral Theme The painting depicts Saint Sebastian, as a victim of Diocletian's suppression of Christianity during the 4th century AD. According to popular legend, Sebastian was bound to a tree and shot with arrows, but was miraculously rescued and healed, only to achieve martyrdom when he was clubbed to death shortly thereafter. Saint Sebastian is a popular saint in both the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox traditions. Pierced with arrows‚Äîa symbol associated with divine punishment in the form of pestilence since antiquity‚Äîand yet miraculously saved from near death, Saint Sebastian was often invoked to intercede on the behalf of plague victims in the 15th and 16th centuries when the painting would have first been put on display.Gelpi, ‚ÄúSaint Sebastian and the Black Death,‚Äù 26. Perhaps because of the popularity of Saint Sebastian during the second plague pandemic, or because his martyrdom offered Counter-Reformation era artists one of the few opportunities to portray the nude in religious art,Liepa, ‚ÄúThe Image of Saint Sebastian in Art.‚Äù 459. there are numerous examples of the Saint painted by El Greco and his contemporaries and an established iconographical schema for his portrayal. Description The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, as noted by Brown, is painted in the late-Renaissance style and shows El Greco's Italian training to fine advantage. The figure is graceful and naturalistic. The eyes are cast heavenward, either in communion with god or in acceptance of his own impending death. El Greco's Sebastian seems resigned to, or perhaps even enjoying his martyrdom. While perhaps slightly elongated, the solitary nude figure is solidly fleshy and certainly shows none of the extreme exaggeration in contrasting highlights or pigmentation for which the artist would later be known. Behind the figure, a somewhat stormy landscape is indicated with loose, gestural brushstrokes. Similar to most portrayals, the saint is shown bound to a tree and pierced in the side with an arrow. And yet, the Palencia Sebastian, unlike El Greco's other surviving portrayal of the saint, currently in the Museo del Prado, deviates in one significant way from the traditional iconography. Rather than painting a standing figure, as most artists portraying the saint did and as he would in the Prado Sebastian, the Palencia Sebastian is crouched in a kneeling posture, bound to the tree by a rope that passes around a raised arm, the bulk of his weight supported by the large rock on which El Greco signed the painting. Comparisons with Michelangelo and Titian The Genius of Victory by Michelangelo (1532-4) Much has been made of this unusual posture. As Andrew Casper says in his Art and the Religious image in El Greco's Italy, the figure in Saint Sebastian is a quotation of a ‚Äúfigure taken from Michelangelo's body of work‚Äîthough scholars do not agree on which one.‚ÄùCasper, Art and the Religious Image in El Greco's Italy.Detail from Titian's Averoldi Altarpiece Certainly a number of scholars have made much of the seeming comparison between El Greco's Sebastian and various figures from Michelangelo's body of work. In his work on El Greco, Michael Scholz-Hansel states without prelude that the figure is ‚Äúbased on Michelangelo as well as on the renowned Greco-Roman statue of Laoco√∂n and His Sons which the artist had evidently studied in the original.‚ÄùScholz-Hansel, El Greco, 45. Based on a visual comparison of the posture of the Palencia Sebastian with Michelangelo's statue of The Genius of Victory, produced for the tomb of Julius II and now in the Palazzo Vecchio, Harold Wethey argues that Sebastian's unique posture in El Greco's painting was based on Michelangelo's sculpture, and is thus evidence of the esteem in which the painter held the giant of renaissance art, his own documented words notwithstanding. For Wethey, El Greco's supposed quotation of Michelangelo's sculpture indicates that El Greco's statement to Pacheco that Michelangelo did not know how to paint is better understood embedded within the context of the longstanding aesthetic debate over the relative virtues of 'disegno e colore' [design or drawing and color] and that, rather than a criticism of Michelangelo per ce, it merely establishes that El Greco felt firmly that color is more important than design when it comes to painting.Wethey, ‚ÄúEl Greco in Rome and the Portrait of Vincenzo Anastagi,‚Äù 175. Similarly, in a detailed analysis of El Greco's various recorded statements on Michelangelo, George A. Rodetis compares the posture of El Greco's Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian with that of the Punishment of Haman in Michelangelo's fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, suggesting that El Greco's emulation of the Florentine artist indicates that his derogatory statements about the painting skills of the latter can be better understood more as an indictment of the limits of fresco to portray the spiritual essence of a scene than a complaint about Michelangelo's mastery of his medium.Rodetis, ‚ÄúEl Greco's Statements on Michelangelo the Painter,‚Äù 30-34. And yet, Rodetis does not base his entire analysis of El Greco's opinion of Michelangelo or his thoughts on the paragone [comparison of or rivalry between] relating to disegno and colore on certain compositional similarities of El Greco's work with that of Michalengelo. Indeed, he makes a point of clarifying that the seeming similarity of posture between Michelangelo's tortured Haman and El Greco's Sebastian might not necessarily indicate that the Cretan painter was paying homage to the Florentine and suggests as equally, if not more, probable the possibility that El Greco, familiar with Titian's treatment of Saint Sebastian in his Averoldi Altarpiece, might have used the Venetian master's work as a model.Rodetis, ‚ÄúEl Greco's Statements on Michelangelo the Painter,‚Äù 30. The Sebastian depicted by Titian is, like El Greco's hanging from bonds which tie his elbows to a tree, and that, similar to El Greco's signature on the stone under the saint's left knee, Titian chose to sign his piece on the stone under his Sebastian's foot.

Biography  = Life in Tibet = Lobsang Dolma was born in 1934 in Kyirong, a region of western Tibet, in the Khangkar family. After the death of her brothers, she was the sole descendant of Tsewang Sangmo (Lobsang Dechen), her mother and Dingpon Tsering Wangdu, her father, a physician, whom she assisted in her administrative duties. In 1955, under intensive teaching by Dragtonpa, one of Kyirong's governors, Lobsang Dolma and her husband attended a two-year graduate program in Tibetan grammar under the direction of Pelbar Geshe Rinpoche (1893-1985) in the Rab-nga Riwo Pelbar Samten Phug hermitage and the Phagpa Wati Sangpo temple in Kyirong. Lobsang Dolma turns out to be a brilliant student. In 1956, both spouses received training in astrology from Pelbar Geshe Rinpoche. In 1957-1958, she received instruction on Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan medicine from the same teacher. She wanted to deepen her knowledge of this discipline, and her father invited Changpa, a Tibetan doctor both for his daughter and to meet the needs of doctors in the area. At the request of his father, they elaborate medicines that are distributed free of charge to patients. = Flight into exile = In 1959, she reached the Tibet-Nepal border and moved to Nepal where she practices a rigorous meditation on Vajrayogini. In 1961, she joined Pathankot, in northern India, with 2,000 Tibetan refugees. She has to earn a living by participating in road construction for over a year in Palampur, Manali, Lalethang, Chalithang and Lahoul. In early 1962, Lobsang Dolma and other Tibetan workers from Manali traveled to Dharamsala to receive blessing from the 14th Dalai Lama and Trijang Rinpoche. The latter asks her to stay in Dharamsala, and to join the Tibetan Institute of Medicine and Astrology (Men- Tsee-Khang) which has just been founded by the Tibetan government in exile. However, Lobsang Dolma's request to join the center is rejected by the Tibetan administration in exile, because at the time women were not accepted in this institution, and she must resume her work of building roads. In 1964, she moved to Dalhousie with her husband and both worked at the Central School for Tibetans. The children then affectionately call her Ama Lobsang Dolma, a nickname that has remained attached to her. The opinion of Trijang Rinpoche and a request from Geshe Bayu led her to practice medicine again. In 1970, she resigned from her post at the Tibetan Central School and opened a private clinic in Dalhousie, where her growing reputation brought with it a crowd of monks, Indian, and Tibetans. = Chief Medical Officer of Men-Tsee-Khang = After the oldest doctors of Men-Tsee-Khang of Dharamsala, Tro Gawo Gyurme Ngawang Samphel Rinpoche (Trogawa Rinpoche, 1932-2005), Kurung Peltsewa Norlha Phuntsok Dradul (1932-1972), and Yeshi Donden resigned from their posts, the Tibetan administration appointed Lobsang Dolma to Dharamsala where she moved with her family. On 5 July 1972, Lobsang Dolma joined the Men-Tsee-Khang where she became the main doctor, while her husband, Dozur Tsering Wangyal, joined the pharmaceutical center. She was appointed chief physician of the Men-Tsee- Khang, and as a result, she was given the title of \\"doctor of the Dalai Lama\\"Tsewang Dolkar Khangkar, Marie-Jos√© Lamothe, M√©decin du toit du monde, Editions du Rocher, 1997, , Chapitre ¬´ Dharamsala ¬ª. Lobsang Dolma has traveled abroad several times. She met in particular Jeffrey Hopkins at the University of Virginia, USA, where she gave lectures on Tibetan medicine. In 1978, she went to the Vajrapani Institute in California for 3 months, and at the University of Wisconsin where she gave intensive training in Tibetan medicine for 2 weeks. At the invitation of the Institute of Jungian Psychology, she conducted a 10 - day workshop in Zurich. At the invitation of World Health Organization and endorsed by the Tibetan Administration, she is attending the International Congress of Traditional Chinese Medicine at the Australian National University of Canberra, Australia, 1-7 September 1979. She gave courses on diagnostics in Tibetan medicine on this occasion. In 1975, her husband died, and she remarried to Norbu Chophel, the assistant of Trijang Rinpoche. On July 15, 1976, she took the vows of a lay woman from Trijang Rinpoche. = Transfer to private medical practice = Following her prolonged absence from the Men-Tsee-Khang, she was relieved of her duties on 1 September 1978, and she built her own private clinic, which was inaugurated on 1 March 1979. In mid-October 1982, she fell seriously ill, and performed religious rituals as suggested by Ling Rinpoche, and her health gradually improves. At the invitation of Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche , she participated in the first international convention on Tibetan medicine in Venice from April 26 to 30, 1983, and in Arcidosso from May 2 to 7, 1983. She cared for many women and children, and gave lectures on various pediatric and gynecological problems. She then went to Holland, where she stayed a month at the request of the Dutch Foundation for Tibetan Medicine. Lobsang Dolma traveled to southern India and visited various Tibetan monasteries and refugee institutions, including the Mundgod Seniors House, which she helped financially and medically. With two visits to Nepal, she was able to see her former teacher, Pelbar Geshe Rinpoche again in 1985. In addition to her clinical activity in Dharamsala, she practiced medicine for free sometimes in Pathankot, Amritsar (at the request of Satwan Singh and Kulwant Singh, officials of the Golden Temple, and Mahesh Chopra Memorial Hospital), Calcutta, New Delhi, Yogi Mahajan's Ashram, and Jalandhar. In August 1985, she traveled to Nubra and Saspol in Ladakh, as well as to the Tibetan camp at Puruwala in Mussoorie. In 1986, she went to Hamipur. In 1988, she went to Kyidrong Samten Ling, Kathmandu. Among her students were her daughters, Pasang Gyalmo and Tsewang Dolkar Khangkar, as well as Khyunglung Thogme Thinley Dorje and Purang Tsewang Namgyal.

FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate and has discovered that the killer was Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), who acted while possessed by a demonic entity, Killer BOB (Frank Silva). At the end of the original series, BOB trapped Cooper in the Black Lodge, an extra-dimensional place, and let out Cooper's doppelg√§nger to use him for physical access to the world. 25 years later, Cooper's doppelg√§nger roams freely through the world, with Cooper still inside the Lodge.David Lynch (writer and director), Mark Frost (writer) (May 21, 2017). \\"Part 1\\".

In Buckhorn, South Dakota, school principal William Hastings (Matthew Lillard) is accused of murdering Ruth Davenport (Mary Stofle), the school librarian, much to the chagrin of his wife, Phyllis (Cornelia Guest). =Events= In Buckhorn, Hastings sits inside his cell, seemingly anxious. Detective Dave Macklay (Brent Briscoe) accompanies Hastings's wife Phyllis in the cell, warning them that the visit will be short; Hastings thanks him. Phyllis tells Hastings that according to their attorney, George Bautzer (Neil Dickson), he will not be released on bail; Hastings insists that he did not kill Davenport, but says he dreamt about being there. Phyllis insists that he was there, and reveals that she knew about his affair with Davenport; Hastings responds that he knew she was having an affair with George and possibly someone else. She taunts him with the perspective of a life in prison; Macklay comes to dismiss Phyllis, leaving Hastings in despair. At the station's entrance, Phyllis meets George, informs him that Bill is aware of their affair, and instructs him not to walk her out and to meet her later at her place; George then discusses with Macklay how Hastings and Phyllis feel.

In a restaurant, Cooper's doppelg√§nger eats creamed corn with Darya (Nicole LaLiberte), Ray (George Griffith) and Jack (Steve Baker). Ray ironically remarks that Jack barely touched his \\"three dinners\\"; he then discusses the plan for the coming days with the doppelg√§nger, who says he will need to be on his own for a while. Ray assures the doppelg√§nger that he will get the information he needs from Betty, Hastings's secretary; the doppelg√§nger replies that he doesn't need the information, but wants it. In the Ghostwood forest, Hawk (Michael Horse) searches through the woods with a flashlight. He receives a call from Margaret Lanterman (Catherine Coulson), who asks him where he is walking. When Hawk replies that something is supposed to happen there, Margaret says, \\"the stars turn and the time presents itself,\\" and tells Hawk to be careful, inviting him for coffee and pie at her house. Hawk thanks her and promises to tell her what happens, then ends the call; he arrives at Glastonbury Grove, where red curtains faintly appear and disappear. Cooper sits in the Red Room. MIKE (Al Strobel) asks him \\"is it future or is it past\\", then tells him someone is there and disappears. An older Laura enters and sits in one of the chairs. She salutes Cooper, informs him that he can go now and asks him if he recognizes her. In an almost verbatim reenactment of his dream, Cooper asks Laura if she is Laura Palmer, and she replies, \\"I feel like I know her, but sometimes my arms bend back.\\" When Cooper asks who she is, she confirms that she is Laura, and when he replies that Laura is dead she says \\"I am dead, yet I live.\\" She removes her face, revealing a pulsating white light, and closes it back. Cooper asks when he can go; in another repetition of Cooper's dream Laura walks over to him, kisses him and whispers in his ear.A female voice can be faintly heard saying \\"Whisper\\" as Laura leans onto Cooper. Laura pulls back; an unseen force moves the curtains and she screams before being pulled away in front of Cooper. The curtains billow and take off, revealing a pale horse standing on the seemingly endless chevron floor and darkness. MIKE reappears and asks Cooper again \\"is it future or is it past;\\" he then leads Cooper to another room, where he presents him to \\"the evolution of the arm\\", a flashing giant neuron structure resembling a barren tree, with a soft-mouthed brain on top as a head.The original actor for the arm, Michael J. Anderson, did not return to the role. The voice actor for the arm is uncredited. Repeating the lines he once told Cooper, the arm says, \\"I am the arm and I sound like this\\", followed by a looping sound. He asks Cooper whether he remembers his doppelg√§nger, and says that the doppelg√§nger must come order for Cooper to go out. Jack closes a garage door with one of Cooper's doppelg√§nger's cars inside, and hands the doppelg√§nger the keys to another car. Before leaving, the doppelg√§nger calls Jack to him, grabs his face and strokes it. The doppelg√§nger goes to a motel, where Darya quickly hangs up the phone and tells him she was talking to Jack to ensure that the job is done \\"on the secretary's car\\"; she tells him that she's happy to see him. The doppelg√§nger tells her Ray never showed up for their meeting, and that he might borrow her gun for a job. He lies next to her and hugs her, then tells her that he killed Jack after discovering that he wired the car. Darya tries to escape, but the doppelg√§nger smashes her head against the headboard of the bed and plays a recording of her phone conversation with Ray, in which the two discuss his imprisonment in a South Dakota federal prison for interstate transportation of firearms and their task to assassinate Cooper, which was assigned to them by a man named Jeffries and is now entrusted entirely to her. Darya tries to escape once again, and the doppelg√§nger smashes her head against the headboard thrice. He asks her to reveal the name of the man who paid for his assassination, which Darya does not know, but who, she discloses, paid $500,000 to split between her and Ray. She says she wasn't going to do it, but the doppelg√§nger brushes this off. He then says that the following day he is supposed to be pulled back into the Black Lodge but that he has a plan for that. He asks her if she received any information from Ray, saying that a set of coordinates and numbers may save her life; Darya did not receive any information, but knows that Hastings‚Äôs secretary revealed something to Ray. The doppelg√§nger pulls an ace of spades card from his jacket, with the symbol covered by a scribbling of a black sphere with two thin protrusions like antennae, and tells Darya that is what he wants. She asks him whether he's going to kill her, and he responds affirmatively; she tries to escape again, after which the doppelg√§nger punches her in the face, then shoots her after covering her face with a pillow. The doppelg√§nger washes his hands and calls the man he believes to be Jeffries.The voice actor for the Phillip Jeffries is uncredited in this episode; in the rest of the season, Phillip Jeffries is voiced by Nathan Frizzel, whose voice sounds conspicuously different from this episode. Consequently, many consider the character speaking on the phone to be a different character from the original Jeffries, possibly an impostor. The voice on the other end of the phone says he missed him in New York and that the doppelg√§nger is still in Buckhorn. He then asks whether Cooper met Major Briggs, much to the doppelg√§nger's astonishment. The voice then says that he just called to say goodbye, and that the doppelg√§nger is \\"going back in\\" the following day so that he will be with BOB again, then disconnects. The doppelg√§nger, now uncertain if the man on the other end of the line truly was Jeffries, opens a laptop and logs into an FBI database to download files related to Yankton Federal Prison, where Ray claims to be. The doppelg√§nger leaves the room and enters into the next one, where Chantal Hutchens (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is staying. He orders her to clean up his room; gathering that he killed Darya, Chantal says it is a good thing, since she was getting jealous of her. The doppelg√§nger tells her that he needs her and her husband to be in a specific location in the following days; he then calls her to him, opens her bathrobe and touches her groin area, saying she is \\"nice and wet\\". In the Black Lodge the arm says, \\"253. Time and time again.\\" It repeats BOB's name three times, then orders Cooper to go twice. Cooper follows MIKE into a hallway; when he is in, MIKE disappears. Cooper proceeds to another entrance but finds it blocked; he walks back in the room he came from, which is now empty, and crosses to the other side. He finds himself in another hallway, which leads him to a room where Leland Palmer sits; he tells Cooper to \\"find Laura.\\" Cooper is attracted by a shining light into another room, which seemingly distorts itself on two overlapping levels, one moving towards the curtains on the opposite side and one moving from them; he then has a vision of a Venus of Arles statue. MIKE senses that something is wrong, and the arm states that it's his doppelg√§nger. From the room, Cooper walks into another hallway, where he sees the statue; he opens the entrance next to it, and from it he sees his doppelg√§nger driving on a road in South Dakota. The statue morphs into a doppelg√§nger of the arm, identical to it except for the yellow color of its brain; the stripes forming the chevron pattern of the floor begin to move upward and downward under Cooper's feet and, as the doppelg√§nger screams \\"non-exist-ent,\\" they open up horizontally, causing Cooper to fall into a black liquid. Cooper is transported on the exterior Glass Box in New York City and sucked inside; he floats through a tube and inside the box. Sam Colby checks the bathroom for the guard, but it's empty, so he decides to let Tracey Barberato in. As they are about to enter, the box trembles and repeatedly creates inside itself a series of matryoshka-like copies of its insides, back and forth, until Cooper disappears. He proceeds to fall through space. Inside the Palmer House, Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) watches gruesome footage of a pack of lions killing an African buffalo.Similarly to an analogous accident in the Pilot, it is possible to spot a hand holding a camera in the mirrors behind Sarah Palmer. At the Roadhouse, the band Chromatics (Ruth Radelet, Adam Miller, Johnny Jewel, Nat Walker) performs its song \\"Shadow\\". Shelly (M√§dchen Amick) takes a tequila shot with her friends Hannah (Gia Carides) and Renee (Jessica Szohr); she says Steven is not the right husband for her daughter, Becky. When James Hurley (James Marshall) enters the Roadhouse with his friend Freddie Sykes (Jake Wardle), the group comments on the fact that he might like Renee. Shelly says there's nothing wrong with James, that he had a motorcycle accident and that \\"James was always cool.\\" From the bar counter, Red (Balthazar Getty) winks at Shelly, while Jean-Michel Renault (Walter Olkewicz) serves drinks.  Production  \\"Part 2\\", like the rest of the limited series, was written by Mark Frost and David Lynch and directed by Lynch. Frost had already written ten episodes of the original series‚Äîthe \\"Pilot\\" and Episodes 1, 2 and 8 with Lynch, plus Episodes 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 26 and the original series finale, Episode 29. Lynch also directed six episodes of the original series‚Äîthe \\"Pilot\\", \\"Episode 2\\", \\"Episode 8\\", \\"Episode 9\\", \\"Episode 14\\" and \\"Episode 29\\". The episode is dedicated to the memory of Frank Silva, who appears in archival footage. = Music = Almost every episode of the 2017 Twin Peaks series featured a live performance by a band at the Roadhouse. In this episode the American electronic music band Chromatics performs its song \\"Shadow\\". Additionally, several sped-up fragments of Lynch's song \\"Last Call\\" from his 2013 album The Big Dream are hidden during the scene in the Palmer house.  Reception  =Broadcast= \\"Part 2\\" was originally broadcast on the Showtime network together with Part 1 on May 22, 2017. The initial broadcast was watched by 506,000 viewers in the United States, a low number by premium cable network standards. But subsequent data from Showtime estimates that in the first three days after the premiere around 1.7 million viewers watched the episode, including 298,000 from DVR viewings and viewers from various streaming platforms. Although \\"Part 2\\" was not rated upon its Showtime broadcast, a TV-14 edit of the episode was uploaded on the official Twin Peaks YouTube channel for a brief period in June 2017 (on the occasion of National Doughnut Day); the same edit was uploaded again on August 8, 2017. =Critical reception= \\"Part 2\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received a 100% rating with an average score of 8.19 out of 10 based on 26 reviews. The critics' consensus reads, \\"'Part Two' delivers all the addictively, terrifyingly inscrutable storytelling that Twin Peaks fans and David Lynch devotees could hope for.\\" Writing for IndieWire, Liz Shannon Miller gave the episode a B+, expressing disappointment at the \\"pretty staggering\\" violence against women in both this episode and Part 1, especially Darya's death, \\"an excruciatingly painful sequence\\"; but she praised the show as \\"fascinating in our current era of revivals, because it eschews all the conventions used by other series\\". She called Kyle MacLachlan's performance \\"impressive\\", extending the praise to the rest of the cast in the light of the \\"insane\\" circumstances they worked under (\\"all actors were only given their own lines, and no knowledge of the full story\\"), and calling the premiere \\"plenty watchable\\" but adding that \\"there are a few elements that don't go down as easy as damn good coffee.\\" The New York Times James Poniewozik gave the episode a positive review, calling Lynch's visual imagination \\"inimitable\\" and likening the episode to the glass box it features while also drawing comparisons to Lost, Fargo and True Detective. Poniewozik wrote, \\"[t]he original Twin Peaks was powered by two questions: 'Who killed Laura Palmer?' and 'What the hell am I watching?'\\", and that while \\"[t]he reincarnation doesn't have the first\\", \\"it still knows how to get you to ask the second\\". In his recap for Entertainment Weekly, Jeff Jensen gave Part 2 a B+, criticizing the episode's \\"absence of certain conventions that even that unconventional pilot possessed\\" while praising the episode's scope and Glass Box subplot, calling himself \\"engaged\\" by the series. In her positive review of the episode, The A.V. Club's Emily L. Stephens gave the episode an A, writing that the \\"comfort\\" of the original Twin Peaks is \\"entirely eschewed\\", praising the Glass Box subplot as \\"a remark upon the creation and the consumption of television and film\\" and calling the episode an \\"unfiltered Lynchian vision, unfettered from the structures of soap operas, police procedurals, or thrillers that gave shape to the first few original outings into Twin Peaks.\\" Notes References External links * \\"Part 2\\" at Showtime * 2017 American television episodes Television episodes written by David Lynch Television episodes written by Mark Frost Twin Peaks (season 3) episodes ","title":"Part 2 (Twin Peaks)"},{"id":"55904163","text":"Wonder Lake also called Deenaalee Bene' is a lake located in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska.

Producers and production  Apt market in Saint-Pierre street Beekeeping brings together many producers. Some estimated 4500 whose 700 own between 70 and 150 beehives. The area numbers many professional beekeepers : more than 300 own at least 150 hives. Production in that area amounts to 2000 tons per year (this being 8% of the national productionBeekeepers in Provence http://www.miels-de-provence.com/apiculture- aujourd-hui.php FR). Many of these beekeepers practice transhumanceTranshumance in Provence : http://lindamathieu.com/2005/06/19/transhumance-in-provence/ FR along a route going from the coastline towards Haute-Provence, across the Southern Alps. Some of them practice transhumance bringing their own beehives on the areas of production of acacia, chestnut and fir honey into the Rh√¥ne valley and beyond. In Provence, summer is the privileged season for lavender honey production, and hives are set up on an area limited in the North by the line Mont√©limar/Digne, and in the South by the Mont Ventoux, the , the mountain of Lure, the Vaucluse Mountains, and the Luberon. In the department of Alpes-de- Haute-Provence, lavender honey is produced in the Banon sector and on the plateau of Valensole. All flowers honey is elaborated on a wide area delimited by N√Æmes, Mont√©limar, Gap, Digne, Nice, Toulon, Marseille and Avignon. But other great amounts of honey are produced by beekeepers in the guarrigue (rosemary and thyme honey),Different honeys: http://www.net- provence.com/en/honey-provence.htm EN or in the maquis (heather and arbutus honey).  A historical repute  Provence honey has earned its fame ever since the 15th century. It is then that it came to increase greatly in production, thanks to the request of Italian merchants, who considered it \\"the best of all good honeys\\". Its quality and prestige remain intact to the extent that it long withstood massive sugar consumption. It was during the 20th century that honey harvested in the areas of Grasse, Brignoles, Alpes proven√ßales, the Mont Ventoux or Barcelonnette built its reputation for quality which enabled it to obtain the \\"IGP\\", in 2005. For example, in the mountain of Lure, the family apiary stems from a long tradition. It provided additional income, and was the only resource to sweeten. The brusc, first beehive built by beekeepers from Provence Until the middle of the 20th century, beehives were built in hollow tree-trunks ‚Äì the bruscs ‚Äì and their number varied depending on the swarms harvested in spring, since each honey harvest killed the bees. The division of labor in each family was identical. The man was in charge of the brusc and also had to get the honey out, while the woman extracted these from the honeycombs, using the heat of the hearth. It was an all flowers honey, used to sweeten drinks, make cakes, cook nougat, candy fruits or achieve ointments. The Lure drug-merchants stirred beeswax and honey into their drug mixture. The wax was also used to polish furniture, its surplus sold to joiners and cabinet-makers, or to make candles or votive candles.Guy Barruol, Andr√© de R√©paraz, Jean-Yves Royer, Montagne de Lure, op. cit. p.152 FR Beekeeping evolved throughout the twenties with the cultivation of lavender and wild lavandin. Then the progressive \\"bruscs\\" were progressively replaced by beehives in the thirties and these were widely used for the following decade. From then on, transhumance of the beehives in the lavender fields had become one of the main features of Proven√ßale beekeeping. Those displacements were initially made by local producers, thanks to a trailer harnessed to the coach linking Forcalquier to Banon and serving Lardiers, the Hospitalet and Saumane. This behaviour was adopted by beekeepers from the Vaucluse, who organized their hive displacements by carts to the Basses-AlpesGuy Barruol, Andr√© de R√©paraz, Jean-Yves Royer, Montagne de Lure, op. cit., p. 153 FR File:Nourrissage d'hiver.JPGWinter feeding File:Apiculture dans les Alpes proven√ßales.jpgBeekeeping in the Alpes proven√ßales File:Ruche entre l'Hospitalet et Lardiers.jpgBeehive between Hospitalet and Lardiers File:Ruches en Haute-Provence.jpgBeehives in Haute- Provence File:Apiculteur lors de la r√©colte.JPGBeekeeper throughout the harvest  See also  * Occitan Cuisine * Honey * Provence * French cuisine * Bee * Agriculture * Proven√ßal markets  References   Bibliography  * Inventaire du patrimoine culinaire de la France-Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur, Edition Albin Michel/CNAC, 1995, realized by the Conseil National des Arts Culinaires headed by Alain Senderens and mandated by the Ministries of Culture and Agriculture. * La montagne de Lure, encyclop√©die d'une montagne en Haute- Provence, by Guy Barruol, Andr√© de R√©paraz and Jean-Yves Royer headed by Guy Barruol, edition Les Alpes de Lumi√®re, June 2004.

A nuclear star cluster (NSC) or compact stellar nucleus (sometimes called young stellar nucleus) is a star cluster with high density and high luminosity near the center of mass of most galaxies. NSCs are the central massive objects of fainter, low-mass galaxies where supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are not present or are of negligible mass. In the most massive galaxies, NSCs are entirely absent. Some galaxies, including the Milky Way, are known to contain both a NSC and a SMBH of comparable mass. Properties Nuclear star clusters are found in most galaxies that can be resolved sufficiently: * at least 50% of all early spiral galaxies (types Sa-Sc) * at least 75% of all late spiral galaxies (types Scd- Sm) * at least 70% of all spheroidal galaxies (types S0 and E). NSCs are the densest known star clusters in the Universe. With apparent magnitudes between -14 and -10 mag in the infrared, they are on average 40 times brighter than globular clusters, although their effective radii are not larger than 2 to 5 parsecs. With a dynamic mass of 106 to 108 solar masses, they are at the upper end of the values reached by globular clusters. The majority of nuclear star clusters contain a mix of old (at least one billion years old) and young stellar populations and show signs of star formation within the last 100 million years. Formation Although the mechanisms behind their formation are not entirely known, hypotheses provide four possibilities: * Nuclear star clusters originate somewhere else and are captured by a central black hole. * Nuclear star clusters are due to an incidence of gas at some distance from the center of the galaxy. * A combination of the above possibilities whereby the gravitational potential of a trapped object, such as the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, triggers new star formation by incident gas near the galactic center. * Nuclear star clusters are created by merging star clusters with subsequent migration to the galactic center due to dynamical friction with background stars. Relationship with globular clusters Because nuclear star clusters occur in most galaxy species, they should still be present in the halo of the resulting galaxy after the fusion of galaxies. This is a hypothesis for the formation of globular clusters. Thus, globular clusters could be the remains of nuclear star clusters excluded from gas incidence, in which no new star formation occurs. According to other hypotheses, however, the nuclear star clusters could be the result of a fusion of globular clusters captured by a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy and dynamically destroyed.

As in the case of topological groups, many deeper results require the point space to be (locally) compact and connected. This generalizes the observation that the line joining two distinct points in the Euclidean plane depends continuously on the pair of points and the intersection point of two lines is a continuous function of these lines. Linear geometries Linear geometries are incidence structures in which any two distinct points x and y are joined by a unique line xy. Such geometries are called topological if xy depends continuously on the pair (x,y) with respect to given topologies on the point set and the line set. The dual of a linear geometry is obtained by interchanging the r√¥les of points and lines. A survey of linear topological geometries is given in Chapter 23 of the Handbook of incidence geometry. The most extensively investigated topological linear geometries are those which are also dual topological linear geometries. Such geometries are known as topological projective planes. History A systematic study of these planes began in 1954 with a paper by Skornyakov. Earlier, the topological properties of the real plane had been introduced via ordering relations on the affine lines, see, e.g., Hilbert, Coxeter, and O. Wyler. The completeness of the ordering is equivalent to local compactness and implies that the affine lines are homeomorphic to R and that the point space is connected. Note that the rational numbers do not suffice to describe our intuitive notions of plane geometry and that some extension of the rational field is necessary. In fact, the equation x^2 + y^2 = 3 for a circle has no rational solution. Topological projective planes The approach to the topological properties of projective planes via ordering relations is not possible, however, for the planes coordinatized by the complex numbers, the quaternions or the octonion algebra. The point spaces as well as the line spaces of these classical planes (over the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions) are compact manifolds of dimension 2^m,, 1 le m le 4. =Topological dimension= The notion of the dimension of a topological space plays a prominent r√¥le in the study of topological, in particular of compact connected planes. For a normal space X, the dimension dim X can be characterized as follows: If mathbb{S}_n denotes the n-sphere, then dim X le n if, and only if, for every closed subspace A subset X each continuous map varphi : A to mathbb{S}_n has a continuous extension psi : X to mathbb{S}_n. For details and other definitions of a dimension see and the references given there, in particular Engelking or Fedorchuk. =2-dimensional planes= The lines of a compact topological plane with a 2-dimensional point space form a family of curves homeomorphic to a circle, and this fact characterizes these planes among the topological projective planes. Equivalently, the point space is a surface. Early examples not isomorphic to the classical real plane {mathcal E} have been given by Hilbert and Moulton. The continuity properties of these examples have not been considered explicitly at that time, they may have been taken for granted. Hilbert‚Äôs construction can be modified to obtain uncountably many pairwise non- isomorphic 2-dimensional compact planes. The traditional way to distinguish {mathcal E} from the other 2-dimensional planes is by the validity of Desargues‚Äôs theorem or the theorem of Pappos (see, e.g., Pickert for a discussion of these two configuration theorems). The latter is known to imply the former (Hessenberg). The theorem of Desargues expresses a kind of homogeneity of the plane. In general, it holds in a projective plane if, and only if, the plane can be coordinatized by a (not necessarily commutative) field, hence it implies that the group of automorphisms is transitive on the set of quadrangles (4 points no 3 of which are collinear). In the present setting, a much weaker homogeneity condition characterizes {mathcal E}: Theorem. If the automorphism group Sigma of a 2-dimensional compact plane {mathcal P} is transitive on the point set (or the line set), then Sigma has a compact subgroup Phi which is even transitive on the set of flags (=incident point-line pairs), and {mathcal P} is classical. The automorphism group Sigma = operatorname{Aut}{mathcal P} of a 2-dimensional compact plane {mathcal P}, taken with the topology of uniform convergence on the point space, is a locally compact group of dimension at most 8, in fact even a Lie group. All 2-dimensional planes such that dimSigma ge 3 can be described explicitly; those with dimSigma = 4 are exactly the Moulton planes, the classical plane {mathcal E} is the only 2-dimensional plane with dim Sigma > 4; see also. =Compact connected planes= The results on 2-dimensional planes have been extended to compact planes of dimension >2 . This is possible due to the following basic theorem: Topology of compact planes. If the dimension of the point space P of a compact connected projective plane is finite, then dim P=2^m with m in {1,2,3,4}. Moreover, each line is a homotopy sphere of dimension 2^{m-1}, see or. Special aspects of 4-dimensional planes are treated in, more recent results can be found in. The lines of a 4-dimensional compact plane are homeomorphic to the 2-sphere; in the cases m>2 the lines are not known to be manifolds, but in all examples which have been found so far the lines are spheres. A subplane {mathcal B} of a projective plane {mathcal P} is said to be a Baer subplane, if each point of {mathcal P} is incident with a line of {mathcal B} and each line of {mathcal P} contains a point of {mathcal B}. A closed subplane {mathcal B} is a Baer subplane of a compact connected plane {mathcal P} if, and only if, the point space of {mathcal B} and a line of {mathcal P} have the same dimension. Hence the lines of an 8-dimensional plane mathcal P are homeomorphic to a sphere mathbb{S}_4 if {mathcal P} has a closed Baer subplane. Homogeneous planes. If mathcal P is a compact connected projective plane and if Sigma = operatorname{Aut}{mathcal P} is transitive on the point set of mathcal P, then Sigma has a flag-transitive compact subgroup Phi and mathcal P is classical, see or. In fact, Phi is an elliptic motion group. Let mathcal P be a compact plane of dimension 2^m,; m=2,3,4, and write Sigma = operatorname{Aut}{mathcal P} . If dimSigma > 8,18,40, then {mathcal P} is classical, and operatorname{Aut}{mathcal P} is a simple Lie group of dimension 16,35,78 respectively. All planes mathcal P with dimSigma = 8,18,40 are known explicitly. The planes with dimSigma = 40 are exactly the projective closures of the affine planes coordinatized by a so- called mutation (mathbb{O},+,circ) of the octonion algebra (mathbb{O},+,  ,), where the new multiplication circ is defined as follows: choose a real number t with 1/2 < t e 1 and put a circ b = tcdot a b + (1-t)cdot b a. Vast families of planes with a group of large dimension have been discovered systematically starting from assumptions about their automorphism groups, see, e.g.,. Many of them are projective closures of translation planes (affine planes admitting a sharply transitive group of automorphisms mapping each line to a parallel), cf.; see also for more recent results in the case m=3 and for m=4. Compact projective spaces Subplanes of projective spaces of geometrical dimension at least 3 are necessarily Desarguesian, see ¬ß1 or ¬ß16 or. Therefore, all compact connected projective spaces can be coordinatized by the real or complex numbers or the quaternion field. Stable planes The classical non-euclidean hyperbolic plane can be represented by the intersections of the straight lines in the real plane with an open circular disk. More generally, open (convex) parts of the classical affine planes are typical stable planes. A survey of these geometries can be found in, for the 2-dimensional case see also. Precisely, a stable plane {mathcal S} is a topological linear geometry (P,mathfrak{L}) such that (1) P is a locally compact space of positive finite dimension, (2) each line Linmathfrak{L} is a closed subset of P, and mathfrak{L} is a Hausdorff space, (3) the set {(K,L) mid K e L,;K cap L e emptyset} is an open subspace mathfrak{O} subset mathfrak{L}^2 ( stability), (4) the map (K,L) mapsto K cap L:mathfrak{O} to P is continuous. Note that stability excludes geometries like the 3-dimensional affine space over R or C. A stable plane {mathcal S} is a projective plane if, and only if, P is compact. As in the case of projective planes, line pencils are compact and homotopy equivalent to a sphere of dimension 2^{m-1}, and dim P = 2^m with min{1,2,3,4}, see or. Moreover, the point space P is locally contractible. Compact groups of (proper) stable planes are rather small. Let Phi_d denote a maximal compact subgroup of the automorphism group of the classical d-dimensional projective plane {mathcal P}_d. Then the following theorem holds: If a d-dimensional stable plane {mathcal S} admits a compact group Gamma of automorphisms such that dimGamma > dimPhi_d-d, then {mathcal S} cong {mathcal P}_d, see. Flag-homogeneous stable planes. Let {mathcal S}=(P,mathfrak{L}) be a stable plane. If the automorphism group operatorname{Aut}{mathcal S} is flag-transitive, then {mathcal S} is a classical projective or affine plane, or {mathcal S} is isomorphic to the interior of the absolute sphere of the hyperbolic polarity of a classical plane; see. In contrast to the projective case, there is an abundance of point-homogeneous stable planes, among them vast classes of translation planes, see and. Symmetric planes Affine translation planes have the following property: * There exists a point transitive closed subgroup Delta of the automorphism group which contains a unique reflection at some and hence at each point. More generally, a symmetric plane is a stable plane {mathcal S} = (P,mathfrak{L}) satisfying condition (*); see, cf. for a survey of these geometries. By Corollary 5.5, the group Delta is a Lie group and the point space P is a manifold. It follows that {mathcal S} is a symmetric space. By means of the Lie theory of symmetric spaces, all symmetric planes with a point set of dimension 2 or 4 have been classified. They are either translation planes or they are determined by a Hermitian form. An easy example is the real hyperbolic plane. Circle geometries Classical models are given by the plane sections of a quadratic surface S in real projective 3-space; if S is a sphere, the geometry is called a M√∂bius plane. The plane sections of a ruled surface (one-sheeted hyperboloid) yield the classical Minkowski plane, cf. for generalizations. If S is an elliptic cone without its vertex, the geometry is called a Laguerre plane. Collectively these planes are sometimes referred to as Benz planes. A topological Benz plane is classical, if each point has a neighbourhood which is isomorphic to some open piece of the corresponding classical Benz plane. =M√∂bius planes= M√∂bius planes consist of a family mathfrak{C} of circles, which are topological 1-spheres, on the 2-sphere S such that for each point p the derived structure (Ssetminus{p},{Csetminus{p}mid pin Cinmathfrak{C}}) is a topological affine plane. In particular, any 3 distinct points are joined by a unique circle. The circle space mathfrak{C} is then homeomorphic to real projective 3-space with one point deleted. A large class of examples is given by the plane sections of an egg-like surface in real 3-space. =Homogeneous M√∂bius planes= If the automorphism group Sigma of a M√∂bius plane is transitive on the point set S or on the set mathfrak{C} of circles, or if dimSigma ge 4, then (S,mathfrak{C}) is classical and dimSigma = 6, see. In contrast to compact projective planes there are no topological M√∂bius planes with circles of dimension >1 , in particular no compact M√∂bius planes with a 4-dimensional point space. All 2-dimensional M√∂bius planes such that dimSigma ge 3 can be described explicitly. =Laguerre planes= The classical model of a Laguerre plane consists of a circular cylindrical surface C in real 3-space R^3 as point set and the compact plane sections of C as circles. Pairs of points which are not joined by a circle are called parallel. Let P denote a class of parallel points. Then Csmallsetminus P is a plane R^2, the circles can be represented in this plane by parabolas of the form y = ax^2+bx+c. In an analogous way, the classical 4-dimensional Laguerre plane is related to the geometry of complex quadratic polynomials. In general, the axioms of a locally compact connected Laguerre plane require that the derived planes embed into compact projective planes of finite dimension. A circle not passing through the point of derivation induces an oval in the derived projective plane. By or, circles are homeomorphic to spheres of dimension 1 or 2. Hence the point space of a locally compact connected Laguerre plane is homeomorphic to the cylinder C or it is a 4-dimensional manifold, cf. A large class of 2-dimensional examples, called ovoidal Laguerre planes, is given by the plane sections of a cylinder in real 3-space whose base is an oval in R^2. The automorphism group of a 2d-dimensional Laguerre plane (d = 1, 2) is a Lie group with respect to the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of the point space; furthermore, this group has dimension at most 7d. All automorphisms of a Laguerre plane which fix each parallel class form a normal subgroup, the kernel of the full automorphism group. The 2-dimensional Laguerre planes with dimSigma=5 are exactly the ovoidal planes over proper skew parabolae. The classical 2d-dimensional Laguerre planes are the only ones such that dimSigma > 5d, see, cf. also. = Homogeneous Laguerre planes= If the automorphism group Sigma of a 2d-dimensional Laguerre plane {mathcal L} is transitive on the set of parallel classes, and if the kernel T triangleleft Sigma is transitive on the set of circles, then {mathcal L} is classical, see 2.1,2. However, transitivity of the automorphism group on the set of circles does not suffice to characterize the classical model among the 2d-dimensional Laguerre planes. =Minkowski planes= The classical model of a Minkowski plane has the torus mathbb{S}_1 times mathbb{S}_1 as point space, circles are the graphs of real fractional linear maps on mathbb{S}_1 = R cup{infty}. As with Laguerre planes, the point space of a locally compact connected Minkowski plane is 1 or 2-dimensional; the point space is then homeomorphic to a torus or to mathbb{S}_2 times mathbb{S}_2, see. =Homogeneous Minkowski planes= If the automorphism group Sigma of a Minkowski plane {mathcal M} of dimension 2d is flag-transitive, then {mathcal M} is classical. The automorphism group of a 2d-dimensional Minkowski plane is a Lie group of dimension at most 6d. All 2-dimensional Minkowski planes such that dimSigma ge 4 can be described explicitly. The classical 2d-dimensional Minkowski plane is the only one with dimSigma > 4d, see.

She is the executive director of The Gathering for Justice. She was one of four national co-chairs of the 2017 Women's March.  Early learning and education  Perez was born in Oxnard, California, to Marcel Perez and Alicia Ramirez Perez, as the youngest of five. In 1994, her sister Patricia was killed in a single vehicle accident and the funeral coincided with Perez's 17th birthday. it was this event that lead Perez to feel inspired to dedicate her life to initiatives that would help transform the lives of young people. ‚ÄúI remember somebody coming to our home, asking if we wanted to press charges. And my father said ‚ÄòI would never take another mother‚Äôs child away,‚Äô‚Äù Perez said. ‚ÄúAnd so I didn‚Äôt learn restorative justice from studying it. I learned it from a man who would never take another mother‚Äôs child away.‚Äù Perez started her undergraduate career at Oxnard College where she received an associate degree in liberal arts. She then transferred to the University of California, Santa Cruz, as a psychology major where she also studied Chicana Feminism and was involved in Rainbow Theater. She credits this time as formative to her dedication to intersectional and transformative leadership. Through the Chicano Latino Resource Center, Carmen was mentored by psychology professor and Chicana feminist Aida Hurtado who she also worked for as her research assistant. Career and activism =Mass Incarceration= In 2001, Perez began work with the Santa Cruz Youth Community Restoration Program, providing alternatives to incarceration for juvenile offenders. In this position she established Reforming Education Advocating Leadership (REAL), a youth mentoring program. In 2003, she was elected to serve as the Chair of the Latino Affairs Commission of Santa Cruz County. Perez also co-founded the Girl's Taskforce to provide gender-responsive programming for girls, regardless of probation status, in Santa Cruz County. In 2004, Perez began working for her mentor, Nane Alejandrez, as his executive assistant and the prison project coordinator focused on cultural programming inside youth detention centers and prisons. In 2005, Alejandrez invited Perez to serve as a youth representative for The Gathering for Justice, a social justice organization established in 2005 by singer, songwriter, actor and activist Harry Belafonte. By 2006, Perez had become a board member of Barrios Unidos and started working for the Santa Cruz County probation department as an intake and investigations officer focused on system accountability. She was promoted to Deputy Probation Officer II in 2007, providing gender responsive programming for an intensive caseload of girls. Perez moved to NYC in 2008 to work full-time as the National Organizer for The Gathering for Justice. Since 2010, she has served as the executive director of The Gathering for Justice, a social justice organization dedicated to ending child incarceration by utilizing Kingian nonviolent direct action, engaging artists and cultural leaders, advocating for policy initiatives and providing direct services inside juvenile facilities. From 2011-2013 she also developed Purple Gold, a young leaders program for 1199 SEIU. In 2013, Perez co-founded Justice League NYC, a taskforce of young criminal justice experts, direct service providers, activists, advocates, artists and formerly incarcerated individuals bringing their resources to the table to create a blueprint to reform the criminal and social justice system in New York City and State. She organized Growing Up Locked Down, a three-day juvenile justice reform conference, in New York City in 2014 and a second in her hometown of Oxnard, California in 2016. The Oxnard conference was the beginning of Justice League CA. In May 2014, she had the opportunity to share her life's work and delivered her 1st TEDx Talk inside Ironwood State Prison hosted by Richard Branson and produced by Scott Budnick. In 2015, Perez testified as a criminal and juvenile justice reform expert before the President's 21st Century Taskforce on Policing. =Women's Rights and Gender Equity= Poster created by the official Women's March on Washington organizers In 2017, Perez was a national co-chair of the Women's March on Washington, with Tamika D. Mallory, Bob Bland, and Linda Sarsour. Perez's contributions included facilitating the creation of the mobilization's Unity Principles, leading the Artist Table and Honorary Co-Chair selection, and recruiting over 500 partners. In addition, The Gathering for Justice, the organization for which she serves as Executive Director, was a fiscal sponsor of the Women's March on Washington and donated its office space to organizers during the planning phase. She was a panelist at the 2017 Women's National Convention. =Racial Healing and Community Policing= Carmen has worked with Danny Glover, America Ferrera, Hot97 hosts Ebro and Nessa, Jussie Smollett, and Colin Kaepernick. On November 16, 2017, she publicized the case of Meek Mill. Actress Jackie Cruz praised Carmen for \\"unlocking her zeal\\" for social causes. ‚ÄúShe trained me to not care anymore and just fight for what you believe in,‚Äù said Cruz in a 2018 interview with Bustle. =Support for Louis Farrakhan= Bari Weiss has criticized Perez for her support of Assata Shakur, a former Black Liberation Army member convicted of murder, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Asked about her support for Farrakhan, Perez responded that there are \\"no perfect leaders\\". In 2018, Teresa Shook, the founder of the Women's March, called for Perez and some of her co-organizers to step down, because they had failed to adequately distance themselves from the anti- Semitic and homophobic rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan, while an article published in The New York Times discussed accounts by two sources that Perez and Mallory had made disparaging comments to Vanessa Wruble, then a fellow organizer, about her Jewish heritage; Wruble later recounted that she felt \\"pushed out\\" because of her Jewish identity. In January 2019, Perez published an op-ed in the Jewish magazine The Forward, where she stated, ‚ÄúI want to be clear: our movement is a safe place for Jewish women, our leadership abhors anti-Semitism and homophobia, and these kinds of comments are and will always be unacceptable.‚Äù In the same article, she acknowledged the failure of the Women's March to act rapidly enough, saying, ‚ÄúI want to be unequivocal in affirming that the organization failed to act rapid enough to condemn the egregious and hateful statements made by a figure who is not associated with the Women‚Äôs March in any way.‚Äù She also published an op-ed in the New York Daily News, where she again took accountability while acknowledging other factors related to her silence, writing, \\"after reflecting deeply on what has taken place over the last few months and having finally emerged from a difficult pregnancy at the age of 41, I want to address these issues, accept responsibility and re-commit myself to being a moral leader.\\" When asked in January 2020 by Emma Green of The Atlantic whether Farrakhan's views represent her own, Perez refused to condemn him. However, she did say that the Women's March erred in harming its own brand. Since the controversy, Perez has participated in antisemitism sensitivity training.Green, Emma. \\"What to Know About Women's March ....\\" The Atlantic. 17 January 2020. 17 January 2020.

The importance of the operation lies in its historical significance as the first large-scale copper mining and smelting operation in the British Islands which was well- documented. New smelting techniques were introduced which were allowed the treatment of argentiferous copper sulphide ores and the more complex lead- copper-silver ores from Caldbeck. Mining started at Caldbeck in June 1566 but was soon discontinued and was not resumed until 1568, when work continued under the supervision of the Hochstetter family until around 1630, and then was not resumed until around 1695. One of the German miners Cornelius de Vos left to set up gold mines in Scotland. George Bowes and Francis Needham reported on the state of the mines in 1602. Robert Bowes was killed in an accident in the mines in 1610. The identity of the principal copper mines near Keswick and Coniston has long been known, but the locations of the Caldbeck mines have not.

From a working-class family, she labored in textile mills and as a housekeeper and laundress, when her husband was unable to find work. Hoping for a better life, they moved to Mobile, Alabama, but when the Civil War broke out and her husband joined the Confederacy, Eunice returned to New England. Lack of word or financial support from her spouse, led Connolly into poverty as she struggled to provide for their two children. Learning after the war ended that he had died, Connolly decided to marry a \\"coloured\\" British West Indian sailor and move with him to the Cayman Islands. The letters she left, give a glimpse into the struggles of working class life during the period of industrialization and the war, as well as the differences in racial attitudes of American and Caribbean societies. Early life Eunice Louensa Richardson was born on December 9, 1931 in Northfield, Franklin County, Massachusetts to Lois (n√©e Wright) and Luther Richardson, Sr. She was the third daughter in the family after Ann and Harriet, and was followed by Jane, Adelia, Luther Jr. and Charles Henry. In the 1845, her family relocated to Manchester, New Hampshire, seeking a more stable income source in the factory town. Richardson went to work in the Amoskeag Textile Mills. On October 21, 1849, Richardson married William C. Stone, a carpenter. The couple initially made their home with Eunice's parents. In 1851, her father left Manchester seeking work and did not return to the family. New England In 1852, after giving birth to their first child, Clarence, the couple moved to a home of their own. By 1857, the couple had acquired a small plot of land in Manchester, but the Panic of 1857 made it difficult for William to provide a living. By 1859, the inability to find steady work, forced him to join family in Alabama, leaving Eunice and Clarence in New Hampshire, where she returned to work in the Amoskeag Mill. Because female employees lived in mill housing which did not accommodate children, Stone was forced to send her son to live with a widow, Mehitable Quimby, who lived in West Manchester. Despite the racial tensions in the south on the eve of the Civil War, she embarked in June 1860 with her son, to join William in Mobile. Mobile, Alabama Initially upon their arrival, the family boarded with William's sister and brother-in-law, Ellen and Dudley Merrill, soon establishing their own residence in Mobile. When the war broke out, Stone's brothers Luther and Henry joined the Union Army, but her brother-in-law and husband joined the Confederate forces. Stone, who was strongly behind the Union chose to return to New England embarking with her son on the arduous journey in December 1861. She arrived in Claremont, New Hampshire, with expectations that her husband's family would provide for her and her son, as well as her daughter, Clara, who would be born within two months of her return northward. Return to New England To pay for their upkeep, Clarence performed chores for her brother-in-law's family to earn his room and board and Stone hired out as a servant. She also made extra money by braiding palm leaf hats and was eventually able to move the children into a tenement building living on their own. Without education, and with children being barred from mill dormitories and domestic living situations, Stone's remaining choice was to take in washing and take Clara with her to housekeeping jobs, though societal norms called into question the respectability of women engaged in such work. Living on the edge of poverty, Stone periodically had to send Clarence to work for relatives. Unknown to Stone, William died in Atlanta on February 11, 1863 and she struggled on despite wartime inflation and lack of work. In December 1864, she moved to Dracut, Massachusetts, where her mother was then living. Working as a seamstress and laundress in Lowell, she battled depression. After the war ended and Lincoln's assassination, Stone received a letter from her sister-in-law Ellen Merrill advising her of her husband's death. Late in 1865, she and the children left her mother's and moved back in with William's family, who were at that time living in Vermont. Settling in Morristown, she hired Clarence out as a farm laborer, while she did cleaning and washing for neighbors and kin. When or where Stone met Smiley Connolly, a mulatto sailor from the British West Indies colony of the Cayman Islands is unclear. Having already pushed the boundaries of respectability, being poor, husbandless and working class, her engagement to Connolly in 1869, pushed her into being a social outcast, though her immediate family was supportive because of Connolly's ability to provide for her and the children. Cayman Islands Knowing that marriage to William S. Connolly would mean separation from her family, because of the post-war feeling regarding interracial marriage, Stone chose to marry on 3 November 1869 in Dracut. Within a week of their marriage, the couple and Connolly's children sailed from Cape Cod en route to the West Indies. The family settled in the village of East End on Grand Cayman. By 1871, Connolly and Smiley had a daughter, Louisa Charlotta, whom they called Lou, and later had a second daughter named Caramiel. She corresponded regularly with her family relaying her new found happiness and contentment. She embraced his three sons from a previous marriage Gamaliel, Cornelius and Jarrett, and did not seem bothered by the fact that their mother, Rachel Partridge Connolly could not have secured a divorce in the Cayman Islands from Smiley, as divorce was illegal until the 1880s. Smiley, having given up sailing at Eunice's request, was a carpenter and built boats from the local hardwood. He also owned land, which they planted. The family lived in a wattle and daub cottage near the sea and Connolly had a woman who helped her with the housework and another who did the laundry. In the West Indies, though Smiley was mixed race, the social hierarchy placed \\"coloured\\" closer to white, the opposite of in the United States, where \\"mulattos\\" were considered black. As such, the Connolly's were part of the middle class and were able to afford to send Clara to school full-time. Clarence by this time was working as a teacher at the church-run school in East End. His death in 1872, caused his mother to suffer another bout of depression. In 1875, Smiley completed a schooner, The Leader, which he had been building and reiterated his promise to Connolly he would not sail unless she and the children accompanied him. In 1876 a hurricane hit Grand Cayman in mid-October and though much damage occurred, the couple's new home was spared. The disaster brought back to Connolly's mind the uncertainty she had experienced over her first husband's whereabouts during the war, and when Smiley decided to join a turtle-fishing voyage to the Miskito Cays, she insisted that the family join him. In the Autumn of 1877, the family boarded The Leader heading to Nicaragua. A hurricane struck near the Windward Islands between September 21 and October 5, 1877. Survivors who made it back to the Cayman Islands on October 8, reported that sixty-six lives had been lost in the storm. Death and legacy Connolly's family did not learn of the family's death until 1881. Replying to a query the family had sent in search of word, a letter reached Ellen Merrill from John S. Wood of Kingston, Jamaica. He reported that the three daughters, Eunice and Smiley, along with six crewmen all perished in the hurricane on 27 September 1877. Historian Martha Hodes discovered Eunice's correspondence while conducting research among her mother's papers at the Duke University Library. Intrigued by the 500 letters preserved, she researched Connolly's life, publishing her biography, The Sea Captain's Wife in 2007. The letters capture the fragility and volatility of life in the era and show that Connolly was able to challenge convention by improving her social standing when she married a black man. Many of the Caribbean branches of Connolly, some spell it Conolly, are related to Smiley and Eunice, including William Warren Conolly, who was the great-grandson of Smiley's brother Thomas Dighton Conolly  References  =Citations= =Bibliography=  1831 births 1877 deaths People from Northfield, Massachusetts Letter writers Women letter writers 19th-century women writers Textile workers ","title":"Eunice Connolly"},{"id":"55904753","text":"Massage Envy Franchising LLC is an American massage and skin care national franchisor, based in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Beth Stiller previously held the chief commercial officer position, from April 2016 until Joe Magnacca's departure in 2019. Kathy Collins became chief marketing officer in July 2018. qHistory Massage Envy was founded in 2002 and started franchising in 2003. By late 2008, Massage Envy franchisees collectively employed more than 8,000 professionals at 420 independently owned and operated locations in 36 U.S. states. The Massage Envy franchise network expanded its membership-based business model in 2009 by adding facials and other spa services. There were approximately 650 franchised locations by late 2010. Forbes ranked Massage Envy number 20 on their 2012 list of \\"Top 20 Franchises for the Buck\\". According to the magazine, franchises required an initial investment averaging $455,505 and made over $1 million in annual sales in 2010. Massage Envy partnered with Susan G. Komen for the Cure for a campaign called \\"Massage for the Cure\\", which raised over $1.4 million by August 2010. There were more than 1,100 locations in 49 U.S. states, as of April 2016. The Massage Envy franchise network expanded its skin care products and service offerings in 2017 to include Image Skincare and PCA Skin as well as non-surgical procedures such as chemical peels and microderm abrasion. The company also announced plans for its franchisees to remodel more than 700 locations, and to launch new body stretch, facial, and massage services over the next few years. In late 2017, Entrepreneur reported there were 1,189 franchises, with startup costs ranging from $434,800 to approximately $1 million. Wages Massage Envy has been criticized for paying therapists unproportionally low wages compared to what they charge for services offered. The average hourly wage for massage therapists and estheticians is $15-$18 at Massage Envy, which is lower than national average of $30- $40. Additionally, Massage Envy pays no compensation to therapists for hours with no clients seen. Massage Envy has known for making therapists working for 8 to 9 hours per average working day, which is unusual in the massage industry due to the labor intensiveness of the work. For this reason, Massage Envy has been known as ‚Äùcruise ship on land‚Äù, and has been compared to the sweatshops of the fashion industry. Sexual Assault Complaints In November 2017, BuzzFeed reported that over 180 women had \\"filed sexual assault lawsuits, police reports, and state board complaints against Massage Envy spas, their employees, and the national company\\" over allegations of sexual misconduct. The women also accused Massage Envy of ignoring or mishandling most of the cases they reported to the company. According to BuzzFeed's article, Massage Envy requires internal investigations of reported abuse, but does not provide significant instruction on how they should be conducted, and it does not require that law enforcement be notified except in states with laws requiring such notification. The article also stated that employees of Massage Envy franchises were not equipped to conduct internal investigations into abuse allegations. In response, the company issued a statement describing the incidents as \\"heartbreaking\\". The company's statement also noted that the Massage Envy franchise network had performed over 125 million massages during their more than 15 years of operation, but added that \\"even one incident is too many\\". The company founded a safety advisory council with industry executives and a representative from the anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Massage Envy also added a \\"Commitment to Safety\\" to their website to make clients aware of implemented changes. Skin Care Products The company announced a private label skin care brand CyMe (pronounced \\"see me\\") in 2018. According to Women's Wear Daily, skin care accounted for approximately seven percent of the company's business, as of April 2018. The Massage Envy franchise network also launched assisted stretch services in 2018, featuring proprietary methods administered by a massage therapist. Entrepreneur ranked Massage Envy number 358 on its 2019 \\"Franchise 500\\" list. Research The Massage Envy network has funded massage therapy research conducted by the Massage Therapy Foundation, as well as the Touch Research Institute, part of the University of Miami's Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine. In December 2018, Massage Envy announced a partnership with the Cortiva Institute, the largest group of massage therapy and skincare schools in the U.S., to provide development and employment opportunities through Massage Envy franchise locations for Cortiva graduates at Massage Envy clinics. =Marketing= In 2015, Adweek reported that the company hired a new lead agency and spent approximately $15 million annually on advertising and marketing, with franchisees spending an additional $40 million annually in local markets. The company rebranded in 2016, targeting baby boomers and millennials; the \\"Because Everything\\" campaign promoted massage as holism rather than a luxury, and featured men, who made up 25 percent of Massage Envy's clientele. The Massage Envy network spent $17.9 million on measured media in the U.S. in 2017. Fallon Worldwide became the company's agency-of-record in 2018. Massage Envy launched a brand awareness campaign \\"Keep your body working\\" in early 2019. The campaign, expected to cost $20‚Äì25 million, includes radio and television ads, as well as digital video and social media placements. It continues to focus on holism and replaces the previous tagline, \\"Making the most of every body\\". =Sponsorships= In 2017 and 2018, Massage Envy sponsored the PGA Tour and served as the \\"official total body care sponsor\\" of Player Performance Centers, mobile trailers staffed with chiropractors, personal trainers, and physical therapy professionals to administer massage and stretch therapy to players. As part of the sponsorship, Massage Envy partnered with ten professional golfers to serve as spokespeople for \\"The Streto Method\\", a proprietary method created by experts in chiropractic treatments, ergonomics, and massage therapy to deliver the company‚Äôs \\"Total Body Stretch\\" service offering.

Dvaravati art is a form of artistic work originating from Mon. Dvaravati flourished from the Dvaravati Mon ancient artifacts are in present-day Thailand and Burma, Mon states to the west in southern Myanmar (Burma) and with the Mon state in northern Thailand. Dvaravati experienced political domination by neighbouring peoples on three occasions: in the 10th century, when the Burmese conquered the Mon state of Thaton west of the Tenasserim Yoma; from the 11th to the 13th century, when the Khmer empire (Cambodia) arose in the east; and finally, in the late 13th century, when Dvaravati was absorbed by the Thai empire.  History  Dvaravati art came into form around the 6th century by the Mon communities as part of numerous minor kingdoms that existed in Thailand. Surrounding geography proved treacherous for travel and thus provided a fair amount of isolation for the individual kingdoms. Isolation enabled development of a highly sophisticated and distinct Mon-Dvaravati style. = Influence = Dvaravati itself was heavily influenced by Indian culture though the process of cultural diffusion over several centuries starting from the Christian 5th century, and played an important role in introducing Mahayana Buddhism and particularly Buddhist art to the region.Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd.,  Architecture  Archaeological research and restoration have indicated that Buddhist monuments of the Dvaravati style exhibited contemporary art of Gupta temple-architecture with many constructed with open-air structures. Chief among the architecture is the stupa style architecture. There are four major categories: #chedi with terrace in each story # stupa with a square base ::The central part of this is pointed in a finial way. #stupa with a square base and a central part ::This form is shaped in an inverted alms-bowl. This form has numerous superimposed flat rings with a bulb terminal. Inspired by Mahayana Buddhism. #stupa with a square base and 5 terraces. ::The lowest is the biggest terrace while the smallest is the top terrace. Each terrace has 3 niches in each of the four direction. Inside these 3 niches stand Buddha images. The temple complex at Wat Phra That Hariphunchai, dating to the 9th and 11th centuries, is a pristine example of Dvaravati architecture. Phra Pathommachedi is a wat dating to the 12th century that exemplifies the architecture. Art Various pottery excavated from former Dvaravati sites in central Thailand exhibit the sophistication and complexity of Dvaravati art. Many Buddha statues were created with Dvaravati style. Some Buddha statues have mudras (hand positions) and others have katakahasta mudra (fingers folded down into palms, suggesting if it is holding something), both of which have evolved before 800 CE. Buddha statues are common artefacts. =Pottery= There are various kinds of Dvaravati pottery. * Dish on stand; ::These pots often have a polished reddish-brown colour with red or white alternating stripes. *Carinated pot ::these pots come in a variety of colours such as red, orange, brown, and black, although the top part of these vessels are plain. *Shallow cup ::These cups are used as lamps. They are made with a medium texture to a brown and gray finish. Most are handmade. *Spouted bowl ::These bowls are used as candles and often are coarse in texture with a black brown or shiny black in colour. *Globular pot *Jar with spout ::There are two variations ::: ::: Museums Artifacts have been collected over the years. Many pristine examples of artifacts can be found in Thai museums such as the Phra Pathommachedi National Museum in Nakhon Pathom city and the Prachinburi National Museum in Prachinburi, Prachinburi, Thailand.

Early life and education Abercrombie is the daughter of Lillie Frank of Lake Charles, Louisiana and Houston oilman James Smither Abercrombie (1891-1975). She rode quarter-horses on her father's ranch in west Texas then began taking lessons to ride a saddle horse before she was ten. That led to her competing in horse shows, including the Madison Square Garden where she won twelve blue ribbons at the 1953 National Horse Show. She traveled back and forth to board school between shows in a private jet. She graduated from Pine Manor Junior College then Rice University in 1946.  Personal life  Abercrombie was married and divorced five times and has two sons. In 1950 she married Argentinian architect Fernando H. Segura (1916-2013). Her two sons, Jamie Abercrombie Robinson (1957-) and George Anderson Robinson (1959-) were born in Houston where they continue to live. In 1964 she married Tony Bryan, a Harvard graduate and Royal Canadian Air Force pilot. He became president and CEO of J.S. Abercrombie's Cameron Iron Works in 1973 and fourteen years later they divorced. Pin Oak Stud Abercrombie first came to the Keeneland Yearling Sale with her father in 1949, and in 1952 they built Pin Oak Farm in Woodford County, Kentucky. Their early success included graded stakes winners such as Make A Play, Roman Patrol and Elocutionist. By 1987, Ms. Abercrombie had purchased a new Pin Oak Farm not far from the original one, and she established a thoroughbred breeding operation with sires such as Sky Classic, Peaks and Valleys, Maria's Mon and Broken Vow. In 1995 the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association recognized Pin Oak Stud as the state and national Thoroughbred Breeder of the Year. In that same year Canada's Sovereign Award went to Peaks and Valleys for Canadian Horse of the Year and Canadian Champion 3-year-old colt. The Pin Oak Stable currently houses nearly 40 broodmares and the stallions Bob and John, Cowboy Cal, Broken Vow and Sky Classic. Houston Boxing Association In 1982 Abercrombie started the Houston Boxing Association and within four years was hosting nearly 50 fights in a single year. With a nutritionist, her signed boxers live rent free in an apartment complex and training in a custom exercise facilities in Houston or travel to her Abercrombie Cannonade Ranch near Gonzales Texas. Abercrombie provides her boxers with health-care insurance as well as profit-sharing benefits. Philanthropy = Rice University = Rice University received gifts of at least $4.6 million from Abercrombie and acknowledged their gratitude when they created the Legacy Society and included her in it. Her work as a member of the Rice University Board of Trustees left a lasting impression on the campus. Her work on the building and grounds committee began in 1979, directing patronage in supporting high quality architectural projects in new buildings, continues today even after her retirement from the board in 1994. = Kentucky Equine Humane Center = Abercrombie cofounded the nonprofit Kentucky Equine Humane Center which works closely with the state's major thoroughbred racetracks (Turfway, Keeneland, Churchill Downs and Ellis Park), where owners can surrender unwanted horses directly from a training or racing stable. The Center opened in 2007 in Nicholasville, Kentucky, and no horse is turned away nor are fees required for surrendering a horse to them. = The Lexington School = One of Abercrombie's more beloved results of her philanthropy is a private K-8 school, The Lexington School, located in Lexington, Kentucky. It opened in the fall of 1959. In honor of her 90th birthday, The Lexington School created a video that includes a variety of images of her early life and the beginning of the school: \\"A Birthday Salute to Ms. A\\" (January 25, 2016).

Gonz√°lez excelled in drawing, painting, and woodcut, a technique on which she held numerous courses and workshops, although due to vision problems, she devoted herself in later years to the technique of pastel, but without ceasing to teach the woodcut technique at her private workshop in Montevideo. Her work is mostly figurative, often costumbrista, developing various themes in the form of a series, such as the \\"Novias revolucionarias\\". This began in 1968 as a manifesto of ironic protest against marriage conceived as a loss of freedom, and in the era of dictatorship, became a symbol of protest on behalf of the loved ones of prisoners, exiles, and the disappeared.

He also said that the hidden motive behind the Patidar agitations is nothing but a gameplan to scrape the reservation system, and that his movement will counter it to 'protect their constitutional right'. Thakor was arrested in September 2015 along with many others for organizing a meeting of all OBC communities in Mehsana district. =Politics= On 23 October 2017, Thakor joined the Indian National Congress party.

Overview The book includes 42 contributed chapters by a variety of authors, including some contemporaries of Alan Turing. The book was published in January 2017 by Oxford University Press, in hardcover, paperback, and e-book formats. Contents The Turing Guide is divided into eight main parts, covering various aspects of Alan Turing's life and work: # Biography: Biographical aspects of Alan Turing. # The Universal Machine and Beyond: Turing's universal machine (now known as a Turing machine), developed while at King's College, Cambridge, which provides a theoretical framework for reasoning about computation, a starting point for the field of theoretical computer science. # Codebreaker: Turing's work on codebreaking during World War II at Bletchley Park, especially the Bombe for decrypting the German Enigma machine. # Computers after the War: Turing's post-War work on computing, at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and at the University of Manchester. He made contributions to both hardware design, through the ACE computer (later implemented as the Pilot ACE) at the NPL, and software, especially at Manchester using the Manchester Baby computer, later the Manchester Mark 1 and Ferranti Mark 1. # Artificial Intelligence and the Mind: Turing's pioneering and philosophical contribution to machine intelligence (now known as Artificial Intelligence or AI), including the Turing test. # Biological Growth: Morphogenesis, Turing's last major scientific contribution, on the generation of complex patterns through chemical processes in biology and on the mathematics behind them, foundational in mathematical biology. # Mathematics: Some of Turing's mathematical achievements, including one of his most significant influences, Max Newman. # Finale: Turing in a wider subsequent context, including his influence and legacy to science and in the public consciousness. The book includes a foreword by Andrew Hodges, preface, notes on the contributors, endnotes, and an index.

Dog... Rabbit..., also known as One Last Score, is a 1999 American crime drama thriller film written, directed by and starring Matthew Modine, in his feature film debut as a director. It also stars John Hurt, Kevin J. O'Connor, Bruce Dern, David Keith and Lisa Marie. Plot Johnnie Cooper (Modine), fresh out of prison for armed robbery, finds work at a gas station to try to start a new life. His parole officer, Gilmore (Keith), lets Cooper's father Sean (Hurt), who he strongly suspects was also involved in the robbery, know about his release because of good behavior. Johnnie later calls his home where his brother Jamie (O'Connor) answers. Jamie and his girlfriend Judy (Marie) visit Johnnie and invite him home for a barbecue. Johnnie's boss (Dern) encourages Johnnie to go after work. It is learned that Johnnie, Jamie, and their father were all involved in the heist that got Johnnie in prison. After getting into a fight with his father, who is revealed to have left Johnnie behind to the cops on their last heist, Johnnie goes to a bar with Jamie and Judy. When Jamie tries to rob some Mexican drug dealers, and they fight him back, Johnnie intervenes, accidentally killing one of the Mexicans. Johnnie, Jamie and Judy all drive away. The next morning, Gilmore arrives at the Johnnie's workplace, having heard about the incident, to interrogate Johnnie about where he was last night. Being convinced that Johnnie was at his family's barbecue, Gilmore starts to leave, but Jamie, afraid of going to jail, knocks him out over the head with a wooden board. Freaking out, Johnnie takes Gilmore to the hospital, and later goes on the run with Jamie, and tells Judy to stay in town to not get involved. Johnnie takes Jamie, who is convinced that Gilmore is dead, along to work at a tortilla factory owned by a Mexican friend, Villalobos, in Tijuana, to hide out for a few months. While working there for several weeks, which makes Jamie uneasy, they conspire with another long-time employee, Cesar (Palomino), to pull off a heist at a bullring to finally get out of Tijuana. Gilmore, who has been recovering from his injury, searches for Johnnie and Jamie by interrogating different people, including Judy. This worries Judy, who later tries to find Jamie in Tijuana and inform him and Johnnie about how Gilmore isn't really dead. Johnnie tries to send Judy away, but she is later kidnapped by the Mexican drug dealers from the beginning when they recognize Johnnie working at the tortilla factory and see her there. Villalobos and Sean eventually discover the scheme the brothers and Cesar are planning at the bullring and want to be part of it. Johnnie tries to get out of it all when he learns Gilmore survived the blow to the head, but Sean convinces him to stay and help out. While going through with their plan, Judy is tortured by her abductors until she reveals Jamie's heist plans. The dealers go to find Jamie in retribution for the killing of one of their men, and Judy escapes from them and tries to get to Jamie before they do. While Johnnie and Cesar are robbing the cashiers at the bullring, Jamie gets their getaway car ready to go to the beach, where Sean is supposed to be waiting for them all on a speedboat. Judy arrives at the bullring to reunite with Jamie, but the drug dealers also arrive. As Johnnie and Cesar try to get into the getaway car, a shootout ensues with the drug dealers, which catches the attention of the bullring guards, who also get involved. In the ensuing gunfight, Judy, Jamie, Cesar, and some of the dealers are killed, and Johnnie tries to get away with the money to the beach. The guards call the police to help catch Johnnie. When Sean sees Johnnie arriving with the money, but with some policemen on his heels, he uses the speedboat to escape, leaving Johnnie behind again to be arrested for the robbery. The film ends with a flashback where as kids, Johnnie is explaining to Jamie the art of theft.

Ware was born in Dublin, the son of historian Sir James Ware. Nothing is known of his education, and he was likely educated by his father in London. On his father's death in 1666, he inherited a large collection of historical manuscripts, which he eventually sold to Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon in 1686. While the manuscripts were in his possession, he added a large number of fabricated documents to them. This put him at odds with Roman Catholic interests in Ireland, and he went into exile in England during the reign of King James II of England. On 24 December 1666, Robert married Elizabeth, the daughter of his cousin Sir Henry Piers, 1st Baronet. He died in 1697 (1696 old style), survived by one son. Ware's invented documents misled historians of the Protestant Reformation for centuries afterwards; Thomas Edward Bridgett finally exposed him in 1890, but it was not until the 20th century that historians were able to sort out the implications of his findings.

Geminus began his senatorial career as a quaestor for the emperor Tiberius; after this he was the emperor's designate for the Republican office of plebeian tribune. Around this time, definitely before he acceded to the consulate, Geminus was admitted to the Septemviri epulonum. According to Tacitus, Geminus owed his successes in his senatorial career to the empress Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Tacitus also describes Geminus as \\"a man well-fitted to win the affection of a woman\\", and witty, and \\"accustomed to ridicule Tiberius with those bitter jests the powerful remember so long.\\"Tacitus, Annales, V.2 Once Livia died, in the year of his consulate, Geminus was prosecuted for treason. According to Dio Cassius, upon being accused of majestas Geminus stood in the Senate chamber, and read his will to the assembled body wherein he left his inheritance in equal portions to his children and the emperor. Thereupon he was charged with being a coward, and he responded by returning home before a vote on the charges was taken. When the quaestor arrived to see to his execution, Geminus slit his wrists saying, \\"Report to the senate that it is thus one dies who is a man.\\" After his death, his wife Mutilia Prisca entered the Senate House where she killed herself with a dagger she had brought in secretly with her.Dio Cassius, LVIII, 4  References  1st-century Romans 29 deaths Year of birth unknown Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Epulones of the Roman Empire ","title":"Gaius Fufius Geminus (consul 29)"},{"id":"55906061","text":"Frances Beatrice Taylor, from a 1922 publication Frances Beatrice Taylor (May 15, 1891 ‚Äî June 10, 1979) was a Canadian journalist, poet, and playwright.

At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 78 resources, including 56 contributing buildings, one contributing site, one contributing object, 18 non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing structure. The district covers most of the central business district. It has a linear layout, with twin main streets (Davis and Benton), associated with Central Park and the Adams County Courthouse (not in the district) at its uppermost end. This is an unusual town layout and is thought to be the only town in Iowa so configured. The elevation slopes down toward the East Nodaway River, south of the downtown and a light industrial area. The commercial buildings are mostly masonry structures constructed with bricks. Many of them replaced wood-frame structures that were destroyed in an 1896 fire. Two other periods of major development include the years after the Panic of 1893 and the Great Depression. The latter focuses on the role the Federal government played in the enhancement of public art. The buildings are from one- to three stories in height, although most are no taller than two stories. Besides commercial use, buildings here also housed theaters, government functions, especially federal agricultural agencies, and the inclusion of automobile-related businesses. The Corning Opera House (1902) is individually listed on the National Register. The park and its fountain are the contributing site and the contributing object.

Education and career A. Harry Wheeler received in 1894 his bachelor of science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He taught high school in Worcester, Massachusetts from 1894 to 1896 and then was a graduate student in mathematics from 1896 to 1899 at Clark University, but left without a degree. He taught high school mathematics in Worcester from 1899 to 1920. His textbooks are First Course in Algebra (1907) and Examples in Algebra (1914). At age 47, returned in 1920 to graduate study in mathematics at Clark University, receiving a master's degree in 1921. Wheeler was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 at Toronto.Wheeler, Albert Harry (1924) \\"Certain forms of the icosahedron and a method for deriving and designating higher polyhedra.\\" In Proceedings of the International Mathematical Congress, Toronto, vol. 1, pp. 701‚Äì708. In 1924 he began part-time teaching (in addition to his high school teaching) as an adjunct instructor of geometry, first at Brown University and then at Wellesley College; however, his college-level adjunct teaching ended by the early 1930s. Wheeler and H. S. M. Coxeter planned to be coauthors (with two other mathematicians) of a short book, which was eventually named The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra and became a minor classic of mathematical literature. However, in 1938 Wheeler objected to Coxeter's expository style so that Coxeter replaced Wheeler's name on the book's title page by another author, although Wheeler is briefly mentioned in the text. Extending work of Max Br√ºckner, Wheeler actually constructed previously unknown polyhedra. In particular, he produced new stellations of the icosahedron. This achievement impressed Coxeter, who noted Wheeler's achievement in the text. Wheeler continued teaching high school mathematics in Worcester until his retirement. His models continued to attract attention. In 1950 he received an invitation to exhibit part of his model collection at the 1950 ICM in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 30 August to September 6. However, serious illness prevented him from attending the conference, and he died in December 1950. Selected works =Books= =Patents= * Blower for peas or the like.

It specifically refers to poems written in classical Japanese in non-traditional forms (as opposed to the 5-7-5-7-7 waka and the 5-7-5 haiku) in the Meiji period. Notable practitioners of the form included Yuasa Banketsu and Ochiai Naobumi. It declined in popularity in the first two decades of the twentieth century, in favour of free-form poetry in a more vernacular form of Japanese.  Etymology  Shintaishi (literally \\"new form poetry\\") has its origins in the Meiji period. It refers to poetry with a fixed form and written in classical Japanese. Early Japanese bilingual dictionaries of French and English generally translated the words po√®me and poem as shi (Ë©©), but in the early Meiji period this word almost exclusively referred to kanshi (poetry in Classical Chinese). and Ry≈çkichi Yatabe, as well as Inoue Tetsujir≈ç in his preface to a verse by Longfellow, expressed the necessity that Meiji poetry be written in a new form unlike the classical styles of Japanese poetry. The word shintaishi is modeled on kotaishi (\\"old form poetry\\", the Japanese name for gushi) and kintaishi (\\"modern form poetry\\", the Japanese pronunciation of jintishi).  Content  Shintaishi were meant to express emotions, concepts and so on that were seen as too \\"modern\\" to be addressed in traditional poetic forms such as haiku and waka.  Examples  Early works in the shintaishi form include those included in Takeuchi Setsu's edited volume Shintai-shiika (Êñ∞‰ΩìË©©Ê≠å) and Yamada Bimy≈ç's edited volume Shintaishi-sen (Êñ∞‰ΩìË©ûÈÅ∏), both of which became bestsellers. Yuasa Banketsu's \\"J≈´ni no ishizuka\\" and Ochiai Naobumi's White Aster are usually taken as early representative examples of the form.  Rise and fall  The form reached its zenith of popularity at the turn of the twentieth century, specifically the \\"Meiji 30s\\", or 1897 to 1906, in Japanese historiographic terms. In the following decade, however, under the influence of Naturalism and the vernacular free-form poetry movement (Âè£Ë™ûËá™Áî±Ë©©ÈÅãÂãï), it saw a decline and effectively disappeared.

Biography  Born Mamajan Kuliyeva () in the city of B√ºzme√Ωin (annexed and made part of the city Ashgabat in 2013), Kuliyeva was orphaned at age 8. A lyric soprano, she studied at the Turkmenistan branch of the Moscow Conservatory from 1938 until 1941. Beginning in the latter year she was a member of the company at the Turkmen Theater of Opera and Ballet; she was the first to perform roles in Western operas on the Turkmenistan stage. She also created roles in numerous operas by composers from the Turkmen SSR and other Central Asian republics; among these were roles in Shasenem and Gharib, The Rose and the Nightingale, and Zohre and Tahir by Adrian Shaposhnikov and Abadan by Ashir Kuliev. Other roles in her repertoire included Marfa in The Tsar's Bride by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Marguerite in Faust by Charles Gounod, and the title role in Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini. During her career she appeared in a handful of films as well. For her work she received multiple awards during her career; she was named an Honored Artist of the Turkmen SSR in 1943, and became a People's Artist of the Turkmen SSR in 1952. Three years later she was awarded the title People's Artist of the USSR. In 2008 she was named a Hero of Turkmenistan. During her career she also received the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, and the Order of the Badge of Honour. She was a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Turkmen SSR at its second and fourth sessions. Kuliyeva, who is said to have been a \\"[Communist] Party organiser\\" during the Soviet era, continued to receive recognition from the Government of Turkmenistan after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 2010 it was reported that she still had final say over all matters of opera performance in Turkmenistan.

It was made available for digital download on 28 November 2017 by Global Records, as the record's third single. The track was written by Inna and Thomas Troelsen, while production was handled by Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan, David Ciente, Vlad Lucan and Troelsen. Musically, \\"Nirvana\\" is a Latin-influenced club song, featuring a rap delivered in Spanish during its drop. Music critics were generally positive towards the dance nature of \\"Nirvana\\", and predicted its commercial success, although some felt it was inferior to her previous work. An accompanying music video was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release to positive response from reviewers. Shot by Bogdan PƒÉun of production team NGM Creative, the clip was noted to have no plot. It makes use of neon lighting and features Inna wearing outfits from different brands. For further promotion, the singer performed \\"Nirvana\\" for native radio stations and appeared on Vocea Rom√¢niei. Commercially, the single reached the top three in Romania and Serbia and the top ten in Turkey. Background and composition \\"Nirvana\\" was written by Inna and Thomas Troelsen, while production was handled by Sebastian Barac, Marcel Botezan, David Ciente, Vlad Lucan and Troelsen. It was released for digital download as the third single from her fifth studio album of the same name (2017) on 28 November 2017 by Global Records. Musically, it is a club song. Its drop features a rap portion delivered in Spanish, while lyrically, Inna \\"miss[es] her lover being on her body\\". It commences with the lyrics \\"Boom boom, contigo te hace\\", while other lines include \\"Nine one one, I'm on fire\\", \\"Smoking Nirvana / Ring the ala- the-la-larm / Smoking Nirvana / Come on ring the ala-la-la-larm\\" and \\"Pues sabes que tu coraz√≥n conmigo, Hace boom boom contigo\\". Jonathan Currinn from website CelebMix noticed the inclusion of a post-chorus, comparing its structure to Inna's \\"Heaven\\" (2016), \\"Ruleta\\" (2017) and \\"Bop Bop\\" (2015). Pure Charts's Julien Goncalves thought that Inna \\"continues to surf on the craze of the Latin culture [...] on a sensual and feverish tempo\\", while Valentin Malfroy of French website Aficia noticed a similar production to its predecessor. The singer herself said \\"[the song] gives [her] a good mood, it is energetic [and] fresh.\\" Critical reception Upon its release, \\"Nirvana\\" was met with positive reviews from music critics. Kevin Apaza from Direct Lyrics praised the song and its drop as \\"feel-good\\", \\"sexy\\" and \\"party-ready\\", although naming it inferior to Inna's past singles including \\"Hot\\" (2008), \\"10 Minutes\\" (2010) and \\"Cola Song\\" (2014). David Watt, writing for British portal All-Noise, predicted the commercial success of \\"Nirvana\\": \\"[...] it‚Äôs a surefire hit.\\"; Aficia's Malfroy also noted its hit potential. Pure Charts's Goncalves wrote: \\"That's good, 'Nirvana' is a bomb where desire shows through every note\\". Music video A screenshot of a scene in the music video of \\"Nirvana\\", portraying Inna in a gold box accompanied by two women with their arms out. A critic interpreted it as Egypt-inspired.

Production team NGM Creative was hired for the shooting, of which Bogdan PƒÉun was credited as the director and Alexandru Mure»ôan as the director of photography of the clip. RD Styling procured Inna's outfits from brands including Alexandru Simedru, Trashkin, Vetements, Off White and Balenciaga. Hair styling was done by Make-up and Beauty Studio, and Endorphin Lab. Direct Lyrics noted that the music video \\"doesn‚Äôt have much storyline-wise\\". The visual opens with Inna walking through a hallway full of background dancers, sporting an outfit similar to the one wore in her previous music video for \\"Ruleta\\", consisting of animal print-designed shorts and overcoat with black boots. She then reaches a room with multiple people, watching two women eating and drinking; product placement of Coca-Cola is also incorporated in the scene. Other scenes include Inna \\"lounging around dressed in a teal outfit\\" and her in a gold box accompanied by two women with their arms out. The clip continues in a similar way and ends with Inna staring at a camera in a blue dress. Nearly all scenes make use of neon lighting, with cut shots showing her dancers performing choreography, and the singer singing to the song against multiple backdrops. The visual was generally viewed positively by reviewers. Direct Lyrics's Apaza wrote: \\"The music video [...] [is] filled with light effects, dancing, and beauty shots from Inna, and all of this is exactly what a song like 'Nirvana' needed, and not anything else. Inna‚Äôs music is all about having a good time, and freeing your mind. So this music video is more than adequate.\\" Son G√ºncelleme of Turkish newspaper Vatan found that the clip \\"stands out with its special costumes and make-up [...]\\", while Aficia's Malfroy compared it to Inna's visual for \\"In Your Eyes\\" (2013). Currinn from CelebMix labelled the clip as a mixture between Inna's own \\"Club Rocker\\" (2011) and G Girls' \\"Call the Police\\" (2016) videos, further saying: \\"The song has hidden depths which the music video relates to well.\\" He also commented on the shot featuring a gold box: \\"It has an Egyptian-feel to [it], although we feel this distracts us from the main visuals.\\" Watt of All-Noise found the clip enjoyable, although calling it imperfect, and noticing that \\"Inna didn't put a lot of heart or money in the music video. It's evident since the video is a simple low-budget MV.\\" Watt also pointed out the singer's weight gain, stating: \\"Her body still looks great but it's nowhere close to what it used to be during 'Hot' and 'Cola Song' days.\\" Live performances Inna performed the song live on the seventh season of Romanian reality singing competition Vocea Rom√¢niei on 8 December 2017, along with \\"Ruleta\\". She also appeared on Romanian radio station Kiss FM to sing the song four days later. Inna was accompanied by male background dancers and standing in a circulating light pyramid. Currinn thought that the performance was \\"outstanding\\", while writing: \\"We love it when an artist brings a new and incredible live performance, and Inna sure has done that. [T]his is like no other performance you have ever seen.\\" Inna was also scheduled to sing the song for native radio station Pro FM, but her performance was cancelled due to her cold. On 20 December 2017, the singer uploaded a video on YouTube of her performing to the song with her background dancers while walking through the building of Virgin Radio Romania, as well as delivering a stripped-down performance of \\"Nirvana\\" there.

It can cause psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and hallucinations. It can also produce neurological symptoms such as confusion, memory loss, weakness, sensory loss, pain, seizures, and problems coordinating the movement of the body. While its cause is unknown, the most common hypothesis is that it is caused by an immune system attack on the nervous system. This immune system attack is linked to cancer in most cases, usually small cell lung carcinoma. The condition's namesake, the anti-Hu antibody, is a protein made by the host's immune system, and it is present in virtually all cases. Treatment is focused on removing the underlying cancer and suppressing the immune system. Its prognosis remains quite poor, with most patients dying less than a year after diagnosis.  Signs and symptoms  The signs and symptoms can vary in onset, quality, duration, severity, and response to treatment. Symptoms tend to present acutely over days to weeks. Its symptoms depend on which areas of the brain the disease affects, because specific parts of the brain have particular functions. Many cases involve an attack on the limbic system, which includes structures like the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. Respectively these brain regions regulate anger, fear, memory formation, and motor and sensory signaling. Affected persons may develop memory loss and may have sudden changes in personality. This is often accompanied by headaches, delusions, or hallucinations. In some cases, the antibodies created by this illness attack another structure of the brain called the brainstem. The brainstem is responsible for basic bodily functions like breathing, but not more complex actions and emotions, which is why the presentation is different when the disease affects the limbic system than when it affects the brainstem. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and decreased breathing which may progress to respiratory failure.  Cause  The condition can involve the limbic system of the brain, which mediates key functions within motivation, emotion, learning, and memory. Anti-Hu associated encephalitis is a syndrome associated with cancer. However, occasionally it occurs without cancer being present. Proteins react within the brain and change behavior and basic biological functions. Primarily adults contract this illness, and typically they have an underlying cancer that is either undiagnosed, diagnosed, in remission, or cured. The condition can occur at any point during cancer. Small cell lung cancer is a particularly aggressive cancer more common in smokers and is associated with anti-Hu encephalitis. Neuroblastoma is a cancer more frequently affecting children, and despite the relatively low rates of anti-Hu among children with neuroblastoma, these are the most likely children to have anti-Hu associated encephalitis. Pathophysiology Nearly all people with the condition have anti-Hu antibodies in their serum. The antibody is produced by the body as an immune system response to Hu proteins, which are naturally clustered within the nuclei of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. The condition can involve a number of neural structures including the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, dorsal roots, peripheral nerves, and the limbic system of the brain. There is a debate about whether the antibody is a cause of, rather than an effect of, the disease process. Older studies suggested the antibodies caused the disease, pointing to the discovery of antibody deposition in the brain tissue of patients at autopsy. However, the injection of the antibodies into mice did not produce any disease, and the deposition of antibody was often not at the places where brain damage was greatest. Newer studies suggest the antibodies are an effect, not a cause, of the condition, with a consensus that a patient's own T cells are playing a major role in the disease process. These T cells may be activated by the Hu proteins. In people with cancer, the cancer has a likely role in the cause of the encephalitis. In a paraneoplastic syndrome, a cancer cell can create proteins that are normally only found as naturally-occurring proteins in other cell types in other parts of the body. In patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, cancer cells in the lung can produce Hu proteins that are usually only found inside of the body's own neurons. It is hypothesized that through these cancer-produced Hu proteins, the body creates an immune system response. This reaction includes T cells, which then attack nervous tissue. The cancer- produced Hu proteins are found in nearly all small-cell lung carcinomas, 70 percent of neuroblastomas, and a small percentage of other tumors.  Diagnosis  Anti-Hu encephalitis is a disease characterized by production of anti-Hu antibodies and rapid development of particular signs and symptoms. Therefore, the diagnosis usually involves detecting its associated psychiatric and neurologic deficits and then performing diagnostic testing. If these signs and symptoms occur in a person who is suspected of having cancer, then anti-Hu associated encephalitis is also suspected. Because small cell lung cancer commonly occurs together with anti-Hu encephalitis, a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer confers a greater suspicion. In suspected cases, physicians perform diagnostic testing using a protein-detecting test that identify anti- Hu antibodies, if present. Another test involves examining the fluid that bathes the brain and spine, although this test is less specific for the disease. Physicians may also use a special imaging device, known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can take pictures of the patient's brain and detect signs of inflammation that suggest ongoing disease. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is another tool that can be done to clarify whether anti-Hu encephalitis is the underlying cause of a patient's symptoms. This is a test that involves placing probes on a person's head to detect electrical brain activity. Certain patterns of activity can be indicative of brain disease. In the case of anti-Hu encephalitis, temporal lobe electrical activity changes and the length of certain electrical waves known as delta and theta waves become slowed. Before the diagnosis can be made, other causes of disease need to be ruled out. They could be the sole cause or a co-contributor to a patient's new symptoms, in addition to anti-Hu encephalitis. Examples include‚Äîbut are not limited to‚Äîproblems with metabolism, a brain tumor, or inflammation of tissue coating around the brain.  Treatment  The mainstay of treatment involves two broad strategies: treat the cancer that usually occurs with the disease, and give medications that suppress the body's immune system attack on the nervous system. Because current treatments are not successful at eliminating the disease, the goal of treatment is often to reduce symptoms rather than attempt to cure it. To date, treatments have been unsuccessful in achieving a sustained reduction of symptoms or survival in the vast majority of patients. Some treatments may directly combat the mechanisms by which the disease may be caused. To suppress the immune system, steroids, antibodies, or even human cells may be injected into a patient. Certain types of antibodies called intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) also have shown to lead to reduced symptoms due to their ability to reduce and eliminate anti-Hu antibodies. A drug called rituximab, a molecule that targets T cells, helps reduce the symptoms of anti-Hu encephalitis and decreases the number of anti- Hu antibodies. Cancer treatment may involve surgical removal of the tumor, or medications that may shrink or eliminate the tumor. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug, has shown promise, in addition to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This hormone is involved in regulating many body functions including stress level and blood pressure. Steroids such as dexamethasone may help reduce disease burden by reducing the antibody- building activity of the disease. Despite the fact that steroids can be used to reduce the immunological antibody-building activity of the disease in all people, many other anti-Hu encephalitis treatments are most effective in children. Treatments may also be focused purely on symptoms rather than targeting the potential causes of the disease. For seizures, anticonvulsant medications may be used, such as valproic acid, levetiracetam, or lamotrigine. For hallucinations, delusions, and mood disturbances, second generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., olanzapine, clozapine) are also used for symptom control.  Prognosis  Although many patients have an underlying cancer, the prognosis is determined by the severity of the neurological symptoms produced by the encephalitis. Compared to other paraneoplastic encephalitides, anti-Hu associated encephalitis has an especially poor prognosis. Several studies reporting an average survival time of less than a year, from the time of diagnosis. Much of the prognosis depends on the efficacy of treatment, which is directed at the underlying cancer, if present. Patients with lower titers of the anti-Hu antibody tend to have a better prognosis.  Epidemiology  Histopathology of small cell carcinoma of the lung, which is strongly associated with anti-Hu antibodies. The typical age at diagnosis is 63 years old. It is three times more common in men than women. Of those diagnosed with the condition, about 85 percent also had a cancer diagnosis, with 86 percent being lung cancers (mostly small-cell carcinoma) and 14 percent being outside the lung (most commonly prostate, gastrointestinal, breast, and bladder cancer). However, other cancers have been known to co-occur with the disease, including spindle cell carcinoma of the sinus and a seminoma of the mediastinum. People with small cell carcinoma often have other diseases caused by an immune response to the cancer, including Cushing syndrome, SIADH, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.  History  The condition was first identified in 1985 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center at Cornell University, by three physicians, Francesc Graus, Carlos Cordon-Cardo, and Jerome Posner. They identified the anti-Hu antibody in two patients who had sensory neuronopathy and small cell carcinoma of the lung.  Special populations  Children, in addition to adults, also cen develop anti-Hu encephalitis; however, the disease manifests differently in children. As with adults, anti-Hu encephalitis is associated with malignancy. The cancers most associated with anti-Hu encephalitis are neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma. Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a condition that develops in children as a result of anti-Hu antibodies. The illness afflicts younger children, with one study showing an age range of about 2 months to 10 years, with the majority of cases falling between 6 months to 3 years. The first symptoms are nonspecific. For instance, it can present like an upper airway infection, with cough and fever, or like an intestinal infection, with vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Crying, particularly in younger children, can be an early sign. Other symptoms include problems with eye movement, irritability, and insomnia.

The area was originally two different fields: Duggan Field (on the west) and Slaughter Field (on the east). When it was proven that both Duggan Field and Slaughter Field were producing from the same formation, they were combined under a single field regulation named Slaughter Field. In March 2015, it ranked 25th on the United States Energy Information's Top 100 U.S. Oil and Gas Fields.  Geologic setting  Slaughter Field is located on the Northern Shelf (also commonly referred to as the Northwestern Shelf) of the Permian Basin. However, it is specifically related to the Midland Basin, one of the three major features within the Greater Permian Basin. It is a ramp-type carbonate field that produces from ~450 to 750 feet below the top of the San Andres member of the Permian section.  Basin development  Model of the Permian Basin's development throughout geologic time and the resultant modern constituents. Red star indicates the location of Slaughter Field. Prior to the formation of the Permian Basin, this area was the expansive marine environment of the Tobosa Basin. In the development of the Greater Permian Basin, there are three main contributing factors. Firstly, mass deposition of clastic sediments causing the initial depression. Following this mass deposition, the collision of supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana to form Pangea with associated faulting and uplift. Finally, basin filling. Due to faulting, uplift, erosion, and varying rates of subsidence, the Tobosa Basin was segregated into sub- basins and platforms. The three major constituents of the basin are the Delaware Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Midland Basin. Other important constituents are the Northern Shelf and Eastern Shelf. There are several other structures associated with the formation of the basin that do not directly affect Slaughter Field. The two sub-basins, Delaware and Midland, rapidly subsided while the Central Basin Platform did not suffer a change in elevation. Prior to the Permian, the Midland Basin was already subjected to considerable deposition of clastic material related to the Ouachita Orogeny. A substantial subaqueous deltaic system developed because of this mass deposition that composed the majority of the basin. By the Middle Permian, the basin was covered with floodplains and almost completely filled. These processes created what is now the Permian Basin and its major constituents.  Stratigraphy  The San Andres is a formation at the base of the Guadalupian Epoch in the Permian Period. It consists of mainly dolomite and anhydrite and is deposited on top of the sandy Dolomite of the Glorietta Formation in the Leonardian Epoch. Above the San Andres is the anhydrite, shale, and sandstone of the Grayburg Formation. Specifically in Slaughter Field, the San Andres formation is capped by a substantial layer of evaporites. Most of the Upper Permian hydrocarbon reservoirs are found within the San Andres and Grayburg Formations. Within the Northern Shelf, the San Andres Formation is approximately 1500 feet thick. The upper and lower San Andres is divided by a distinct later of siltstone up to 10 feet thick.  Depositional environments  Basic depositional model of the Northern Shelf of the Permian Basin showing the three main depositional environments associated with Slaughter Field. The region of Slaughter Field can be characterized by three main depositional environments: the shoals of the shelf margin, lagoonal evaporites, and the wackestones and packstones in the tidal flats. These environments result from the cyclic deposits in a regressive series. These deposits prograde to the south across the broad, shallow marine Northern Shelf.  Reservoir characteristics  The San Andres Formation of Slaughter Field is a restricted platform carbonate play consisting of flat-lying, bioturbated wackestones and packstones of the San Andres Formation and produces from nearly 5000 feet depth. This is the younger, shallower section of the lower San Andres. The reservoir rock has an average porosity of approximately 11% and a uniform permeability of 0.2 to 30 mD. The source rock is organic-rich calcareous shale and shaley limestone. Most of the oil and gas migrates long distances up to the Northern Shelf from the Midland Basin. This most likely allows the oil in the San Andres to be more mature that the rest of the Upper Permian. The trap is stratigraphic with an up-dip porosity pinch out.  Production  Slaughter Field produces sour crude oil with an API gravity of 29¬∞ - 31¬∞. It is also produced natural gas well into the interior of the Northern Shelf. The Northern Shelf, the greatest producing region in the entire Permian Basin, has successfully produced over four billion barrels of oil. After the field was discovered in 1937, primary production was through depletion and solution gas drive. Secondary recovery was conducted from the 1960s to 1970s through infill drilling programs. In 1980, CO2 flooding was initiated in the south/southeastern region of the field. There are over 6000 wells in Slaughter Field with various operators throughout its existence. This field has produced more than 1.2 billion barrels of oil and approximately 172,540,000 mcf of gas.

As an android is a human-like robot, a cyborg, on the other hand, is an organism whose physiological functioning is aided by or dependent upon a mechanical/electronic device that relies on some sort of feedback. Implantable cybernetics and biomechatronics are on course to be proliferated among the global population within the twenty-first century as the markets for implantable electronics are already huge and growing. The global market for artificial cardiac pacemakers (PMs) and implantable cardioverter- defibrillators (ICDs) was approximately ‚Ç¨8 billion in 2015, and is growing at 10% per year. Over 350 million people worldwide experience endemic diseases, diabetes, cardiac and renal failure, hearing disorders, and neurological disorders, thus making implantable technologies specific to these uses susceptible to increasingly higher demand. However, for the millions of cyborgs already equipped with body-enhancing technologies, namely PMs and ICDs, the data mining of these technologies pertains to broader topics of data sovereignty, data ownership rights, privacy and security, and medical research and development.  Implantable technologies and their general uses  According to European Directive 90/385/EEC, an \\"active implantable medical device\\" is any device that is intended to be used for human beings in the: 1) diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease or injury; 2) investigation, replacement, or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process; and 3) control of conception. The implantable device is to be totally or partially introduced, surgically or medically, into the human body, and is intended to remain after the procedure. According to one definition of the term cyborg, basic technologies, such as implantable medical devices, that humanity has physical attachments with have already made humans into cyborgs. These technologies are responsible for enhancing people's cognitive abilities, or more importantly, keeping them alive. The three most common implantable technologies are cochlear implants, PMs, and ICDs. Cochlear implants aid in the process of hearing, and are used by more than 200,000 patients worldwide. PMs and ICDs keep people alive through the measurement of bodily voltage levels, measurement of regular and irregular heartbeats, and the delivery of electric impulses when irregularities are sensed in order to keep the person alive. There are about 3 million people worldwide with pacemakers, and each year 600,000 pacemakers are implanted. The data collected from these technologies, however, is not owned by the person whose body the technology is in, but rather the company who owns the intellectual property to that technology, as well as other third-parties. Intellectual Property, Data brokerage, and the Third-Party doctrine =Intellectual Property and Data brokerage= Companies are now able to mine the data exhaust from internet- enabled wearable and implantable technologies, such as medical and fitness tracking devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch Nike+, etc.), sensors, PMs, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) microchips, and so forth. However, consumers in the U.S. do not have agency over their data due to current intellectual property law and the third-party doctrine. Intellectual property owners of the software, as well as the patented hardware and processes, of these devices acquire the data from the cyborg's bodily processes via these implantable devices, which become property of the owner, not the cyborg. Consumers surrender these massive pools of data via an End-User-License-Agreement (EULAs), terms of service agreements, and so forth. Companies then algorithmically arrange data, and consumers lose ownership of their data to the intellectual property owners and data brokerage firms to commodify, thus becoming a part of the larger Big Data economy. In a $300 billion-a-year industry, currently no legislation specific to the regulation of third-party data broker firms exists. Third-party data broker firms are not restricted by Federal Trade Commission regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. It is very difficult for consumers to opt-in and out of having data collected about them, whereby their data ownership rights become very limited. =Third-party doctrine= Under the third-party doctrine, an individual does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to information they voluntarily disclose to a third party. In the context of the PM, which monitors a patient's heartbeat, blood temperature, breathing, and heart electrical activity, this extracted data is voluntarily given to a third party, and thus subject to the third-party doctrine. The five largest PM manufacturers in the world are the U.S.‚Äôs Medtronic ($1.9 billion in global PM sales in 2013), St. Jude Medical (nearly $1 billion in global PM sales in 2013), and Boston Scientific ($514 million in global PM sales in 2013), Germany's Biotronik ($397 million in global PM sales in 2013), and Italy's Sorin Group ($219 million global PM sales in 2013). PM users have no agency over their data, nor over who has the ability to access it, and current laws impose no requirement for manufacturers to allow PM users access to their own data. The notable activist, Hugo Campo, has been fighting for the right to access the data collected by his own defibrillator for years without success due to the logic of PM data being covered by the third-party doctrine. =EU GDPR and Cyborg data= In April 2016, the European Union tabled legislation for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC of 1995, and comes into force on May 25, 2018. Internet-enabled wearable and future implantable technologies will fall under the purview of this legislation. The directive will implement tougher fines for non-compliance and breaches, and gives consumers more control over how their personal data is used. Some of these consumer rights are, but are not limited to, having the right: * To request data in monthly intervals; * To access any information a company holds on them; * To know why that data is being processed; * To know how long it is stored for; * To know who gets to see their data; * To demand that their data be deleted if it is no longer necessary to the purpose for which it was collected; and so forth Surveillance and Sousveillance As cyborgs are comprehensive data subjects, they can also be used as a powerful instrument to facilitate surveillance and sousveillance through optical recording technology. Some data collection from cyborgs can be harmless, namely posting pictures to Facebook, or recording one's life experiences. However, cyborgs can serve as a means of surveillance on the overall populace via sousveillance. Sousveillance is the notion of a populace watching the state from below, whereby the notable University of Toronto professor and cyborg, Steve Mann, has advocated that sousveillant devices can ‚Äúinvert the panopticon‚Äù and challenge and balance the hypocrisy and corruption that is otherwise inherent in a surveillance-only society. Sousveillant technologies secure the cyborg and individuals, especially by deterring and documenting crime, but potentially infringes privacy on cyborgs and non-cyborgs as well. Google Glass, for example, is an optical recording device that presents concerns toward privacy in public. The ability for cyborgs to record everyday routines and interactions with others thus present the question of how society and laws are to respond to the advent of cyborgs being subjects and instruments of surveillance and sousveillance. Public good Data mined from bodily processes are able to help companies in their research and development endeavours in developing better technologies, and conducting invaluable medical research for identifying and managing various conditions. PMs and ICDs offered by major companies come with wireless capabilities that communicate with home transmitters, which then relay data to the physician, and thus allow for remote patient follow-up and monitoring. These systems for remote follow- up are used widely across the U.S. and Europe. Major PM and ICD producers have their own remote monitoring system networks, such as Biotronik's Home Monitoring, Medtronic's CareLink Network, Boston Scientific's Latitude Patient Management system, and St. Jude Medical's Merlin.net. The benefits of this data collection include a reduction of in-clinic visits, improved patient safety, increased patient satisfaction, and potential cost savings for consumers. The ability to remotely follow up because of PM and ICD data collection allows for tracking product performance in a large number of patients, and may allow earlier identification of issues with specific models. The data collected from PMs and ICDs have the potential to facilitate critical medical research. Namely, Medtronic collects and analyzes the data generated by its pacemakers and defibrillators via the CareLink system. Medtronic is using the collected PM data and is working with researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine in order to help answer specific questions about heart disease, such as whether weak hearts cause arrhythmias or vice versa. Although this aspect of the technology is not widely proliferated yet, scientists and industry developers say that wireless devices could trigger an automatic treatment, which could range from electrical stimulation to the release of drugs.

Later, she felt that her initial approach was not genuine to her own experience and began to experiment with different techniques and settings for her photographs. She began to use digital tools, such as Photoshop, to combine her photographs and also to use more color photography. Romero's contemporary work includes a large amount of staging to create a sense of theater and expresses a diverse picture of Native American identities. The Santa Fe New Mexican describes her work as a \\"sometimes whimsical, often complex examination of modern culture with a distinctly modern Indigenous worldview.\\" The Bristol Post quoted her series, Water Memories, as \\"breathtaking,\\" and that it \\"exposes the fragile and essential relationships that exist between people, water and life.\\" Water Memories was shown in 2016 at the exhibition, \\"STILL,\\" held at the Rainmaker Gallery in Bristol.

She was the first child of Edward and Martha (born Sykes) Swaine. She was involved in her local school; the Unitarian Sunday School and she was the honorary secretary of the Yorkshire Ladies' Educational Association. This association was established in 1825 by women to support other women living in poor industrial conditions. The association was still in operation in 2017. Swaine wanted the law to be changed so that married women might have their own possessions and for women to be able to access education in universities. She was a member of the Ladies' Council of Education of Yorkshire. In 1849 her father published a pamphlet based on a lecture title The Political Franchise: A Public Trust. He argued the case for universal suffrage for men, but he excluded women from his ambitions. She translated a theological work by Albert R√©ville from French. It was titled History of the Doctrine of the Deity of Jesus Christ and it was published in 1870. In the 1881 census she described herself as having \\"no proper trade or profession\\". In 1882 the Sunday School Association published her book Remarkable Women as Examples for Girls which included biographies of notable women.Brown, H. (2004).

History In 2009, the American company Airtronic USA unveiled a modernized version of the weapon called the RPG-7USA. The launcher is fitted with updated features including a MIL-STD-1913 Quad Rail System for mounting combat optics, flip-up back up iron sights, aiming lasers/illuminators, tactical lights, and vertical foregips, as well as an M4 carbine-style pistol grip and telescoping stock. Compared to the RPG-7V2, the American launcher, named by the company the Precision Shoulder-fired Rocket Launcher (PSRL-1), is slightly lighter at 14 lb (6.35 kg) unloaded without optics and is made of 4140/4150 ordnance-grade steel for a longer 1,000-round lifespan that can separate into two pieces for compact carry. The PSRL-1 uses EOTech sights with a new sighting system that combines an illuminated reticule for use in low light situations, and is able to be fitted with magnifying optical sights for long-range firing enabling 90% hit probability at 800 metres, twice the distance of other RPGs; rate of fire is 3-4 rounds per minute. It is reportedly accurate at ranges from 900-1,200 m, and guided rockets could extend range to 2 000 metres. The weapon was a program of record in U.S. Special Operations Command by 2015, and the PSRL-1 was to enter production by mid-2016. Airtronic has also developed the more advanced GS-777/PSRL-2 model made of high-strength polymer that reduces weight to 7.77 lb (3.5 kg) and further improves durability and life cycle. The first confirmed sales were made to the Ukrainian military in 2017. Currently the US PSRL-1 rpg is manufactured for export only, or for allies who are used to using Soviet-style weapons.http://www.milmag.pl/news/view?news_id=176 PSRL-1 was adopted by Philippine Army and Peruvian Army.National Guard receives 500 U.S.-made grenade launchers (Photo), UNIAN (17 May 2018) Design The PSRL-1 is compatible with all Soviet RPG-7 rockets. Weight: 6,6 kg Length: 915mm Scope: PSRL 3.5 X 24mm Effective range: 800 m - 1000m Ammunition Other than all types of Soviet RPG-7 rockets, Airtronic developed AirTronic Shoulder-Fired Rocket Ammunition as a modernized RPG-7 rocket type of shoulder-fired ammunition. All ammunition is manufactured in the United States and the Intellectual Property is fully owned by the company. The ammunition is recommended for use in AirTronic rocket launchers such as the PSRL and GS-777 in order to achieve the highest level of performance. The legacy external configuration of the RPG rocket has been maintained such that AirTronic ammunition is backwards compatible with existing RPG-7 type launchers. While the external configuration of the legacy RPG rocket has been maintained, improvements have been made focusing on the fuzing, reliability, robustness, and manufacturing quality per DoD standards. The warhead fuze features a dual safe and arm arrangement for improved handling safety. Also, the rocket motor ignitor fuze has been redesigned to improve motor ignition reliability. Inert training variants are also available which match the ballistics of the live ammunition. This allows for safe training at a reduced cost. Training variants inert warheads are filled with marking compound so that the impact of the round can be observed. There are 3 variants of this ammunition: * SR-H1 is suitable for PSRLs + RPG-7s. It is a 3.82kg 93mm HEAT warhead that is able to penetrate 500m RHA. Its effective range is at 500m, while maximum range can reach up to 800m. The fire rate is between 4 to 6 rpm. * SR-T1 is suitable for PSRLs + RPG-7s. It is a 3.82kg 93mm Inert warhead that can't penetrate armor because its for training only. Its effective range is at 500m, while maximum range can reach up to 800m. The fire rate is between 4 to 6 rpm. * SR-T2 is suitable for PSRLs + RPG-7s. It is a 2.12kg 70mm Inert warhead that can't penetrate armor because its for training only. Its effective range is at 800m, while maximum range can reach up to 1200m. The fire rate is between 4 to 6 rpm. Users In popular culture In the 2012 Marvel movie The Avengers, General Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury used his PSRL-1 to fire a custom warhead at an F-35 fighter jet launching off the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. It was also briefly seen at the hands of a mercenary who is patrolling in Loki's underground hideout. In Activision's 2012 first-person- shooter game Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, the AirTronic RPG-7 is known in game as \\"RPG\\" and seems to be a futuristic version of the Soviet RPG-7.

Inaugurated by the initiative of Abdullah Ahmad in early April 1911, Al-Munir was listed as the first Islamic mass media in Indonesia. The magazine was often associated with Al-Imam magazine published under the direction of Sheikh Tahir Jalaluddin in Singapore during 1906-1909. In addition to Abdullah Ahmad, several religious figures such as Abdul Karim Amrullah, Muhammad Thaib Umar and Sutan Muhammad Salim were recorded in the ranks of the editorial board. Carrying the mission as a medium for Kaum Muda (young people) movement, the magazine played an important role in the second wave of Islamic reform in West Sumatra in the early 20th century. The magazine features some of the rubrics that include articles covering Islamic religious matters, question and answer forums that are generally concerned with Islamic jurisprudence, the development of Islamic intellectual activity in the world, and chronicles usually translated from Islamic magazines in the Middle East. However, due to budget constraints, the magazine stopped its publishing in 1915. Even so, the birth of Al-Munir was soon followed by a similar publication by various Islamic movements throughout the archipelago. History In 1906, Al-Imam magazine began its publishing in Singapore under the direction of Sheikh Tahir Jalaluddin. This magazine had historically been in close connection with Al-Urwatul Wusqa, a magazine published by the prominent Islamic reformists Jamal-al-Din Afghani and Muhammad Abduh in Paris, France. The magazine was widespread in the Malay Peninsula and the island of Sumatra. One of the regions that experienced the strongest influence of the publication was Minangkabau region in West Sumatra. After the publication of Al-Imam stalled in 1909, Abdullah Ahmad, the Minangkabau delegation of Al- Imam, immediately met the leader of the magazine in Singapore. In his visit, Ahmad conveyed his intention to publish a magazine with the same vision and mission of da'wah. Returning from a visit to Singapore, with the support of local merchants, Ahmad began initiating the publication of Al-Munir in Padang. The association of the founders of Al-Munir joined in Sjarikat Ilmu, a council consisted of ulamas, which also became the publishing and managing body of Al- Munir. Its members consist of scholars from the Islamic reform group in Minangkabau or often called Kaum Muda (young people). Although Ahmad was the director, he was not a daily committee, which was served by Marah Muhammad. In the ranks of the editorial board, headed by Sutan Djamaluddin Abubakar, there were a number of prominent Islamic figures including Abdul Karim Amrullah (father of Hamka), Muhammad Thaib Umar, and Sutan Muhammad Salim (father of Agus Salim).Al-Munir. No. 1/1911. Other writers not included in the governing structure include Ibrahim Musa Parabek, Abbas Abdullah, Zainuddin Labay El Yunusy, and Muhammad Jamil Jambek. Issue Al-Munir declared its intent when it was first published in early April 1911. According to Masoed Abidin in Encyclopedia of Minangkabau, the name Al Munir means torch, which in turns connotes the light of enlightenment. The magazine was published every Saturday, at the beginning and the middle of the month in the Islamic calendar. Most editions were 16 pages long, and the inscription used Jawi alphabet, as in the early 20th century some Minang people were still proficient in writing and reading the Arabic-Malay script. However, the spelling used in the magazine followed the spelling standards used in the colonial government schools.Al-Munir. No. 1/1911. To distribute the magazines and collect subscriptions, Al-Munir had 31 agents in various areas spread across Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. The factor caused the widespread distribution of this magazine is considered its utilization of a network of Al-Imam magazine already spread throughout the archipelago. Later the magazine expanded its follower base into Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In terms of its content, Al-Munir had some similarities with Al-Imam. Many of the issues already contained in Al-Imam were re-enacted in Al-Munir. The contents of Al-Munir magazine can be broadly grouped into sections; editorials, mailings, questions and answers, and domestic/foreign news. In addition, there was also a translation section from the Middle Eastern magazines such as Al- Manar and Al-Ahram. The written articles and the answers to the letters of the reader were mostly concerned with the issues of Islamic jurisprudence and aqeedah (Islamic creed). In addition to advocacy on the compatibility of Islam and modern science and rationality, Al-Munir actively called on Muslims to return to pure Islamic teachings by abolishing taqlid (conformity to legal precedence) and opposing the practice of ecumenical bidah (religious innovation), khurafat (superstition) and tariqa (Sufi order). Through Al- Munir, the scholars of Kaum Muda expressed their ijtihad (independent reasoning) to some of the problems previously forbidden by the traditional scholars, such as the legality of taking photographs, or illegality of wearing ties and hats. Termination Al-Munir ceased its publication on January 31, 1915. In the essay included in the final edition, it was stated that \\"Al-Munir cannot be continued, but to the readers and the Islamic community it is advisable to continue to increase their knowledge with diligent reading.\\" The termination of the magazine was due to lack of funds. In the later editions, the magazine had repeatedly published announcements to agents and readers to send their subscriptions. In addition, the scholars who managed the magazine had absolutely no background in business. Publishing at the time was held only for the purpose of da'wah, without being accompanied by business skills and professionalism. Three years after the end of Al-Munir, on the proposal of Abdul Karim Amrullah, the mass organization based in West Sumatra Sumatra Thawalib had published a magazine under the name Al-Munir Al-Manar in Padang Panjang in 1918. The magazine was led by the Muslim scholar Zainuddin Labay El Yunusi, who was among the contributors to Al-Munir. However, the magazine only lasted for six years. The publication of Al-Munir Al-Manar stalled after the death of Zainuddin Labay El Yunusi in 1924. However, Al-Munir Al-Manar is often referred as the continuation of Al-Munir magazine. Similar to Al-Munir, the magazine was published twice a month, at the beginning and middle of the month. Reception Although the circulation of Al-Munir had reached no more than 2,000 copies, the magazine was widely read in a number of areas in Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and Java. In Minangkabau itself, the magazine raised both pro and counter-reactions. After the presence of Al-Munir, soon magazines with the same spirit had appeared in Minangkabau area, such as Al-Akbar based in Adabiyah School. The network of Sumatra Thawalib in various regions published limited issue magazines, such as Al-Bayan in Parabek, Al-Basyir in Sungayang, Al-Ittiqan in Maninjau, and Al-Imam in Padang Japang. Similarly, the conservative clerics, later dubbed as Kaum Tua (old people), published counter magazines, such as Suluh Malayu under the leadership of Khatib Ali, and Al-Mizan under the leadership of Abdul Majid and Hasan Basri. In 1916, Abdullah Ahmad worked with the Chairman of the Islamic Sarekat Tjokroaminoto to establish Al-Islam magazine in Surabaya. The magazine marked the beginning of the acceptance of Islam Nusantara with the use of Latin script. See also *List of theology journals References Bibliography :* Abuddin Nata (2005).

Career Pintar enjoyed sports as a child. A month prior to her 15th birthday, while hiking on a hill near Lubn√≠k, Slovenia, she slipped and fell. Pintar fell unconscious and was evacuated by helicopter. She had damaged several vertebrae and compressed her spine. Pintar lost the use of her legs, and required the use of a wheelchair. She spent five months rehabilitating, during which time she tried table tennis for the first time. She enjoyed it, and following fellow Slovenian Andreja Dolinar's fourth place at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, Pintar decided that she wanted to pursue the sport after she had completed education. Her first tournament was in Bibone, Italy, in 2002, where she took a set off Olympic champion Alena Kanova of Slovakia. After a point was challenged, she lost focus, which she later described as the lowest point of her career. She teamed up with Dolinar and won the doubles competition at the European Championship, qualifying for the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, at the same time. She attended her first Paralympics in Athens, later saying that the toughest match was the semi-final game. Pintar went on to win the individual gold medal, making her well known in her home country. She went on to win a bronze medal at the 2004 World Para Table Tennis Championships in Montreux, Switzerland, and repeated that success at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. Pintar stopped competing in 2014, and announced her formal retirement from table tennis in 2017. In the meanwhile, she had taken up work as a translator.

History Bawana (‡§¨‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ), established in 1168, was previously called Bawani (‡§¨‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡•Ä). It received this name from the Hindi language word \\"bawan\\" (52) since this area was a grouping of 52 villages, 17 in Narela, 17 in Karala, 6 in Palam and 12 directly under Bawana, with 5,200 bighas of agricultural land.Delhi traces its lost rural roots, Times of India, 9 Jan 2011. Revenue department records mention two people connected with its origins, \\"Kala\\" and \\"Thakur\\" who came from Bengal. The Jat people of Taoru, who initially migrated to Mehrauli, settled at Bawana after spending significant time there. In due time they became influential enough to become chaudhary (chief) of the area. In 1860s Bawana became a Zail (revenue unit) with 3 other villages, Bawana, Alipur and Kanjhawala, under its authority when the British introduced the colonial zaildari system of revenue collection in 1860s. Jat chief, who was the Zaildar of Bawana Zail, built the Bawana Fortress in the 1860s as the headquarter of Bawana Zail. Along with Zails of Mehrauli, Dilli, and Najafgarh, Bawana was one of the four Zails within the colonial era Delhi district. Rajesh K.

Additional zails of Badarpur, Badli, Nangloi, Palam Zail and Shahdara Zail might have came up later.Susan Sinclair, 2012, Bibliography of Art and Architecture in the Islamic World (2 vol. set), p85. In the 1930-40s authorities started to use Bawana Zail Fortress as a school. Later it also served as a veterinary hospital for a short time before being used as an orphanage. During the 1996-98 rule of Jat Chief Minister of Delhi Sahib Singh Verma, it was turned into an office of Patwari, hence the zail fortress also came to be known as \\"Bawana Tehsil\\". Eventually this run down building was abandoned. Architecture It is a 200 square yard single story structure of ramparts and parapets built with lakhori bricks and lime mortar. It has a grand arched gateway that opens into an inner courtyard surrounded by corridors. In the courtyard, the extreme corner on the left has two rooms that were used as jail by the Jat zaildar to imprison those zamidars who defaulted on their zamindari land tax. Next to the jail rooms, a small staircase leads to the terrace. The terrace has one bastion on each of its four corners. These bastions served as guard posts. The courtyard had a water well to serve the occupants. Conservation After the Bawana fortress was abandoned around late 1990s or so, large portions of its walls, built from lakhori bricks, were ruined from both the out- and inside. The parapet collapsed. The old water well dried up and its water also turned saline. It saw minor restorations in 2004 and again in 2010 for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, though the earlier 2004 plan to convert it into a monument for the Indian independence freedom fighters did not materialise. In February 2017 major restoration by the State Archeology department of the Government of Delhi eventually commenced, using original construction material of that era, including a concrete preparation with 23 ingredients including lime, surki (trass), jaggery, bael fruit (wood apple) pulp and urad ki daal (paste of vigna mungo pulse).

The museum's webpage asserts that Lake Michigan and the Chicago River were key factors in Chicago's growth toward status as a world-class city, and pays tribute to Congress for granting lake frontage in 1818 to the infant state of Illinois. The museum opened in June 2016. History Chicago's maritime history hit its first peak during the \\"Golden Age\\" of the American steamboat. Prior to and during the Civil War era, small but fast (in comparison with previous technology) palace steamers carried passengers and freight over the Great Lakes to Chicago. Canal boats, meanwhile, paraded up and down the newly-dug Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River and even the Mississippi. Maritime freight traffic enabled Chicago to make a fast recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. According to the Chicago Maritime Museum, Chicago's ship-docking operations in 1872 exceeded that of any other port in the United States. With the growth of diesel-powered truck traffic, Chicago's maritime heritage was at risk in the 20th century. Urban redevelopment efforts, inspired by architect Daniel Burnham and his 1909 Plan of Chicago, bulldozed down many dockside warehouses and working loft buildings. Much of the downtown dock space was redeveloped as Wacker Drive. Advocates call for a second peak of Chicago maritime history in the 21st century, this time oriented toward upper-class housing and waterway-oriented lifestyle experiences. Description The Chicago Maritime Society began its collecting activity in 1982. In 1980s, the Society briefly opened a temporary museum at the North Pier Terminal in Chicago. During its early years, the Maritime Society worked closely with the Lake Michigan diving community (See \\"Affiliated groups\\"). The society continued developing its collection, eventually taking in more than 6,000 items of tangible maritime heritage. In the early 2000s, the Society opened a museum on Chicago's South Side. The Maritime Museum operates adjacent to a former working tributary of the Chicago River, Bubbly Creek. The museum's creekside location has inspired it to take a broad view of Chicago's maritime heritage. Its website states that the facility celebrates not only Chicago's primary lake and river, but also traditionally industrial Lake Calumet and the city's \\"beaches, deep tunnels, and pumping stations.\\" The museum's Bridgeport location pays tribute to a neighborhood that began with Chicago's Irish American canal-digging navvies, a key support group within the city's maritime history. The Chicago Maritime Museum is located at 1200 West 35th Street.

She was awarded a master of arts degree in English language teaching and applied linguistics from the University of Nottingham in 1997. Tan remained with the university to study for a doctor of philosophy degree, lecturing there during this time. She received her doctorate in applied linguistics in 2000. Tan lectured at Assumption University in Bangkok from 2001 and at the University of Central Lancashire (Uclan) from 2004. She was appointed dean of Uclan's School of Languages and International Studies in 2010 and in 2012‚Äì13 was academic lead for the university's Thailand campus project. In October 2013 Tan was appointed rector of Uclan's Cyprus campus, replacing Lee Chatfield upon his retirement. The campus had been opened in the UN Buffer Zone between the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus in October 2012. The campus came in for some criticism as it made losses in its first two years and some alleged that Tan was the only UK academic on the site, a claim denied by Uclan. The location in the buffer zone was criticised by UN leader Ban Ki-moon as a violation of the spirit of the zone. Tan spoke at the opening of the 2014 Cyprus session of the European Youth Parliament. In May 2017 she negotiated an agreement with the British Sovereign Base Areas Police to provide professional development programmes to them. Tan returned to the university's Preston camopus in August 2017 and was appointed director of business development at the Faculty of Culture and the Creative Industries.

After he had finished his studies without a degree he made his debut in 1829 under Karl Friedrich Cerf at the Royal City Theatre. Later he was engaged as a \\"youthful lover\\" at the Municipal Theatre Wroclaw. Personal life When in 1831 the actor Gustav Emil Devrient moved from Hamburg to Dresden , Dahn was appointed successor to the Hamburg City Theatre. In Hamburg, Dahn married on 15 April 1833, the actress Constanze Le Gaye and had with her two sons, Felix (1834‚Äì1912) and Ludwig (1843‚Äì1898) and a daughter. The marriage was quite unhappy and the two divorced in 1850 again. In 1834, Dahn was brought to the Royal Court Theatre in Munich , where he remained engaged until the end of his life. There he married his second wife, the actress and colleague Marie Dahn-Hausmann. Death At the age of 78, Friedrich Dahn died in Munich on 9 December 1889, where he found his final resting place.

He was a full professor at the University at Albany, SUNY from 1982 until his death in 1998, having originally joined the faculty there in 1979. From 1985 to 1988, he was the chair of the Department of Sociology there. He supervised more Ph.D. students than any other faculty member in the University at Albany, SUNY's sociology department. During his career, he also served as chair of the American Sociological Association's Section on Crime, Law, and Deviance. He was named a fellow of the American Society of Criminology in November 1998. In 1999, he was one of four University at Albany, SUNY faculty members to receive the university's Excellence in Research Award.  Fishbein/Ajzen model evaluation  In 1984 Liska stated that the 1975 Fishbein/Azjen model had brought significant order to earlier \\"other variables\\" research on inconsistencies between people's attitude and behavior, but argued that the Fishbein/Ajzen model was not \\"complex enough to organize and coordinate much contemporary research.\\" Liska reviewed research showing deviations from the two defining features of the Fishbein/Ajzen model: the assumptions that the effect of an individual's social environment on his or her behavior is expressed through behavioral intentions, and that the effect of the individual's social environment on these behavioral intentions can be assumed to be solely a function of two intermediaries, individual attitudes and social norms. Liska described and illustrated a set of specific expansions to the Fishbein/Ajzen model, and proposed a much more intricate model which incorporated most of these more specific expansions. Richard A. Davis evaluated Liska's revisions of the Fishbein/Ajzen model using a study where the 1970 educational attainments of a set of high school students were modeled, based on information collected in 1955 when the students were high school sophomores. Davis found partial support for the Fishbein/Ajzen model, since in predicting a sophomore's ultimate educational attainment \\"behavioral intentions maintain their centrality.\\" At the same time, Davis found that the social environment of the high school sophomores \\"maintains a direct unmediated effect on both intentions\\" (bypassing direct influence of the sophomores' individual attitudes and social norms) \\"and behavior\\" (bypassing direct influence of the sophomores' behavioral intentions). Davis concluded that, despite the valuable parsimony of the Fishbein/Ajzen model, \\"Liska's revisions have been supported in large measure.\\" References External links * 1940 births 1998 deaths American sociologists University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni University at Albany, SUNY faculty American criminologists ","title":"Allen Liska"},{"id":"55907699","text":"Papaqucha may refer to: * Papaqucha (Huancavelica), a lake in Peru * Papaqucha (Lima), a lake in Peru ","title":"Papaqucha"},{"id":"55907703","text":"Paralovo may refer to: * Paralovo (Bosilegrad), a village in Serbia * Paralovo (Novi Pazar), a village in Serbia ","title":"Paralovo"},{"id":"55907706","text":"Parinaquta may refer to: * Parinaquta (Carabaya), a lake in Peru * Parinaquta (Chucuito), a lake in Peru ","title":"Parinaquta"},{"id":"55907709","text":"Cris Thomas (also known as Space Rogue) is an American Cyber Security Researcher and White Hat hacker. A founding member and researcher at the high- profile hacker security think tank L0pht Heavy Industries, Thomas was one of seven L0pht members who testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs (1999) on the topic of government and homeland computer security, specifically warning of internet vulnerabilities and claiming that the group could \\"take down the internet within 30 minutes\\". Subsequently, Thomas pursued a career in Cyber Security Research while also embracing a public advocacy role as a cyber security subject-matter expert (SME) and pundit. Granting interviews and contributing articles, Space Rogue's advocacy has served to educate and advise corporations, government, and the Public about security concerns and relative risk in the areas of election integrity, cyber terrorism, technology, the anticipation of new risks associated with society's adoption of the Internet of things, and balancing perspective (risk vs. hype). Personal life Career =Cyber Security= A founding member of the hacker think tank L0pht Heavy Industries, Thomas was the first of L0pht's members to leave following the merger of L0pht with @Stake in 2000, and the last to reveal his true name. Thomas was one of seven L0pht members who testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs (1999). Testifying under his internet handle, Space Rogue, the testimony of Thomas and other L0pht members served to inform the government of current and future internet vulnerabilities to which federal and public channels were susceptible. The testimony marked the first time that persons not under federal witness protection were permitted to testify under assumed names. While at the L0pht Thomas created The Whacked Mac Archives and The Hacker News Network. In addition he released at least one security advisories detailing a flaw in FWB's Hard Disk Toolkit. Thomas continued a career in Cyber Security Research at @Stake, Guardent, Trustwave (Spiderlabs), Tenable, and IBM (X-Force Red). Selected to serve as a panelist during a 2016 Atlantic Council cyber risk discussion series, and a webinar speaker for the National Science Foundation's WATCH series, Thomas has embraced a public advocacy role as a cyber security subject-matter expert (SME) and pundit, granting interviews and contributing articlesArticle examples to educate the public about security concerns and relative risk. Topics include election integrity, cyber terrorism, technology, password security, the anticipation of new risks associated with society's adoption of the Internet of things, and balancing perspective (risk vs. hype). In response to a 2016 United States Government Accountability Office report revealing the nation's nuclear weapons were under the control of computers that relied on outdated 8\\" floppy disks, Thomas argued that the older computers, data storage systems, programming languages, and lack of internet connectivity would make it more difficult for hackers to access the systems, effectively reducing the vulnerability of the weapon control systems to hacking. Following cyber security mega-breaches at Target, Home Depot, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Thomas advocated for proactive implementation of basic security measures as the most effective means to thwart similar mega-threats. Bluntly stating that the gap between knowledge and implementation leaves companies and individuals at unnecessary risk, Thomas‚Äô recommendation focused on simple measures that have been known for one to two decades, but which organizations have not implemented universally. Thomas had identified retail cyber security breaches, including that at FAO Schwarz, as early as 1999. In 2017, at the Defcon hacker conference Thomas assisted with escorting Rep. Will Hurd (R) and Rep. Jim Langevin (D) around the conference area through the various villages. At Defcon 27 in 2019 Thomas appeared on a panel with Rep. Langevin (D-RI), Rep. Lieu (D-CA), and former Rep. Jane Harman entitled \\"Hacking Congress: The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend.\\" During the panel Thomas was quoted as saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to us as a community to engage with those people‚Ä¶to educate them‚Äù, \\"But Congress doesn't work that way; it doesn't work at the 'speed of hack'. If you're going to engage with it, you need to recognize this is an incremental journey‚Äù and ‚Äúit takes 20 years to go from hackers in Congress to Congress at DEF CON‚Äù. =The Whacked Mac Archives= The Whacked Mac Archives logo The Whacked Mac Archives was an FTP download site managed by Thomas with the world's largest collection of Apple Macintosh hacking tools. The total size of all the tools on the site was 20MB. A CD copy of the contents of the FTP site was advertised for sale in 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. =Hacker News Network= Serving as Editor-in-Chief, Thomas founded and managed L0pht's online newsletter and website, known as the Hacker News Network (or simply Hacker News or HNN). Originally created to rapidly share discoveries about computer security, Hacker News also became a forum for users to post security alerts as vulnerabilities were identified. The publication grew, eventually supporting paid advertising and an audience that included technology journalists and companies with an interest in cybersecurity. The website can be seen in several background shots of the video \\"Solar Sunrise: Dawn of a New Threat\\" produced by the National Counterintelligence Center in 1999. Alt URL After L0pht's merger with @Stake in 2000, the Responsible disclosure-focused Hacker News Network was replaced with Security News Network. Hacker News Network, after a decade offline, set for a launch on Jan. 11, 2010, with video reports about security, the last videos were published in 2011. Hacker News Network in 2018 redirects to spacerogue.net =CyberSquirrel1 (CS1)= 180px In 2013, Thomas created the project CyberSquirrel1 as a satirical demonstration of the relative risk of Cyberwarfare attacks on critical infrastructure elements such as the North American electrical grid. Started as a Twitter feed, the CyberSquirrel1 project expanded to include a full website and CyberSquirrel Tracking Map; as the dataset grew, Attrition.org's Brian Martin (alias ‚ÄúJared E. Richo‚Äù a/k/a Jericho) joined the project in 2014. CyberSquirrel1's results disrupted public perception regarding the prevalence of nation-based hacking cyberwarfare attacks, concluding that damage due to cyberwarfare (for example, Stuxnet) was \\"tiny compared to the cyber-threat caused by animals\\". =Election Security= As the 2015-2016 alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections unfolded, public and media interest in hacking and hackers increased. Leading up to the 2016 election, Thomas was interviewed for mainstream media productions, including CNBC's On the Money. After the release of the Joint Analysis Report, Thomas called for expanded detail on Indicators of Compromise in Federal Joint Analysis Reports, indicating that increased transparency and IP address reporting were instrumental for enhancing security. Prior to the 2018 election Thomas continued his advocacy speaking with CBS News and other outlets about securing our elections and the vulnerability of voting machines.

Process mining depends on the availability of accurate and unambiguous event logs, according to established standards. The purpose of this standard is to provide a generally acknowledged (W3C) XML format for the interchange of event data between information systems in many applications domains on the one hand and analysis tools for such data on the other hand. As such, this standard aims to fix the syntax and the semantics of the event data which, for example, is being transferred from the site generating this data to the site analyzing this data. As a result of this standard, if the event data is transferred using the syntax as described by this standard, its semantics will be well understood and clear at both sites.

The agency administers the state's workers' compensation system, conducts workplace inspections, licenses and certifies trade workers, and issues permits for heavy machinery. History The Department of Labor and Industries was created by an act of the state legislature in 1921, overseeing industrial insurance, worker safety, and industrial relations. The new agency superseded the Bureau of Labor, created in 1901 to inspect workplaces, and minor state boards and commissions monitoring worker health, safety, and insurance claims. In 1973, the state legislature passed the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act, which superseded the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and allowed L&I; greater powers to investigate employers and enforce state and federal labor laws. Washington became one of the first states to implement their own labor laws, which received full approval from OSHA in 1976. Structure L&I; had a budget of $715 million during the 2015‚Äì2017 biennium and employed 2,891 people. The department is divided into several divisions, including the Divisions of Occupational Safety and Health, Workers' Compensation, Field and Public Safety, and Fraud Prevention and Labor Standards.

The soldiers also shot dead four relatives and two servants of the household. Sayera Khatun and her husband were rendered homeless until the local Awami League activists built them a temporary shed which was also destroyed by the Pakistan Army after 20 days. They were then sent away to Dhaka where they were put under arrest with their elder son's family. Death and legacy Sayera Khatun died on 31 March 1975 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Sheikh Sayera Khatun Medical College and Hospital in Gopalganj District was named after her. The college was inaugurated by Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, on 1 January 2012. Her death anniversary is observed annually in Bangabandhu Bhaban and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi, Dhaka, by Bangladesh Awami League and members of the Sheikh-Wazed family members.

Early life and influences  Janine Joseph was born in the Philippines, her father at the time, worked for President Corazon Aquino. He held a strong belief that if they stayed then their children would never learn the values of hard work and would inherit the social and economic status that their family had in the Philippines. In 1991, Joseph and her family immigrated to California on tourist visas, where the family had previously visited multiple times before. First settling in Riverside, California, then in Arizona. She spent many years not knowing that she was undocumented, until colleges began to refuse her financial aid because of her status. Nonetheless, it was events like this that influenced her to write poetry. While she was attending a writer's retreat in 2003, while also being enrolled in Riverside Community College, she met laureate Natasha Trethewey, who would later become a future poet. After completing her education at Riverside Community College, she later transferred to UC Riverside, and followed up on graduate programs for writing, in New York and Houston. It was during this time, she began to write more poetry and essays, that were focused on her growing up undocumented in America. She graduated from New York University, and the University of Houston. She taught at Weber State University, and Oklahoma State University.  Bibliography  = Essays = * \\"Language of the Border.\\" VIDA: Women in Literary Arts. VIDA Exclusive. May 2015.

She represents the 41st district, which covers parts of the southern Las Vegas Valley. Biography Jauregui was born in 1983 in Monterey Park, California and raised in nearby Hacienda Heights. She is Latina. Jauregui attended Mt. San Antonio College, then graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She works for Ticor Title of Nevada and previously worked for former U.S. Senator Harry Reid. Jauregui ran for the open seat vacated by the retiring Victoria A. Dooling in 2016. She defeated former Assemblyman Paul Aizley in the Democratic primary and Republican Nick Phillips in the general election. Legislative history Assemblywoman Juaregui's inaugural legislative session began with becoming the primary sponsor of AB291. A proposed bill to repeal state preemption laws concerning firearm ownership in the state of Nevada. The bill has been represented prohibiting certain acts relating to the modification of semiautomatic firearms, including trigger mechanisms and bump stocks. Other language of AB291 pertains to reducing the concentration of alcohol that may be present in the blood or breath of a person while in possession of a firearm. AB291 also pertains to repealing state law protections, and grants the authority to regulate ammunition and firearms laws at county level. AB 291 was scheduled to not complete the time requirement to pass legislative deadlines. AB 291 was granted an exemption, and the preemption repeal was stricken from the bill on May 29, 2019 at the request of Everytown for Gun Safety. The bill added language to accept \\"Red Flag Law\\" in Nevada. A high-risk protection order that has been controversially touted as lacking due process and constitutionality, while support voiced concerns for safety measures. During the Senate Judiciary Meetings, Nevada constituents raised concerns with Sandra Juaregui's controversial acceptance from Everytown for Gun Safety, in the amount of $10,000. Protests have ensued over this bill across the state of Nevada since its introduction. The bill was signed into law by Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak on Friday, June 14, 2019.

It proposes that hormonal changes across the cycle cause women, when they are most likely to get pregnant, to be more attracted to traits in potential short-term male sexual partners that indicate high genetic quality, leading to greater reproductive success. Some of these proposed traits are physical features like symmetry and masculinity, while others are personality traits like dominance and creativity, and others are genetic traits like compatible major histocompatibility complex gene profiles. The theory also proposes that women's behavior may change during the most fertile time in their ovulatory cycle. At high fertility, women may experience increased sexual desire, consume fewer calories, become more physically active, avoid risky situations, avoid male relatives, dress more provocatively, become more competitive with other women, flirt with men more frequently, and experience decreased satisfaction with their current romantic partner. The theory is based on the principles of evolutionary psychology and has been extensively researched by scientists in the fields of psychology, biological anthropology, and evolutionary biology. Related research has shown that both men and other women may be able to subconsciously detect when a woman is in the most fertile phase of her ovulatory cycle. Women in the fertile phase are often rated as being more physically attractive, smelling more attractive, and having higher- pitched voices. Men in relationships tend to become more jealous of other men and protective of their partner when she is at high fertility. Additionally, lap dancers report receiving more tips during the fertile phase of their cycle. As ovulatory shifts are predicted to be caused by changes in sex hormones across the menstrual cycle, they may be affected by the use of hormonal contraceptives. Studies often report that women who use hormonal birth control experience weaker or nonexistent ovulatory shifts in thoughts and behavior. While many studies have demonstrated strong evidence in support of the ovulatory shift hypothesis, some studies have also failed to show significant effects for some predictions of the theory. Two meta-analyses published in 2014 reached opposing conclusions on whether or not the existing evidence was robust enough to support the prediction that women's mate preferences change across the cycle. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that the ovulatory shift hypothesis model that proposes changes in thoughts and behavior within each ovulatory cycle is incorrect, and that changes actually occur between cycles.  Background  = Estrus in humans = Female baboons and many other primates experience sexual swellings that advertise their fertility during estrus. Humans do not display any such obvious physical signals of fertility, but may still experience a subtle estrus-like state. Most female mammals experience reproductive fertility cycles. They typically consist of a long period of low fertility, and a brief period of high fertility just prior to and including ovulation. In humans, this is called the ovulatory cycle, or menstrual cycle. The period of high fertility is also called the fertile window, and is the only time during the cycle when sex can result in conception. Females of most mammalian species display hormonally-induced physical and behavioral signals of their fertility during the fertile window, such as sexual swellings and increased motivation to mate. Some species will not‚Äîor cannot‚Äîengage in sex at all outside of this window. This phase of sexual receptivity and proceptivity, estrus, is often referred to as being \\"in heat\\". Human females, however, engage in sex throughout their ovulatory cycles, and even beyond their reproductive years. Additionally, they do not show obvious physical signals of high fertility. This has led many researchers to conclude that humans lost their estrus through evolution. It has been hypothesized that this could be due to the adaptive benefits of concealed ovulation and extended sexuality. However, research has shown that human females may in fact experience subtle but distinct physiological, behavioral, and cognitive changes during the high- fertility phase of their ovulatory cycle, and that both men and other women can detect signals that indicate high-fertility in a woman, which may indicate that humans have retained an estrus-like state. = Evolution of ovulatory cycle shifts = Estrus evolved to facilitate reproduction and maximize reproductive success, or the success of passing on one's genes by producing offspring that are most likely to survive and reproduce themselves. The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that motivation and desire to mate should increase during the fertile window, and that females should seek and attract the best possible mate at their highest fertility. An ideal mate could have many qualities: resources to care for offspring, the physical ability and social status to protect a mate and offspring, a compatible personality for a long-term pair bond, etc. Evolutionary theory and sexual selection theory suggest that an organism‚Äôs top priority should be to maximize survival and reproductive success. Thus, the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women possess a dual sexuality, where during the fertile window, a woman should prioritize attracting and choosing a mate with the best genetic quality, or ‚Äúgood genes‚Äù, since this is the only time she can become pregnant and pass on heritable genetic qualities to her offspring. However, at low-fertility, a woman should prioritize a mate with \\"good parenting\\" traits, such as willingness and ability to invest in parenting, resources to devote to offspring, and compatibility for a long-term partnership. These differing traits are sometimes referred to as the \\"sexy cad\\" vs. the \\"good dad\\". It has also been hypothesized that high-fertility preferences should be strongest when evaluating a short-term sexual partner, but low-fertility preferences should be strongest when evaluating a long-term relationship partner. A woman can gain the benefits of good genes through only a single sexual encounter, and good dad traits are only relevant for a long-term pair bond. Some researchers have suggested that over evolutionary time, women may have maximized reproductive success by seeking good genes from an extra-pair copulation‚Äîcheating on their partner‚Äîat high fertility, while also maintaining a long-term pair bond with a partner who provides parenting resources for the offspring, sometimes called the dual strategy hypothesis. Of course, an optimal partner is one with both sexy cad and good dad traits, but such a man is statistically unlikely to be common. Thus, natural selection may have designed ancestral women to be opportunistic. If successful, a woman could gain the benefits of both high-quality genetics and high-quality parenting to give her offspring the best chance of survival. However, natural selection would not have favored men who desire to provide for offspring that do not share their genes, so this would have been a risky strategy. = Mechanisms = 342x342px Ovulatory cycle shifts are hypothesized to be regulated by sex hormones, primarily estradiol and progesterone, which become elevated at different times across the cycle. In particular, high levels of estradiol and low levels of progesterone, which peak at high fertility just prior to ovulation, have been shown to be correlated with several mating-related psychological changes. However, some studies have only found correlations with changes in estradiol. It is well-established that estradiol can act in the brain to produce other psychological and behavioral changes, and animal studies tend to show a link between sexual behavior and estrogen concentrations. Other hormones such as testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin have been studied as possible correlates, but most have produced little to no effect.  Changes in cognition and behavior across the ovulatory cycle  Numerous studies have demonstrated ovulatory cycle shifts in women‚Äôs mating-related motivations, preferences, thoughts, and behaviors. The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that these shifts are designed by natural selection as evolutionary adaptations for selecting and attracting specific types of mates with high genetic quality when a woman is most likely to get pregnant. =Sexual desire= Some of the earliest studies on human ovulatory shifts explored whether women engage in more instances of sexual activity during high fertility, as this could indicate a human estrus-like state. While some studies have found increases in frequency of sexual activity at high fertility, larger studies have concluded that there is generally no difference in frequency of sexual activity across the ovulatory cycle, possibly due to the multitude of factors that affect the ability to engage in sex (e.g., access to a partner, partner‚Äôs desire, time for engaging, etc.). Researchers have subsequently explored whether sexual desire, rather than frequency of sexual activity, changes across the ovulatory cycle, as this would not be affected by practical barriers to engaging in sex. Several studies in this area have shown that women‚Äôs sexual desire and masturbation behaviors do increase during the fertile window, although results have been mixed.  Relationship satisfaction  Consistent with the hypothesis that women may seek high quality genes from short-term extra-pair partners at high fertility, several studies have shown that fertile-phase women are more attracted to, flirt more, and initiate sex more often, with men who are not their partner. In fact, women often report that attraction to their current partner does not increase during the fertile window, but both attraction and relationship satisfaction may actually decrease. Studies have found that this effect is particularly strong when women do not perceive their current partner to be highly sexually attractive. Women in relationships also tend to be more assertive and independent during the fertile phase. Additionally, researchers have shown that women at low fertility tend to initiate sex with their primary partner more frequently, especially when they perceive their partner to be less invested in the relationship than they are, consistent with the idea that women seek investment in a long-term relationship when they are not likely to get pregnant.  Flirting  While women in relationships may experience decreased relationship satisfaction and increased flirting with extra-pair partners during high fertility, studies have shown that single women at high fertility also engage in more flirting behavior, and are more receptive to men's advances. Women also flirt selectively with men described as \\"sexy cads\\" who display indicators of good genes, especially when considering them as short-term sexual partners. Although women's attention to attractive men increases at high fertility, their memory for those men is not increased, consistent with the hypothesis that women would only be interested in them as short-term partners and would not need to remember them after ovulation has passed. =Attraction and mate preferences= The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women at high fertility should be most attracted to short-term sexual partners with physical and behavioral features that likely signal genetic fitness, or good genes. Symmetry 252x252px Having symmetrical features may indicate that an individual possesses high-quality genes related to health, and that they developed in a stable environment with little disease or trauma. Studies have found that women rate faces of more symmetrical men as more attractive during high fertility, especially when evaluating them as short-term partners. It has also been demonstrated that women at high fertility are more attracted to the body odors of men with more facial and bodily symmetry. Although many studies and one meta-analysis have shown that fertility-moderated shifts in attraction to facial and bodily symmetry occur robustly, other reviews have concluded that the effect is small or non- existent. Masculinity In many species, more masculine and dominant males experience greater reproductive success. Masculine traits are produced during puberty by increasing amounts of testosterone. Testosterone is a known immunosuppressant, thus traits that reflect high levels of testosterone may indicate that a man possesses high-quality genes which allowed him to develop masculine features without experiencing any deleterious effects of high testosterone levels. Masculine traits include facial features like a strong jawline, bodily features like height, muscularity, and body hair, and vocal features like a deeper voice. While many studies have shown that women tend to be attracted to more masculine characteristics at high fertility, results have been mixed, and two meta-analyses have concluded that the effect is not robust.  Dominance  Many primates prefer to mate with dominant or high-ranking males at high fertility, as these mates could confer genetic, material, and social benefits. Some studies have found that women at high fertility are more attracted to potential short-term male sexual partners with masculine behavioral traits like dominance, aggression, and confidence, and those who are more directly competitive with other men. One study found that fertile-phase women find the scent of dominant men more attractive.  Creativity  Charles Darwin first proposed that music, lacking a functional evolutionary explanation by natural selection, may be an instrument of sexual selection, just like a male peacock's extravagant feathers, which serve to attract a female. Similarly, humans may use artistic expressions as a display of good genetic qualities like creativity and intelligence. To this end, one study has found that women at high fertility preferred short-term partners described as creative artists over those described as wealthy businessmen, despite the fact that a wealthy man would have more resources to care for offspring.  Compatible genes  The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a suite of genes responsible for adaptive immune response and histocompatibility in an organism's cells. In animals, including mammals and other primates, MHC has been shown to play a role in MHC sexual selection, where organisms mate selectively with individuals who possess MHC alleles that are more dissimilar from their own. MHC has been shown to be responsible for changing the pheromone compositions of mice, causing mice with dissimilar MHC genes to have more attractive body odors. It has been hypothesized that this is a mechanism for creating genetic diversity, avoiding inbreeding, and creating offspring that are more resistant to pathogens. Some studies have shown that humans tend to form long-term partnerships with individuals who have more dissimilar MHC, and find the scent of MHC-dissimilar individuals more attractive, especially at high fertility. However, other studies have found little or no effect of MHC on mate preferences, and some have even shown a reverse effect, that people prefer partners with more similar MHC to their own. Several reviews and one meta-analysis on the human and primate literature regarding MHC have concluded that the effects of MHC similarity on attraction are not robust, but that humans are reliably attracted to individuals with more heterozygous, or diverse, MHC genotypes, regardless of whether they are similar to their own. However, it is unclear whether attraction to MHC heterozygosity changes across the ovulatory cycle. = Clothing and grooming = The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women's behavior during the fertile phase should also reflect evolutionary adaptations for reproductive success, primarily through attempting to attract short-term mates of high- genetic quality. One avenue of this research has found that women tend to dress in clothing that is perceived to be more revealing, fashionable, or sexy at high fertility. Fertile-phase women also spend more time on their appearance and tend to wear accessories like jewelry, makeup, or hairstyles that are perceived as trying to look more attractive. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that women tend to purchase more products related to enhancing their appearance, attractive clothing, shoes, or accessories, during the fertile window. = Activity and food consumption = One of the earliest studies on ovulatory shifts found that female lab rats tend to run on their exercise wheels more during their fertile window. Subsequent research showed that a variety of species experience an increase in the frequency of spontaneous activity and motor behavior during estrus. Some studies on humans have shown a similar pattern: women walk more steps, as counted by a pedometer, during the high-fertility phase of their cycle. However, other research has found no difference in locomotion patterns across the ovulatory cycle, and many studies on activity across the cycle have small sample sizes and substantially differing methodologies, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Despite a possible increase in activity, many studies have found that women consume fewer calories during their fertile phase. Some researchers have suggested that these changes in activity and food consumption may indicate that during estrus, women are motivated to focus more of their energy on mating-related behaviors like going out to meet new potential mates, instead of survival-related behaviors like seeking food. = Risk-taking and inbreeding avoidance = Although a majority of research on the ovulatory shift hypothesis indicates that women consistently attempt to seek out and attract men during peak fertility, some studies have shown that high-fertility women strategically avoid two specific types of mating situations: rape and incest. Several studies have shown that women at peak fertility are more likely to avoid risky situations where sexual assault may be more likely to occur. Researchers have argued that natural selection should have designed women to be especially wary of rape during the fertile window, because women would not be able to selectively choose the genetic qualities they would prefer for their offspring, and that a man willing to engage in rape may actually possess some unfavorable genes. Women may also selectively avoid incest, another situation where deleterious genes could be passed on to her offspring. Studies have found that females of other species tend to avoid male kin during the fertile window, and one study showed a similar result in humans: that women avoid speaking to their fathers when they are at peak fertility. = Competitiveness with other women = Parental investment theory posits the idea that natural selection designed each sex to have different mating strategies based on how much investment the sex is required to devote to offspring for their survival. The sex that invests more in offspring should be more intersexually selective, or picky when choosing a sexual partner, because they have more time and resources to lose if they make a poor choice. The other sex should be more intrasexually competitive, or competitive with members of their same sex, in order to access and attract the more selective sex. In humans, as in all mammals, females are the sex that invests more in parenting, simply through the lengthy and taxing process of pregnancy and lactation, whereas males need only to contribute one act of sexual intercourse to pass on their genes. Thus, females are expected to be the more selective sex, and males are expected to be more competitive. However, unlike many species where males do not contribute to parenting at all, humans have highly dependent offspring, and a complex social structure that allows males to make significant and important investments in parenting effort. According to parental investment theory, this indicates that natural selection may have designed women to be somewhat competitive with other women for access to the best mates and potential fathers for their offspring. Some studies have indicated that women engage in more competitive behaviors with other women when they are at high fertility. During the fertile window, women not using hormonal contraceptives self-report increased feelings of intrasexual competitiveness, describe other women as less attractive, and use more dehumanizing terms when talking about women, but not men. Women's choices to purchase more attractive or revealing clothing at high fertility are also increased when they are first shown a photograph of an attractive woman, but not photographs of men or unattractive women, suggesting clothing may not be chosen to attract men, but rather as a competitive display for other women. Additionally, some studies have used economic games to show that women are less likely to share resources or engage in cooperative bargaining with other women during the fertile window. However, some researchers have noted that the reason why women should be more competitive during the fertile window is unclear. The ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that women should be seeking short-term sexual partners at peak fertility, but men can effectively have multiple sexual partners, so competition over one high-quality man should not be necessary. If women were competing for a long-term partner, there is no reason why they should be more competitive during the fertile window than any other time in their cycle.  Detecting ovulatory cycle shifts  In related research, there is evidence that both men and women can subconsciously detect cues to women's fertility that change across the ovulatory cycle. Some researchers have suggested that natural selection designed women to signal their fertility in order to attract a mate. However, other researchers have proposed that women evolved to have concealed ovulation but they still \\"leak\\" subtle cues of their fertility, and men have evolved to detect these cues. = Lap dancer tips = One of the first modern studies to explore whether women have truly concealed ovulation utilized a simple task: have professional lap dancers record the amount of tips they receive for each day of their ovulatory cycle. The study found that women not using hormonal contraceptives earned significantly more money on the days they were most fertile, compared to other days in the cycle. The researchers suggest that women may be more attractive to men during the fertile window, indicating that women do possess an estrus phase and that their ovulation is not completely concealed. = Body odor = During estrus, many species produce pheromones, or body odors that indicate to potential mates that one is in the fertile phase. While no specific human pheromones have been identified, there is evidence that humans may exhibit similar scent changes at high fertility. Body odors of high-fertility women not using hormonal contraceptives are rated more attractive by both men and women. Vaginal odors from high-fertility women are also rated as more attractive than odors from the same women at low-fertility. Additionally, some studies have shown that men exposed to high-fertility body odors of women exhibit increases in testosterone, a feature associated with mating motivation and behavior, although other studies have failed to replicate this effect. = Physical attractiveness = Researchers have found that both men and women rate physical features of women at high fertility more attractive than when they are at low fertility. Facial attractiveness has been shown to increase in fertile phase women. It has been hypothesized that this shift may be due to subtle changes in soft tissue symmetry that increase during high-fertility. = Vocal pitch = Studies have found that fertile phase women speak with a slightly higher vocal pitch. Recordings of women's voices in the fertile phase are rated, by both men and women, as more attractive than recordings by the same women during low fertility. However, these effect sizes are relatively small compared to other cues of ovulation. = Partner jealousy = Several studies have found that men in a relationship tend to be more protective and possessive of their partner when she is at peak fertility, as well as more jealous of any advances their partner might make on other men. One study also demonstrated that after interacting with their partner during the fertile phase, men shown a photograph of an attractive man exhibit increased testosterone, which may be a competitive response.  Effects of hormonal contraception  Since it has been proposed that changes in hormone levels across the ovulatory cycle are the primary mechanisms that causes cycle shifts, some studies have explored the effects of hormonal contraception, like the pill, on both women's cycle shifts and other people's ability to detect cycle shifts. Most studies have reported that hormonal contraceptives weaken or eliminate cycle shifts entirely. It has been proposed that the synthetic hormones present in hormonal contraception that suppress ovulation also suppress the subsequent cognitive and behavioral changes found in naturally- cycling women. Other studies have concluded that changes in synthetic hormones produce cycle shifts similar to effects produced by the real hormonal changes in naturally-cycling women. The precise effects of each hormone on cycle shifts, and the effects of each synthetic hormone present in different types of contraceptive, are not well understood.  Alternative hypotheses  = Within-cycle vs. between-cycle shifts = While the ovulatory shift hypothesis proposes that adaptive changes in mating-related cognition and behavior occur within each ovulatory cycle, some researchers have posited a between-cycle shift theory. Many women experience regular anovulatory cycles, or non-fertile cycles where ovulation does not occur, therefore hormonal changes between ovulatory cycles may be a more reliable indicator of true fertility, as higher levels of estradiol are more likely to produce a fertile ovulatory cycle. Thus, some researchers have proposed that hormonal changes between cycles, primarily in elevated estradiol levels, are responsible for changes in mating- related cognition and behavior. Within-cycle shifts may be simply a byproduct of between-cycle shifts caused by elevated estradiol.  Meta-analyses  One meta-analysis and several reviews of the literature have been conducted on both published and unpublished data that support the claim of the ovulatory shift hypothesis that women experience changes in attraction preferences at high fertility. However, another meta-analysis and subsequent commentary concluded that the effect is not actually significant and may be a result of some studies using imprecise measurements of when women are in the fertile window, as well as publication bias. The authors of the former meta-analysis subsequently published a p-curve analysis, a statistical test which supports the claim that the effects are not a result of publication bias or p-hacking, and concluded that the methodology used by the latter meta-analysis caused the authors to overlook patterns of robust effects in cycle shifts.

He is a pastor in the Assembly of God church and has been the national president of the PSC. He was the PSC's candidate for President of Brazil in the 2014 election, in which he placed fifth, with 0.75 percent of the total votes. Biography Pereira is the son of pastor Heraldo and missionary Dilma and was born in Acari, a poor neighborhood in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro. His parents gave him the same name as his uncle. The family residence was the location of the Assembly of God Madureira Ministry. He has five siblings: Meirelaine, Ivete, Edivaldo, Edmilson and Marcos. Pereira learned to work early. At age six, he was already helping his father sell plant pots at fairs. At ten, he made friends with marketers and started selling bananas, mugs and cups. He also became a bricklayer and an office errand boy. When Pereira was 14, he was approved in a public tender and accepted into the Reinsurance Institute of Brazil (IRB). At 17 years old, he joined the Economy and Finances College of Rio de Janeiro and paid for his studies with the salary received from his work at the Institute. Later, he created his own company. By the 1989 election, he had become an active supporter of presidential candidate Leonel Brizola and a public figure. Pereira's second wife is gospel singer Ester Batista, and he is a father to three children. He was previously married to Maeli de Almeida. Between the two marriages, he was in a relationship with K√°tia Miriam Offredi Maia, who accused him of physical aggression, followed by death threats. K√°tia Miriam claimed she was in a stable union with Pereira. Political career Pereira kept himself in the political background until the electoral success of Anthony Garotinho (PR, former PDT) and Benedita da Silva (PT) when they ran for Governor and Vice-Governor, respectively, of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both politicians were evangelicals. They had the support of former federal deputy bishop Manoel Ferreira (PSC), leader of Pereira's church. From 1999 to 2003, Pereira was selected to be the assistant chief of staff of the state government. He was responsible for the implementation of the first \\"Bolsa Fam√≠lia\\" of Brazil: \\"Cheque-Cidad√£o\\". In 2003, he joined the Social Christian Party as vice-president. After more than a decade, he decided to run for public office for the first time. Critics and controversies Pastor Pereira was considered a \\"public enemy\\" by LGBT activists for being one of the advocates of the campaign \\"Man + Woman = Family\\", which was promoted by the PSC in 2012. He also received criticism from defenders of LGBT rights after declaring in his 2014 bid for the presidency that, if elected, he would propose a law to the National Congress to revert the decision of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) recognizing same-sex marriage in Brazil. The pastor also drew flak from sectors linked to women's rights for opposing abortion rights. During the presidential campaign, Pereira also positioned himself against proposals of drug legalization and assumed the image of a defender of the traditional family, arguing that it is mandated by the Constitution. In 2012, he was convicted and ordered to pay his ex-wife, Katia Maia, an indemnity of R$ 85,000 (US$ 26,350) for material and moral damage. Pastor Everaldo asked the Justice Court of Rio de Janeiro (TJ-RJ) to overturn the decision and was acquitted by the Supreme Federal Court. In 2013, Pereira's ex-wife initiated in the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) a new judicial process, alleging that the pastor committed physical violence, followed by death threats. Katia Maia said that during the aggression there were \\"kicks and punches, that caused a puncture in [her] eardrum\\". Pereira, however, said he acted in legitimate self-defense after a car pursuit in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. On August 2016, Pereira was also accused of threatening a young woman who claimed to have been attacked and sexually harassed by federal deputy Pastor Marco Feliciano, one of the most prominent names of the PSC, the party Pereira presided over. The threat allegedly happened after the woman refused to accept hush money. On January 2017, it was revealed that, during the 2012 municipal elections, Pereira asked for money from former federal deputy and President of the Chamber Eduardo Cunha.

Lynch (March 6, 1882 ‚Äì December 8, 1985) was an American biologist and cancer researcher, who notably pioneered the use of the Swiss laboratory mouse in cancer research.  Background  Clara Lynch was born on March 6, 1882 in Canton, Ohio and passed away on December 8, 1985 in Arlington, Virginia at the age of 103. She never married but did have two nieces named Marcia and Eliza Miller. Lynch was born to her parents William A. Lynch and Eliza R. Underhill. Her father was a prominent attorney during his time. Lynch had two other siblings named Alice Allen Lynch and Frances H. Lynch, both of whom also lived to adulthood.  Education  Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in 1912 Lynch received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Smith College in 1902 and continued on to receive her Doctorate degree from Columbia University in 1919. In 1918, she became a part of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a member of the faculty, which she served for 53 years. This institute is now known as Rockefeller University. Lynch taught anatomy and physiology of mammalian species while at Smith College. While at Columbia University, Lynch worked under the notable Thomas Hunt Morgan.  Contributions  During the early parts of Lynch‚Äôs career, the field of cancer research was growing rapidly, and may scientists were making huge advancements in the understanding of this disease. She joined this field when she began her work as a faculty member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research under James B. Murphy. Lynch was one of the first female scientists to study cancer. In the beginning, she studied mammary tumors in mice noting that some mice formed tumors more rapidly and spontaneously than others. She came to conclude that developing tumors was an inherited trait. Lynch also looked at tumors in the lungs of these mice, also coming to the conclusion that the tendency to accumulate tumors in both the mammary and lung tissue resulted from dominant inherited traits. Lynch's work was often doubted by other scientific experts during this time. Lynch is also given credit for pioneering her so-called albino Swiss mouse, which she used as test subjects for experiments. She actually brought back this albino Swiss mouse in 1926 from Lausanne, Switzerland because it was easily bread in the laboratory. Dr Andre de Coulon (1890-1935), then a founding scientific director of the Centre Anti- Cancereux Romand (CACR) gave her nine (7 females and 2 males) mice from his colony raised there since 1924 (date of the CACR - Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, ISREC inception). Clara famously brought the mice in a shoebox aboard the Orduna Ship (a crossing from Cherbourg in France to New York lasting 13 days, Sept 1st - 13th, 1926). The mice were not proceeded through custom with any permit from the Department of Agriculture. Lynch often bred the mice and distributed them to other laboratories for research. The descendants of this type of mouse are widely used in research today.  Scientific advancements  Example of the mice used by Clara Lynch during her tests of susceptibility on inheriting cancer or other diseases. One well-known research article written by Lynch is entitle \\"The Inheritance of Susceptibility to Yellow Fever Encephalitis in Mice\\", which was received on October 2, 1935. She performed this research on her Swiss mice that she had brought from Lausanne, Switzerland in 1926 to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Technology. In this study she looked at the importance of resistance for individuals related to the likelihood of attaining certain infectious diseases, and in this case specifically Yellow Fever. Some mice were more susceptible to diseases than others, and Lynch wanted to see how genetic factors influenced susceptibility to Yellow Fever Encephalitis. Lynch worked with Thomas P. Hughes, a fellow scientist in the field, and together they discovered that the sex of the mice did not determine susceptibility to Yellow Fever, offspring from two susceptible parents were more likely to be susceptible to Yellow Fever than offspring who only had resistant parent, and that overall there are hereditary factors present in mice that attribute to susceptibility to Yellow Fever.

Cascio and Luthans (2014) applied the principles of PsyCap in their retrospective analysis of prisoners in the notorious South African prison, Robben Island, to argue that PsyCap was the key to enabling the prisoners (such as Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma) to survive, resist, and effectuate change to prison life and their guards.Cascio, W. F., & Luthans, F. (2014). Reflections on the metamorphosis at Robben Island: The role of institutional work and positive psychological capital. Journal of Management Inquiry, 23(1), 51-67. Hope: The construct called \\"hope\\" was developed by Charles R. Snyder and has two components: agency (willpower) and pathways.Snyder, C. R. (2002). Hope theory: Rainbows in the mind. Psychological Inquiry, 13, 249-276.Snyder, C. R., Rand, K. L., & Sigmon, D. R. (2002). Hope theory. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 257-276). Oxford, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. Hope enables the individual to have the agency to set and pursue meaningful goals and facilitates generating multiple pathways to reach those goals in case of obstacles. Hope is the \\"will\\" to succeed and the ability to identify, clarify, and pursue the \\"way\\" to success. Efficacy: The construct called \\"efficacy\\" is defined as the \\"employee's conviction or confidence about his or her abilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources or courses of action needed to successfully execute a specific task within a given context.\\"Stajkovic, A. & Luthans, F. (1998). Social cognitive theory and self-efficacy. Organizational Dynamics, 26, 62-74. Resilience: The construct called \\"resilience\\" is characterized as positive coping and adaptation in the face of risk or adversity.Masten, A. S. (2001). Ordinary magic: Resilience processes in development. American Psychologist, 56, 227-239. It is the \\"positive psychological capacity to rebound, to 'bounce back' from adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure, or even positive change, progress, and increased responsibility\\" (Luthans, 2002, p. 702).Luthans, F. (2002). The need for and meaning of positive organizational behavior. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23, 695-706. Resilient people tend to have a resolute acceptance of reality, a deep belief that life is meaningful, and an ability to improvise and adapt to change.Coutu, D. L. (2002). How resilience works. Harvard Business Review, 80(5), 46-55. Optimism: The construct called \\"optimism\\" is associated with having a positive outcome, outlook, or attribution, including positive emotions and motivations, while maintaining a realistic outlook. Optimism was first explained by Martin Seligman wherevy optimists are defined as those who make internal, stable, and global attributions of positive events and external, unstable, and specific attributions of negative events.Seligman, M. E. P. (1998). Learned optimism. New York: Pocket Books. A second perspective on optimism is whereby optimists are defined as those who expect that a desirable outcome will result from their increased effort, and will continue to put fort effort even in the face of adversity.Carver, C. S., & Scheier, M. S. (2002). Optimism. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 231-243). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.  Psychological Capital Questionnaire Scales  The PCQ consists of four scales with six items each. Higher scores correspond to greater psychological capital abilities. Hope: This six-item scale measures an individual's ability to persevere towards goals and redirect paths to goals in order to succeed. Efficacy: This six-item scale measures an individual's ability to have confidence to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challenging tasks. Resilience: This six-item scale measures an individual's ability to sustain and bounce back when beset by problems and adversity to attain success. Optimism: This six-item scale measures an individual's ability to make a positive attribution and expectation about succeeding now and in the future.  Psychological Capital Questionnaire Forms  Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ): The original and validated form of the PCQ. It can be used as a self-assessment and a multi-rater assessment, meaning that the assessment considers the target individual's self-assessment alongside the assessments from others who rate the target individual's PsyCap. Psychological Capital Questionnaire Short Form (PCQ Short Form): The PCQ Short Form is a 12-item form of the PCQ. It is only usable as a self-assessment.  Psychological Capital Questionnaire Scoring  All PCQ scales are scored using a 6-point Likert scale. Each scale measures its own unique dimension of PsyCap. An overall PsyCap score is calculated by taking the mean of all the items in the PCQ. Scales include reverse-scored items. The 6-point Likert scale for all PCQ scales is as follows: # Strongly Disagree # Disagree # Somewhat Disagree # Somewhat Agree # Agree # Strongly Agree  References  __FORCETOC__ Industrial and organizational psychology Positive psychology Psychological testing ","title":"Psychological Capital Questionnaire"},{"id":"55908178","text":"V≈ôesovice may refer to: * V≈ôesovice (Prostƒõjov District), a village in the Czech Republic * V≈ôesovice (Hodon√≠n District), a village in the Czech Republic ","title":"V≈ôesovice"},{"id":"55908184","text":"Hertha Doreck, n√©e Sieverts (1889 ‚Äì 30 March 1991), was a German paleontologist. Life Hertha Walburger Doris Doreck was born in V√∂lklingen, German Empire, in 1899. She trained as a teacher for schools in Prussia, but became interested in mathematics and the natural sciences. Doreck focused on zoology, paleontology and geology during her time at the University of Berlin and she researched Cretaceous Crinoids for her dissertation under the supervision of Josef Felix Pompeckj that she completed in 1927. Only able to find a series of short-term positions, she was finally hired at the Institute for Applied Geology in Bonn at a very low salary in 1930. Although she mostly worked as a personal assistant, she was able to work with the fossil collection. After five years she got a training opportunity at the National Prussian Geological Institute in Berlin and was hired there in 1936 she as a scientific assistant. This job entailed mapping and field work and was unusual to be performed by a woman at that time. Her public employment ended in 1936 when she married Walter Doreck and entered the housewife and \\"private- research\\" phase of her life. Despite having two daughters, Horeck continued to be active in research and reported her work on Crinoids in the journal Zentralblatt for fourteen years. \\"In the early 1950s, Doreck was invited to Lawrence, Kansas, by R. C.Moore, and publicized as the 'German Crinoid Expert.' She had devised a system of classification for Mesozoic Crinoids that, although never published, was and still is the basis for the systematics of this group. During the last years of her research, Doreck turned to the systematics of the Holothuroideans. During the years she spent as a housewife, she had little time to pursue her research goals. Her husband became seriously ill, and she took care of him until his death in 1972. She died on 30 March 1991.\\"Ogilvie & Harvey, pp. 750‚Äì51 Notes References * 1899 births 1991 deaths German paleontologists ","title":"Hertha Doreck"},{"id":"55908196","text":"Arnett Cobb Is Back is an album by saxophonist Arnett Cobb which was recorded in 1978 and released on the Progressive label.Jazzology: Progressive Records discography, accessed November 28, 2017Arnett Cobb catalog accessed November 28, 2017 The 1994 CD reissue included two additional alternate takes.
