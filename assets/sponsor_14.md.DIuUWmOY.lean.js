Nineteen people were killed and over 100 were injured. Accident On 2 July 2015 at 1200 hours, a Pakistan Army mixed train was derailed near the Chanawan Bridge on the Upper Lower Chanawan Canal near Jamkey Chattha, Gujranwala. The train comprised six passenger carriages and 21 wagons. It was travelling from Pano Akil to . Four of the carriages were derailed. The train was carrying about 300 people, soldiers of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers and their families. One of the derailed carriages ended up in the canal. Authorities took steps to drain the canal in order to assist the rescue operation. At least nineteen people were killed and over 100 were injured. The injured were taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Gujranwara. A Pakistan Railways train had crossed the bridge safely an hour before the accident. Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique stated that the possibility that the cause was a terrorist attack could not be ruled out. A regional police officer stated that the bridge was in poor condition and that no explosive materials had been found at the accident site. Rafique suggested other forms of sabotage may have been used. Bridges in Pakistan are checked four times a year. Conflicting information was given about the state of the bridge, with Rafique stating that it passed an inspection in January 2015 and was found to be \\"faultless\\". It was also reported that the bridge was reported to be in an \\"extremely dangerous\\" condition. It was subsequently reported that the locomotive hauling the train had derailed some before the bridge, which collapsed as a result of the derailed train attempting to cross it. The condition of the track was reported as the cause of the derailment.  Casualties  Among the 19 dead were the Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Amir Jadoon, his wife and two children - a daughter and a son. Subedar Major Islam of the Engineer Battalion also died in the accident. Others include: * Major Adil * Captain Kashif * Lieutenant Muhammad Abbas * Train Driver Chaudary Muhammad Riaz * Subedar Usman * Naik Arif Nasir * Lance Naik Zafar * Sanitary workers Saleem and Usman Investigation The Joint Investigation Team opened an investigation into the accident. Railways Minister Rafique stated that a final report would be produced within 72 hours. It was reported that Pakistan Railway officials had tried to remove evidence from the scene before investigators arrive on site. According to the report, a bogie of one of the carriages derailed before the bridge. The condition of the track and sabotage are possible causes of the crash. On 7 July 2015, Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique while putting the responsibility of the incident on the deceased driver revealed that the train incident occurred due to over-speeding. He also reiterated that Chawan bridge and the railway track was perfectly fine. However, an investigation team found some bolts and fish plates approximately some 400 meters away from the accident spot along with some frictional scratches on the track which contradicts the statement by Rafique.

Attempts to elect a president and vice president, who must represent both the anti- and pro-independence camps in New Caledonia under the Nouméa Accord, were unsuccessful until three ministers from the pro-independence minority agreed to back Germain.

Governor of Kırklareli (Turkish: Kırklareli Valiliği) is the civil service official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Kırklareli. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Kırklareli is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Kırklareli. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Kırklareli provincial police force and the Kırklareli Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Kırklareli is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Kırklareli is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Kırklareli. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Kırklareli, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Kırklareli Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Kırklareli has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

The RTA is intended to increase revenues and budget efficiency for NASCAR Cup Series organizations, as well as to make promotional deals, attract sponsors, market the sports teams and drivers and to present and work with NASCAR in a single voice. It was established on July 7, 2014 and then comprised nine teams. The current chairman of the RTA is Rob Kauffman, co- owner of Chip Ganassi Racing, one of the teams that is part of the RTA. History NASCAR and union-like organizations NASCAR has always in the past had a negative view of and has resisted union like organizations and the formation of them. In 1969, NASCAR stars formed the PDA (Professional Driver Association), led by Richard Petty. Shortly after a boycott of the 1969 Talladega 500 over track conditions the union disbanded. NASCAR pioneers Curtis Turner and Tim Flock were banned from the sport after trying to form a union among the drivers and get the Teamsters to represent them. Formation of the RTA In 2014, the top race teams in the sport created the Race Team Alliance. The organization structured similar to the former FOTA in Formula One. Much like with union-like organizations of the past, NASCAR took a negative view with chairman Brian France calling it the \\"worst thing we could ever do\\". NASCAR, through president Mike Helton, assured the media that there is no animosity between the RTA and the sanctioning body. Actions In May 2018, The Race Team Alliance named Jonathan S. Marshall as its first Executive Director. Now based in Charlotte, North Carolina, Marshall was formerly World Surf League's (WSL) chief operating officer, and was recruited for the role by executive search firm RSR Partners. Marshall’s previous experience also includes spells with USA Today Sports Media Group and Westwood One, the New York-based mass media company. “The RTA has matured to a point where its board and members determined it was time to have a full-time executive who wakes up every day thinking of how to move the collective interests of the RTA member teams forward,” said Robert Kauffman, co-owner of Chip Ganassi Racing and chairman of the RTA. “During the process of finding our new executive director, we were fortunate to have met with a number of highly qualified and talented individuals which made our decision that much more difficult. Ultimately, we selected a candidate who had a range of experience across sports, intellectual property and media rights, operations and sponsorship. I think Jonathan’s diverse background will be a big boost to the organization.” “I’m a race fan, first and foremost”, added Marshall, “and I’ve been impressed by what the RTA has been able to accomplish in its short history. It shows the strength of the teams working together on common goals. “There is no doubt that stock car racing, like all major sports, is evolving and working on new ways to engage their fans in deep and meaningful ways. I am beyond thrilled to have been selected as the RTA’s executive director and am looking forward to working with all of the member teams and other industry stakeholders to advance the sport of stock car auto racing.” Charter system In advance of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, the RTA played an integral role in forming an agreement between NASCAR and the various NASCAR Cup Series competitors on a charter system which would guarantee full-time license holders automatic entrance into every race of the season for nine years. Charters which are transferable were granted to full-time Cup Series teams that had been active in a full-time capacity since at least the 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. There are a total of 36 charters, and a new total starting field in each race of 40 providing four \\"open\\" spots on the weekly race grid. Failure to field a car results in the loss of that charter. This action was driven by the RTA in an effort to increase the value of the current full-time teams. Two charters granted to the since-defunct Michael Waltrip Racing were sold for over a million dollars apiece to Joe Gibbs Racing and Stewart Haas Racing.

It formed the legal basis for the dictatorship of longtime president Mobutu Sese Seko. Defining state power as an extension of Mobutu's power, the 1974 constitution codified Zaire as a one-party state with the Popular Movement of the Revolution as the only legally permitted party. It enshrined the status of Mobutism as the state ideology. The 1974 constitution was the third in the Congo's post-independence history, replacing earlier constitutions adopted to replace the original basic law of 1960, adopted in 1964 and 1967. According to academics Merwin Crawford Young and Thomas Turner, the 1974 constitution should be seen as the culmination of a period of Zairean political history beginning in 1970. The phase was marked by growing national self-confidence and the emergence of Mobutu's Authenticité policy to remove non-\\"authentic\\" foreign influences from Zairean society. Young and Turner describe the 1974 constitution as the \\"normative embodiment of the Mobutist state at its apogee\\" and argued that it was an unprecedented legal expression of \\"centralized, untrammelled personal power\\". Under the provisions of the Constitution, the MPR was recognised as Zaire's only \\"institution\\" and its president as President of Zaire itself with total power over government and judiciary (Articles 28 and 30). Mobutism was declared the state ideology (Article 46) and all Zaireans were automatically made members of the MPR (Article 8). Mobutu himself was exempted from the restrictions on power mentioned in the document and given the power to unilaterally modify the document at will. The state of Zaire's legal system as established by the constitution led Marcel Lihau, a jurist and former president of the Supreme Court of Justice who had fled the country, to remark that \\"Mobutu is the constitution in Zaire\\". Young and Turner did, however, note that the \\"Mobutist state never approximated the leviathan vision embodied in the constitution\\". In particular, after Shaba I and Shaba II invasions (1977–78), Mobutu was forced to liberalize Zaire's political structure to allow contested elections and a degree of political dissent. The 1974 constitution remained in force, with some subsequent modifications, until the collapse of the Mobutu regime during the First Congo War. In 1994, the first of two Transitional Constitutions were adopted; the current Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was adopted in 2006.

It was first published in the United Kingdom through Bloomsbury Circus on 12 March 2015, followed by a United States release on 30 June through St. Martin's Griffin. The work deals with the themes of cyberbullying and peer pressure and is told from the viewpoint of several anonymous narrators as they reflect upon the appearance of a new student that stirs up differing emotions from various people. Synopsis The book's plot predominantly centers upon Carolyn Lessing, a beautiful young teenager that has moved to Adamsville, Alabama and has recently begun attending the local high school. She's initially met with a largely positive reception from the student body, as they're both awed and envious of her, and she soon begins dating Shane, one of the most popular guys at school. However even as they praise her, Carolyn is still an outsider and is more treasured for what she represents (wealth, glamour, talent, fame) than for herself as a person - something that becomes more readily apparent when her relationship with Shane brings about the wrath of one of the school's mean girls. As time progresses her peers begin to bully Carolyn, first slowly and then with more emphasis. Despite these actions taking a very negative toll on Carolyn's physical and mental well-being, the bullying is largely met with apathy because it was so slow to develop and most of the onlookers are inured to what they're seeing and many even believe that she brought this about on herself. Development Bannan drew upon her own childhood experiences for Weightless and was also inspired by a news story about an American teenager that committed suicide as a result of cyberbullying. Bannan chose to set the work in a small town as she felt that they tend to give more weight and consideration to rumors and gossip, and because she felt that this was hypocritical to how small towns are typically portrayed. She also decided that rather than narrate the book from the perspective of one person that it would be better to use the first person plural narrative, as this made the work feel more \\"real, authentic and natural\\". Reception Critical reception has been positive. The Irish Times and the Irish Independent both gave favorable reviews for Weightless, with both outlets citing the book's themes of cyberbullying and peer pressure as highlights. The Argus also enjoyed this aspect, which they felt was \\"immensely effective, providing a bird’s-eye view that forces you to realise that bullying and its consequences are far more complex (and at the same time, so brutally simple) than we might sometimes think, and to see how everybody, somehow, is involved or has their own perception of things.\\" References External links * 2015 American novels American young adult novels 2010s young adult novel stubs Novels set in Alabama Novels about cyberbullying 2015 debut novels ","title":"Weightless (novel)"},{"id":"47142837","text":"Province of Iğdır, showing the provincial districts.

As of the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, the coalition appeared to be defunct. Components of the group later joined the Syrian Democratic Forces throughout 2016. It was superseded by various other groups and military councils within the SDF. Ideology During the founding statement of the Liberation Brigade on 12 September 2014, the group declared that they will be the \\"forces of democracy, chosen by the Syrian people\\" and vowed to defend liberty and preserve the unity of Syrian territory. The group also claimed that it will follow \\"strict military standards\\" in discipline and the selection of commanders. Groups Liwa Ahrar al-Raqqa The Jihad in the Path of God Brigade () is a rebel group that operated in eastern Aleppo Governorate. It was formed as a subunit of Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa in September 2012, but later left the group. It fought the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the eastern Aleppo province. The group acknowledges the Syrian opposition-in-exile government the Syrian National Council and the Supreme Military Council. The Jihad in the Path of God Brigade was a founding member group of the Euphrates Volcano operations room formed in September 2014. The group was later renamed as Liwa Ahrar al- Raqqa (), which then joined the Syrian Democratic Forces in March 2016. Liberation Brigade Abdul Karim Obeid, the commander of the Liberation Brigade, in al-Shaddadi after the offensive in February 2016 The Liberation Brigade (, Liwa al-Tahrir) is a FSA-affiliated rebel group that was formed in the city of Ras al-Ayn, part of the northern Hasakah Governorate, on 12 September 2014. Led by Abdul Karim Obeid, also known as Abu Mohammed Kafr Zita, a former commander of the Farouq Brigades, the group joined the Euphrates Volcano operations room in coordination with the YPG soon after its formation. In mid-2015, the group participated in the Tell Abyad offensive and jointly controlled the border crossing with Akçakale. In early June 2016 the Liberation Brigade's commander, Abdul Karim Obeid, attended and spoke at the funeral of Abu Layla, who was killed during the Manbij offensive, in Kobane. In September 2016 tensions flared up between the YPG and members of the Liberation Brigade due to the perceived marginalization of FSA and Arab components of the Syrian Democratic Forces, while SDF sources suggested Abdul Karim Obeid was displeased with the civil administration of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria replacing warlordist political rule in the Free Syrian Army style. The group also refused to fight the Turkish Armed Forces and its allies during the Jarabulus offensive. In a video message to the United States, the group's commander, Abdul Karim Obeid, called for the SDF to be reformed into a united army under the authority of the United States Central Command and threatened to leave the SDF and withdraw from Tell Abyad if the YPG continued to dominate the coalition. As a response, the YPG imposed a blockade on the villages controlled by the group. Hours later, Abdul Karim Obeid and dozens of his fighters crossed from Tell Abyad into Turkey and defected to the Turkish Army. About 25 to 50 of them arrived in Jarabulus and joined pro-Turkish rebels fighting the SDF. The remaining fighters stayed with the SDF. Since November 2016, the pro-SDF Liberation Brigade faction took part in the Raqqa campaign, including the Battle of Raqqa since June 2017.

It lies near the village of Kaltenbronn in the borough of Gernsbach, a town in the county of Rastatt in the German state of Baden- Württemberg. Its summit is the highest point in the borough of Gernsbach and the eastern chain of the Northern Black Forest, the ridge between the rivers Murg and Enz. A mountain pass runs northeast of the summit plateau between the two river valleys passing over the saddle of Schwarzmiss (). Characteristic of the Hohloh is its flat bunter sandstone kuppe with its observation tower, the Hohloh Tower (Hohlohturm) and a raised bog and bog lakes on the plateau which are protected.  Geography   Location  The Hohloh lies within the Central/North Black Forest Nature Park, mainly on the forest estates of the Gernsbach hamlet of Kaltenbronn, which is situated 2 kilometres east of the summit. On the western edge of the plateau, parts of the mountainside belong to the villages and municipalities of Reichental, Weisenbach, Langenbrand and Gausbach, which lie in the valley of the Murg. Since the municipal reforms in Baden-Württemberg in the 1970s, Kaltenbronn and Reichental have been part of the municipality of Gernsbach, Langenbrand and Gausbach belong to Forbach (all in the county of Rastatt). The forests of Kaltenbronn belong administratively to the western Murg valley, although they are east of the main crest. The boundary between the Eberstein or Old Baden Murg valley (Amt of Gernsbach) and the Old Württemberg Enz valley (Oberamt Wildbad) did not run along the watershed of the Hohloh, but about two or three kilometres east of it. The entire Hohloh region thus lay in Baden.  Natural region grouping  According to the Handbook of the Natural Region Divisions of Germany the Hohloh is part of the major unit group of the Black Forest (no. 15), of the Grinden Black Forest and Enz Heights (Grindenschwarzwald und Enzhöhen) major unit (no. 151), the Enz Heights (Enzhöhen) sub-unit (no. 151.1) and Enzmissen natural region (no. 151.11). Towards the east the countryside descends into the natural region of Enzriedel (151.10), to the southwest into the sub-unit of the Grinden Black Forest (Grindenschwarzwald) (151.0) and natural region of Grinden of the Middle Murg Valley (Grinden des mittleren Murgtals) (151.02) and to the northwest into the major unit of the Northern Riverine Black Forest (Nördlicher Talschwarzwald) (152), sub-unit of the Bühlertal Forest (Bühlertaler Wald) (152.1) and natural region of the Murg Forest (Murgwald) (152.11).  Hills and high points  The Hohloh is . Its flat summit dome or kuppe is the highest point on the eastern mountain chain of the Northern Black Forest, the ridge between the valleys of the Murg and Enz. Its opposite number is the Hornisgrinde, the highest point on the western mountain chain. On many maps, an elevation of is given; this is the height of the nearby site of the Hohloh Tower.  Topography  The summit region of the Hohloh is formed by a broad plateau. In the west the plateau is bounded mainly by steep slopes with a pre-alpine character in the valley of the Murg which, like the plateau, lie on the bunter sandstone platform. Below a height of about 640 metres, this is succeeded by the basement and fertile soils on Forbach Granite, recognisable by a step in the landscape with a spring horizon, the transition from coniferous to mixed beech forest and the onset of grassy valleys. To the east, facing the Enz valley, the relief energy is markedly lower, the mountainsides are gentler, the boundary of the plateau less clear. The Hohloh region is drained, corresponding to the large-scale direction of dip of the bunter sandstone, predominantly into the eastern valleys (the Kegeltal valley, where the mountain pass over the Schwarzmiss runs, and the Rombach valley), long side valleys of the Great Enz. To the north the main chain heads for the Langmartskopf (Langmahd), Teufelsmühle and the Dobel, to the south it transitions to the Breitloh region, followed by the Toter Mann, the Schramberg and the village of Besenfeld.  Nature   Plateau and raised bogs  Great Hohlohsee On the southern part of the plateau is the Hohlohmiss, a misse with raised bogs and several bog ponds, including the Great and Little Hohlohsee. Like the neighbouring Wildseemoor, these are biogenic and not geomorphological landforms. They have developed since the last ice age about 10,000 years ago due to the high rainfall on the acidic klebsands of the upper conglomerate horizon of Middle Bunter. Due to their outstanding ecological importance, the Hohlohmiss and Wildseemoor have been protected as part of the Kaltenbronn Nature Reserve.  Reserves  The Hohlohseemoor south of the Hohloh summit has been a nature reserve since 1940. Since 2000, the Hohlohsee bei Kaltenbronn Nature Reserve together with the Wildseemoor and surrounding bannwald and schonwald have been part of the Kaltenbronn Nature Reserve and Protected Forest which covers an area of 17.5 km². On the mountain there are parts of the protected area of the Middle Murg Valley (Mittleres Murgtal), CDDA No. 323009; 1940; 76.1 km²); the reserves being excluded from it. The nature reserve is part of the fauna-flora habitat region of Kaltenbronner Enzhöhen (FFH-No. 7316-341; 10.4244 km²). In addition there are elements of the Northern Black Forest bird reserve (Vogelschutzgebiet Nordschwarzwald, VSG No. 7415-441; 360.4511 km²) on the mountain. The Kaltenbronn region with the Hohloh was considered for inclusion in the Black Forest National Park, established in 2014,c.f.

Usage   Hohloh Tower and transmitter  Hohloh Tower At the northern end of the summit plateau, at a height of , is the Hohloh Tower (Hohlohturm), officially the Emperor William Tower (Kaiser- Wilhelm-Turm), an observation tower, from which there are often wide views in the Northern Black Forest. It stands about 200 metres north of the summit and on the edge of the steep slope where a better view of the Murg Valley to the northwest may be had. As early as 1853 the Kaltenbronn Forestry Department directed the construction of an observation tower that, as well as having long-distance views into the Murg and Rhine valleys as well as of Württemberg and Hohenzollern in favourable weather, and even of the Bernese Alps, about 250 kilometres away. A few years later a wooden tower with a toposcope was built, which was accessible until 1895. In 1897 the Black Forest Club had a new tower built of bunter sandstone from the local area (work started on 10 May and it was completed on 12 August), which was 22.2 metres high at that time. Due to the height to which the trees had grown, it was raised in 1968 by a further 6.4 metres to the present 28.6 metres. This extra section can be seen from inside the tower: in the area of the old top of the tower the material of the newel changes from sandstone ashlars to Béton brut. The staircase has 158 steps. The observation platform is at a height of roughly 1,012 m. Today the tower is managed by the Gernsbach branch of the Black Forest Club and owned by the state of Baden-Württemberg. On 21 October 2010 a licensing agreement was made between the Black Forest Club and the Forest Commission of Baden-Württemberg, prior to that its use was not regulated legally. The views reach from the Vosges to the southwest, over the Palatine Forest to the northwest, the Odenwald to the north as far as the Jurassic crags of the Swabian Jura. In very good visibility the Feldberg in the Southern Black Forest and several peaks of the Swiss Alps can be made out on the southern horizon; to the north occasionally the Großer Feldberg in the Taunus may be seen. The panorama was improved further in the 1990s as a result of hurricanes Vivian, Wiebke and Lothar which destroyed large areas of trees on the summit plateau. Between the tower and the summit, on the site of a former military radio relay installation is now a civilian transmission mast and transmitter site that enables mobile telephony in the remote highlands.  Transport, hiking and sport  About 930 metres northeast of the summit of the Hohloh and 800 metres northeast of the Hohloh Tower on the northeastern edge of the summit plateau is the Schwarzmiss saddle (), over which the Landesstraße 76b runs between Hilpertsau on the Murg and Sprollenhaus on the Great Enz. Both on the Schwarzmiss as well as below it (for example in the hamlet of Kaltenbronn) are several hikers' car parks. They are starting points for walks, mountain bike tours and loipes. There are public bus services to Schwarzmiss and Kaltenbronn from the Murg and Enz valleys. The Black Forest ridgeways of West Way and Middle Way as well as the E1 European long distance path run via Kaltenbronn and the Hohloh past the Hohlohsee and Hohloh Tower. The Hohlohseemoor is accessible on a board walk. The long distance ski trails on the ridge run north to the Dobel (15 km from Schwarzmiss) and Wildbad- Sommerberg (12.5 km), to the south as far as Besenfeld (16 km). At Kaltenbronn there is a downhill ski slope with drag lifts. The Old Wine Road (Alte Weinstraße), a historical cart track from the lower to upper Murg Valley runs along the ridge of the Hohloh. It bypassed the gorge-like Middle Murg Valley which, until the 18th century, was only accessible on a mule track.

They have released four albums: Delta Grooves (2012), Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles (2013), Modern Sounds of Ancient Juju (2014), and Howl (2017). Both Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles and Modern Sounds of Ancient Juju were released by Arhoolie Records. Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles was the first time Arhoolie had chosen to release a blues album in almost three decades. After Smithsonian Folkways Recordings acquired Arhoolie's catalog in 2016, the label stopped issuing new recordings, and seeking to stretch the boundaries of their sound, the band signed with the Little Village Foundation label in 2017 and released Howl, recorded at Kid Andersen’s Greaseland Studios. The group consists of Joshua Howell on vocals, harmonica, and guitar; Pete Devine on drums and other percussion, and Joe Kyle Jr. on bass. Their music is mainly rooted in the Delta Blues and Hill country blues of Mississippi. Each of their albums feature a mix of original compositions, traditional blues songs, and covers of songs composed or popularized by early blues artists, though not usually those artists’ most familiar work. Among HowellDevine's own compositions are longer, fast tempo numbers, as well as one in which the harmonica and rhythm section evoke steam locomotives that brought the early Southern blues musicians north. The recordings feature Howell on an Epiphone Dot electric guitar, a 1931 National Duolian steel resonator guitar, and acoustic guitar, using fingerpicking and often slide technique. For most live performances he uses the electric guitar exclusively. Howell plays various Hohner Marine Band harmonicas. Devine uses a full drum kit for most live performances (and often a washboard, played with drumsticks), though depending on the venue, he has used a scaled-down percussion set up. Kyle almost always plays an acoustic upright bass, but has used a Kay hollow body electric bass for songs with funk elements. HowellDevine performs regularly throughout Northern California, including twice-monthly appearances at Club DeLuxe in San Francisco, and with growing frequency, at The Freight and Salvage in Berkeley. They occasionally play beyond the region. In 2018, HowellDevine played the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland OR, performing on the Brewery Main Stage as well as the FedEx Crossroads Stage. In 2016, they performed at the Strawberry Music Festival in Tuolumne, CA. In 2015, they performed at two New England events: They were filmed for The Extended Play Sessions at the Fallout Shelter in Norwood, Massachusetts and they played on two days of the 18th Annual Rhythm & Roots Festival in Charlestown, Rhode Island. In 2013, HowellDevine was a finalist among 120 bands in The Blues Foundation's 2013 International Blues Challenge held in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition to headlining their own performances, they have opened for other acts including Johnny Winter, Dr. John, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Charlie Musselwhite, Elvin Bishop, and Maria Muldaur. In 2015, “Elwood Blues” (Dan Aykroyd) featured HowellDevine on his nationally syndicated Bluesmobile radio show, interviewing Howell, with a one-hour focus on the band and their influences. The band played Frank Stoke's \\"It Won’t Be Long Now\\" in the studio, Aykroyd also chose a HowellDevine original \\"Railroad Stomp\\" as his Blues Breaker Pick Of The Week.  History  Howell and Devine met when Howell was booked to open for Devine's band at a show in San Francisco. Two years later, Chris Strachwitz, who founded Arhoolie Records in 1960, discovered HowellDevine playing in that city's Mission District, saying the band reminded him of the music he experienced in Mississippi Delta juke joints. He then signed them to Arhoolie for the two albums that followed, Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles and Modern Sounds of Ancient Juju. Howell took up the blues harmonica at age 14. While still a teenager, he would sit in during blues shows at venues in Oakland, CA that would allow a minor to play, including Eli's Mile High Club and Your Place Too, where he played with Haskell Robert Sadler, also known as Cool Papa. Later he would also play harmonica with Arkansas-born country blues guitarist/singer Robert Lowery in Santa Cruz, CA. Howell's chief harmonica influences are Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Walter, and Sonny Terry. He took up guitar in his later teenage years. Devine has been a percussionist in the Bay Area's vintage jazz, blues, and country scene for decades. Citing Baby Dodds, Zutty Singleton and Francis Clay as major influences, he's appeared on over 32 albums and as part of Bo Grumpus, Lavay Smith's Red Hot Skillet Lickers, the gypsy-jazz combo Gaucho, and his own Devine's Jug Band, among others. Since 2012, the trio has included Kyle on bass, a veteran who's played with Lavay Smith's Red Hot Skillet Lickers and continues to play with The Waybacks, Americano Social Club, and Mal Sharpe's Big Money in Jazz, among others. On Delta Grooves, bass was played by Sam Rocha; Safa Shokrai played bass on two tracks on Jumps, Boogies & Wobbles and joins for occasional live performances. Ralph Carney played tenor saxophone on \\"Harmonica Wobble #2\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" on Delta Grooves. Kid Andersen played the Hammond B3 organ on \\"Sookie Sookie\\" and \\"Funky Miracle\\" on Howl.

It stars Elena Solovey, Rodion Nakhapetov and Aleksandr Kalyagin. The film is about a silent film actress Olga Voznesenskaya (Elena Solovey), whose films are so admired by the revolutionaries that they risk capture to see her on the screen. The character of Olga was inspired by Vera Kholodnaya. Plot The film is set in the Autumn/Fall of 1918, during the Russian Civil War. The silent movie star, Olga Voznesenskaya, has just celebrated a triumph, along with her co-star and lover, Vladimir Maksakov, in the romantic comedy \\"Slave of Love\\". The Bolsheviks have captured Moscow, and the film team moves south, to Odessa, in order to work on a new production away from the fighting. Olga is a difficult star, sometimes overwrought, sometimes deeply wrapped up in her own stardom. Maksakov does not accompany the others to Odessa, which means that filming must be halted. Olga has in any case refused to appear without her partner, and the remaining stocks of unused film have become spoiled. On the set Olga gets to know the camera operator, Viktor Potozki, and soon falls for him. Additionally Fedotov, the local spy chief of the \\"White Guard\\" (an important anti-Bolshevik force in the all too real Civil War of the time), appears on the film set with increasing frequency, while Bolsheviks are being arrested across the land. After a short while, more actors and support personnel turn up from Moscow, bringing with them fresh supplies so that filming can resume. Maksakov is not with them, however, and his role is recast. The taste of audiences for silent movies has moved on, and there is a requirement for exotic embellishments which Voznesenskaya, like her absent partner Maksakov, rejects as artistically counter-productive. But when Voznesenskaya over-reacts and runs off to a cinema, announcing that the film they are making is a lie, she is showered with flowers by her fans, which mollifies her a little. One day the camera operator Viktor Potozki arrives on set late, and apparently drunk. Filming is interrupted by the intervention of the White Russian spy chief Fedotov. Fedotov is searching all the film teams in Odessa to try to find a camera operator who a little time earlier had filmed, secretly, the death by shooting of a revolutionary. Vikor, who in reality is completely sober, admits to Olga that he is the camera operator that Fedotov is looking for. Potozki had used the supposedly spoiled film stock to film White Guard atrocities in order to promote the Bolshevik cause. \\"In Europe they publicise Bolshevik atrocities\\", he says, \\"but they should look at this!\\" The film footage in question is in Potozki's car. Olga successfully rescues it, and is exhilarated by the realisation that she has, by this action, saved Viktor's life. Soon afterwards, at Viktor's invitation, she is given a secret screening of the footage. He shows her shootings of insurgents following denunciations, the hunger of the refugees and the suffering of those left behind. Olga is shattered, and now refuses to continue with her own work on the film-set. A theme of the film is the interface between the apolitical Olga and the film team, and the passionate political commitment represented by the camera operator Potozki. As Potozki's true priorities emerge little by little, two powerful sets of emotions begin to overlap, with Olga's exclamation, \\"My God, what a beautiful thing it is to take part in a cause for which you might die or end up in prison!\\" Olga appears to have fallen in love with Potozki, with whom she meets up in a cafe so that he can hand over the secret film roll for her to keep safely till the evening. However, as they leave the cafe Potozki is shot dead by Fedotov's men. Olga now tries to pass the film roll across to Potozki's fellow Bolshevik partisans, but they appear to know nothing about it. That evening the White Russian spy, Fedotov, again turns up on the film-set, where the production team are trying to get the by now thoroughly apathetic Olga to finish the climactic suicide scene in their movie. Suddenly Potozki's comrades arrive. They shoot Fedotov and his men, and rush off, taking Olga and the film roll with them. They place Olga in a tram and force the driver to take her to her hotel in the city centre. However, during the journey the driver jumps off and alerts the White Guard that there is revolutionary on the tram. The guards leap onto their horses and pursue the tram, from which Olga curses them as \\"beasts\\". The tram and its pursuers disappear into the fog. The final few moments of the film were rewritten for ideological reasons. In the original version Olga, facing her Bolshevik pursuers from the back of the tram, can be seen mouthing to them \\"I'm not with them: I'm on your side\\". It was only at the last minute that this section was reshot, with Olga, no longer inaudible, yelling \\"Beasts!\\" at the horsemen. Cast *Elena Solovey as Olga Nikolayevna Voznesenskaya *Rodion Nakhapetov as Victor Pototsky *Aleksandr Kalyagin as Kalyagin *Oleg Basilashvili as Yuzhakov *Konstantin Grigorev as Fedotov *Yuri Bogatyryov as Maksakov Background and production Vera Kholodnaya, the inspiration for Olga Vera Kholodnaya, sometimes described as Russia's first major movie star was the inspiration for the character of Olga Voznesenskaya. She died in Odessa in 1919 from influenza in her mid twenties. Kholodnaya was rumoured to have worked as a Bolshevik spy towards the end of her life. In 1972 the Soviet director Rustam Khamdamov started to make a biographical film about Kholodnaya, under the title \\"Нечаянные радости\\" (\\"Inadvertent Pleasures\\"); but the production was interrupted and the project was never completed. Some of the costumes created for Khamdamov's film were then used in A Slave of Love. Additionally, Elena Solovey, who stars as Olga in A Slave of Love, had previously been the actress picked for the starring role in Khamdamov's uncompleted movie. Most of the film is produced in conventional full colour. However, the \\"secret film\\" produced by Viktor of White Guard atrocities, included when he screens it for Olga, uses monochrome: these sections are indeed interspliced with contemporary Russian Civil War footage. In addition, scenes from the silent movie featuring Olga sometimes appear in the background in \\"black and white\\". Themes and influence Birgit Beumers, the author of Nikita Mikhalkov: The Filmmaker's Companion, believes that in the film, Mikhalkov offers an idealised view of the revolution, not based on reality, in that he treats revolution and love as synonyms. She writes: \\"the sexual seduction in the old world is replaced by political seduction accomplished by Viktor to bring Olga to the side of the Revolution; Olga's suicide in the film of the old world is substituted by the surrender of her life to the ideal of Bolshevism: she saves Viktor's film, and travels herself towards a new life\\". Aside from issuing a \\"subtle comment on the nature of film\\", with a \\"false, artificial, trite\\" screen reality, for Beumers, Olga is \\"rendered as a type in a melodrama\\", who is unable to see reality, and distracts herself from political reality through cinema. Beumers highlights the way Mikhalkov appears to mock the film crew in the film, with the obesity of director Kalyagin, producer Yuzhakov's concern about the arrival of film stock, scriptwriter Konstantinovich's writer's block, and actress Olga's image fears. Beumers likens one of the scenes to the three frames of the statue of the lion in Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin. Beumers also notes Mikhalkov's effective use of black and white inserts, including the silent film footage itself, and Viktor's documentary footage, which she believes represent history, contrasting it with the present in colour. Nancy Condee notes, that by combining revolutionary message with melodramatic mode of expression, Mikhalkov is able to \\"gesture at a space beyond Marxism-Leninism while at the same time in no sense opposing or negating it\\". Writing about A Slave of Love, Condee re-purposes Christine Gledhill's characterization of melodrama, \\"if realism's relentless search for renewed truth and authentication pushes it towards the future, melodrama's search for something lost, inadmissible, repressed, ties it to an atavistic past\\". Release and reception A Slave of Love premiered in Soviet cinemas on 27 September 1976. In the near abroad, it appeared in cinemas in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) on 21 January 1977. It was first transmitted on East German television on 21 July 1977. Meanwhile, in the German Federal Republic (West Germany) cinema screenings began on 2 July 1987. West German television audiences had their first opportunity to see the movie only on 28 February 1996, long after reunification, when it was screened on the Franco-German Arte channel. In 2005 Icestorm came out with a DVD of A Slave of Love, as part of their \\"Russian Classics\\" series. Critically acclaimed, Mikhalkov won Best Director at the Tehran International Film Festival in 1976. In 1978 the film was voted one of the best foreign films by the National Board of Review, and was voted the 3rd best foreign film of the year at both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and New York Film Critics Circle Awards. The New York Times called it an \\"unexpected masterpiece\\", while Jack Nicholson and director Monte Hellman praised it highly.

Early years Greeves, the son of Edward Goderich and Julia Anderson, was born in Skipton, Victoria on 16 December 1878. He was a noted sportsman at Geelong College, which he joined in 1890, captain of the football team and winner of the College Cup in 1897. VFL career Greeves debuted for Geelong in the 1897 VFL finals series, a round-robin competition between the league's top four ranked sides. Geelong, which had lost their first fixture to Essendon, called up the 18-year-old Geelong College captain for their second game of the series, against Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval. Playing as a backman, Greeves was reported to have done well in his role, with the Geelong side securing a nine-point win to remain in the race for the premiership. He kept his spot in the team for the third and final round of the series, in which Geelong defeated Collingwood at East Melbourne, a win that was only enough to secure the runners-up position for Geelong, as Essendon had remained unbeaten. In the 1898 season, Greeves got his first opportunity in round five against Fitzroy and was described by the Geelong Advertiser as having played a \\"dashing game\\" as a rover, but he wouldn't reappear for two months. He played three games for Geelong late in the season, best on ground in a win over Melbourne, which he played as a centreman. With his Geelong College commitments over, Greeves was a regular in the Geelong team in 1899, his final season. He made a total of 14 appearances, the last a record win over St Kilda, by 162 points to 1. Later life Greeves married Frances Adaline Nasmith on 28 January 1903, at Scots Church, Collins Street, Melbourne. The couple lived in Warragul. Their eldest son, Edward Jr, was born later that year. He won the inaugural Brownlow Medal in 1924. On 11 August 1935, Greeves died in Geelong at the age of 56.

SADF era 8 LLA shoulder title Organisation The first Officer Commanding was Commandant R.D.J. Coetzee and the first RSM WO1 C.S. Feldtmann. Major R.D.J. Coetzee was appointed as the acting Commanding Officer on formation of the unit and was accompanied by 420 members consisting of: * 11 officers (2 majors, 1 captain, 3 lieutenants and 5 second lieutenants) * 40 NCOs (1 WO2, 6 sergeants, 22 bombardiers and 11 lance-bombardiers) * 369 Gunners Renamed 8 LAA was renamed on 27 April 1973 as Regiment Overvaal. Higher HQ Regiment Overvaal fell under the regional jurisdiction of Witwatersrand Command from 1969 to 1974. Divisional Command Regiment Overvaal was assigned to support 8th Armoured Division from 1974 to 1984. Regiment Overvaal then was assigned to Far Northern Command from 1984 to 1987. The regiment was finally returned to 8th Armoured Division from 1987 to 1997.

It is part of the ridge that borders the lower Murg valley on its eastern side. The summit of this mountain is formed by a six-metre-high crag made of bunter sandstone with a flat top, 25 m² in area, from where there are good views.  Name  The origin of the first part of the name, Bern, is the Old High German word, bero, which meant \\"bear\\". Bears lived in the Northern Black Forest until the Late Middle Ages. Stein (\\"rock\\") refers to block of rock that forms the summit.  Natural monument  The Bernsteinfels crag and its surrounding area were declared a natural monument on 5 Nov 2007 by the towns of Gaggenau and Bad Herrenalb due to its rock formations, which are unique in the region, and its geological- tectonic and natural importance, and were given protected area number 82160150001 by the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg.  Geology  Geologically the origins of the Bernstein go back to the Lower Triassic, 240 million years ago. The summit block of this mountain consists of fissured Middle Bunter Sandstone. These mighty sandstone blocks are a consequence of the formation of the Upper Rhine Graben, whose sinking began about 50 million years ago. About 5 million years ago there was a marked uplifting and tilting of the edges of the graben. At that time the Bernstein crag was actually formed. Its present shape is the result of cold periods over the millennia of i.e. ice ages, that were interrupted by warm periods. The hollow spherical formations (Kugelsandstein) on the southwest and northeast faces of the Bernstein rock are the remaines of geodes that were formed here once. They have nothing to do with Gletschermühlen or human influences, as has been repeatedly suggested.  Main rock  The main rock of the Bernstein has a volume of about 200 m³. It is accessible via a stone staircase made in 1864 and has extensive, far- reaching views. In clear weather the views extend far over the lower Murg valley, for example, to Strasbourg Minster, 54 km away, to the Vosges 60–120 km away, and the mountains of the Palatine Forest 45–75 km away. The visible length of the horsing is up to 180 km. On the main rock there is a 3-metre- high stone cross dating to 1877 and, since 1995, a semi-circular toposcope made of steel. This provides information about the direction and distance of those places and mountains that are visible over a radius of 18 km and also several more distant locations such as Karlsruhe and the Hornisgrinde as well as non-visible locations such as the Feldberg and Mont Blanc. It also gives the position of sunset on the visible horizon at the summer and winter solstices as well as at the equinoxes, with dates and times. In addition it gives the length of days (time between sunrise and sunset) in hours and minutes at the start of each season as well as the height of the midday sun (highest point of the sun during its visible trajectory) in degrees, also at the start of the seasons. In entirely other dimensions are given the average distance from the earth to the moon, the sun the orbit of the planet Pluto and the nearest star in km and light years as well as distances to the earth's interior.  Access  Several paths run up to the Bernstein. The two shortest are 3.5 kilometres long and run from Althof and Bernbach respectively (both in the borough of Bad Herrenalb), the longer and steeper routes run from Michelbach and Sulzbach (borough of Gaggenau) and from Gaggenau itself.

Development and premiere  The show premiered at 09:30 pm (IST) on Monday on 27 July 2015 on Zee TV and airs every Monday to Friday, moving the show Qubool Hai to 07:30 pm, fortifying the early primetime band. Talking about introducing a fresh concept on primetime, Zee TV's business head, Mr. Pradeep Hejmadi said,“Even when it comes to genres such as history and mythology, a most fascinating period that remains unexplored by Indian television is the pre-Independence era. This vibrant period of India’s history that saw a great upheaval also saw intense drama unfold in the lives of the royalty of the princely states. Behind empty walls of grandeur and fake displays of splendor was hidden the truth of erosion of wealth, insecurities, succumbing to British dominion, depression and bankruptcy. Ek Tha Raja Ek Thi Rani is a story of love set against this most interesting canvas. It aims to give viewers an up close and personal view of the lifestyles and some of the most closely guarded secrets of the rich and royal of the 1940s. It is a work of fiction that draws inspiration from the lives of the royalty of that period.\\"http://businessofcinema.com/tele/zee-tvs- ek-tha-raja-ek-thi-rani-is-all-set-to-take-viewers-to-the-1940s/219039 Producers Sunjoy and Comall Wadhwa of Sphere Origins further add, “The idea has been to look back at a glorious period of history for inspiration and churn out a timeless masterpiece that will entertain and enthrall TV audiences. The most daunting task at hand has been the re-creation of the pre- Independence era and the majestic lifestyles of the kings and queens of the princely states. Enormous research has gone to ensure authentic representation of the era and to create magic on screen. We have on board an ensemble of extremely impressive actors who beautifully fit the parts they are playing. The show will definitely turn out to be a clutter-breaker and hopefully, the biggest fiction show of the year.” Casting Popular TV Actress, Drashti Dhami was roped in the play the lead as Gayatri. Speaking about her comeback to television post her last show Madhubala – Ek Ishq Ek Junoon, she said “I do feel a little under pressure since ‘Madhubala’ was such a success. But I am also looking forward to seeing my fans’ reaction to my new show. Even my family and friends are very excited,” “It found it difficult to speak in the dialect which people spoke at that time. That was challenging. Other than that, I did not have any issues with the role,” Siddhant Karnick was roped to play the male lead opposite Drashti. The show also had other notable cast including Anita Raj, Moon Banerjee, Priya Tandon and Surekha Sikri who was seen in Balika Vadhu, Ajay Arya. In December 2015, Abhinam Nain entered the show. Later Anjum Fakih entered as the Main Antagonist as Rageshwari. In May 2016, Drashti and Sidhant left the show as the show was gearing up for a leap. After Eisha Singh and Sartaj Gill enterecas the new Rani-Raja. Reception The show began with good ratings and became one of the most watched shows across all GEC's and was one of the top ten serials of 2015. Later due to poor repetitive tracks the TRPs dropped and it was scheduled to go off air. These were the rumours by people that the show will be go to off air. The track of both leading pair Drashti Dhami and Siddhant Karnick will be ending in serial and both decided to quit the show because of the leap is taken.

Appearance  The crystals are short prismatic and pyramidal, with a lead-grey colour that may tarnish to steel-blue or bronze-white. The streak is reddish grey. The crystals are opaque, with a metallic lustre.  Physical properties  Fülöppite is opaque. A petrographic microscope can be used to examine opaque materials under reflected polarised light. Under these conditions the mineral shows moderate anisotropism, changing colour from blue-green to red-brown. The reflectivity of a surface is the percentage of incident light energy that is reflected. It varies with the medium above the surface, such as air or oil, and with the wavelength of the incident light. The reflectivity of fülöppite in air for light of wavelength 540 nm is 31.9% to 40.1%. The mineral is brittle with an uneven fracture. It is soft, with a Moh's hardness of only , and heavy, with specific gravity 5.2. It melts easily in an open tube yielding sulphur fumes and a deposit of Sb2S2. It is not attacked by concentrated hydrochloric acid.  Occurrence  The type locality is the Dealul Crucii Adit, Baia Mare, Maramureș County, Romania, and the type material is kept at the Natural History Museum, London, England, reference 1929,248. It is of hydrothermal origin and associated with zinkenite, semseyite, fizélyite, andorite, freieslebenite, geocronite, boulangerite, jamesonite, cinnabar, sphalerite, marcasite, quartz and dolomite. Fülöppite was first reported in Britain from Wet Swine Gill, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria. It was described as dark grey metallic patches of fibrous crystals accompanying stibnite. Subsequently, rare dark red resinous to submetallic crystals associated with stibnite were identified as being close to fülöppite in composition.Journal of the Russell Society 8(2) 101-102> References Lead minerals Monoclinic minerals Sulfosalt minerals ","title":"Fülöppite"},{"id":"47143468","text":"Adriana Ambesi was an Italian film actress of the 1960s.Weisser p.307 She is sometimes credited as Audrey Amber.

The square, or praça, is an open space surrounded by Portuguese colonial- period buildings such as the Church and Convent of Santa Cruz (São Francisco Church), the Misericórdia Hospital and Church, the Provincial Palace and buildings from later periods. The complex is a well-preserved example of both the Spanish colonial and the Portuguese Franciscan architecture of north- eastern Brazil. São Francisco Square is a stone-paved, open space measuring by . Its configuration reflects both Spanish and Portuguese influence, being organized as a plaza mayor, the typical public space of Spanish colonial cities, following the prescriptions of the Codigo Philippino, a code of laws introduced by the Iberian Union of Spain and Portugal in 1603. The urban design of the city developed along the colonial Portuguese model after the end the union in 1640. The square represents a rare example of the fusion of colonial Spanish and Portuguese city planning. São Francisco Square is ringed by religious, administrative, and residential structures; in time additional religious and residential structures were constructed just beyond the square proper. On August 1, 2010 the site, which covers , was selected as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is managed by a regional office of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) and the municipal government. History São Cristóvão was divided into two distinct zones: the lower city, or cidade baixa, where the port, factories and popular houses were located; upper city, or cidade alta, located on the top of a hill. São Francisco Square developed as the focal point of the upper city, and came to house headquarters of colonial civil, military, and religious institutions. It also offered a strategic military vantage point to monitor the lower city, the land regions around São Cristóvão, and the Atlantic Ocean coast. São Cristóvão was invaded by the Dutch in 1634 as part of the Dutch invasion of Brazil. Luso-Spanish troops, under the command of the Count of Bagnoli, destroyed crops, scattered cattle, and called for the population to desert. The Dutch, who found a semi-deserted city, completed the destruction of both São Cristóvão and structures around the square. In 1645, The Dutch were expelled from Sergipe in 1645 and left the city in ruins. The captaincy of Sergipe was annexed to Bahia at the end of the 17th century and São Cristóvão becomes the regional administrative center, with its administrative buildings centered around the square. The city and plaza were attacked by both inhabitants of Vila Nova, who objected to Portuguese tax collection; and an invasion in 1763 by mocambos, or fugitive Afro-Brazilian slaves, and indigenous peoples. Access São Cristóvão Square is located from the state capital of Aracaju. Most of its historic buildings are open to the public and can be visited.

On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after it had captured Palmyra. The statue was removed to the National Museum of Damascus and underwent reconstruction work, and now stands again.  Description  The statue, of a lion holding a crouching gazelle, was made from limestone ashlars in the early first century A.D. and measured in height, weighing 15 tonnes. The lion was regarded as the consort of Al-lāt. The gazelle symbolized Al-lāt's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under penalty of Al-lāt's retaliation. The lion's left paw had a partially damaged Palmyrene inscription (PAT 1122) which reads: tbrk ʾ[lt] (Al-lāt will bless) mn dy lʾyšd (whoever will not shed) dm ʿl ḥgbʾ (blood in the sanctuary).Van Baaren (1982), p. 65 and Reinhard G. Lehmann: “Kein Blutvergießen!” Die Löweninschrift der ʾAllāt von Palmyra, in: ḤBL Tadmor. Studies in Palmyrene Script and Language. KUSATU 23 (2018), pp. 3-8.  History  The statue before 2005 restoration. The statue was discovered in 1977 by a group of Polish archeologists from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw (PCMA UW) working under Prof. Michał Gawlikowski. The lion of Al-lāt was the basis for the PCMA UW logo design. The statue was found in pieces, having been reused in antiquity for the temple's foundation. Subsequently, it was decided to reassemble the pieces in front of the entrance to the Palmyra Museum. The task was undertaken by restorer Józef Gazy. In 2005, it underwent restoration to eliminate problems from assemblage. Ultimately, the piece was restored in imitation of its original intended appearance – a relief jumping out from a wall. During the Syrian Civil War the statue was shielded with a metal plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting. On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after it had captured Palmyra. After the liberation of Palmyra by the Syrian army, Syria's director- general of antiquities and museums Maamoun Abdulkarim declared that the pieces were still in place and it should be possible to put them back together, giving hopes for reconstruction. The statue was moved to Damascus in 2016, where it underwent complete restoration. On 1 October 2017, it was fully restored, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus, until safety is assured in Palmyra to move it there again.

First transmitted on 9 June 1961, the show was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, and was produced by Duncan Wood. The title is a retronym.  Synopsis  Anthony Hancock has taken up amateur radio as a hobby but is dissatisfied with his conversations with other users, which consist mainly of remote games of chess and Snakes and Ladders, as well as discussions about the weather with a fellow operator in Tokyo who speaks poor English. Just as he is expressing his wish for more excitement in his hobby he hears a distress signal from a man whose boat is sinking. Hancock tries to help but struggles to copy down the man's location details correctly, suffering numerous inconveniences and interruptions such as a broken pencil, having to put another shilling in the electricity meter, having his radio set disconnected by his burly neighbour and, finally, the radio's valves (which he had just replaced at the start of the episode) giving out. Hancock enlists the help of the police to get new valves, but when he gets his radio set working again he cannot re-establish contact with the man in distress. One of the police officers then reads in the newspaper that the man was rescued with the assistance of a radio operator in Tokyo, whom Hancock assumes with dismay to be his interlocutor from earlier. Resuming his usual radio activities Hancock suffers checkmate in his chess game, following which he disconnects all the cables from his radio set whilst singing \\"When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day\\". Pye re-recording In October 1961 Pye Records produced an audio remake of \\"The Radio Ham\\", together with a remake of \\"The Blood Donor\\" from the same series. These were produced in the style of the radio shows, complete with an invited studio audience, and released as an LP in 1961.Pye-Nixa PLP 1092, Pye NPL 18068, Pye Golden Guinea GGL 0270, Marble Arch MAL 872 (all 12\\" mono LPs). These recordings have been available more or less continuously ever since, and are also found on several British comedy compilation sets. The re-recorded Pye version has a different ending from the original, with Hancock instead announcing over the airwaves that he is selling his radio equipment. Paul Merton remake A remake starring Paul Merton in the Hancock role was broadcast on ITV on 9 February 1996 as part of the series Paul Merton in Galton & Simpson's... In popular culture The line \\"Would you stop playing with that radio of yours, I'm trying to get to sleep!\\" from the Pye re-recording has seen common use in royalty-free sample libraries, leading to its use in singles such as George Michael's \\"Too Funky\\".

It is best known for its creamware, which is often called Leedsware;Hartley Greens it was the \\"most important rival\\" in this highly popular ware of Wedgwood, who had invented the improved version used from the 1760s on.Hughes, 45 Many pieces include openwork, made either by piercing solid parts, or \\"basketwork\\", weaving thin strips of clay together. Several other types of ware were produced, mostly earthenware but with some stoneware.Godden, 192; Hughes, 260-262 Openwork \\"basketwork\\" dish, built up by weaving strips, c. 1785 Wares The pottery produced catalogues of goods in 1783, 1785, 1786, 1794, and 1814;Godden, 192; Hughes, 260-262 the pattern is somewhat indicative of the development of the business. There are other documents, and pattern books illustrating decoration, in the Leeds City Art Gallery and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.Godden, 192, 196 By 1790 the company employed 150 people. Leeds wares were lighter than those of most of their competitors, which gave them an advantage in European markets where import tariffs were based on weight.Hughes, 260 But this trade was greatly disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars. The final 1814 catalogue had over 200 general items and 48 patterns of tea, coffee, and chocolate services in a wide variety of plain, ornamented, perforated, and basketwork styles; this same catalogue continued with minor variations until a much later period. At this time, annual sales were about £30,000 per year. Sauce boat, c. 1775, \\"in a faintly Japanese style\\". Although all the standard types of colour decoration were used at times (underglaze painting, overglaze enamels and transfer printing), a high proportion of the earlier wares were not decorated.Godden, 192; Hughes, 262 Other decorative techniques used include \\"engine-turning\\", where the body is covered with coloured slip, which is then selectively removed to create a pattern,Godden, 195 and (in the early 19th century) \\"resist lustre\\" where parts of the piece are covered before a lustreware glaze is applied.Godden, 197 Some black \\"basalt\\" stonewares were produced, mostly teawares and after 1790. Many were \\"engine-turned\\", with geometric decoration cut on a wheel.Godden, 197; Hughes, 262 Some figures, rather in the style of Staffordshire figures by Ralph Wood and others, were made, sold plain or enamelled.Godden, 192-193; Hughes, 262 Marks An impressed mark of \\"Leeds Pottery\\" (or \\"Leeds * Pottery\\") was introduced around 1775, to which \\"Hartley Greens & Co\\" was added from 1800. The earlier wares were unmarked, and attribution of pieces to Leeds is sometimes uncertain (with Liverpool and Swansea being the most likely alternatives). The 18th-century marks are often copied in later \\"reproductions\\" or fakes.Godden, 192; Hughes, 262 Business history Leeds Pottery has had a long and complex business history. It was created in Hunslet by John Green and Joshua Green, unrelated, around 1756, joined by Richard Humble in 1775 to become Humble, Green, and Co. Circa 1783 a businessman named William Hartley joined the firm, and the firm was renamed Hartley Greens & Co.Hartley Greens The company's flint mill at Thorpe Arch was in 1814 replaced by a converted windmill on their Leeds premises. In the early 19th century, however, the company went into a prolonged decline and from 1821 was sold repeatedly, becoming in turn Wainwright & Co., Stephen & James Chappell, Warburton & Britton, and finally Richard Britton & Sons, until it finally closed in 1881. Its buildings were then demolished. However, in 1888 production was restarted by James Wraith Senior, who used the old designs and marked his products Leeds Pottery. This business wound down in 1957. Leeds City Council restarted the brand in 1983, making reproduction pieces, but soon had to sell the business. Production was moved to Stoke-on-Trent, and in 1992 after acquisition by John Croft it was renamed Hartley Greens & Co. In 2011 it was acquired by Denby Pottery, and production moved to Middleport pottery, north of Stoke-on-Trent.Hartley Greens File:Plate LACMA 49.13.7.jpgPlate with the Dutch Maiden in overglaze enamels, c. 1770; hand-painted wares such as this are relatively uncommon.

Lloyd graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1918 as a regular officer in the artillery and subsequently served in a range of staff and regimental positions in the inter-war years. He later saw service in the Second World War, during which he held senior staff and administrative positions in the Middle East, the Netherlands East Indies, Papua and Australia. Later he worked as a newspaper executive, as chief of several United Nations agencies, and in private enterprise. Lloyd died in 1956. Early life Charles Lloyd was born on 2 February 1899 at South Fremantle, Western Australia, the second and only surviving child of Thomas Edward Lloyd, a postmaster, and his wife Edith, née Lock. His parents separated in 1901 and two years later his father committed suicide. He was subsequently raised by his mother, who worked as a telephone attendant at Coolgardie, and then in Fremantle from 1909. Lloyd was educated at Beaconsfield, Fremantle Boys' Central and Perth Modern schools. Military career Entering the Australian Army in 1915, Lloyd graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in December 1918 as a regular officer in the artillery, too late to see action during the First World War. Lloyd was nicknamed \\"Gaffer\\" by the other cadets due to his serious demeanor, and Gavin Long considered him among the \\"ablest\\" of the group of officers that joined the Staff Corps at that time. He was appointed as a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force upon completing his training at Duntroon and embarked from Sydney in January 1919, being sent to the United Kingdom and later posted to France. Returning to the Permanent Military Force as the AIF was demobilised, he later completed his training serving with the British Army in England and India in 1919–20. Lloyd married Sybil Drummond in Melbourne on 31 December 1921. He subsequently held junior staff and regimental postings in Australia during the 1920s, at the same time studying law at the University of Sydney. His next postings included various adjutant and quartermaster roles at battery and brigade level in the 2nd and 3rd Military Districts. Later he attended Staff College, Camberley, in the United Kingdom during 1932–33. Next he was appointed Brigade Major of the 4th Divisional Artillery in Melbourne in 1934, and was promoted to major in 1937. He was posted to the Directorate of Artillery at Army Headquarters in Melbourne from 1938 to 1939. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Lloyd was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for overseas service. He held administrative posts in the 6th Division and I Australian Corps in the Middle East during 1940, but was transferred before the 6th Division went into combat for the first time. In December that year, ranked colonel, he was posted to the 9th Division as the senior operational officer, serving as chief of staff to Major General Sir Leslie Morshead. In March, the 9th Division moved into the Western Desert, where they were to finalise their training and prepare to join the British advance through Libya. The landing of German forces around Tripoli in April forced the British and Commonwealth armies into withdrawal from Benghazi as the Afrika Korps arrived to reinforce the Italians in North Africa. The Axis forces subsequently began to advance west towards the strategic port of Tobruk. During the Siege of Tobruk which followed, Lloyd saw action between April and October 1941, until the Australian units were relieved by British forces. Following the evacuation of the 9th Division from Tobruk by sea, Lloyd then served as chief liaison officer at AIF Headquarters, Middle East. Departing the Middle East in late January 1942, Lloyd was promoted to brigadier and flew to Batavia in the Netherlands East Indies, where elements of the 2nd AIF had been diverted to whilst returning from the Middle East in order to meet the Japanese threat following their initial attacks against British Commonwealth and US forces in the Pacific in December 1941. He subsequently filled a senior staff posting in General Sir Archibald Wavell's ABDA Command during its brief existence, holding the position of Deputy Intendant-General with the temporary rank of major general between January and February 1942. Rising from major to major general in less than two-and-a-half years, he became the youngest general officer in the Australian Army at the age of 42. In this role he acted as Wavell's chief administrative officer; however, he advocated to the Australian high command against British proposals for I Corps to remain in Java, which he believed was unsound and likely result in its loss given the precarious tactical situation there, and that instead it should be returned to Australia to be concentrated for operations against the Japanese elsewhere. Ultimately while a few Australian units were landed in Java, where they were inevitably captured in the fighting that followed, the bulk of the 6th and 7th Divisions were returned to Australia after pressure from the Australian government. Following the Netherlands East Indies campaign, Lloyd returned to Australia in April 1942 and reverted to the rank of brigadier. He was subsequently appointed Director of Staff Duties at Land Headquarters (LHQ) in July. In September he was briefly posted to I Corps in Papua as Brigadier General Staff under Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Rowell. In February 1943, Lloyd was promoted again to major general and appointed Adjutant General at LHQ by the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, remaining in this position until 1946. Blamey had reportedly been \\"dissatisfied\\" with the performance of the previous Adjutant General, Major General Victor Stantke, and appointed Lloyd to rejuvenate the office. Leaving the full-time army, he transferred to the inactive reserve in February 1946. Described by Chester Wilmot as \\"one of the ablest staff officers and most colourful characters of the AIF\\", and by Wavell as \\"a staff officer of great quality\\", during his service Lloyd had been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (1941) and was mentioned in despatches three times (1941–42). Later life In 1946, Lloyd became a senior executive of the Argus & Australasian newspaper, before unsuccessfully seeking Liberal Party pre-selection for a seat in Federal parliament the same year. In 1948, he was appointed as a member of the government committee that reported on the administration of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. His later work included postings as chief of the United Nations Refugee Organisation in Australia and New Zealand (1948–51), and Chief of Mission of the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (1951–53). On return to Australia he took up a position as vice-chairman of Navcot (Aust.) Pty Ltd, a private enterprise which was involved in shipping refugees from Europe as part of the post-war immigration program. Whilst visiting relatives in Western Australia, Lloyd died of jaundice in the Repatriation General Hospital, in Hollywood, Perth, on 31 May 1956 and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, daughter and two sons.

The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Andrea Riseborough, and Emily Alyn Lind. This was producer Richard D. Zanuck's last film; he died before filming began.  Plot  An unknown strange outbreak has devastated the area of the United States. A family of three, Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), Claire (Andrea Riseborough) and their daughter Zoe (Emily Alyn Lind), have taken refuge in an abandoned fallout shelter shortly after the catastrophe to hide from the monsters outside. Zoe wakes one night after having a nightmare of the 'Breathers'. The family has difficulty coping in their cramped environment but manage by having a set of rules, such as always keeping calm and never leaving the shelter. The three soon discover at dinner that their already dwindling rations are also being consumed by a rat and try to find and kill it. The family also discovers that the rat managed to sneak into the shelter through an opening other than the main barricaded hatch. They find a small air duct but Ray reassures Zoe that the Breathers wouldn't be able to fit through the duct. They believe they may be the only ones left alive. The Breathers have been actively hunting down the family, and have nearly located them multiple times. Claire and Ray's priority is to keep Zoe alive, regardless of what happens to them. In a flashback, it is the beginning of the outbreak, 301 days ago. After the start of outbreak, Ray, Claire and Zoe drive along a highway fleeing their town, Kingsville, only to be stopped with many other people by the CDC. Signs all around state that they are under quarantine. Claire kills the rat but in the process, Ray accidentally knocks over one of their lamps, burning a wooden table. Having put out the fire, the family quickly realizes that the smoke produced from the fire is drifting up the air duct, giving away their position to anyone in the area. Later they discover that the smoke has left ash covered all above their shelter hatch, making their hiding place visible. Claire and Ray go to the surface to cover and hide their shelter but Zoe, using a homemade periscope, spots a humanoid figure in the distance. Disregarding her mother's rules, Zoe climbs through the barricade to the surface to warn her parents of the Breather. She manages to warn them and they all go back into the shelter, but are followed. Claire, Ray and Zoe try to keep quiet but Zoe's doll, Olive, gets caught on a nearby pipe screw and activates, making noises. The Breather attempts to break in. Others join and finally break through the hatch and into the shelter. Claire and Zoe manage to escape through the air duct but Ray is caught and disappears, followed by a spatter of blood. Claire and Zoe run and end up on the highway where they were stopped by the CDC. In another flashback, two fighter jets fly overhead and bomb the family's town. They rush to a nearby abandoned shelter as the rest of the town's population is decimated by the military. Claire accidentally cuts herself on a rusty piece of iron as she descends into the shelter and notices the flesh around the cut is discolored and her blood black. They deduce that the virus is airborne and they have already been infected. In the present, on the highway, Claire and Zoe are caught in a net fired from a helicopter. Breathers, actually American soldiers wearing night vision goggles and re-breather packs, surround them with automatic rifles. The soldiers test Claire and Zoe's blood and interrogate them to find out if there are any others in the vicinity. Afterwards, the soldiers prepare to execute them. Ray suddenly appears and kills one of the soldiers. Ray has black arteries and veins and bloodshot eyes. He incapacitates three more soldiers, demonstrating remarkable physical strength and agility, and is shot multiple times before falling. Claire and Zoe escape from their net, and an enraged Claire transforms like Ray, killing all but one soldier, who injures her. Before he is able to kill Claire, a transformed Zoe appears and exposes the soldier to the air by removing his re-breather, infecting him. Zoe, in her enraged state, almost attacks and kills Claire, but Claire reminds her of their rule to always keep calm. Claire and Zoe sit with Ray during his final moments. Claire notices the helicopter coming back and the two flee. The two find a sewer system nearby and hide there. They hear someone approaching, who turns out to be Joe, Zoe's friend and next door neighbor. He has survived and leads them to others just like them within the underground sewers. Before Zoe and Claire join the group of infected survivors, Zoe notes how they managed to survive to day 302 while looking at the sun rising through a nearby window. Claire says \\"Not days,\\" implying that their days are really \\"miracles\\", something Ray called each day at the beginning of the film. Claire looks up into the window before climbing through the sewer hole, revealing her blood shot eyes.

Daniel Kurland calls it \\"a very promising, controlled debut feature from Matt and Ross Duffer.\\" It accomplishes what it sets out to do, and does so \\"in a creative, minimalist manner.\\" Nav Qateel, writing for Influx Magazine, gives the film a grade of \\"B\\", calling it a \\"polished thriller-horror\\" and \\"an accomplished film with a satisfying conclusion.

The leaves are from the talipot tree, a type of palm, and fortunes are written on them and read by fortune tellers. It is believed that three thousand years ago the seven rishis, sages, wrote everyone's fortunes on the leaves. The National Library of Sri Lanka holds an ola-leaf manuscript collection. Sinhala letters are round-shaped and are written from left to right. They are the most circular-shaped script found in the Indic scripts. The evolution of the script to the present shapes may have taken place due to writing on ola leaves. Unlike chiseling on a rock, writing on palm leaves has to be more round-shaped to avoid the stylus ripping the Palm leaf while writing on it. When drawing vertical or horizontal straight lines on Ola leaf, the leaves would have been ripped and this also may have influenced Sinhala not to have a period or full stop. Instead a stylistic stop which was known as ‘Kundaliya’ is used. Period and commas were later introduced into Sinhala script after the introduction of paper due to the influence of Western languages. The Mukkara Hatana, an ola-leaf manuscript now in the British Museum states that King Parakramabahu IV granted it to the Karavas.

Born in Kilmore, County Wexford, O'Neill first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty when he first linked up with the Limerick under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1965 championship. O'Neill immediately became a regular member of the team and won one Leinster medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level O'Neill played with Kilmore-Rathangan. Throughout his career O'Neill made 5 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1967 championship. Playing career Inter-county O'Neill joined the Wexford under-21 team as captain in 1965. A 7-9 to 1-5 trouncing of Dublin gave him his first Leinster medal in that grade. Reigning champions Tipperary were the opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final, however, a 3-7 to 1-4 victory gave O'Neill an All-Ireland medal. Wexford retained their provincial crown in 1966, with O'Neill collecting a second Leinster medal following a 7-10 to 2-8 demolition of Laois. On 2 October 1966 Wexford faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider at Nowlan Park, however, a 3–12 to 5–6 draw was the result. The replay took place two weeks later, however, the sides couldn't be separated once again after a 4–9 apiece draw. At the third time of asking Cork finally triumphed following a huge 9–9 to 5–9 victory. O'Neill made his senior championship debut on 11 July 1965 in a 1-15 to 2-6 Leinster semi-final defeat of Laois.

Her dedication to the needs of girls and their education was one of her top priorities. She established orphanages and provided assistance to the old and the ill. She assumed the name of \\"Teresa Eustochio\\" after she became a Benedictine. She was beatified on 27 October 1946 after the recognition of two miracles attributed to her intercession and a third allowed for her canonization on 10 June 2001. Life Ignazia Verzeri was born in Bergamo in 1801 as the eldest of seven children of Antonio Verzeri and Countess Elena Pedrocca-Grumelli. Her aunt Antonia Grumelli was a Franciscan Poor Clare nun and prophesied that she would enter into religious service: \\"God has destined you for this state to become the mother of holy children\\". Her brother was Girolamo Verzeri who would become the Bishop of Brescia on 30 September 1850. Canon Giuseppe Benaglio, the Vicar General of Bergamo, oversaw her studies; later she studied with the Benedictine nuns of Santa Grata in Bergamo. A devout and intelligent child, Verzeri desired nothing more than to pursue a life of service to God and to discover that her vocation lay in religious life despite originally being apprehensive about what her vocation would entail. On 8 February 1831, with the assistance of Benaglio, she founded the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She aimed for this new congregation to be a group that would focus on the lives of girls, particularly their education. Benaglio died in 1836, leaving her the task of leading the congregation alone. She worked tirelessly to establish orphanages and provided assistance in many ways to the old and to the sick. Verzeri died on 3 March 1852 in Brescia. Legacy Verzeri's congregation continued to flourish after her death and expanded on an international scale to places in Latin America such as Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. It also expanded to Asia in India and to Africa in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. It also expanded in Europe to places such as Albania. Canonization The canonization process opened on 23 August 1883 under Pope Leo XIII who granted her the title of Servant of God. Two processes were held both in Bergamo and in Rome. Pope Pius XI approved her life of heroic virtue and granted her the title of Venerable. Two miracles attributed to her intercession allowed for Pope Pius XII to hold her beatification on 27 October 1946 and a third miracle attributed to her allowed for Pope John Paul II to canonize her on 10 June 2001.Canonization of 5 blesseds References External links *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN 1801 births 1852 deaths Founders of Catholic religious communities 19th-century venerated Christians Canonizations by Pope John Paul II People from the Province of Brescia Italian beatified people Italian educators Benedictines ","title":"Ignazia Verzeri"},{"id":"47144024","text":"George Abrán Gonzales (January 5, 1938 – March 24, 2015) was an American politician, musician, and broadcaster who served as the mayor of Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1968 to 1972.

Guerra dedicated her life to the education of girls and made it the sole focus of her religious life while also making a strong emphasis on devotion to the Holy Spirit. To that end she sent a total of twelve private letters with Pope Leo XIII who held great esteem for Guerra's work to the point he issued three documents on it. Leo XIII renamed Guerra's order further strengthening it though Guerra was forced to resign as the Superior General in August 1906 due to internal friction. Guerra was beatified on 26 April 1959 after the recognition of two miracles attributed to her intercession. Life Elena Guerra was born into a wealthy, aristocratic family in Lucca on 23 June 1835 as one of six children to Antonio Guerra and Faustina Franceschi. In her childhood she was known to be talented but timid in nature. Guerra made her Confirmation on 5 June 1843. Guerra worked with the Vincentians, caring for the poor and the sick. Cholera struck Lucca in 1853 and she tended to the ill after her parents granted her permission to do so. Guerra studied French as well as music and art but also learnt Latin and the lives and works of the Church Fathers during an illness that spanned from 1857 to 1864 as she could not leave the house because of it. In 1866 she established a lay association dedicated to the education of girls, which she decided would be the sole focus of her life. It was called the Order of Saint Zita in honor of the patron saint of Lucca whom she admired. One of her students was Gemma Galgani. Guerra travelled to Rome in 1870 to attend a session of the First Vatican Council that Pope Pius IX had convened. Guerra and her father made an Easter pilgrimage there in April 1870 and visited the tomb of Saint Peter before she was able to meet with the pope on 23 June 1870. In 1885 she wrote Pope Leo XIII and asked him to rekindle in the faithful devotion to the Holy Spirit. Leo XIII responded with an apostolic letter (Provida matris caritate). Encouraged, Guerra wrote thirteen letters to Leo between 1895 and 1903. Leo issued the encyclical Divinum illud munus (subtitled \\"On the Holy Spirit\\") in 1897, in which he established the Novena to the Holy Spirit to be said between Ascension Thursday and Pentecost.Pope Leo XIII. Divinum illud munus, May 9, 1897, §13, Libreria Editrice Vaticana He followed this in 1902, with a letter to the bishops, Ad fovendum in Christiano populo.Lumini, Antonella. \\"Apostle of the Holy Spirit\\", L'Ossservatore Romano, November 2, 2016 Leo XIII granted her a private audience on 18 October 1897 in which he encouraged her work and renamed the order. It was at some stage that she corresponded with Arnold Janssen regarding a \\"militia of the Holy Spirit\\" that would be dedicated to working against the Freemasons. In August 1906 the Archbishop of Lucca told her that he would not permit her prospective religious from vesting or taking their vows unless she resigned as the order's Superior General. Guerra resigned her position after reflection more so in light of internal friction with some nuns questioning the manner in which she was leading the congregation. Her order received papal approval from Pope Pius X on 6 March 1911. John Bosco once referred to Guerra as a \\"golden pen\\" in reference to her spiritual writings. Tomb of Blessed Elena Guerra in the church of Sant'Agostino in Lucca. Guerra died on 11 April 1914 (on Holy Saturday) and is buried in Lucca at the church of Sant'Agostino. Her order continues its work with houses in nations such as Iran and the Philippines amongst others; in 2008 there were 232 members of her order in 36 houses across the globe. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Lucca on 5 May 1936 under Pope Pius XI. With the commencement of the cause she was granted the posthumous title of Servant of God. Two local processes were held on a diocesan level and were both ratified on 13 April 1945 after documents were sent to the Congregation for Rites; her spiritual writings received theological approval on 21 May 1935. An antepreparatory committee approved the documents pertaining to the cause on 26 June 1951 as did a preparatory one on 20 January 1953 and a general committee on 21 April 1953. Pope Pius XII approved her life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable on 26 June 1953. Two investigations into two alleged miracles were held and were both validated and ratified on 16 October 1953. The miracle was soon approved (after passing several boards) and allowed for Pope John XXIII to celebrate her beatification on 26 April 1959 in Saint Peter's Basilica. 5000 of her own congregation attended the beatification celebration. The apostolic letter Renovanis faciem terrae' was the document that authorized the beatification, signed by Cardinal Secretary of State Cardinal Domenico Tardini. The current postulator overseeing this cause is the Cistercian priest Ugo Gianluigi Tagni.

It was driven between 1837 and 1839 on the Leipzig–Dresden railway by Freiberg miners and opened out in 1933/1934. Today only an obelisk commemorates this milestone in German railway history.  History  Although the Leipzig–Dresden railway ran over the fairly flat terrain of northern Saxony, the northern slopes of the Dresden Basin meant that a tunnel was required because at that time it was believed that trains on major railways could not climb significant slopes. Similarly, the Berlin-Dresden railway, which was built half a century later, partly running parallel with it, has its steepest gradients in this area. More than 500 miners sunk four 20 m-deep shafts to the level of the tunnel floor. The tunnel was driven from the bottom of these shafts and from the tunnel portals. Two of the shafts were later used for the ventilation of the tunnel. The tunnel was completely lined with 8,900 m³ of Elbe Sandstone to reduce the water inflow. With the opening of the Leipzig–Dresden railway on 7 April 1839, Oberau station, which was situated high above the cutting leading to the tunnel, was the closest station to Meissen. Because of this unfavourable situation, Meissen sought a more convenient station and in 1842 Niederau station was opened on the line about 2.5 kilometres south of the tunnel. With the opening of Niederau station, the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company closed Oberau station on 15 May 1842. From 1933 to 1934, Oberau Tunnel was converted into a cutting because of its restricted structure gauge and the severe damage caused by water and frost during its operation. In the area of the former tunnel, state road 177 between Radeburg and Meissen now crosses the line on a bridge. A monument to the tunnel was built out of the original material of the portal crown; it reused the Saxon coat of arms, which was once at the centre of the portal. The Dresden coat of arms was placed on the left and is now located on a memorial stone next to the road bridge.

The daughter of painter George de Forest Brush, she produced a biography of him in 1970, and her own memoirs published posthumously. She was married firstly to the artist William Robert Pearmain, and later to Dr. Harold Bowditch. She became involved in costume work for plays but sought spiritual concerns and found the Baháʼí Faith in 1926, going on Baháʼí pilgrimage and serving in the arts inside and outside the religion's community She was active in the Baháʼí Faith community of Greater Boston, elected as Chair of the Boston Spiritual Assembly and later to the first local assembly of Peterborough, New Hampshire. Early years Nancy Douglas Bowditch, was born Nancy Brush in Paris on July 4, 1890, daughter of painter George de Forest Brush, and Mary \\"Mittie\\" Taylor (Whelpley) Brush, a sculptor and inventor. In Dublin the family was neighbors and close friends with Samuel Clemens and his daughter Jean Clemens, who died about 1909, and then the Clemens moved away. Nancy met William Robert Pearmain in America in 1906 and he followed her in 1907 to Europe. They married in 1909, she betrothed as \\"Nancy Douglas\\", and he a student of her father's. They had a daughter born May 1911. The Brush family interacted with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the Baháʼís in the area in July and August 1912, especially during an annual out-of-doors play as well he visited their farm. Pearmain died unexpectedly in September. Nancy moved from place to place until she married Harvard graduate Dr. Harold Bowditch in October 1916. Spiritual search Bowditch became more involved with costume work for theatre productions. While her life was going well she also felt \\"something was wanting in my existence and couldn't put a finger on ... I then began to seek for that missing link, going to most every church and attending various meetings. ... (and) hearing of a meeting to be held in Boston about the Baháʼí Faith.\\" > I'll never forget entering the large hall and seeing around me such a > different type of gathering from the usual Boston crowd. Here were both rich > and poor, along with every race. Many were black. I listened to a wonderful > talk on the Faith by Mr. Harry Randall and was so thrilled! Afterwards I > made my way straight to the table where books were being sold in order to > learn more about the subject. I picked out as many as could be comfortably > carried home on the streetcar, then found to my dismay that I didn't have > enough money with which to pay for them! The person at the book stand told > me it was all right to take them home and pay at the next meeting. This may have been an event the Boston Baháʼí community hosted called a \\"World Unity Conference\\" in 1926 as part of a series sponsored by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of the United States and covered in the Boston Evening Transcript. Randall helped organize and spoke at it. The first day long meeting was held at Steinert Hall, the second at the Second Unitarian Church, and third at the Church of the Redemption where Randall chaired the day. She then credits Randall, Louise Drake Wright and her sister Mrs. George Nelson as aiding her inquiry into the religion while she read books like Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era. She officially joined the religion in 1929. She was visible in the 1930 Race Amity Convention held at Green Acre,by then an established conference center of the religion, and left on Baháʼí pilgrimage in late March 1931 with her then 19 yr old daughter. They spent three weeks in the area of Haifa and left by way of Jerusalem taking in Christian paths of pilgrimage. She then attended the 1931 national convention of the Baháʼís in the United States reporting on events in Boston as the Chair of the Boston Assembly. She wrote of her pilgrimage in Star of the West in July 1931.and spoke of it in August. Arts and services Bowditch would continue working with the religion with occasional gaps in public mention. Bowditch repeated her activity at the Green Acre Race Amity conference in 1934including an event at her home. In 1936 she assisted in World Order magazine publications with some cover art.In 1937 she offered a talk for the summer program at Green Acre that also dedicated a new hall. In 1938 she took up residence in a summer studio at Green Acre and ran a program on art for the school. In 1939 she was on a national radio committee for the religion. There is a break in visible activity in 1940 and her father died April 24, 1941, but she was again involved at Green Acre in July 1941 for a pageant. After another year gap in activity she was on the centenary committee of 1943-44, to commemorate the founding of the religion in 1844. In Portsmouth she offered a program at the Baháʼí library about her pilgrimage,as well as at Green Acre. She was on the maintenance committee for Green Acre across 1945–1947.In Teaneck, New Jersey she offered a program for youth on dramatizations of the religion, and her poem \\"The Song of Tahirih\\" was published in July 1947 World Order . In 1948 she was listed as the corresponding secretary of the Baháʼí group of Brookline, Massachusetts, and offered a program in nearby Hamilton, Massachusetts. Her mother died in 1949. In 1950 she published a play The Desert Tent: An Easter Play in Three Episodes. In 1953 Bowditch was noted helping a Portsmouth community pageant,and her family moved to Peterborough, New Hampshire in the south of the state in 1959, attended the 1963 Baháʼí World Congress with her husband and a granddaughter, and in 1965 Bowditch is pictured on the first local Spiritual Assembly of Brookline, the local administrative organization of the religion. Retirement years Harold died in August 1964 and their home at 12 Pine Street became the official Baháʼí Center of the community in 1967 at which Guy Murchie gave a talk for the opening ceremony.

First transmitted on 11 March 1960, the show was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, and was produced by Duncan Wood.  Synopsis  Anthony Hancock has taken up reading and claims to be familiar with the works of Bertrand Russell, although in reality his preferred reading matter is crime fiction. He borrows a book from the library, the murder mystery Lady, Don't Fall Backwards by Darcy Sarto, and back at 23 Railway Cuttings proceeds to provide Sid with a running commentary on the plot whilst reading it. Sid is impatient to know the identity of the killer, but Hancock assures him this is always revealed on the last page. However, when Hancock reaches the end he finds the last page has been torn out. Hancock is initially dismayed but then insists that it should be possible for Sid and himself to work out the identity of the killer using the clues provided by the author - however their attempts at deduction prove fruitless. Returning the book to the library - and angrily denying the librarian's suggestion that Hancock himself is the vandal - Hancock finds out the address of the last reader to borrow the book several years previously, a Mr Procter, hoping that he will know the answer. However it transpires that the page was already missing from the book when Procter read it, and Procter becomes agitated on being reminded of the unsolved mystery. Still undeterred, Hancock visits the author's house, only to find a plaque stating that Darcy Sarto has died. Finally he visits the British Museum, reasoning that they must have a copy since every book published in the United Kingdom is stored there. At the Museum a copy of Lady, Don't Fall Backwards is found with all of its pages intact - however, the last page contains not the end of the story but instead a note stating that Sarto died before completing it, and that the unfinished book had been published anyway as being of interest to Sarto's fans. Disgusted, Hancock declares he will never read a book again and will instead take up a new hobby - the gramophone. Back at home later, Hancock has purchased his audio equipment and Sid returns from having purchased some records, but Hancock is unamused by Sid's choice of music - Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. Decca re-recording In 1965 Decca Records produced an audio remake of \\"The Missing Page\\", together with a remake of \\"The Reunion Party\\" from the same series. These were produced in the style of the radio shows, complete with an invited studio audience, and released as an LP in 1965.

The resulting work was called the Bronx Zoo Triptych.Tutko, Nancy. Artwork Asks, ‘Is It Painting or Photo?’ The New York Times. Sunday, March 8, 1987. p.CN33. Print. In 1995 Lindroth collaborated with Open Society Fund and Pen Pals for Peace to create Polaroid 20x24 photographs for a book of children's 'etters from Sarjevo entitled Dear Unknown Friend. The exhibition, Dear Unknown Friend, Children's Letters from Sarajevo, consisting of Polaroid 20x24 photographs of the letters, toured the Balkans in 1996 and 1997 and returned to the State Museum of Pennsylvania in 1999. In 1988 Jonathan Edwards College of Yale University commissioned Lindroth to photograph six former, current and future masters of the college with the Polaroid 20x24 camera. The six were Beekman Cox Cannon, H. Catherine Skinner, Frederic Lawrence Holmes, E. J. Boell, Bernard Lytton and Gary Lee Haller. The photographs hang in the Junior Common Room.

Linda Lindroth with her work in her studio; photo used with permission of Graham Hebel  Trickster in Flatland  In 2011 Lindroth began her Trickster in Flatland series, exploring the subject of American commerce during the early part of the twentieth century by photographing the tattered remains of small boxes that contained products once invented and manufactured in the United States. These artifacts, chosen for their design elements and materiality, offer up evidence of the level of skill and anonymity of their makers. The work is strongly influenced by constructivist and abstract expressionist painters of the first 50 years of the century. Lindroth lives and works in New Haven, Connecticut, and has been an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut since 1998.

RACE also offers other training and certification in race riding, the care of horses and racehorse training, including riding courses for international students. The Irish School of Farriery run by the Irish Farriery Authority is located in a purpose-built building on the RACE campus, and several other organisations involved in the equine sector are also located here. History RACE was founded in 1973, as a social project to offer new entrants to the racing profession support as apprentices. Over the next forty years it expanded into providing education and training for jockeys, stable staff, racehorse breeders, racehorse trainers and other people involved in the thoroughbred industry. It is located in Curragh House, formerly the home of William Hall-Walker, an important figure in thoroughbred racehorse breeding. The campus has extensive landscaped grounds and is located near the Curragh Racecourse and many training establishments. RACE is a not- for-profit educational establishment and registered charity and is supported by the racing industry and various state agencies. Students from over thirty countries have been trained here, and many have moved on to make considerable contributions to the global racing sector. The chairman is trainer John Oxx.

It was built about 1815, and is a 1 1/2-story, heavy timber frame cottage. The layout of the house is a one-room core and an engaged porch with a rear shed room and features a broken-slope roof. The architecture of the home is classified as a \\"coastal cottage\\" in North Carolina regional architecture. Few examples of this style of home have survived, but similar one-room core historic homes include Purefoy-Chappell House and the Cullen and Elizabeth Jones House. It is the oldest homestead available for public viewing in the region. The homestead is part of the estate of Daniel Davenport, the first representative to the North Carolina Senate from Washington County. (It is noted that Davenport was a slave owner, although his descendants were not.). The house itself is presumed to have been built by his daughter, Asenath Davenport. The house is located on a 1.02-acre plot. The larger homestead includes several features such as three historic outbuildings (a smoke house, corn crib, and loom house) which were relocated to their current locations and an additional five structures which were constructed later in the home's history but are in their original locations. (chicken coop, well house, outhouse, and two sheds) The property was never outfitted with plumbing or heat, nor wired for electricity even though it was an occupied home until 1975. On the property are the graves of the building's last three occupants. (Susan Ann and Armistead Davenport, and their daughter Harriet Ann Davenport) The house was gifted to the Historical Society of Washington County in 1995 on the condition the property be renovated. The society's restoration of the property included extensive roof and chimney repair, as well as repairs to the siding and internal features. In 1999 the homestead was opened as a museum, furnished with both replica and original items depicting the life of homesteaders during the late 1790s. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, though the outbuildings are not included in the designation.

At the university level, she took courses in music science at both the University of Cologne and the Free University of Berlin. Rütgers joined the Städtische Oper Berlin as a contralto from 1957 to 1959, specializing also in oratorio performances, and then worked with the Hamburg State Opera and at the Opera house of Essen until 1963. Between 1963 and 1965 she performed at the Salzburg Festival, the part of Die Vertraute (Her confidante) in a production of Elektra by Richard Strauss, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, alongside Astrid Varnay in the title role, and Martha Mödl, Hildegard Hillebrecht, James King and Eberhard Waechter in leading parts. The production of Mozart's Die Zauberflöte at the Salzburg Festival, with Rütgers as the Third Boy, was filmed and released as a made-for- television-movie in 1964. She appeared alongside Walter Kreppel as Sarastro, Roberta Peters as the Queen of the Night, Pilar Lorengar and Waldemar Kmentt as Pamina and Tamino, and Renate Holm and Walter Berry as Papagena and Papageno, in the production staged by Otto Schenk and conducted by Istvan Kertesz. In 1965, Rütgers toured North America and performed works by Handel and Bach. She recorded the first version of Bach's Magnificat with Helmuth Rilling in 1967. In the 1970s, she no longer accepted long engagements but selected individual appearances.

As the carbon dioxide filled their lungs, they began to sweat, move vehemently and wear themselves out; the viewers could sense their agony through the projected sound of breathing, which was augmented via microphones attached to their chests. It took them 19 minutes in the first performance and 15 in the second to consume all the oxygen in that one breath and reach the verge of passing out.http://interartive.org/2012/01/abramovic-breath-voice- void/ During the 19 minutes of the Performance at the Studenski Kulturni Centar in Belgrade, one hears the noise of their breathing in and out. Ulay commented on the Performance: \\"I breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.\\" Abramović: \\"I breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out carbon dioxide,\\" and Ulay repeated Marina’s sentence. The second part of the Performance took place in November of the same year at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

History The Nicolett Hotel was constructed by Frank E. Wheelock at North Town in 1889, some three miles northeast of what became the new town of Lubbock, Texas. Less than a year later, it was moved intact on rollers to the corner of Broadway Street and Avenue H to be inside the new county seat, located north of Yellow House Canyon and east of the current Interstate 27. Wheelock named the Nicolett Hotel after the Nicollet Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had once stayed and which was demolished in 1923. The Nicolett was operated by a real estate agent, George Maddon Hunt (1843–1919), who came to Lubbock from Sterling, Kansas, and became Wheelock's father-in-law. About 1940, the hotel was moved to the northeastern part of Lubbock for use as a community center before its demolition a few years later. The hotel had 18 rooms; the top floor was a lighted and ventilated attic. It had a restaurant known for low-priced good cooking. The hotel register, in the possession of the Southwest Collection at Texas Tech University, shows that area pioneers, businessmen, and cowboys from the IOA Ranch stayed at the Nicolett. So did the leaders from the two rival villages. W. D. Crump and H. M. Bandy, established Lubbock or \\"North Lubbock\\", and W. E. Rayner, who had earlier founded the town of Rayner in Stonewall County, built South Lubbock, also known as Monterey. Both aspired to be the county seat. These men subsequently met at the Nicolett to merge their efforts to establish what became Lubbock.Paul H. Carlson, \\"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8–9, 11. The original site of Rayner's settlement was north of the present Texas Tech campus. Historian Paul H. Carlson, professor emeritus at Texas Tech, identified some of the Nicolett guests as H. H. Campbell, one of the founders of the Matador Ranch in Motley County to the east of Lubbock, and among the founders of Lubbock, Rayner, Crump, Bandy, Rollie Burns, and George Wolffarth.Carlson, \\"The Nicolett Hotel\\", pp., 13–15. Carlson writes that: > From the beginning in early 1889, the Nicolett stood as something of a > sentinel on the prairie, luring cowboys, farmers, townspeople, traveling > salesmen, and others to Lubbock. The Lubbock village in which it stood and > the hotel encouraged two groups, the Crump-Bandy camp and later the Rayner > party, to establish towns that might become the Lubbock County seat. It was > the site of merger talks that began as early as June 1890, a date even > before Whit Rayner or W. D. Crump and H. M. Bandy had established their > towns, and ended on December 17 with a mutually beneficial > agreement.\\"Carlson, \\"The Nicolett Hotel\\", p. 17. Early in its existence, the Nicolett was the temporary place of worship of what became the large Broadway Church of Christ in Lubbock. Many of the worshippers had been brought to Lubbock by H. M. Bandy, a pastor who came from the settlement of Thorp Spring in Hood County in Central Texas. Besides building the Nicolett, Frank Wheelock went on to become one of the first county commissioners and the first mayor of Lubbock. He introduced to Lubbock County the first cotton gin, self-binding harvest machine, and Hereford cattle. He was the first postmaster of Lubbock and president of the Lubbock Cemetery Association.

Career Stevenson started her career as an actress. Her credits include The Office, Days That Shook the World, People Just Do Nothing and Roisin Conaty's GameFace. She has appeared on TV shows like Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Drunk History, The Apprentice: You're Fired!, Mock the Week, Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled, John Bishop's Only Joking and The Wright Stuff. Stevenson has been doing stand-up comedy since 2006, which was also the year she first performed at the Edinburgh Fringe. Her solo debut was in Along Came A Spider (2009). Her subsequent Edinburgh shows were Dictators (2010), Cavewoman (2011), Uncomfortably Numb (2012), Optimist (2014), Mad Man (2015), Seven (2016), and Bombshell (2017). Bombshell was listed among the \\"Best- Reviewed Edinburgh Shows 2017\\". Her 2019 Edinburgh show is titled Mother and Stevenson is planning to take it on tour in the UK and in the US after this year's festival. She has been hosting the weekly comedy live show Old Rope in London where comedians showcase new material since 2009. In 2011, Stevenson finished third on the ITV reality show Show Me the Funny. Among her fellow contestants were Ellie Taylor, Prince Abdi, Alfie Moore and Stuart Goldsmith. The final show had her perform live at the Hammersmith Apollo with Patrick Monahan and Dan Mitchell. Stevenson sings and plays the guitar. She sang with Craig Robinson at The Improv in Los Angeles in 2019 when he spontaneously asked her to join him on stage to do her \\"Stevie Nicks turns into Cartman\\" version of \\"Dreams\\".

Her father is originally from Prestwick in Scotland but moved to England as a teenager. Her grandmother is from St. Andrews. Her partner Paul is also Scottish and frequently features in her stand-up shows as \\"Scottish Boyfriend Explains A Hing\\". She has a sister. Stevenson describes her parents' marriage as \\"a mixed-class relationship\\" because her father is from a wealthy Scottish- Presbyterian family and her mother is from a working-class Welsh-Kale Romani family. Her father managed Wembley Stadium in the 1980s. When she was a young child she met stars like Annie Lennox and Freddie Mercury through her father's work at Wembley. Stevenson describes herself as \\"not really impressed by anyone\\" which she credits partly to meeting such stars frequently when she was very young and partly to becoming \\"jaded and cynical\\" when she saw many of her father's former friends disappearing from their lives after he had lost his job at Wembley. Very early on in her career, a manager told her to change her last name from \\"Stevenson-Oake\\" to just \\"Stevenson\\" because the double- barelled name made her sound \\"posh\\" while she was not posh.

Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, 576 U.S. 787 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case where the Court upheld the right of Arizona voters to remove the authority to draw election districts from the Arizona State Legislature and vest it in an independent redistricting commission.  Background  The Arizona Constitution (Art. IV, pt. 1, §1) lets voters adopt laws and constitutional amendments by ballot initiative. Arizona voters adopted Proposition 106 in 2000 to address the problem of gerrymandering by creating the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC). The Arizona Legislature sued in 2012, arguing that the creation of the AIRC violated the Elections Clause of the U. S. Constitution, which says “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.” The United States District Court for the District of Arizona, dividing two to one, rejected the Legislature's complaint, finding that prior Supreme Court decisions “demonstrate that the word ‘Legislature’ in the Elections Clause refers to the legislative process used in [a] state, determined by that state's own constitution and laws,” and that the lawmaking power in Arizona “plainly includes the power to enact laws through initiative”.  Opinion  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The Court affirmed the District Court's ruling, holding that \\"[r]edistricting is a legislative function to be performed in accordance with the State’s prescriptions for lawmaking, which may include the referendum, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 567, and the Governor’s veto, Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 369. While exercise of the initiative was not at issue in this Court’s prior decisions, there is no constitutional barrier to a State’s empowerment of its people by embracing that form of lawmaking.\\" The court also noted that in 1911, Congress amended section 2a(c) of Title Two of the United States Code, which provided for federal redistricting if states fail to act. Recognizing \\"that States had supplemented the representative legislature mode of lawmaking with a direct lawmaking role for the people,\\" Congress \\"replaced the reference to redistricting by the state 'legislature' with a reference to redistricting of a State 'in the manner provided by the laws thereof.'\\". In support of its holding, the court cited passages from the Arizona Constitution which read \\"[a]ny law which may be enacted by the Legislature under this Constitution may be enacted by the people under the Initiative\\"(A.Z. Const. Art. XXII, §14). The majority also reviewed several dictionaries from the approximate time of the framing of the US Constitution. Instead of a narrow definition of \\"legislature\\" meaning a state's senators and representatives these dictionaries defined \\"legislature\\" broadly, as \\"the power that makes laws\\". Dissents Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Scalia and Thomas each wrote additional dissents which the other joined. Roberts concluded that the term “the Legislature” in the Elections Clause unambiguously refers to a representative body as \\"confirmed by other provisions of the Constitution that use the same term in the same way. When seeking to discern the meaning of a word in the Constitution, there is no better dictionary than the rest of the Constitution itself.\\" Justice Scalia explained at length why he would not have granted standing in this case, then added \\"[n]ormally, having arrived at that conclusion, I would express no opinion on the merits unless my vote was necessary to enable the Court to produce a judgment. In the present case, however, the majority’s resolution of the merits question ('legislature' means 'the people') is so outrageously wrong, so utterly devoid of textual or historic support, so flatly in contradiction of prior Supreme Court cases, so obviously the willful product of hostility to districting by state legislatures, that I cannot avoid adding my vote to the devastating dissent of the Chief Justice.\\" Justice Thomas contrasted the court's support for direct democracy in this case with the overturning of many state voter referenda opposing same sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges,. decided days earlier.  Impact  The case has formed the basis of action by the Supreme Court in at least one other case, Hickenlooper v. Kerr.John Hickenlooper, Governor of Colorado v. Andy Kerr, et al., no. 14-460, October 22, 2014 ([ docket]). Hickenlooper was a petition for certiorari brought by John Hickenlooper in his capacity as governor of Colorado, as part of a long-running litigation over the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. On June 30, 2015, the Court issued a grant, vacate, remand order in the case, in which it granted the petition, vacated the decision below by the Tenth Circuit, and remanded it to the lower court for reconsideration in light of Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission.

Gallery 30 has occupied two historic buildings in downtown Gettysburg, and its ownership has been active in the local community since the gallery's opening in 1979. Gallery 30 specializes in American fine art and artisan crafts with an emphasis on local and regional art; some of Gallery 30's most notable artists have included Wendy Allen, Janet Walsh and Metro the Painting Racehorse. History Gallery 30 opened in October 1979 when watercolorist L. Chris Fick and former Gettysburg College professor Elizabeth “Betty” Martin partnered in a venture that they called a “half bookstore, half gallery.” The women named their business “Gallery 30” in honor of its location at 30 York Street in downtown Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Gallery 30 opened with a small selection of paintings, photographs and sculptures by local and regional artists and about 4,000 books. The book selection spanned many literary genres but focused primarily on children's literature, reflecting the owners’ appreciation for the art of illustration. In June 1988, Gallery 30 was acquired by former music teacher and Kansas native Rodney Gisick. Although previous owner Betty Martin continued to be involved with Gallery 30's book department in an advisory capacity, Gisick took Gallery 30's selection in a different direction with the launch of a literary project that he dubbed “Man to Man Books.” By 1992 Gisick had compiled “the largest catalogue of men’s studies books available” in the United States, prompting one publisher to call Gallery 30 “the men’s bookstore for the nation.” During his time as owner, Gisick also made changes to Gallery 30's art department, adding handcrafted gold and sterling silver jewelry and more contemporary artisan crafts. In May 1993, Gallery 30 and its historic building were purchased by Washington, DC government relations consultants Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin. The new owners shifted Gallery 30's primary focus from books back to local and regional art and further diversified the gallery's collection of artisan crafts. Throughout the 1990s, Starkey and Gilmartin also concentrated on deepening the business's roots in the Gettysburg community by regularly hosting book signings, art contests and other family-friendly events. In August 2007, Gallery 30 and its historic building were acquired by Pennsylvania native Linda Atiyeh. Atiyeh enlarged Gallery 30's selection of Pennsylvania-made artisan crafts, added handcrafted jewelry by both local and international artists and refined Gallery 30's collection of local and regional fine art by placing a greater emphasis on Pennsylvania and Gettysburg-related subject matter. In 2013, Atiyeh expanded Gallery 30 by moving the business to a larger historic building at 26-28 York Street, next door to Gallery 30's original location.Haines, Jessica A. “Gallery 30 moves to new location in Gettysburg.” The Gettysburg Times [Gettysburg, PA] 23 April 2013: page 1. Print. In April 2015, Historic architecture =30 York Street= The historic 19th Century building that originally housed Gallery 30 is located at 30 York Street, also known as US Route 30 and the historic Lincoln Highway, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The brick building bears an official plaque that verifies it as a Civil War building that was standing during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. In fact, the building was erected in the early 1800s by Gettysburg merchant John Hoke, the proprietor of a store offering dry goods and groceries. In 1858, J.C. Guinn took over Hoke's Store and continued to operate it “on an enlarged scale.” In 1866, the store changed hands again when it was purchased by J.A. Grimes who called his business a “family grocery and variety store.” Nicholas Codori acquired the building in 1867 and started a butcher shop with his son Simon J. Codori. In 1906, the Codori family abandoned the butchering business in order to open a garage in another York Street building and form the Citizens Oil Company. By the early 1920s, Gettysburg merchant Harry Viener had acquired 30 York Street and was operating a store specializing in ready-made clothing. In 1953, Harry Viener's Store was sold to brothers Martin and Charles Redding and was reopened as Redding's Supply Store.“Redding’s opening will be held fri-sat.” Redding's Supply Store remained in operation until 1979. In 1979, Chris Fick and Betty Martin acquired the 6,000-square-foot building at 30 York Street and renovations were undertaken in order to create a more light-filled space prior to Gallery 30's opening. Several 6-feet tall by 8-inches wide window panels were added to the east side of the brick building, and the interior was opened up to make way for a shiplap structure to be installed through the center of the space. Gettysburg contractor Robert Crouthamel was hired to construct a small house inside the building to serve as Gallery 30's children's book department. Gallery 30's logo and storefront sign were designed by architect Fred Harle of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; the logo consisted of a white numeral 30 oriented at a 30-degree angle on a green background. When Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin acquired 30 York Street in 1993, they made several architectural changes including enclosing the building's back porch in order to add windows and square footage to Gallery 30's retail gallery space. In 2007, Linda Atiyeh acquired 30 York Street. Atiyeh continued to operate Gallery 30 at its original location, making only minor architectural adjustments to the building's interior. =26-28 York Street= In 2012, Linda Atiyeh purchased the 16,400-square-foot building located at 26-28 York Street with plans to relocate and expand Gallery 30. This historic building began life as Walter's Theater; at the turn of the 20th Century entrepreneur John F. Walters, who had had great success with a small “moving picture business” on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, decided “to erect a larger theater, complete with stage on York Street.” Walter's Theater regularly hosted picture shows, community theater events, singers and traveling vaudeville acts. The theater created a stir in 1910 when it featured a “real burlesque show” called “Monte Carlo Girls” live on its stage. The graduation ceremony for Gettysburg High School's class of 1917 was also held at Walter's Theater, with those in attendance taking special notice of the patriotic decorations hung throughout the auditorium in support of the American troops in World War I. In 1917, Richard H. Humphries of Philadelphia became the manager of Walter's Theater, changing the theater's name to the Lincoln Way Theater. In 1927, E.L. Weikert acquired the Lincoln Way Theater, remodeled the building into an auto garage and opened a Hudson-Essex dealership called E.L. Weikert Motor Car Company.Nasby, Dolly. Then & Now: Gettysburg. Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. Print. In 1931, Weikert sold the building to Luther Sachs, who opened Luther I. Sach's Hardware Store. Sach's partnered with the Adams County Market-Growers’ Association in 1935 to create an indoor farmer's market in the rear section of his hardware store; thirty-three individual stalls were rented to local farmers at a rate of $25.00 per year. In the years that followed, 26–28 York Street was home to a number of different businesses, including H. G. Armistead Five and Ten Store, J. Louis Schultz Insurance and The Blind Center Shop. The Blind Center Shop was opened in 1949 by Cletus A. Wertz, a Gettysburg man who was blinded in an accident “several years” before. The shop carried leather and plastic products, including purses and belts, that were hand-laced and assembled by Wertz, who lived and worked with the assistance of his seeing-eye dog Dolly. In 1952, Hayward Wogan purchased 26-28 York Street. Wogan redesigned the building, christening it The Peoples Drug Store Building, and opened Peoples Drug Store, a Rexall pharmacy. In the mid-1980s, Hayward Wogan changed his pharmacy's name to Wogan's Drug Store. After Hayward Wogan's death, his sister Catherine Wogan closed the drug store and the space became Wogan's Antique Gallery. In 2012, Linda Atiyeh acquired the historic property and began extensive renovations, including removing a drop ceiling to uncover original skylights, un-bricking original windows, installing new electrical, heating/cooling and lighting systems, painting and restoring the exterior storefront, and uncovering and restoring the original wood floor using vintage floor planks reclaimed from a historic building in Kentucky. Gallery 30 opened for business in the newly restored building at 26-28 York Street in 2013.Haines, Jessica A. “Gallery 30 moves to new location in Gettysburg.” The Gettysburg Times [Gettysburg, PA] 23 April 2013: page 1. Print Community involvement Throughout its history, Gallery 30 has endeavored to give back to the local community in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Gallery 30's founders often held book signings, film screenings, slideshows, lectures and art exhibitions that were open to the community free of charge. Under the direction of owner Rod Gisick, Gallery 30 began hosting larger artistic events, including the Annual Loretta Chris Fick Memorial Art Show and Reception and the First Annual Pennsylvania Artisans Show. In 1993, owners Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin instituted a free children's story hour, occasionally featuring readings by local authors, held weekly at Gallery 30. Throughout the 1990s, Gallery 30 supported fledgling community organizations such as Main Street Gettysburg and Gettysburg Area Retail Merchants Association. Gallery 30's ownership was also instrumental in the formation of the Adams County Arts Council and the History Meets the Arts Exhibition, “a multi-faceted cultural event held annually in Gettysburg to showcase our nation’s prominent historical artists in an up-close, personal setting.” Gallery 30 was involved in Downtown Gettysburg's inaugural First Friday event in 2002 and continues to celebrate First Friday to this day with extended hours, featured artists, book signings and refreshments on the first Friday of each month. Notable artists Gallery 30 has exhibited American fine art and American craft for over 36 years. Representing over 100 different artists from around the country, Gallery 30 has showcased an extensive collection of both emerging and established artists working in a variety of mediums. Through the years Gallery 30 has represented hundreds of artists, artisans and authors. In 1979, the gallery opened with the work of two local artists, surrealist painter John Winship and abstract sculptor Alan Paulson. Later, Gallery 30 represented acclaimed artist Wendy Allen; Allen creates Abraham Lincoln portraits using an artistic technique that is a combination of painting and sculpting, molding thick layers of paint with her hands. Allen's work has appeared on dozens of book and magazine covers and has been selected for Abraham Lincoln exhibitions alongside the work of artists such as Salvador Dalí, W.H. Johnson and Norman Rockwell. In the late 2000s, Gallery 30 represented renowned watercolorist Janet Walsh. Walsh served as president of the American Watercolor Society and a Fellow in the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in London, England; her work has received many accolades including a Metropolitan Museum of Art Award. In 2007, Walsh developed an instructional video series exclusively for Gallery 30 based upon her book “Watercolor Made Easy.” Today Gallery 30 represents Abraham Lincoln portrait artist Rich Thompson. Thompson's work has been displayed in the Lincoln Collection at the Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, the Lincoln Museum in Hodgenville, Kentucky, The Lincoln Library and Museum in Harrogate, Tennessee, as well as Ford's Theatre in Washington DC. Thompson also won visitors’ choice at the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia during Lincoln's 200th birthday celebration. Gallery 30 also represents award- winning folk artist Susan Daul.

Metro the Painting Racehorse Gallery 30 also represented Metro the Painting Racehorse from 2012 to 2016. Metro Meteor was “once considered one of the fastest sprinters on the east coast, winning eight races and more than $300,000 at Belmont and Saratoga; that is until knee crippling injuries ended his racing career and almost ended his life.” In 2009, Gettysburg artist Ron Krajewski adopted Metro off the track and first gave the horse a paintbrush. Metro started making broad strokes against a canvas, and soon the horse was painting with Krajewski every day. Half of Metro's profits from the sale of each painting are donated to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program, “an organization that retrains and finds new homes for retired racehorses.” As of July 2015, Metro had raised over $80,000 for the charity.

Built c. 1870, this house was for many years the summer residence of writer and editor William Dean Howells, best known as editor of Atlantic Monthly magazine. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 (where the listing misspells the name \\"Howels\\"). Description and history The Howells House is located on the south side of Pepperrell Road (Maine State Route 103), occupying a parcel of land that stretches down to the banks of the Piscataqua River, between the village of Kittery Point and Fort McClary State Park. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof, clapboard siding, and a fieldstone foundation. The main facade faces south toward the river, and is three bays wide, with projecting bays on either side of a picture window. The right bay houses an entrance, while the left bay has a three-part window whose larger central portion is arched. The mansard roof is pierced by shed-roof dormers. The main house is joined to a former carriage barn via an enclosed passage; the barn has been similarly styled. The house was built about 1870 by Joseph D. Branum, a businessman from Springfield, Massachusetts. The house was for about 20 years the summer residence of the noted literary figure William Dean Howells (1837-1920). Howells achieved critical acclaim as editor of the Atlantic Monthly in the 1870s, and was also a writer of note. He was in his later years a major contributor to Century Magazine, and served as an advisor to Harper and Brothers.

The store was founded in 1932 by brothers Pasquale and Nicola D'Agostino, in the pioneering phase of the supermarket industry. At D'Agostino's peak in the 1990s, the chain operated at 26 locations in New York City and adjacent Westchester County, with annual sales exceeding $200 million. By 2016 under financial pressure, D'Agostino's consolidated to nine stores (now ten), all in Manhattan, and was considering selling to a rival grocer. Founding and expansion The opening of D'Agostino Brothers on 20th Street (1950). Every store opened by the family was first blessed by a Catholic priest. Left to right: Patsy D'Agostino, city official, priest, Nick D'Agostino Sr. D'Agostino's in a landmarked building at Love Lane and Henry Street, Brooklyn (1980). The founders of D'Agostino Supermarkets, brothers Pasquale and Nicholas D'Agostino Sr., emigrated from the mountain village of Bugnara, Italy, arriving separately in New York City as teenagers in the 1920s. Due to their poverty, they skipped high school and instead furthered their education by assisting merchants including their father's fruit-and- vegetable pushcart business. In 1932, the brothers bought a small shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a prosperous neighborhood whose residents could afford quality groceries even during the Great Depression. In 1939, the store moved to larger quarters nearby; the brothers named it the Yorkville Food Shoppe and added a meat department. In a key innovation, they gave people the opportunity to shop for meat, produce, dairy and baked goods in a single store, helping to pioneer and popularize the idea of the \\"supermarket\\". D'Agostino's flourished in the post-WWII economic boom and opened another large store in 1950, on 20th Street alongside Stuyvesant Town – Peter Cooper Village. Pasquale died in 1960 and Nicholas ultimately bought out his share of the business, to serve as CEO, Chairman and President, and to resolve the family succession issue. At this time, there were eight D'Agostino stores on Manhattan's East Side. With its reputation for quality meats, D'Agostino's ran popular ads in the 1960s that teased, \\"Please don't kiss the butcher.\\" Nicholas D'Agostino relinquished daily management to his sons, Stephen and Nicholas Jr., in 1964. With Nicholas Sr. continuing as Chairman, Stephen became President and CEO in 1972, and Nicholas Jr. succeeded him in 1982. During the 1970s, D'Agostino's expanded to Manhattan's West Side, and promoted the chain with sturdy plastic \\"D'Ag Bags\\" that were fashionable enough to bring further cachet. The store's singing commercials, created by Jo Foxworth, with the tag line, \\"Please, Mr. D'Agostino, Move Closer to Me,\\" aired routinely on radio and television during this period. At its peak in the 1990s, after two generations of steady expansion, the chain operated at 26 locations in New York City and adjacent Westchester County, with annual sales exceeding $200 million. Difficulties and downsizing During the 2000s, D'Agostino's and similar stores experienced worsening competitive pressure from larger chains of supermarkets and drugstores. At the same time, worsening financial pressure from New York real estate costs, unionized labor expenses, and trade credit restrictions severely limited the cash available for refilling shelves. By 2016, under CEO Nicholas D'Agostino III, the chain consolidated back to nine stores, all in Manhattan, and was considering combining with Key Food, Gristedes, or another rival grocer. A $10 million line of credit from the owner of Gristedes helped stabilize operations. Popular culture D'Agostino's has long used the slogan \\"New York's Grocer\\" and has often appeared in entertainment media to convey the New York setting. The chain figured prominently in the 1974 film Death Wish, including a series of scenes within the store itself. The store also features in the 1975 movie, The Prisoner of Second Avenue. On television, D'Agostino's is where Will & Grace ran into each other a year after their falling out, and the store was often featured in the series Friends. In the 1991 novel American Psycho, serial killer Patrick Bateman shops at D'Agostino's. In Ghostbusters II, Dana Barrett is seen holding a bag of groceries from D'Agostino's.

Location The street is located in the middle Downtown district in Bydgoszcz, connecting on a southeast - northwest axis Gdańska Street to Pomorska Street. At its south-eastern end stands an Evangelical Methodist Church, and its opposite tip aims at the so- called Bydgoszcz Musical District. History The establishment of the street is associated with the dynamic development of the city in the second half of the 19th century. The location of Bydgoszcz Main train station, away from the current center of Bydgoszcz in 1851, eased the urban expansion of the city to the north and north-west. After the construction of new quarters along Gdańska Street, Dworcowa Street and Pomorska Street, another expansion phase occurred among perpendicular short side streets. 1894 is the first date referring to Moltkestraße, today's Cieszkowski Street, with its lavish buildings erected during economic boom and the consequent revival of construction activity in Bydgoszcz. New frontages were built on a grand scale, using the nascent Art Nouveau design. Special attention has been given at the time to street equipment praised by the local establishment: paving, wide sidewalks with granite, street lighting (gas, then electrical after 1900). Buildings have been completed within a decade, making August Cieszkowski street a place gathering luxurious tenement houses designed by renowned architects in Bydgoszcz: * Karl Bergner; * Józef Święcicki; * Paul Böhm; * Carl Meyer; * Rudolf Kern, * Fritz Weidner. Frontages present a variety of stylistic trends, both traditional (Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque) and avant-garde (Historicism, Secession, Modernism). First houses were completed in 1897, but most of the construction work took place between 1900 and 1903. In 1904, the road had already received a full equipment: forged fences along the northern frontage, pavement including porphyry , walkways, sewer system and gas street lighting. Among residents and landlords -during both the Prussian period (till 1920) and the interwar- were senior officials, merchants, businessmen, teachers and officers. After 1990, most of the street buildings have undergone repair and restoration. Since 2008 the \\"August Cieszkowski Street Residents Association\\" organizes its annual festival \\"U-Rodziny Augusta Cieszkowskiego\\" (In the Family of August Cieszkowski), promoting cultural integration and bringing street residents and tourists. In 2011, the municipal council decided, as part of the revitalization plans, to build a parallel street, \\"Nowomazowieckiej St.\\", which should relieve the heavy traffic transit in Cieszkowski Street.  Architecture  August Cieszkowski Street is considered as a showcase of architecture in downtown Bydgoszcz, exalting the style and spirit of Belle Époque. Street frontages are an example of the coexistence of classical forms with avant-garde style. Facades have been designed by the elite architects in Bydgoszcz in the late 19th and early 20th century, including: * Józef Święcicki, his projects are based on Eclecticism, combining dominant forms and historizing elements (Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque); * Karl Bergner who designed Eclecticism styled houses with interspersed Art Nouveau details, as was done in Berlin; * Fritz Weidner, Rudolf Kern and Paul Böhm were influenced by Historicism, and were following new, avant-garde, stylistic choices (Secession, elements of Modernism). Oldest buildings are located at the intersections with Gdańska Street and Pomorska Street and display Eclecticism forms with details Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque. In younger buildings, especially those erected after 1900, traditional stucco decorations on the facades are reduced to the benefit of enriching architectural forms. Buildings show asymmetrical facades, irregular shapes, with picturesque towers and merging bay windows. These forms are topped with magnificent gables, stressing the picturesque character. In all facades decoration appears stylized and simplified motives, in line with the new trends in art in the late 19th and early 20th century: acanthi, rococo details, Rose windows, herms and others. Most developed sculptural allegorical decorations on houses facades are geometric and floral ornaments, initials, cartouche symbols and carved figural sculptures. The symbolism used generally refers to the house as a \\"home\\", a place of peace and rest, and points out the passing and contemplation of life.  Main places and buildings  Józef Święcicki's mural In November 2018, the city of Bydgoszcz honored the memory of the architect by dedicating a mural to Józef Święcicki and his works, on a wall located at the corner of Gdańska and Cieszkowskiego streets, in front of his former house File:J Swiecicki mural.jpgŚwięcicki's mural House at N°1 Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N°601268, Reg.A/1104 (October 18, 1993)Załącznik do uchwały Nr XXXIV/601/13 Sejmiku Województwa Kujawsko- Pomorskiego z dnia 20 maja 2013 r. 1903–1904, by Paul Böhm Art Nouveau Construction costs exceeded the initial estimations (40,000 DM) and were covered by the architect who hoped to profit from the sale of the finished property.

In the opposite corner, a cartouche bears the initials \\"KV\\" from the first owner of the building, Krause Vincent. The facades display various cornices and ornaments, embellished with vegetal motifs. The top of the main facade is capped with a weather vane bearing the date \\"1899\\".

The first building on the plot dates back to the 1870s. In 1896, at the same location, Gustav Reschke, a rentier and real estate dealer (who already ordered buildings at N°11 and 17) commissioned a new, grander tenement. The ground floor was devoted to retail stores and the rest was a four-storey apartment. A full revitalization of the house, bringing back original facade appearance with reconstructed architectural details and original colors, has been carried out in 1993–1994. The four-storey building has a \\"L\\" shape with bay windows and balconies on the first and second floor. The front elevation is symmetrical, with regularly laid out architectural decoration. Some of the first floor windows are flanked by Ionic pilasters. Second floor windows are topped with stylized acanthus pediments. File:A1099 z 04.05.1994 dom, 1896-1897 Bydgoszcz, ul.

In 1895, in the same location, the architect Fritz Weidner designed another tenement on behalf of Wilhelmin Wiemer, owner of the lot. Finally, for financial disputes, the project has been carried out by Karl Bergner instead of Weidner. The construction of the building was completed in 1899. The ground floor was devoted to shopping and restoration retail and upper floors for housing. On October 11, 1936, Richard Klewin, a dentist, acquired the building.Odpis z Księgi Wieczystej nr 3922/Bydgoszcz, tom 32, wykaz 1212. During the communist era the building housed the restaurant Gromada and since 2000, it accommodates restaurant \\"Pierogarnia pod Aniołami\\" (\\"Dumpling Restaurant Under the Angels\\"), run by Bydgoszcz Diocese Caritas association. The facade has undergone a full overhaul in 1994. The three-storey building has a \\"U\\" shape footprint with a beveled corner. The corner elevation displays an avant-corps as well as the facade on Cieszkowski street, which is also enriched with a two-storey bay window. The corner, capped by a spired roof lantern, is flanked on the top with triangular gables with dormer windows. The second floor bay- window is an open arcaded loggia supported by Ionic columns.

The forest of horror was unintentionally discovered on March 22, 2014 by a commercial motorcyclist in the area. Over twenty decomposed human bodies and hundreds of human skulls were found dispersed throughout the forest, and over twenty people were rescued from the forest. Governor of Oyo State Abiola Ajimobi visited the forest after it was unveiled. A building with several items, including children's and adult clothing, mats and other household items, was found in the forest. The activities that occurred in the forest are believed to have been coordinated by unknown kidnappers and ritualists in the state who are often patronized by some affluent Nigerians and politicians who use human flesh for rituals. Reactions The discovery of the horror forest generated controversy throughout Nigeria. It raises some question on the security of the state and the need to strengthen it. There was a concern on the link between the management (kidnappers and ritualist) of the horror forest and some top government officials and notable politicians in the state but there seems to be no clear evidence to establish that fact. There was a claim by the youth in the area that the Oyo State Police command refused to investigate the forest despite several kidnapping cases reported in the state. Some of the survivors rescued from the den claimed that the ritualist kidnapped victims by claiming to be the officials of the urban renewal initiative coordinated by the Oyo State government.

His paintings cover a wide range of subjects, most of them on a fairly small canvas and executed either in water colours, or, predominantly, in oils: genre pictures, portraits, landscapes, and more increasingly in later life, still lifes and paintings of dogs, in which genre he became a specialist. In early years he liked to treat the same subject both as a painting and as a ceramic model.

It is presented by Chris Williams and generally comprises music and news from two chosen years. The programme is produced by Blackpool Bullet Productions for Chris Williams Entertainments and is sponsored by the Isle of Man Railways. The show is broadcast throughout the Isle of Man on FM and MW frequencies. In addition the transmission covers North West England, North Wales, Southwest Scotland and Northeastern parts of Ireland on 1368 kHz AM (219 metres medium wave). It is also broadcast worldwide through the Manx Radio website. The title of the show is taken from Carnaby Street, seen by many as the epi-centre of Swinging London in the 1960s. The show commences at the conclusion of the 8:30am news bulletin and begins with the playing the show's theme tune, Crunchy Granola Suite by Percy Faith & His Orchestra. Williams then gives a brief outline of the chosen years of that week's show, together with the artists which will be featured, and concludes his introduction with the phrase; \\"Let's get on with it!\\"http://www.manxradio.com/radioplayer/od/1393/ Show format The show's format is usually that of a contemporary presentation in the two chosen years. Williams, with the assistance of his \\"co-presenters\\" Doris the Tea Lady, Harry the Engine Driver and Roger the Fireman, take the listener on board the Isle of Man Railways time train, whereupon they are transported back to the chosen year. Music from the particular year is played together with Williams reporting contemporary news items which are spoken about in the context of the present tense. The format differs on the last Saturday of each month when the show comprises a general playlist of 60s music with no specific years featured. Carnaby Street leans heavily on the kind of presentation common on Radio Caroline, making reference to that station's strong links to the Isle of Man. Radio jingles and competitions which would have been familiar to listeners of Radio Caroline in the 1960s are common throughout the transmission. However if the chosen year is pre-1964 (i.e. prior to the commencement of Radio Caroline broadcasts), jingles from Radio Luxembourg are used instead. Certain Radio London jingles also feature, and the show is very much geared to giving the feeling of a pirate radio broadcast in the spirit and style of Caroline and The Big L.http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/kneesflashes/happenings/julyaugsept11/julyaugsept1101.html Numerous competitions from the programme's sponsors are also featured with various prizes offered. The music covers a broad spectrum by well-known 60s artists, and the playlist also includes three; million selling records from both of the featured years. The manner of the presentation and tempo of the show is upbeat and vibrant, being referred to by Williams as: \\"the biggest little 60's show on the radio.\\" Often heard are quips by Doris, which invariably take the form of double entendre. The show generally ends with Williams reviewing some aspects of the show whilst Crunchy Granola Suite plays in the background. The edition is then available on the Manx Radio website to be listened to again for the following seven days. From 2017 Carnaby Street was also repeated in the early hours of Monday mornings as part of Manx Radio's overnight service. However as of the beginning of 2019 following a reappraisal of the overnight schedule the repeat transmission was discontinued with. Whilst Manx Radio is a commercial radio station, advertising content on the show is from the show's sponsor only. However, contemporary radio adverts are also played in order to re-create the flavour of radio broadcasting in the 1960s. Radio Caroline Link up In November 2014, as part of the 50th birthday celebrations of Radio Caroline, Manx Radio joined with Radio Caroline for an anniversary link up, part of which included Williams hosting a special transmission of Carnaby Street from onboard Caroline's floating base, the MV Ross Revenge, moored on the River Blackwater, Essex.http://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/caroline-on-the-dial-for- island-radio-fans/ This association has seen further broadcasts of Carnaby Street from the Ross Revenge and in turn has subsequently lead to numerous collaborations between Manx Radio and Radio Caroline. =Marine Offences Act Commemorative Broadcast= To mark 50th anniversary of the passing into law of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act in 1967, Carnaby Street broadcast live from Radio Caroline on Saturday 12 August 2017. This was part of a wider Radio Caroline commemorative weekend with an exhibition at Royal Theatre, Clacton- on-Sea, in addition to which Williams broadcast his Manx Radio Breakfast Show from Caroline's studio on board the MV Ross Revenge on Monday 14 August, to mark fifty years to the day when the act came into law. History The programme can trace its lineage to the 1970s with its genesis in previous Manx Radio programmes of a similar genre such as The Golden Oldies Show which was presented by Stu Lowe.http://www.manxradio.com/ Following Lowe's departure from Manx Radio, Andy Wint took over the presentation of the station's traditional 60s music slot, and subsequently set about enhancing the presentation style and the show's format, providing a more professional tone to the production. In 2005 the Carnaby Street concept was introduced by Williams resulting in the show's current make up. Guest presenters In May 2015 Chris Williams had to temporarily stand down from presenting Carnaby Street following a bout of illness, with Simon Clarke deputising. Following a period of convalescence, Williams returned to present the show on 27 June. The programme was presented by Bob Harrison on 21 March 2020 as a consequence of Williams undergoing a period of self isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Still observing his period of self isolation Williams was however able to resume presenting the show on March 28, when he undertook the presentation from his home in Peel.

The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on 5 September 2016, PlayStation 4 on 3 December 2016 and for Nintendo Switch on 15 November 2018.  Gameplay  Mother Russia Bleeds has beat 'em up-style gameplay often compared to those of Streets of Rage and Double Dragon. The players are set to fight through side-scrolling, stage-by-stage levels, using guns, melee weapons or their bare fists to take out enemies. When killed, some enemies start convulsing. Players may fill their syringes with the drug from these enemies' corpses, which can then be injected to refill health or to go into berserk mode, which adds strength and speed to the player. The game can be played in single-player or local multiplayer co-op for up to four players, in the classic arcade campaign, survival, and boss rush modes.  Plot  Mother Russia Bleeds is set in an alternate 1980s Soviet Union ruled by the Russian Mafia. Four Ruska Romani working for a man named Mikhail make money by street fighting in the slums. In the midst of a bout, government forces raid the operation and kidnap the four 'Gypsies'. The party wakes up a month later in an underground laboratory built under a government prison, where they have been made guinea pigs for the concoction of an addictive drug called Nekro. They break out of their cell and escape the laboratory, killing all scientists and security in their way, while suffering increasingly intense hallucinations due to the Nekro, which they also depend on to fight through injury, and give themselves monstrous strength. Determining that the Soviet government is working with the mafia to spread and sell Nekro, the party clears a gang of violent drug-dealing skinheads out of their former home before meeting Vlad - the pacifistic leader of an organized protest group - and defends his people on their way to a rally before parting ways to follow a tip regarding the location of Mikhail. Mikhail, to the party's disgust and outrage, is working for the mafia under threat of violence against his family, having sold the party out to be used as test subjects. Mikhail escapes, and the party meets back up with Vlad, whose protest has exploded into a city-wide riot after police fired on the protestors. The party fights their way through an army of riot officers and government soldiers, and assaults the Soviet HQ. They encounter Mikhail, who has lost his arm in exchange for being allowed to appeal to the party one last time to stop fighting. After turning him down, Mikhail leads them into a fight pit where the rich and powerful watch - in seeming obliviousness to the chaos outside - as waves of vagrants, gangsters, and animals mutated by Nekro attack the party for their amusement, only to scatter in hushed horror as the party kills them all. Mikhail, horrified by the violence, and terrified of the mafia's eventual retaliation, commits suicide in front of the party. The party corners the government leader in his office, only to suffer a final violent hallucination in which horrifying manifestations of their crippling Nekro addiction assault them, threatening to drive them to madness. When the party overcomes their hallucination, they return to reality, only to find that they have brutally murdered the leader. If the Romani used Nekro to heal themselves during the fight, they die in front of Vlad, their bodies fatally taxed by the extended overdose of Nekro. If they manage to overcome the hallucination without injecting more of the drug, Vlad takes them to the hospital where they recuperate from their injuries. In an epilogue they find that the revolution has overthrown the government, and erected a statue in their honor, having been positioned as 'the face of the revolution' by Vlad, despite the party's discomfort about the violence they committed to accomplish their goal.  Development  Mother Russia Bleeds was heavily inspired by Streets of Rage, Double Dragon and Renegade. The game's development started in September 2013, after former Ubisoft Paris game designer Frédéric Coispeau quit his job and met web designer Alexandre Muttoni, with whom he then formed Le Cartel Studio on 20 August 2013. Le Cartel Studio soon started working on the story and some artworks for their game. In October 2013, the crew welcomed its new programmer, Florian Reneau, where the new composer, Vincent \\"Fixions\\" Cassar, followed shortly. After a few productive months, Le Cartel Studio opened the Mother Russia Bleeds website, with that making the official announcement to their project, on 1 March 2014. At the end of that same month, Le Cartel Studio uploaded a pre-alpha gameplay teaser for Mother Russia Bleeds on 30 March 2014. The level featured scenes from the level \\"Night Club\\", which was heavily inspired by Hotline Miami, which led to a huge spread of the teaser. A week after, Le Cartel Studio announced that the games was going to release in Q1 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, and if it sells well also for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, as well as Xbox 360 and Xbox One, set to run through a crowd funding campaign, which was later canceled. On 18 June 2014, Le Cartel Studio decided to the let the fans of their game's VK page decide on the characters' names, which resulted in \\"Sergei\\", \\"Ivan\\", \\"Natasha\\" and \\"Boris\\". The pre-alpha teaser of Mother Russia Bleeds was later acknowledged by Dennaton Games' Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin, the creators of the Hotline Miami, which the level shown in the teaser was inspired by. Söderström and Wedin then recommended the game to Devolver Digital, resulting in a partnership between the two companies, just a few months after. At Sony's E3 2015 press conference, Mother Russia Bleeds was officially announced under its new publisher, and was announced for the PlayStation 4. The first trailer for the game followed shortly after the Sony press conference, which, besides PlayStation 4, also confirmed the game for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux. As announced on 10 August 2016, Mother Russia Bleeds was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on 5 September 2016. Alongside, a Dealer Edition of the game was released, including a second copy of the game, the original soundtrack by Vincent \\"Fixions\\" Cassar, and the Behind the Schemes mini-documentary. The same day, a port for PlayStation 4 was announced to be in the works, which was released on 3 December 2016.  Reception  Mother Russia Bleeds received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

First described as Libellula deplanata by Jules Pierre Rambur in 1842, it is common across much of the eastern United States. Taxonomy When Jules Pierre Rambur first described the blue corporal in 1842, he assigned it to the large skimmer genus Libellula. There it remained until 1897, when James George Needham established the genus Ladona, and transferred the blue corporal (and several other species) to it. Taxonomists have disagreed since as to which genus the dragonfly should be assigned to, with some subsuming members of the genus Ladona into Libellula, and others maintaining the two genera. However, recent molecular DNA studies strongly suggest that Ladona is a monophyletic group which is a sister taxon to Libellula. The blue corporal has, in the past, been considered to be a subspecies of the closely related white corporal. The etymology of the genus name Ladona is unknown, but the specific name deplanata, meaning \\"flattened\\" or \\"expanded\\", probably refers to the shape of the blue corporal's abdomen. The word \\"blue\\" in its common name refers to the male's coloration, while the word \\"corporal\\" refers to two lines on the dragonfly's thorax; in the US military, those with the rank of corporal wear two stripes on their uniforms. Description The blue corporal is a small, thickset dragonfly, measuring in length. The male has a dark brown thorax with two wide, bluish, pruinose stripes on the front and a pruinose blue abdomen. His face is black, and his eyes dark brown. The female is brown, with a narrow, pale stripe and an equally narrow black strip on each side of the thorax, and a black dorsal stripe down the center of her abdomen, broadening toward the posterior. Her face and eyes are brown. Both sexes have clear wings with short black streaks at the base, often with a smaller amber streak between them. Similar species The chalk-fronted corporal is larger, and shows a basal spot on the hindwing, rather than the streaks shown by the blue corporal; the adult male chalk-fronted corporal has a white (rather than black) face. The male eastern pondhawk has completely clear wings (with no basal streaks) and green eyes, while the male blue dasher is slimmer, with green eyes and a white face. The male little blue dragonlet is smaller, with clear wings and white cerci. Habitat, distribution and range The blue corporal is common and widespread throughout the eastern United States. Its range extends from Oklahoma to New Hampshire in the north, south to Texas and Florida. It favors the still, infertile waters of sandy-bottomed ponds, lakes and pits, and breeds less frequently in streams than its close relatives do. Behavior Unlike most skimmers—and indeed most dragonflies—the blue corporal typically perches on the ground, though it will sometimes cling vertically to sunlit trees during the late afternoon. Males spend much of their time patrolling the edges of ponds and lakes, resting on banks, low vegetation or floating debris between flights. Unless they are mating or laying eggs, females spend little time near the water. The blue corporal's flight is low and fluttering, occasionally interrupted by hovering. Like all odonates, the blue corporal is predatory. As larval instars, they prey primarily on midge and mayfly larvae; they are also known to take ostracods and cladocerans, though these make up only a very small percentage of their diet. As adults, they hunt flying insects, taking primarily small flies, beetles and leafhoppers. They are \\"sally hunters\\", making quick, short flights after prey from a perch on or near the ground. The blue corporal has a single brood per year. It mates on the wing. The female, guarded by the male, who hovers above her, deposits her eggs immediately after mating, dipping her abdomen into the water to do so. She spreads her eggs out, spacing them several meters apart around the perimeter of a pond; overall, she lays few eggs in any one site. The young develop synchronously, which increases the amount of intraspecific competition between them. The blue corporal overwinters as a final instar nymph, and the entire population of an area emerges over a one-month period in early spring. The flight period varies with latitude. For example, it flies from November to May in Florida, while in Louisiana it flies from February to May. Further north, it emerges later. In South Carolina, it flies from late March until early May, while in Kansas it flies from April to May. In Ohio and Kentucky, it flies from April to June, and in New Jersey, it flies from April to July. Conservation and threats The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has not officially assessed the blue corporal's status, but the dragonfly is said to be common across its range. Like all dragonflies, it faces a variety of threats. As instars, blue corporals are preyed upon by fish; studies have shown that, in response, they tend to use cover more. Larval mortality ranges from 90–97% annually.

Named the Mebane Professor of Gastroenterology in 2013, he is Professor of Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and has an active medical practice in New York City. He joined CBS News in 2006. When LaPook joined CBS News, The New York Observer reported on the hire as a trend away from professional journalists covering expert fields and a tendency toward hiring subject matter experts to do journalism.  Early life and education  LaPook was born in Mineola, N.Y, into a Jewish family, the son of Elsa (née Eisenbud) and Sidney LaPook, a dentist and World War II veteran (1928–2018). He has three sisters, Judith LaPook, Nancy LaPook Diamond, and Corinne LaPook. He graduated with honors from Yale University and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving his M.D. in 1980. He completed a residency in internal medicine and fellowship in gastroenterology at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. He is married to Kate Lear, daughter of legendary TV producer Norman Lear.  Career   Medicine  In 1986, Dr. LaPook began an active practice in gastroenterology and internal medicine at Columbia. He continued to teach at Columbia University Medical Center and became Professor of Medicine. LaPook has done extensive work in the field of medical computing, including helping to develop an electronic textbook of medicine and writing a medical practice management software package that he sold in 1999 to a company that was later acquired by Emdeon Corporation, the parent company of WebMD. He is a published author, and is especially focused on educating the public about health issues. LaPook is the founder of the NYU Langone Empathy Project, whose goal is improve the interaction of health professionals and patients by creating a curriculum on video that teaches empathy to doctors, nurses and all members of the healthcare community.  Journalism  In 2006, LaPook joined anchor Katie Couric at the \\"CBS Evening News\\" as Medical Correspondent. In 2013, he was named Chief Medical Correspondent for CBS News, appearing regularly on \\"CBS This Morning,\\" the \\"CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley,\\" CBS Radio, and CBSN, the first interactive streaming news network. He has interviewed patients, healthcare providers, researchers, thought-leaders, and government officials, including President Obama twice, in an attempt to provide insight and perspective on a wide range of health and medical subjects.  Education  In 2014, LaPook founded The Empathy Project at NYU Langone Medical Center, whose premise is that a good interpersonal relationship between patient and caregiver is critical to excellent medical care. The Empathy Project seeks to promote a culture of empathy in medicine—to educate patients to expect and demand it, and to train healthcare providers to be more humane and effective. It will bring together leaders in medicine, technology and entertainment, and create short films that will highlight important issues between patient and medical caregiver.  Awards  LaPook has won three Emmy awards for his coverage in 2012 of the national shortage of drugs, for team coverage in 2013 of the Boston Marathon bombings and in 2019 for Sunday Morning, Outstanding Program. In 2018 The Alliance for Women in Media awarded him a Gracie Award in the News Feature Series category for two groundbreaking 60 Minutes reports that investigated the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. LaPook was also named a George Foster Peabody Award finalist in 2018 for those two 60 Minutes investigative reports on the gymnastics scandal. He has won two Edward R. Murrow Awards for “Best Broadcast” in 2007 and 2013. He also won a 2015 New York Press Club Award for Journalism for “Eye on Ebola” WCBS-AM News Team Special.

It is approximately long and flows through Exeter Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is not designated as impaired and has typical water chemistry for a stream of its geology and land use. Rock formations in its watershed include the Catskill Formation. Most of the watershed of Lewis Creek is on forested land. However, agricultural and residential land are also present in some areas. A plaster and clover mill historically operated on the creek. A stream inventory was carried out on Lewis Creek in August 2005. It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, as well as Class A Wild Trout Waters. A total of 13 species, including brook trout and brown trout, inhabit the creek. Course Lewis Creek begins on a hill in Exeter Township. It flows east- northeast for several tenths of a mile, entering a valley. The creek then turns northeast for several tenths of a mile. Its valley becomes narrower and shallower for a short distance before the creek leaves the valley, crosses Pennsylvania Route 92, and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Lewis Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Hydrology and climate Lewis Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. The creek's water chemistry is typical for streams of its geology and land use. It is fertile enough to avoid experiencing acid flushes. The concentration of alkalinity in Lewis Creek is 42 milligrams per liter. The concentration of water hardness is 57 milligrams per liter. The creek is slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.2. It has a high specific conductance of 216 micromhos. The water temperature of Lewis Creek was measured to be at 10:15 A.M. on August 8, 2005. The air temperature near the creek at this time was . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Lewis Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is just under above sea level. Lewis Creek is a small coldwater stream. The headwaters of the creek are on Mount Zion. In its lower , it has an average width of . The gradient of the creek is per . The rocks in the watershed of Lewis Creek mainly consist of Devonian sandstones, shales, and siltstones of the Catskill Formation. Watershed The watershed of Lewis Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Ransom. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Pittston. The main land use in the watershed of Lewis Creek is forested land. However, rural residential areas and a small amount of agricultural land occurs along the creek's corridor. Additionally, there are some manmade ponds in the watershed. Major roads in the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 92. A bridge carrying that route crosses Lewis Creek in Exeter Township. However, it is listed as a structurally deficient bridge by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Another bridge carries Appletree Road over the creek near its mouth via a culvert. Deficiencies in the culvert have been known to cause flooding. As of 2005, the population density of the watershed of Lewis Creek is 77 people per square kilometer. The entire length of the creek is on private property that is closed to access. However, 90 percent of the creek's length is within of a road and all of its length is within of one. History and recreation Lewis Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199033. In 1845, a plaster and clover mill was being operated on Lewis Creek by Lloyd Jones. However, the mill was rendered obsolete by the introduction of horse-powered threshers. A stream inventory was carried out on Lewis Creek in August 2005. The creek and several dozen other streams in Pennsylvania were evaluated for High-Quality Coldwater Fishery status in 2012. The mouth of Lewis Creek is near the Apple Tree Access Ramp of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. No part of the creek is open to public fishing. However, a few landowners along the creek do utilize it for this purpose. Biology The drainage basin of Lewis Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The entire length of the creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout. In 2005, 13 species of fish were observed in Lewis Creek. This is very high for a stream of its size. There were 34 brook trout and three brown trout of legal size per in the creek. This equates to 115 brook trout and 10 brown trout, with lengths of in the creek. The biomass of wild brook trout was 37.39 kilograms per hectare. In addition to brook trout and brown trout, large populations of young fallfish have been observed in Lewis Creek, even though the species has been declining in population in the area.

The genre is one of the oldest in American cinema; some of the first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. With the advent of sound in the late 1920s and 1930s, comedic dialogue rose in prominence in the work of film comedians such as W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers. By the 1950s, the television industry had become serious competition for the movie industry. The 1960s saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies. In the 1970s, black comedies were popular. Leading figures in the 1970s were Woody Allen and Mel Brooks. One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film. Another development was the increasing use of \\"gross-out humour\\". History 1895-1930 Chaplin as the Tramp in 1915, cinema's \\"most universal icon\\"Sarris, p. 139. Comic films began to appear in significant numbers during the era of silent films, roughly 1895 to 1930. The visual humour of many of these silent films relied on slapstick and burlesque. In American film, the most prominent comic actors of the silent era were Charlie Chaplin (although born in England, his success was principally in the U.S.), Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. A popular trend during the 1920s and afterward was comedy in the form of animated cartoons. Several popular characters of the period received the cartoon treatment. Among these were Felix the Cat, Mickey Mouse, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and Betty Boop. 1930-1950s Laurel and Hardy in the 1939 film The Flying Deuces Toward the end of the 1920s, the introduction of sound into movies made possible dramatic new film styles and the use of verbal humour. During the 1930s, the silent film comedy was replaced by dialogue from film comedians such as W. C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, and Our Gang. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who had made a number of very popular short silent films, used the arrival of sound to deepen their well-formed screen characterizations and enhance their visual humour, and went on to great success in talking films. The use of sound was used to the advantage for ribaldry for comedians like Mae West. These films were known as Pre-Code. As the Great Depression came to improve, the film industry no longer needed to use shock value to draw in moviegoers. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic Church recognized the off-color humor in Hollywood and led a moral crusade. By 1934, the Hays Code was enforced years after its original enactment. Film censorship became strong throughout the next three decades. The comedian Charlie Chaplin was one of the last silent film hold-outs, and his films during the 1930s were devoid of dialogue, although they did employ sound effects. Screwball comedies, such as produced by Frank Capra, and notably \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", exhibited a pleasing, idealized climate that portrayed reassuring social values and a certain optimism about everyday life. Movies still included slapstick humour and other physical comedy, but these were now frequently supplemental to the verbal interaction. Another common comic production from the 1930s was the short subject. Hal Roach Studio specialized in this form. While Columbia was prolific, producing 190 Three Stooges releases, alone. These non-feature productions only went into decline in the 1950s when they were migrated to the television. As the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism rose in Germany, Adolf Hitler in popular culture became more common in the American film industry. Bosko's Picture Show became the first American cartoon to parody Hitler, however brief. Der Fuehrer's Face and Herr Meets Hare became cartoons to expand the parody of the Fuhrer. As Jews, the Three Stooges felt personally concerned for antisemitism in the Holocaust. In 1940, they decided to turn their fears into comedy. They parodied Hitler in their shorts, You Nazty Spy and I'll Never Heil Again Chaplin followed with his The Great Dictator. The film was not only Chaplin's first sound film, it was the final appearance of his Tramp character, who he reveals is Jewish. With the entry of the United States into World War II, Hollywood became focused on themes related to the conflict. Comedies portrayed military themes such as service, civil defense, boot-camp and shore-leave. Abbott and Costello became a popular comedy duo who appeared in films, such as \\"Buck Privates.\\" The war-time restrictions on travel made this a boom time for Hollywood, and nearly a quarter of the money spent on attending movies. The post-war period was an age of reflection on the war, and the emergence of a competing medium, the television. In 1948, television began to acquire commercial momentum and by the following year there were nearly a hundred television transmitters in American cities. By the 1950s, the television industry had become a serious competition for the movie industry. Despite the technological limitations of the TV medium at the time, more and more people chose to stay home to watch the television. The Hollywood studios at first viewed the television as a threat, and later as a commercial market. Several comic forms, such as Burns and Allen, Ed Wynn, Groucho Marx, and Lucille Ball, that had previously been a staple of movie theaters transitioned to the television. Both the short subject and the cartoon now appeared on the television rather than in the theater, and the \\"B\\" movie also found its outlet on the television. As television became filled with family-oriented comedies, the 1950s saw a trend toward more adult social situations. Only the Walt Disney studios continued to steadily release family comedies. The release of comedy films also went into a decline during this decade. In 1947 almost one in five films had been comic in nature, but by 1954 this was down to ten percent. The 1950s saw the decline of past comedy stars and a certain paucity of new talent in Hollywood. Among the few popular new stars during this period were Judy Holliday and the comedy team phenom of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Lewis followed the legacy of such comedians as Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but his work was not well received by critics in the United States (in contrast to France where he proved highly popular). As in the United Kingdom, in the next decade much of this talent would move into television. Sex symbols, particularly Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis, established the sex comedy by the end of the decade. Set in the 1920s, Some Like It Hot borrowed elements from the Pre-Code era with its subtle undertones and suggestions. Doris Day and Rock Hudson also offered material that set the stage for the sexual revolution of the next decade. 1960s-1980s The next decade saw an increasing number of broad, star- packed comedies including It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965) and The Great Race (1965). By the middle of the decade, some of the 1950s generation of American comedians, such as Jerry Lewis, went into decline, while Peter Sellers found success with international audiences in his first American film The Pink Panther. The bumbling Inspector Clouseau was a character Sellers would continue to return to over the next decade. Toward the end of the 1950s, darker humour and more serious themes had begun to emerge, including satire and social commentary. Dr. Strangelove (1964) was a satirical comedy about Cold War paranoia, while The Apartment (1960), Alfie (1966) and The Graduate (1967) featured sexual themes in a way that would have been impossible only a few years previously. In the year 1970, the black comedies Catch 22 and M*A*S*H reflected the anti- war sentiment then prevalent, as well as treating the sensitive topic of suicide. M*A*S*H would be toned down and brought to television in the following decade as a long-running series. Among the leading lights in comedy films of the next decade were Woody Allen and Mel Brooks. Both wrote, directed and appeared in their movies. Brooks' style was generally slapstick and zany in nature, often parodying film styles and genres, including Universal horror films (Young Frankenstein), westerns (Blazing Saddles) and Hitchcock films (High Anxiety). Following his success on Broadway and on film with The Odd Couple playwright and screenwriter Neil Simon would also be prominent in the 1970s, with films like The Sunshine Boys and California Suite. Other notable film comedians who appeared later in the decade were Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and Burt Reynolds. In 1980, the gag-based comedy Airplane!, a spoof of the previous decade's disaster film series was released and paved the way for more of the same including Top Secret! (1984) and the Naked Gun films. Popular comedy stars in the 1980s included Dudley Moore, Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, and Dan Aykroyd. Many had come to prominence on the American TV series Saturday Night Live, including Bill Murray, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. Eddie Murphy made a success of comedy-action films including 48 Hrs. (1982) and the Beverly Hills Cop series (1984-1993). Also popular were the films of John Hughes such as the \\"National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)\\" and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. He would later become best known for the Home Alone series of the early 1990s. The latter film helped a revival in comedies aimed at a family audience, along with Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and its sequels. 1990s–2010s One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film, encouraged by the success of When Harry Met Sally... in 1989. Other examples included Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Clueless (1995) and You've Got Mail (1998). Spoofs remained popular as well, especially with the Scary Movie franchise and Not Another Teen Movie. There were also \\"stoner\\" comedies, which often involve two men on an adventure with random things happening to them along the way. Based on Cheech and Chong, big movies of this subgenre would be Dude, Where's My Car, Big Nothing, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, and Pineapple Express. These movies usually have drug-related jokes and crude content. Another development was the increasing use of \\"gross-out humour\\" usually aimed at a younger audience, in films like the \\"Austin Powers\\" films, There's Something About Mary, American Pie and its sequels, and Freddy Got Fingered. In mid-2000s, the trend of \\"gross-out\\" movies is continuing, with adult-oriented comedies picking up the box office. But serious black comedies (also known as dramatic comedies or dramedies) were performing also well, such as The Weather Man, Broken Flowers and Shopgirl. In late 2006, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan blended vulgar humour with cultural satire. Since the late 2000s, the live-action comedy film has entered a period of severe decline, with studios green-lighting far fewer of them each year. The problem is that faced with brutal competition in developed markets in the same timeframe, major film studios became dependent upon distributing their films to increasingly diverse international audiences in emerging markets to maintain their profits; but the humor in most comedy films is tightly bound to the home culture of the films' creators and does not translate well.

She influenced Northern Irish artists such as William Scott and T.P. Flanagan. Early life and education Kathleen Bridle was born at Swalecliffe in Kent on 19 November 1897. She was the middle child of the three daughters of an Irish lieutenant and coastguard, James Bridle, and a school teacher Janet Bridle (née Flower). Owing to her father's occupation, the family moved many times, living at Gravesend and Winterton-on-Sea before finally settling in Holyhead in 1913. Due to this the Bridle children were educated at home by their mother, but also at nearby schools. In 1910, Bridle attended a private school in Ramsgate, where her artistic talent was recognised. Bridle enrolled at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art (DMSA) in 1915, moving in with her aunt in uncle at 60 Upper Rathmines Road. She won a teacher-training scholarship in 1917, which funded her remaining four years at the School. Bridle won a prize for pictorial design in 1917, and completed the certificate course in art by 1918. Bridle was awarded the Taylor scholarship in 1920, for her work based on the Greek myth Leda and the Swan. The scholarship allowed her to attend the Royal College of Art (RCA), London in 1921. Whilst there she became good friends with John Hunter, who gave her the nickname \\"Pindi\\", a name she kept for life. During this time she also became friends with the sculptor Henry Moore. Bridle's first exhibited piece with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) was the painting The Checkered Cloth in 1921, with her continuing to show with the RHA until 1939. The Mermaid, her enamel plaque which was completed under the guidance of Percy Oswald Reeves, was first shown at the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland exhibition in 1921, then at the Galeries Barbazanges, Paris in 1922, and finally won first prize in its section at the Tailteann Games of 1924. At an exhibition of paintings by Dublin students in 1922, Bridle sold five landscapes. In 1923 Bridle received her teacher's diploma and a continuation scholarship. While still in London and attending the RCA, Bridle taught classes at night at the Elephant and Castle School of Art from 1924 to 1925. She won the George Clausen prize at the RCA for her 1924 portrait of Norah McGuinness. Artistic career Bridle was employed briefly as a glass painter in the Dublin studio of Harry Clarke. Clarke introduced her to Seán O'Casey, which led to her taking over O'Casey's lodgings before his move to London around 1925 or 1926. She moved to Enniskillen, County Fermanagh in 1926, to take up a teaching post at the Enniskillen Technical School, whilst also teaching part-time at other schools such as the Collegiate Grammar School. Enniskillen would be her home for the rest of her life. Bridle continued to paint, and was a major influence on William Scott, giving him lessons in art, exposing him to modern artists through books and painting outdoors with him. Around 1927 she painted a portrait of Scott, and another portrait of Hunter was exhibited with the RHA the same year. In 1928, Bridle held her first solo exhibition in the Enniskillen town hall, a show which included still life studies, portraits, and landscapes. An exhibition of Irish art at the DMSA featured her painting The Inner Harbour, Holyhead, and she was a contributor to the Olympic festival in 1928, in Amsterdam. Bridle was one of the founders of the Ulster Unit in 1934, and was featured in their inaugural exhibition. She was a regular exhibitor with the Ulster Academy of Arts from 1931 to 1949, being elected an associate in 1935 and an honorary member in 1962. In 1936 she held an exhibition at John Magee's gallery in Belfast entitled Paintings of Fermanagh, Donegal, and Sligo, which included works such as Donegal Town (1936). During a visit to Italy in 1937, Bridle studied the frescoes of Giotto at the Arena chapel, Padua. She was amongst the artists featured in the touring exhibition of living Irish artists in 1943 to 1944, which was organised by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, exhibiting with them until 1953. Bridle was very well travelled, visiting Europe extensively to study art, even touring Yugoslavia by bus in her 60s. In 1947, Bridle's second major exhibition was held at the CEMA gallery, Belfast, featuring landscapes from Fermanagh and Anglesey. This was followed by a solo show at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery in 1950, as well as being shown at the annual exhibitions of the Royal Ulster Academy from 1950 to 1979. The first Contemporary Ulster Group exhibition in Belfast in 1951 included five of her paintings. She was appointed to a full-time position at the Collegiate Grammar School in 1955. She was featured in the Contemporary Art Group exhibitions in Belfast in 1957 and 1958, and a solo exhibition of 13 of her paintings was held in the Piccolo gallery, Belfast in 1958. When Bridle retired from the Collegiate School in 1963, the Enniskillen committee of the Arts Council held an exhibition of her work in the town hall. She continued to teach part-time in the convent grammar school from 1964, helping to prepare students for examinations. A number of pieces of work from this period reflect on her travels to places such as New Zealand and French New Guinea. Bridle collaborated with her former pupils, Scott and T.P. Flanagan, in 1973 for an exhibition at the Arts Council gallery, Belfast. In 1986 she received a commission to paint The Cathedral from the Convent of Mercy for St Macartin's cathedral, Enniskillen. Influence and legacy Bridle served as an art organiser in Fermanagh from 1945 to 1951, and encouraged art teachers to broaden the scope of their curriculum. In teaching T.P. Flanagan at Enniskillen Technical College until 1949, she inspired his interest in watercolour. Flanagan and Bridle painted together in Enniskillen, facing Lough Erne. To mark her 90th birthday, Flanagan presented her with a self-portrait. Her final public appearance was made in 1989, at the Ardowen Theatre, Enniskillen, for a viewing of David Hammond's film, Reminiscence by Kathleen Bridle. Bridle died at Lakeside nursing home, Bellanaleck, on 25 May 1989. She is buried in Breandrum cemetery. A major retrospective of her work was held at the Fermanagh County Museum in 1998, which was toured to the Ulster Museum and the Armagh County Museum. Primarily Bridle was a watercolourist and landscape painter, but she also painted portraits in oils. Her 1948 self-portrait is held in the National Self-Portrait Collection of Ireland. The Ulster History Circle erected a blue plaque to Bridle on 15 November 2010, at her former home.

The fountain is a Grade II listed building. Background Sketch of the original tower design Following the murder of Lord Frederick there were a number of memorials proposed to him; the proposal for a pillar or obelisk at Bolton Abbey was first made in September 1882 by electors of the Northern West Riding of Yorkshire parliamentary constituency (for whom Cavendish had been an MP since 1865). The proposal was led by William Foster, owner of the Black Dyke Mills, but he died before the proposal came to fruition. A committee, chaired by Angus Holden was formed to take the idea forward and £2,000 () was raised in donations. Bids for a memorial were sought and the chosen bid was one designed by Manchester architects Thomas Worthington and John Garrard Elgood. The design was for a tall crenellated tower to be sited on South Nab, a promontory overlooking the River Wharfe (, ). In 1884, the Duke of Devonshire (Lord Frederick's father) notified the committee that objections to the planned tower had been received and that it \\"would be detrimental to the landscape of the district and mar the beauty of the outline\\". On the basis of this and also the Duke's own opinion about the unsuitability of the design and location, the committee resolved to find another solution. Worthington and Elgood came up with a different design, this time for a fountain. The revised design was accepted by the committee and it was resolved to erect the fountain just north of the priory at a location known as Hartington Seat. Opening Construction work on the fountain completed in 1886 and the formal dedication of the fountain was held on 11 June 1886. Over 500 guests attended the event and the dedication was made by the Marquess of Ripon and responded to by Lord Frederick's younger brother, Lord Edward Cavendish, on behalf of the Cavendish family. Description Worthington and Elgood's design for the fountain was constructed by Stephenson and Co of Manchester with the carving work conducted by Earp and Hobbs. The fountain stands approximately high and is constructed of local stone in the form of ashlar blocks. Standing on a plinth the fountain is surrounded by six buttresses in a hexagonal plan. A frieze connects the buttresses and is inscribed \\"This fountain was erected by electors of the West Riding as a tribute to his memory, Frederick Charles Cavendish Born November XXX. MDCCCXXXVI. Died May VI. MDCCCLXXXII\\". Each buttress has a gargoyle at the level of the frieze and in the parapet above each section of the frieze there is a coat of arms. Two of these are those of the Cavendish family and the other four are the arms of the Lyttleton, Boyle, Clifford and Howard families, all of whom are families in the Cavendish lineage. Above the frieze the memorial is topped with an open lantern. The Leeds Mercury described the architectural style as Gothic.

Like \\"Wedding Bells\\" and \\"I've Just Told Mama Goodbye,\\" the song was filled with the kind of sentimentality that had made Roy Acuff, one of Hank's biggest musical influences, so popular in the South.

It is the oldest of Spain's tourist trains, managed by the Spanish public company FEVE since its inauguration in 1983 until 2012, when FEVE disappeared and Renfe Operadora took over.  History  With the Transcantábrico, FEVE (Narrow Gauge Railways) created the first hotel-train in Spain. The original idea was to create a tourist train, emulating the legendary Orient Express, which would use FEVE's tracks in northern Spain. The special feature of this train is that, unlike other tourist trains, it operates on gauge track. It opened for business on 30 July 1983 with an inaugural trip between La Robla and Cistierna in Leon. Its original composition was three Pullman lounge cars built in the UK in 1923 (pub, bar and lounge), 4 bunk bed cars, a generator car and a service car for the crew. there are 2 trains, the Classic and the Luxury, the latter is considered the best tourist train in the world. A FEVE 1600 Series locomotive at Viveiro  Itinerary  For the first years it travelled between Leon and Ferrol (through Bilbao), until the closure of the Leon - Bilbao (Ferrocarril de La Robla) line, when it then travelled between Bilbao and Ferrol. After the reopening of the La Robla line in 2003, it returned to original route. In 2009 new special services were introduced from San Sebastián to Santiago de Compostela and from 2010 services were made regular to/from San Sebastian using this Basque Railway Network from Basauri. Since 2011 there is also the Transcantábrico Luxury, a new tourist train that runs between San Sebastian and Santiago de Compostela, while the former tourist train was renamed Transcantábrico Classic, maintaining the traditional route between Leon and Ferrol (through Bilbao). there are 2 routes operating regular services from March until October: * Luxury: running from San Sebastián to Santiago de Compostela and back. * Classic: running from León to Santiago de Compostela through Bilbao and back. The trains can also be hired for charter trips, adapted to clients, for groups and companies for incentives, conferences and exhibitions.  Facilities and services  The current train composition is 4 saloon cars, 7 sleeper cars, a generator wagon and a service car for the crew. The original bunk cabins have been replaced by suites equipped with bedroom and bathroom, a double bed, wardroom, bag storage, desk, safe, adjustable climate control, in-room music, telephone, minibar, and a bathroom with hairdryer and hydromassage shower/steam sauna. The Luxury train composition is similar except that passenger capacity is halved, with rooms much larger than the Classic, with a living area apart from the bedroom, a two-metre double bed or twin beds, a sofa that converts into a double bed in the living room, flatscreen TV and a computer with free Internet connection. Its lounges and suites combine early 20th century’s charm with modern comforts such as WiFi and flatscreen TV.

All cars are interconnected, so travellers can move freely between them and their accommodation units. Both in the train's lounges and in the renowned restaurants along the route, the gastronomic offer is handled by famous kitchens and chefs from northern Spain, celebrated for to the quality of its professionals and ingredients. The crew is headed by an expedition leader and includes a guide, the head waiter, waiters, music entertainer, cleaners, security, train driver, bus driver and rail technicians. The guide accompanies travellers on all visits and restaurants. In addition it offers guests national, international and local press.

In 1986 it extended to 105 km (65 miles) of (single) track covering 12 different routes. History The tram service was opened in April 1883, using horse traction. It was electrified between June 1904 and August 1905, and the system, which had originally been established as a private enterprise, was taken over by the municipality in 1915. The original metre gauge track was replaced between 1933 and 1942 with a broad gauge, which corresponded with the Soviet standard. The early post-war period saw further expansion, with the extent of the network reaching 105 km (65 miles), and up to 300 tramcars in use. Lately the system used RWZ-6 tramcars from the Rīga Train and Tram Works and Russian KTM-5s. However, after the 1960s the city's tram network declined and contracted, faced by competition from the new Tbilisi Metro and a shortage of available cash for investment and infrastructure maintenance. While tram lines in downtown were one by one dismantled the network expanded in newly built suburbs till 1986. By 2000 only 8 tramlines were operating, which was down to 2 lines by 2003. By 2005 just one line (Route 12) was operating, and this remained in service till near the end of 2006. On 4 December 2006 tram system together with trolleybus system was closed, most of the remaining Tbilisi tram rails, as well as the city's trolleybus infrastructure, were removed in few years. What remains A few isolated tram rails remain in place, along with some of the overhead cabling. Many of the supporting poles have found alternative uses as mounting posts for street lights. A few of the historical tramcars are used as street cafes. A future with trams? Plans exist to reactivate the Tbilisi tram network, with the construction of new lengths of dedicated track for a modern light-rail system.Präsentation zur ReaktivierungNewsmeldung eines georgischen Senders zur Straßenbahn See also * Tram * Tbilisi References Transport in Tbilisi Tram transport in Georgia (country) History of Tbilisi Tbilisi ","title":"Trams in Tbilisi"},{"id":"47145190","text":"The EPs is a compilation album by Italian Gothic Metal band Lacuna Coil, 18 July 2005.

A pelerine is a small cape that covers the shoulders. Historically, the pelerine possibly originated in a type of 15th century armor padding that protected the neck and shoulders by itself, if the padded fabric was reinforced internally with metal, and/or acted as padding between armor and the skin in the neck-to-shoulder region. The pelerine often had fasteners so that pauldrons could be attached. In the world of fashion, it was most popular during the mid- to late nineteenth century in Europe and the Americas. The word comes from the French \\"pèlerine\\" (pilgrim) and is perhaps a reference to the small capes worn by many of the women in Jean-Antoine Watteau's 1717 painting Pilgrimage to Cythera. Pelerines could be made of various materials, including muslin and silk. They could be adorned with embroidery, beadwork, ruffles, or evenfeatherwork. Crocheted pelerines were also common. Layered muslin pelerines were popular in the 1830s as an option to drape over the top of the large sleeves fashionable at that period. Along with tippets, they helped emphasise the fashionable width of the sleeves and the shoulderline of the decade. By the late nineteenth century, pelerines tended to be seen as less formal garments and were often worn at home. Gallery File:A silk pelerine, 1815.jpg1815.

It was released as the B-side to \\"Why Don't You Love Me\\" in 1950 on MGM Records. Background By May 1950, Hank Williams was a country superstar, having scored eight Top 5 hits since January 1949, and \\"Why Don't You Love Me\\" became his second #1 country single in a row. However, the B-side \\"A House Without Love,\\" which contained lines like \\"We slaved to gain a worthless treasure\\" and \\"the simple things have gone forever,\\" seemed to express Williams growing disillusion with fame and his growing estrangement with his wife Audrey Williams. In the episode of American Masters about Hank's life, songwriter Danny Dill stated, \\"See, Hank was one of those people that had driving ambition. He wanted to get to this place in the world where he was somebody. And he got up there, and there wasn't anything up there. It was empty...There was nothing there that he wanted. It was all back down there where he'd been.\\" There are many documented accounts of the singer's disdain for those he perceived as thinking they were \\"above\\" him and he often made light of the fact that Audrey often spent money faster than he could make it. Indeed, the more successful Williams became, the more out of control his personal life spiraled as the new decade wore on. Williams recorded the song on August 30, 1949 at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio (the same session that produced the B-side \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\"). He is backed by members of the Pleasant Valley Boys – Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Innis (rhythm guitar) – as well as Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Ernie Newton (bass). Cover versions *George Jones recorded the song for his 1962 tribute album My Favorites of Hank Williams. *Merle Haggard and Bonnie Owens recorded the song as a duet in 1966. *The song appears on the 1995 Willie Nelson box set A Classic and Unreleased Collection.

Shekvetili is home to the popular amusement park Tsitsinatela, large indoor venue Black Sea Arena, and the Miniature Park, an open-air exhibition of scale models of Georgia's architectural landmarks.  Geography  Shekvetili is a 5 km seaside strip dominated by the forest of pine trees, at 2 m above sea level. It is located midway between the sea resorts of Ureki and Kobuleti, 21 km east of Ozurgeti, the main town of Guria. The resort is traversed by the S2 highway and is also served by the Natanebi railway station.  History  Shekvetili served as an important trading locale within the southwestern Georgian Principality of Guria in the 18th century. It was occupied by an Ottoman garrison in 1723 and passed into Russian possession in the Treaty of Bucharest in 1812. The Turks referred to it as Shefketil, while to the Russians it came to be known as the Fort of St. Nicholas. According to a contemporary account, \\"the stores for Fort St. Nicholas are landed upon an adjoining tongue of land, and transported thither on men's shoulders.\\"  Battle of Limani (1829)  As a frontier fortress, Shekvetili was a scene of military confrontations between the Russian and Ottoman forces in the course of the Russo-Turkish wars. During the 1828–29 conflict, the Fort of St. Nicholas was one of the bases for Russian operations into \\"Turkish Guria\\" (Adjara). On 5 March 1829, Major-General Karl Hesse at the head of a force of 1,200 Russian regulars and some 1,500 Gurian militiamen stormed and destroyed a large fortified Ottoman camp at Limani, close to Shekvetili.  Battle of Shekvetili (1853)  The Battle of Shekvetili (1853). During the Crimean War, on the night of 15–16 October 1853, a superior Ottoman force of three or five battalions, including bashi-bazouks, led by Hasan and Ali Beys and Dede Ağa, natives of Çürüksu, stormed Shekvetili, held by two companies of Russian infantry and a local Georgian militia under Captain Shcherbakov, and captured the post after hours of a pitched battle. Atrocities committed by the bashi- bazouks in and around Shekvetili alienated local Muslim Georgians, who had initially welcomed the Ottoman advance. The Russian casualties amounted to nearly 1,000 killed, including Captain Shcherbakov and Georgian militia commander Prince Giorgi Gurieli, and 80 captured, while the Turks lost 32 dead and 59 wounded. The battle opened the Caucasus front of the Crimean War.

An election-eve parade and rally by Democrats was fired on by multiple shooters as it passed the home of Joseph James Bruno, known as \\"Big Joe\\", the local Republican boss. Three victims died almost immediately and two others died over the next two days. The attack received national news coverage, and accounts of it shared the front page with early election news in several major newspapers. The top newly elected Pennsylvania Democrats attended the funerals. Six members of the Bruno family were eventually found guilty of multiple murder charges in four trials, with Bruno and his brother Phil receiving life sentences. Bruno escaped from prison, leading to the then- largest manhunt in Pennsylvania history. He was caught eight months later. All of the Bruno family members were eventually paroled. None ever admitted guilt, and no motive was ever formally established. Background Kelayres is a small community of about five city blocks by ten. Surrounded by coal mines, slag heaps, and a reservoir, there are only two streets that connect Kelayres to the neighboring towns of McAdoo and McAdoo Heights. Joseph James Bruno was the first child of James Biaggio and Marie Antonia (Abbato) Bruno. James marriage license gives the day as October 22, 1882. Other records give slightly different October dates and years, including 1878. Joseph was born in Bucita, Calabria, Italy in 1883, which accords with his stated age in contemporary news articles. James Biaggio Bruno first emigrated from Italy in 1877, and went back several times, in 1882 marrying Marie Antonia (Abbato). Marie and their son, Joseph, emigrated in 1886, on one of James' return voyages, well after James settled in Kelayres, making way for his young family. They were from a small village called Bucita, in Cosenza region of Calabria, Italy. In Kelayres, the elected school boards had the power to hire and fire schoolteachers, and related contract work was subject to cronyism. A 1907 election which many locals considered questionable led to Bruno becoming school board director and a cousin Louis the school principal. Brother Philip also became a tax collector. From this point, Bruno's influence grew. He would serve as justice of the peace, county detective, and an officer at the bank. He ran a garage which maintained the local school buses. He also ran slot machines and bootlegged coal. In nearby Pottsville, he ran a brothel. Critics claimed he abused his powers to enforce loyalty. In 1932, the old wooden schoolhouse burned down. Bruno led the construction of a new building, the \\"Bruno School\\". His brother Louis, the acknowledged brains of the family, was killed in an automobile accident, and Bruno's ways of dealing with opposition became cruder and more antagonizing. On a national level, in 1932, Roosevelt and the Democrats swept most of the country, but not Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Democrats felt they had made progress, and campaigned heavily in local elections in 1933 and 1934. In Kelayres, a rival family, members of the McAloose clanThis family was also Italian. The name was anglicized from Macaluso swept the local 1933 elections, advocating a teachers' union and other protections against nepotism and cronyism. But Bruno, in his role as justice of the peace, took the ballot box and kept it in his house for several days before turning it over to an election judge for a recount, who ruled in favor of Bruno and the Republicans. The Democrats challenged the recount in the courts. Meanwhile, neither faction recognized the other's legitimacy, resulting in competing slates of schoolteachers, tax collectors, and bus drivers. A court issued a temporary injunction in favor of Bruno. His challengers occupied the school at the beginning of September 1934, and open brawling broke out, leaving the school physically unusable until November. The Brunos lived mostly barricaded in their houses during this time. They received bomb threats, and even the women took to carrying clubs just to go to church. Fourth and Center Fourth Street runs north-south, Center Street runs west-east. The southwest corner of their intersection was occupied by the Bruno house. Built in 1927, a brick house with 12-inch thick walls, it was the most expensive house in the township, worth more than twice the second most expensive. Just west of the Bruno house were a pool hall and a saloon, both owned by Bruno. The pool hall served as Republican party headquarters. The saloon was rented to Tony Cara, who along with most of his customers, was anti-Bruno by 1934. Immediately south of the Bruno house, on Fourth, was the home of son James. Across the street on the northwest corner was the Marko building,No longer there. occupied by A. J. Payer's butcher shop and two families, including the Fiorillas, who had switched allegiance from Bruno to McAloose, in politics and in a marriage. On the northeast corner was John Saladago's drug store. Saladago was originally a Bruno supporter. He switched in 1934 to favor the McAlooses, his neighbor one house north. The second floor of Saladago's building had an apartment rented by Paul Bruno, a nephew. The southeast corner was occupied by the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Its main entrance faced the Bruno house. Election eve Both parties held rallies Monday evening, November 5. The Republicans met in Bruno's pool hall. The Democrats met in McAdoo, and also in front of Nicholas Perna's house, on Center street. About 8pm, a car containing Bruno's daughter, Antoinette Billig, and others was jeered at by children supporting the Democrats. An occupant responded by firing three warning shots over the children's heads. An additional torchlight parade by Democrats began around 9pm, with men, women and children marching, and younger children riding in an open truck. The parade headed east up Center and turned south along Fourth, in a show to deliberately taunt Bruno and his supporters. At around 9:10pm, Toney Orlando, a nephew of Bruno, was outside the Bruno house and began firing a pistol at the crowd. He was joined by James, firing from in front of his house. Some people had been hit at first, but the immediate reactions were confused, with some thinking fireworks had been set off. Immediately afterwards, several rifles and shotguns were fired repeatedly with some lulls, so rapidly that initial reports mentioned machine guns. About two dozen people were struck. The initial calls for help to the police were dismissed as pranks. When the police did respond, the shooting was over, and the police had to guard the Bruno house overnight. The initial investigation of the house found, on the second floor, three rifles, three shotguns, and six revolvers, and hundreds of bullets and over a dozen spent shotgun cartridges. Election day and funerals Arrested that morning, or held as material witnesses, were Bruno, wife Cecilia, daughter Elveda, sons Alfred and James, sister Lucy, brother Phil, nephews Paul and Arthur, nephew Toney Orlando, a bus driver, and three Bruno-appointed teachers. The news of the massacre was quickly disseminated, and was front page election day news across the country. In Pennsylvania, it was also widely reported on the radio. Democrats portrayed the massacre as Republican political activity: Republicans also commented on the massacre, emphasizing it was a local, ethnic or factional dispute. State Attorney General William A. Schnader was the Republican gubernatorial candidate, and promised a full investigation. At the time, and in later years, he would attribute his loss as partly due to the massacre. Three funeral services were held at the Immaculate Conception Church in Kelayres. Two were held in the neighboring village of Lofty. The top newly elected state politicians and cabinet-designates, all Democrats, attended the funerals on Friday, November 9, including Senator-elect Joseph F. Guffey, Governor-elect George Earle, Lieutenant Governor-elect Thomas Kennedy, and Attorney General-designate Charles J. Margiotti. Also in attendance was the former Secretary of the Commonwealth, Richard J. Beamish, who had resigned earlier in the year to support Democratic candidates in his role as a newspaperman. Earle and Guffey were upper-class. Kennedy had worked in the mines since he was 12 and had been a leader in the United Mine Workers. Margiotti also had humble roots and was influential among Italian-Americans. When some women made a personal plea to the Governor-elect in Italian, Margiotti provided the translation. The funerals drew a crowd of about 10,000 and were national news. reports 20,000. The funeral speeches contained overtly political remarks. For example, Earle claimed \\"they died in the trenches of the New Deal\\". Trials Bruno at his third trial in 1935. The Brunos were kept in Schuylkill County Prison before and during their trials. They were treated leniently. They were allowed to wear ordinary clothing, take food deliveries, they had their own cell keys, they were not kept to hours, and visitors were unsupervised. They had dental work done with a certain dentist in Pottsville. Bruno himself was a prison trustee. Locals called the prison the \\"Bruno Hotel\\". In early December, the school election dispute was resolved against the Brunos. His son James was fired from the First National Bank in McAdoo. Four trials of seven defendants were held over the next year and a half. Tried were Bruno and his two sons, James and Alfred, brother Phil and his son Arthur, and nephews Paul Bruno and Toney Orlando. The victims were Frank Fiorilla, Andrew Kostishion, Dominic Perna, Josh Galosky, and William Forke. The first trial was for Bruno alone, for the murder of Fiorilla. Two defense witnesses, relatives Jennie and Lucy Bruno, claimed Dan McAloose had fired shots. Bruno was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. After the trial, a local man was arrested for attempted jury tampering. The second trial was for Bruno alone, for the murders of Kostishion, Perna, and Galosky. He was found guilty of three counts of second-degree murder. The third trial was for the six other Bruno relatives, for the murders of Fiorilla, Kostishion, Perna, and Galosky. Phil was found guilty of four counts of manslaughter, the other defendants were found not guilty. The fourth trial was for all seven defendants for the murder of Forke. Joe and Phil Bruno were found guilty of first-degree murder, the other five were found guilty of second-degree murder. Sentencing for the seven defendants was handed down July 13, 1936. Joe and Phil Bruno each were sentenced to life. Alfred, James, and Toney were sentenced to ten-to-twenty years. Arthur was sentenced to five-to-ten years. Paul received a retrial, and was later found not guilty. Escape and manhunt Wanted poster On November 23, 1936, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the various Bruno family petitions for retrials. Arrangements were made for their transfer to Eastern State Penitentiary. The two Republican members, Alvin Maurer and Philip Ehrig, of the County CommissionThe third Commissioner was an uninvolved Democrat. ordered Warden Herbert Gosselin to allow even more leniencies, and unsupervised family visits increased. Commissioner Ehrig himself visited Bruno. On December 8, the two Commissioners filled a prison guard vacancy with the inexperienced Guy \\"Speck\\" Irving, also over the Warden's objection. On December 17, daughter Antoinette visited four times, ostensibly regarding the handling of family financial matters in Bruno's absence, but later admitted to delivering $1000. That evening Bruno complained of a toothache, and he arranged a visit to the Pottsville dentist for the morning of December 18. Irving, serving as his driver, said that he watched Bruno enter the dentist's building around 9:30am, and drove around the block to park, then looked in through the dentist's window and thought he saw Bruno in the dentist's chair, and did not wonder what was taking Bruno so long until around 1pm, and that he then drove around Pottsville for over an hour looking for Bruno, and finally had someone call the prison with the news. The prison clerk passed on the news to James Bruno, who informed the First Deputy. Warden Gosselin was finally apprised of the situation. The state Attorney General, Charles J. Margiotti, personally supervised the ensuing investigation. He disputed Irving's account, and claimed that the guard drove Bruno directly to a rendezvous location and then waited several hours to report. It was later learned that Bruno had been picked up by a friend, Joshua Nilo, who had been waiting for him that morning. He then stayed at the home of Rocco Garramone in Hazleton. The two drove Bruno to New York City, where he lived as \\"Frank Miller\\". On December 19, Judge Hicks had Gosselin, Walker, Irving imprisoned on various charges, and set bail at $15,000 each. Daughter Antoinette Billig was also arrested, but state Attorney General originally would not allow bail to be set for her, until her husband provided information about the escape On December 21, Margiotti accused the two Republican commissioners of hampering the investigation.For example, they would not permit interviews of prisoners without their own lawyers present. On the 23rd, Margiotti issued warrants for Ehrig and Maurer, who were arrested, with bail set at $15,000. In the end however, all but Irving were exonerated. Lewis BuonoSome sources spell his first name as \\"Louis\\". The wanted posters made under his supervision say \\"Lewis\\". More confusingly, some reports spell his last name as \\"Bruno\\". was the Chief Detective of Schuylkill County in the 1930s, and assumed control of the hunt for Bruno, his former employee. On August 22, 1937, a tip led Buono to a rooming house in Manhattan, where Bruno was seized without a struggle as he returned. He had dyed his hair black, grown a mustache, gained weight, and changed his glasses. Parole All the Bruno family prisoners were paroled. Arthur was paroled in 1938. Toney Orlando was paroled in 1941. Alfred and James were paroled in 1942; Phil a few years later. Joe Bruno was paroled in 1948. Joe Bruno returned to his house in Kelayres. He received a cold reception. He died in 1951.

Life Wheelock was born in Holland, New York. His family moved to Moline, Illinois when he was a child, and his uncle Stillman Wright Wheelock (1816–1892) served as mayor of Moline from 1877 to 1882. In 1887, at the age of 24, Wheelock came to West Texas to become the manager of the short-lived but large IOA Ranch, owned by the Western Land and Livestock Company, a firm controlled by Wheelock's great-uncle, Stillman W. Wheelock, the president of the Moline Plow Company begun by John Deere and the Moline Paper Company. The IOA was established in 1884, and encompassed the southern portion of what is now Lubbock County. It had 20,000 cattle, but was unprofitable. The ranch was liquidated around 1900, with the remaining cattle sold to farmers and stockmen. Wheelock and Rollie C. Burns (1857–1945), a Missouri native who was also the IOA manager, turned their interest to developing home sites for newly arrived pioneers. Two communities developed—one north of the Yellow House Canyon, \\"Lubbock\\" or \\"North Lubbock\\", and the second, established by W. F. Rayner, formerly of Stonewall County, Texas, was called \\"Monterey\\" or \\"Ray Town\\", though the name \\"Monterey\\" was rarely used at the time. Rayner believed that his more southern location would make it easier for a railroad connection to come to the location. In 1890, leaders of the two settlements, which were of similar small size, met in the Nicolett Hotel, a business established the previous year by Wheelock, who named it for the Nicollet Hotel (different spelling) of Minneapolis. At the meetings, the two factions resolved their differences and merged to establish what became Lubbock.Paul H. Carlson, \\"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8–19. The new Lubbock County had only 94 registered voters in 1891. Wheelock served on the first county commission. On March 16, 1909, voters agreed to incorporate Lubbock as a city by a vote of 84 to 46. The population had then reached 1,800. Wheelock became the first mayor; he received all 168 votes cast in the election held on April 6, 1909. He was the mayor until 1915. Wheelock died in the summer of 1932 of a heart attack while outside the Nicolett Hotel. Wheelock and his wife, the former Sylva Belle Hunt (1874–1944), had seven children. F. E. Wheelock Elementary School at 3008 42nd Street in Lubbock, an entity of the Lubbock Independent School District, is named in his honor. The Wheelock Subdivision also bears his name.

In the late 1700s, Joseph Mast walked from Pennsylvania and settled on much of the land that is now Valle Crucis. Around 1810, his son David built the two-room log cabin which now sits facing the main house at the Mast Farm. David's son Andrew began building the main house around 1880. Andrew's son, D. Finley Mast, completed it in 1896. A photo of the house in the early 1900s shows a sign stating simply, \\"BROOKSHIDE FARM, D. FINLEY MAST, ONE HALF MILE TO POST OFFICE.\\" Originally, the main house consisted of only the part closest to the road – three stories high, with two rooms on each floor. Like most large homes with open flames for cooking, it had a detached kitchen. The main house is a two-story frame dwelling with a gable roof. In the early 1900s, Finley and his wife, Josephine, began to make additions to the house and to operate it as an inn. Over a period of about twenty-five years, five different symmetrical additions were completed, ultimately comprising thirteen bedrooms – and one bathroom. Other contributing buildings are an eight-sided gazebo (1890), wash house, spring house, meat house, log woodhouse, apple house (1905), weaving house (c. 1812), blacksmith shop, and gambrel roofed barn. The weaving house served as the original farm house. The Mast Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is also located in the National Register-listed Valle Crucis Historic District. The Mast Farm Inn is a member of the Historic Hotels of America.

Summerfield: The Classical guitar. Its Evolution, Players and Personalities since 1800, 5th edition (Blaydon-on-Tyne: Ashley Mark, 2002), p. 86. Life and career Born in Camogli, Chiesa began studying classical guitar privately with Mario Canepa, continuing his studies with Carlo Palladino, a student of Luigi Mozzani, in Genoa. In 1956 and 1960 he attended the Accademia Musicale Chigiana courses by renowned international guitarists such as Alirio Diaz and Emilio Pujol, from whom he learned the vihuela. He subsequently (until 1992) replaced Alirio Diaz in courses of transcriptions from tablature. Having abandoned his concert career because of a hand problem, he devoted himself particularly to the teaching and study of the literature of the lute and guitar, revitalizing especially the nineteenth-century Italian guitar. From 1963 he was professor of guitar at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan. His students included prominent internationally known soloists of today, such as Frédéric Zigante and Emanuele Segre. From 1965 he began an intense collaboration with the publisher Suvini Zerboni, publishing revisions of many works classical and ancient, performing accurate philological analysis and greatly expanding the repertoire available to the classical guitar. He edited more than 150 works by various composers and wrote a number of didactic works. In 1972, with Suvini Zerboni, he began the publication of the magazine Il Fronimo, of which he was founder and director and whose title is taken from a treatise by Vincenzo Galilei on the art of writing tablature for lute. (Fronimo / dialogo di Vincentio Galilei / nobile fiorentino / sopra l’arte del bene intavolare / et rettamente sonare la musica, 1568-1584). The magazine quickly became a reference point for guitar musicologists internationally. In 1983, he became the director of the Corsi Accademici di Chitarra, held annually at Bassano del Grappa (Vicenza). Ruggero Chiesa died in Milan. Legacy Since 2005 the Ruggero Chiesa International Competition of Classical Guitar — City of Camogli has been dedicated to his memory.

The film stars Jamie Foxx as a Las Vegas police officer who faces off against mobsters to rescue his son, T, who they got. Michelle Monaghan, Dermot Mulroney, David Harbour, Tip \\"T.I.\\" Harris, Gabrielle Union and Scoot McNairy also star. This film is a remake of the French thriller Sleepless Night and was released in the United States on January 13, 2017. It received generally mixed reviews from critics and grossed $32 million worldwide against a $30 million production budget. Plot In Las Vegas, LVMPD policemen Vincent Downs and his partner Sean Cass rob a shipment of cocaine belonging to entrepreneur Stanley Rubino, who intended to sell it to mobster Rob Novak, the son of a powerful mob boss. They volunteer to investigate the robbery in order to cover up their involvement, clashing with Internal Affairs investigators Jennifer Bryant and her superior Doug Dennison, who are suspicious of their involvement. It is also revealed that Vincent is estranged from his wife Dena, who is getting remarried, and has minimal involvement in the life of his 16-year-old son Thomas. While driving Thomas to his soccer game, Vincent is ambushed by Rubino's men, who stab him in the abdomen and kidnap his son - demanding the stolen cocaine back in exchange for Thomas's life. Vincent retrieves the cocaine from Cass, places it in a duffel bag and leaves it in the ventilation shaft of one of the bathrooms in Rubino's casino, hoping he can negotiate his son's release before handing over his leverage. He is unknowingly followed by Bryant, who, now convinced he is a dirty cop, retrieves it and hides it in the women's locker room nearby. Upon learning that the drugs were moved, Vincent is forced to present Rubino with bags of sugar to ensure Thomas's safety, but Novak uncovers his ruse and Thomas is recaptured by Rubino's men, while Vincent manages to escape. Meanwhile, after coming up empty while searching the casino for Downs, Dennison is convinced he's gotten away, and directs Bryant to go home and get some sleep. Bryant gives him the key to the women's locker with the cocaine, and heads for the exit. Vincent enters the casino as a janitor, but crosses paths with Bryant on her way out and chased into one of the hotel rooms. They fight, and he subdues her before revealing he's been undercover on behalf of Internal Affairs for the last two years to dismantle the crime ring within the police department. He knows his partner Cass is a drug-runner, knew details about a previous investigation by Bryant, and is now attempting to find the senior member of law enforcement that is covering everything up. A skeptical Bryant directs him to the locker room to retrieve the cocaine, but the drugs have recently been removed by Dennison. Dennison ambushes Vincent, but is ultimately overpowered and knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, Thomas escapes and steals Rubino's cellphone to contact Vincent, but is quietly being followed by Rubino and his men who allow it all to happen in an attempt to lure Vincent into a trap. Elsewhere, Dena finds out Vincent and Thomas are in danger and heads to the casino. Cass arrives and confronts Vincent about his Internal Affairs involvement, but then saves Vincent from one of Novak's men. He is shot in the process and presumed dead. Vincent infiltrates the casino in a police uniform that Cass brought and finds out Dennison is the mole in the force upon going through Cass' phone; Dennison is on Novak's payroll and ordered Cass to kill Vincent after informing him that he was Internal Affairs. Bryant and Dennison later find a severely injured Cass in the garage. While Bryant checks the vitals of Novak's man, Dennison privately questions Cass on whether Vincent is aware of his involvement and finishes him off when Cass refuses to answer. Vincent and Thomas reunite just as Novak begins shooting up the casino and escape to the parking garage. In the ensuing shootout, Bryant arrests Rubino. Vincent and Thomas attempt to escape in a stolen car, but are ambushed by Novak and his men, leading to a violent shootout. Dena arrives and kills Novak's remaining henchman to save Vincent and Thomas, before Novak corners them. He shoots Vincent in the chest, but Vincent survives and fatally shoots Novak. Vincent then contacts Bryant and alerts her of Dennison's corruption. She instantly attempts to apprehend him, but Dennison shoots Bryant. He then kills Rubino after questioning him if Novak's father ever mentioned him in his criminal dealings, then shoots dead the policeman driving the cruiser in order to cause the vehicle to crash - intending to frame Rubino for the incident; however, Bryant survives and exposes Dennison - who is promptly arrested. Vincent and Bryant are taken to the same hospital, where they make amends and congratulate each other on the job. Meanwhile, a corrupt DEA Agent - seen earlier in the film - contacts Novak's father and informs him that there has been a problem, implying to subsequently tell him about his son's death.

In the United Kingdom, film adaptations of stage farces were popular in the early 1930s. British comedy films are numerous, but among the most notable are the Ealing comedies, the 1950s work of the Boulting Brothers, and innumerable popular comedy series including the St Trinian's films, the Doctor series, and the long-running Carry On films. Some of the best known British film comedy stars include Will Hay, George Formby, Norman Wisdom, Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and the Monty Python team. Other actors associated with British comedy films include Ian Carmichael, Terry-Thomas, Margaret Rutherford, Irene Handl and Leslie Phillips. Most British comedy films of the early 1970s were spin- offs of television series. Recent successful films include the working-class comedies Brassed Off (1996) and The Full Monty (1997), the more middle class Richard Curtis-scripted films Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and Notting Hill (1999) the pop-culture referencing Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End), and a movie based on a real-life event The Boat That Rocked (2009). History 1930s–1950s In the United Kingdom, film adaptations of stage farces were popular in the early 1930s, while the music hall tradition strongly influenced film comedy into the 1940s with Will Hay and George Formby among the top comedy stars of the time. In England in the late 1940s, Ealing Studios achieved popular success as well as critical acclaim with a series of films known collectively as the \\"Ealing comedies\\", from 1947 to 1957. They usually included a degree of social comment, and featured ensemble casts which often included Alec Guinness or Stanley Holloway. Among the most famous examples were Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and '' The Ladykillers (1955). In the 1950s, the British film industry produced a number of highly successful film series, however, including the Doctor series, the St. Trinian's films and the increasingly bawdy Carry On films. John and Roy Boulting also wrote and directed a series of successful satires, including Private's Progress (1956) and I'm All Right, Jack (1959). As in the United States, in the next decade much of this talent would move into television. 1960s–1980s In the late 1950s, as the United States, the television industry has become a serious competition over the film industry. So from the early 1960s, much of the British comedies passes through television. = Monty Python team = Monty Python team, created in 1969, is composed of six members : Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. Even if most British comedy films of the early 1970s were spin-offs of television series, including Dad's Army and On the Buses, the greatest successes, however, came with the films of the Monty Python team, including And Now for Something Completely Different (1971), Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) and Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979). One of the most famous movies of the 1980s (in part realized by Monty Python team) is A Fish Called Wanda, a multicultural movie between British and American cultures, with the American actress Jamie Lee Curtis. To finish, Monty Python produced in 1983 Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. 1990s–2010s One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film, like Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Sliding Doors (1998), and Notting Hill (1999). Recent successful films, more representative of British humour were the working class comedies Brassed Off (1996) and The Full Monty (1997). = Comedies with Rowan Atkinson = In 1990 Rowan Atkinson created a series for TV Mr. Bean, which made the actor Rowan Atkinson famous all around the world. Later, he played in two movies based on 'Mr Bean' : Bean in 1997, and Mr. Bean's Holiday in 2007. Later, he parodied the James Bond film series in the spy series Johnny English, consisting of three films releasing from 2003 to 2018, distributed by Universal Pictures. = Comedies about India = Some British comedies examined the role of the Asian community in British life, including Bhaji on the Beach (1993), East Is East (1999), Bend It Like Beckham (2002), Anita and Me (2003) and Death at a Funeral (2007).

It is a colonial species and is found in shallow water in the Indo- Pacific region. Description Anthelia glauca has large tubular polyps growing from a creeping mat that sometimes forms stolon-like fingers. The non- retractable polyps may be tall with a ring of eight slender, plume-like tentacles. The colour is usually white, pale grey, pale brown or bluish-white, and viewed from above, the polyps somewhat resemble snowflakes. Distribution and habitat A. glauca is found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region from the Red Sea to Hawaii, growing at depths between . Its range includes the eastern coast of Africa and at Sodwana Bay, this coral grows on reefs formed from fossilised sand-dunes, along with a few stony corals and a diverse population of other soft corals. It is probably the most common species in its genus. Biology Anthelia glauca is a zooxanthellate soft coral; embedded within its tissues are single-celled symbiotic dinoflagellates which provide their host with the products of photosynthesis such as organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. The polyps supplement this with the planktonic particles caught by the widely-spread tentacles. During the day the polyps sway and contract in a rhythmic fashion. Colonies of A. glauca are either male or female. Spawning and egg transfer takes place at the full moon over a four to five month period in summer. The larvae are brooded in a unique pharyngeal pouch, an extension of the pharynx constricted on either side of the developing larvae. It has been found that the immature planula larvae acquire their zooxanthellae from symbionts present in the pharyngeal pouch by invasion through their ectodermal surface during the brooding process.

At their shortest, the skirts could measure six inches off the ground, which was seen as a bold statement of independence on the part of its wearers.

He plays the electric guitar, bass as well as percussion and keyboards. After a string of AfroJazz albums, Franck is breaking new ground with a genre called \\"Alternative Afro-Electro-Rock\\" or \\"Afrolectric Music\\" that fuses Rock, Electronica and African-flavoured beats. His music leans towards the new sound of Black Rock and Biyong is notable for his African \\"Guitar Hero\\" musical alternative and aesthetics. Early life and education Franck Biyong was born in France but grew up in Gabon , Nigeria and Ivory Coast. His father went to France as a student, graduated, became an English teacher and moved his family back to West Africa . Franck and his siblings attended the Institut National Supérieur des Arts et de l'Action Culturelle in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He originally studied piano but dropped it in favour of drums, percussion and eventually, guitar. Franck's fondness for African- American Jazz guitarist, Wes Montgomery's \\"Canadian Sunset\\" got him interested in electric guitar. At age 14, Franck moved to England where he started working with various bands and recording demos influenced by musical heroes Prince Nico Mbarga, Sun Ra, Frank Zappa, William Onyeabor, King Crimson and many others. Career 1997: Afrolectric Fela's death in 1997 spurred Franck's return to France where he formed fifteen-piece band Massak—a Basaa (Cameroonian tongue and tribe) word that means music, trance and enjoyment through rhythms and sounds—to pay homage to the legendary musician and his Africa 70 and Egypt 80 ensembles. He termed his music then as \\"Afrolectric\\", a meeting of AfroBeat and influence from UK's electronica scene, and went on to form the Afrolectric Music label. Franck then toured clubs and festivals globally for several years (including appearances at the SOB's in New York, The Jazz Café in London and the Montréal Jazz Festival). His first official single, B.L.A (which stands for Brain Liberation Army) was released as a 7'inch vinyl on Lenar/Soul Fire Records. The two-part jam greatly appealed to gritty funk and Afrobeat lovers across the globe. The 2006 Realms of the Atlantis would become Franck's first full-length album. It was a collection of moods and atmospheres exploring a more relaxed and spiritual musical dimension and broader range of influences. Franck Biyong expanded his repertoire a year later with sophomore release, Haiti Market a surprising psychedelic Afropop record paying tribute to the spirit of the Haitian cults and religions. From that point on, Franck was releasing a new album every year: 2008 brought Spirits into Sounds, 2009 saw the experimental Rhythms of our Memory and in 2010, Franck Biyong travelled to his homeland to record his fifth album, Visions of Kamerun. This was his final project with the band Massak and told the history of the colonial wars and linkages of the African nation with France. Franck then formed new band The Afrolectric Orkestra, composed of young Caribbean and African musicians based in Europe as well as young rising stars of the Paris' Jazz scene. They went on to release Franck's sixth album, Voodoolectric Ground. In 2011, Jazz & Africa came out. It was an album filled with highly original renditions of songs by Manu Dibango, Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra among others. The same year, Franck released Meeting the Basic Needs of The People with many long time collaborators in wide variety of personnel setting. In 2012, Ki i Ye Yi was billed to Biyong and The Diamane Bantu Messengers (essentially a variation on Massak) with the assistance of the Paris DJs crew who released the LP with Afrolectric Music. The album had cameos by American Tenor Saxophonist Ben Abarbanel-Wolff, musical director for Afrobeat Academy and Ghanaian highlife legends Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas. Franck's final dalliance into Afro jazz would be the EP, 21.12.2012 (Truth or Lies?) released in 2013. That same year, Biyong also issued a cover version of Fela Kuti's I.T.T (International Thief Thief) as a free download single. 2014-Present International career In 2014, he recorded his new single, Liyomba. The song is off Franck's upcoming 10th album release, Moonwatching and is an experiment in Rock, Electronic Music, Trap, Afro-House and Psychedelics. It draws from the crucial role the moon plays in African culture, religion and spirituality. This forthcoming release shall fuse Franck's electric sound with the deep well of Afro-Futurism. Other ventures As Music Director on Coke Studio Africa Season 1 and 2 Franck worked with the likes of Wyclef Jean, Salif Keita, Lady Jaydee, King Sunny Ade, Culture Musical Club, Seun Kuti, Just A Band and David Correy. Franck Biyong is currently signed to AfriCori.

He ordered the execution of all Nader's sons and grandsons, with the exception of the 13-year-old Shahrokh, the son of Reza Qoli.Cambridge History p.59 Meanwhile, Nader's former treasurer, Ahmad Shah Abdali, had declared his independence by founding the Durrani Empire. In the process, the eastern territories were lost and in the following decades became part of Afghanistan, the successor-state to the Durrani Empire. The Ottomans regained lost territories in Eastern Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The northern territories, Iran's most integral regions, had a different fate. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who, in 1744, had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service,Ronald Grigor Suny. \\"The Making of the Georgian Nation\\" Indiana University Press, 1994. p 55 capitalized on the eruption of instability, and declared de facto independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia.Yar-Shater, Ehsan. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. 8, parts 4-6 Routledge & Kegan Paul (original from the University of Michigan) p 541 Due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain de facto autonomous through the Zand period. Under the successive Qajar dynasty, Iran managed to restore Iranian suzerainty over the Georgian regions, until they would be irrevocably lost in the course of the 19th century, to neighbouring Imperial Russia.Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond p 728-729 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 Meanwhile, Azad Khan Afghan (who was a member of Nader Shah's army and participated in the Indian campaign) managed to take control over the land between the Aras river, and the Urmia Lake by 1750. Azad Khan would later go on to capture Isfahan and occupy Shiraz, before losing all his territories by 1758 to Karim Khan. The Bakhtiari and Zand tribes moved back to their homeland and bickered with neighboring warlords over control of Western Iran. Meanwhile, the Absheron Peninsula and surrounding territories, were under the control of the Khanate of Baku, while the Avar Khanate took control over modern day Dagestan. Alongside eastern Georgia, these territories would all be re-incorporated into Iran but eventually permanently and irrevocably lost as well in the course of the 19th century, through the two Russo-Persian Wars of the century, to neighbouring Imperial Russia.Timothy C.

The Afsharid dynasty would continue to live on in parts of Khorasan with Mashhad as the capital. When the Zand empire expanded rapidly, Karim khan allowed the Afsharids to continue rule in Khorasan, showing his respect for Nader Shah.

Koops was born in Pomerania, the son of Matthias and Katherina Dorothea Koops. By 1789 he had emigrated to England, for he leased a house in Edmonton, London, that year. In 1790 married Elizabethe Jane Austen at St Marylebone Parish Church. He was naturalized on 1 April 1790. From 1800-1801, Koops operated the Neckinger Mill in Bermondsey, London, where he experimented with making paper from straw, hay, wood pulp, recycled paper, and other items, without the necessity of cloth. In 1801, Koops was granted two patents for these inventions, issued on 17 February and 18 May. These patents granted him the \\"sole privilege of making paper from straw, hay, thistles, waste and refuse of hemp and flax, and different kinds of wood and bark\\" for a period of 14 years. In February 1801, he conveyed fractional ownership of shares in these inventions to James Stevenson and other individuals, and that same year launched the Straw Paper Manufacturing Company at Millbank. This company was at the vanguard of industrial paper-making, with its steam engine by John Rennie the Elder, Hollander beaters and at least one hydraulic press for squeezing water from the paper. However, Koops had been declared bankrupt a decade earlier, on 30 June 1790, and still owed considerable sums to his creditors. These creditors settled with Koops in 1801, but claimed that they had not received their promised settlements, and on 14 October 1802, entered Koop's dwelling house and factory and seized and sold all contents. Furthermore, they claimed full rights to his patents, and thus disputed the fractional shares owned by Stevenson and others. (They won the subsequent lawsuit.) On Christmas Day 1803, the Straw Paper Manufactury's proprietors were served notice for failure to pay rent, and in 1804 the factory was sold at auction. As a last measure, on 28 December 1805, the Straw Paper Manufactury's proprietors paid £1,000 to Koops' creditors, but in the end Koops was again declared bankrupt on 25 June 1812. He appears to have died before 1815.

Plot Colonel Robert Sikes is a stealthy, one-man assault team who takes on a city's street gangs, mobsters, and politicians until his mission is complete. His former protégé, William Porter, teams up with the local police department to bring his former commander to justice and prevent him from further vigilantism. Cast *Steven Seagal as Col.

Call as Mayor Randolf *Scott Takeda as Johnny Ito Production Writer-director Michael Winnik said he wanted to make \\"First Blood meets Death Wish.\\". Seagal liked the script and an earlier film of Winnik's, Guns, Girls And Gambling and agreed to make the film. The film was shot in Utah in March 2015 on a budget of $8 million. The shooting schedule was 20 days. Winnik said of Seagal, \\"he’s definitely the real deal... he really knows his guns, his Aikido, his martial arts, his fighting skills. You know, he’s teaching you weapons, he’s teaching you moves. He’s been around a long time, but his arms, his hands, they’re still lightning fast.\\" In the movie, Seagal's character dies. Winnik says the actor was not pleased with this and \\"if you ask him, he didn’t [die]. He escaped. That said, the implication, the way the film is structured, is that he does. Obviously you can interpret it as you wish, but yes, he does go down. And that’s kind of what he’s been saying throughout the film. 'Would you give your life to save the world if no one knew you did it?' is the question he keeps posing. He’s completed his mission and he’s even made the other character take the fall for it.\\" Reception The film received negative reviews from critics.

The series is a darker take on the characters and setting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. It is written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, with art by Robert Hack, and is inspired by the appearances of Sabrina in Aguirre-Sacasa's other Archie series, Afterlife with Archie. Publication history Due to the positive reception of Afterlife with Archie #6, which centered on Sabrina, a solo series starring her was announced in June 2014. The first issue was released in October 2014. The series went on a six-month hiatus before returning in April 2015 under the new Archie Horror imprint. Though the two series are described as \\"companion series\\" and share several characters, they are each set in their own reality and are not directly related to one another. In issue #8, Sabrina experiences a vision of the Afterlife with Archie versions of herself and Jughead Jones, suggesting some connection between the two continuities. While the show maintains a vintage aesthetic the use of contemporaneous technology shows that it is firmly set in the modern day. The title is based on a 1972 anthology series, Chilling Adventures in Sorcery As Told By Sabrina, in which Sabrina narrated serious horror tales drawn in the Archie style. That book only lasted two issues, and was rebooted in 1973 by Archie's imprint Red Circle Comics as Chilling Adventures in Sorcery, minus Sabrina and the company's traditional cartooning style. Story arcs Volume 1: The Crucible (issues 1–5) Half-witch Sabrina lives with her witch aunts, Hilda and Zelda, her warlock cousin Ambrose, and Salem, her feline familiar, in the town of Greendale. Nearing her sixteenth birthday, she must choose whether to become a full witch or pursue a mortal life with her boyfriend, Harvey Kinkle. Meanwhile, Madam Satan, a former flame of Sabrina's estranged father has returned from Hell and wants revenge on the Spellman family. Volume 2: Witch-War (issues 6– ) Sabrina’s father, Edward Spellman, is mysteriously back among the living, masquerading as a resurrected Harvey. Hilda and Zelda warn Sabrina about the consequences of necromancy, but Sabrina protects \\"Harvey\\" against their attempts to send him back to the grave. Edward begins to wonder who could’ve helped Sabrina engage in such powerful magic. Characters Main *Sabrina Victoria Spellman, a teenage half-witch who lives in the town of Greendale with her aunts, her cousin Ambrose, and her familiar Salem. Unbeknownst to Sabrina, when she was just a year old, she was taken from her mother, Diana, by her aunts with the approval of her father, Edward. Sabrina was told that her mother died; she hasn't seen her father since she was young. While Sabrina is taught witchery by her aunts at home, she lives a relatively normal life in public as a cheerleader and student at Baxter High School. No one, including her boyfriend Harvey, is aware that she is a witch.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #1, October 2014.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #7, August 2017. *Hilda Spellman, Sabrina's witch aunt and co-guardian. She is more forbearing than Zelda, though both are strict followers of witch law and the Church of Night.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #7 & #8, August–October 2017. *Zelda Spellman, Sabrina's other witch aunt and co-guardian. She is more pragmatic than Hilda, though they both ultimately want the best for their niece, despite keeping the truth about her parents a secret. *Madam Satan, formerly known as Iola, Edward's witch girlfriend whom he left for Diana. Heartbroken that he chose a mortal over her, Iola killed herself and wound up in the pits of Gehenna, a place reserved in the circle of Hell for suicides, where she remained faceless until she was accidentally released by two amateur witches. After gaining a new face, she burns the tree that encased Edward and cures Diana of the insanity he inflicted upon her, but leaves her unable to leave the psychiatric facility. Upon discovering their daughter's existence, she makes her way to Greendale where she becomes a teacher at Baxter High as \\"Evangeline Porter\\" where she can monitor Sabrina and continue her revenge against the Spellman family.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #2, June 2015. *Ambrose, Sabrina's Pansexual warlock cousin who comes to live with her and her aunts from the Old Country. As punishment by the Witches Council for revealing himself to mortals, he cannot leave the Spellman house. He has two cobra familiars, Nag and Nagaina. *Harvey Kinkle, a football player and fellow student at Baxter High School. He is Sabrina's boyfriend but is unaware that she and her aunts are witches. After being set up by Madam Satan, he discovers their true nature and is killed by the other witches. Edward is later resurrected in Harvey's body, though Sabrina only believes it to be Harvey.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #3, July 2015.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #8, October 2017. *Salem, Sabrina's familiar who often acts as the voice of reason. Originally a human named Samuel, he was turned into a cat as punishment by the witches of Salem Village for impregnating a witch named Abigail (unaware that she was a witch) and refusing to marry her. At some point as a cat, he attempted to enact the Book of Revelation. He was given to Sabrina by her aunts and was prophesied by the Devil himself that if he were to do his duty and protect her, then he may become human again.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #6, September 2016. *Edward Spellman, Sabrina's estranged warlock father and the younger brother of Hilda and Zelda. It is later known that the true father of Sabrina Spellman is really Lucifer Morningstar himself. He quickly rose through the ranks in the Church of Night as a skilled conjuror and eventually became a High Priest. He broke witch-law to marry Diana Sawyer, a mortal, whom he hoped would bear him an heir. When Hilda and Zelda discovered that Edward had been lying to the congregation, they trapped him in a tree as punishment. His ex-lover Madam Satan would go on to vengefully burn the tree, but would also aid in his resurrection into Harvey's body. With Sabrina believing that she brought back Harvey, Edward wonders who could’ve helped her with such strong magic, and why. He vaguely remembers \\"Iona\\" from his past.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #1 and #2, April–May 2015 Other characters *Diana Spellman (née Sawyer), Sabrina's mortal mother, whom she believes to be dead, but is really in a psychiatric facility. Her husband, Edward, turned her insane after she refused to give up her daughter to his sisters. Madam Satan eventually grants Diana her sanity, but makes sure that she'll never be able to convince the doctors to let her leave. Diana is briefly able to contact Sabrina through a dream, but is stopped and Sabrina soon forgets the encounter. *Rosalind, also called \\"Roz\\" and \\"Rossy\\" on occasion, a student at Baxter High School who competes with Sabrina for everything from boys to roles in the school play to popularity. Since Rosalind is usually the one losing out, she frequently gossips maliciously about Sabrina to other students. Diana warns Sabrina about Rosalind in a dream, saying that she’s not as she seems, but Sabrina forgets by the next morning.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #4, September 2015. *Nag and Nagaina, Ambrose's cobra familiars who were originally humans (a prince and a princess) that were tricked by a sorcerer into trying to murder their father's bride-to-be and were consequently turned into snakes. *Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, young witches from High Priestess Grundy's coven in Riverdale who were trying to summon a succubus to help them settle a blood- rivalry but instead summoned Madam Satan. Later, they visit Greendale with others from Riverdale High and participate in the search for Harvey. While there, Madam Satan recruits them for a resurrection spell.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina #5, July 2016. *Satan, also known as Lucifer and the Devil, the worshipped figure of the Church of Night. He appears during Sabrina's baptism as a giant humanoid goat. When he appeared to Salem back in 1692, he also displayed a human head. The series also alludes to and features fictionalized versions of numerous real-world figures, namely Rudyard Kipling, Ann-Margret, Aleister Crowley, Giles Corey, John, Benjamin, William, and Elizabeth Proctor, Abigail Williams, Reverend Parris, Mercy Lewis, Sorcar, and Alphonse Louis Constant. Fictional characters from other media appear as well such as Martin Coslaw, Miss Lovett, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, Steven Marcato, and the Three Witches. Figures from demonology include Baphomet, Yan-gant-y-tan, Volac, Beelzebub, Fur-Fur, Cerbere, Ba-El, Empusa, and Stolas. In addition to Betty and Veronica, several other characters from Archie Comics appear briefly including Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Chuck Clayton, Reggie Mantle, Dilton Doiley, Mr. Weatherbee, Nancy Woods, Hot Dog, and Pop Tate. Reception The first two issues sold out. Comic Book Resources called it \\"a surprisingly successful little horror sub-imprint\\" and \\"that Aguirre-Sacasa and Hack have created a horror comic that would work well even if it wasn't attached to the iconic 'Sabrina.'\\" while The Mary Sue said that it was \\"a refreshing change of pace for a story we all think we know already.\\" IGN gave the first issue an 8.9 out of 10 calling it \\"something that fans of Afterlife and horror in general will be wanting more of by issue’s end.\\" Comics Alliance called it \\"a pretty incredible accomplishment\\" saying that \\"in a time when we’re getting some fantastic horror comics on the stands, Sabrina might just be the best of the bunch.\\" Television adaptation In December 2017, a live-action adaptation of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, produced by Warner Bros.

The largely powerless government was dissolved when General Sani Abacha seized power on 17 November 1993. History 12 June 1993 presidential election was won by Moshood Abiola. General Babangida annulled the election. This led to rioting, particularly in the south, which was harshly suppressed. Babangida announced that he would step down on 26 August 1993, and handed over to Ernest Shonekan as head of the Interim National Government (ING) on 27 August 1993. Shoenkan had a degree in law, had studied at the Harvard Business School in the US, and had held senior management positions in various companies. He was an Oloye of the Yoruba people and had been president of Babangida's Transitional Council. He was an unelected technocrat chosen in a deal between Babangida and political leaders, and his appointment was poorly received by the press and the public. Shonekan appointed Moshood Abiola as his vice-president. General Sani Abacha was made secretary of defence in the cabinet. Under the ING the country suffered runaway inflation and saw strikes by workers in various sectors. Most foreign investors withdrew apart from oil companies. Shonekan made efforts to have government debt forgiven. He drew up a timetable for return to democracy and for withdrawal of Nigeria's contingent from the ECOMOG preackeeping force in Liberia. He also launched an audit of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, the largest oil company, and tried to restore civil liberties. Shonekan managed to remove laws that allowed arbitrary arrest and confiscation of property, promoted press freedom, obtained the release of some political prisoners and made reforms to the corrupt public services and state-owned companies. No clear process was given for holding fresh elections, and there was general political uncertainty under the Shonekan government. The ING faced media campaigns against the delay in returning to democracy and the continued involvement of the military in politics. The government was opposed by pro- democracy activists, civil society organisations, labour unions and students. The Lagos high court nullified Shonekan's appointment and called for Abiola to be sworn in as the elected candidate for the presidency. General Sani Abacha forced Shonekan to resign on 17 November 1993, and as the most senior military officer took over as head of state.

It was preceded by Hidden Order and was followed by Code of Conduct. Of the book, Thor stated that his \\"No. 1 goal is to entertain people. I'm an entertainer and I'm gonna give them a great summer read. But if you close the book with questions or wanting to learn more about something or just a little bit smarter, than I think that's a neat kind of value add.\\" Plot The main plot of the novel revolves around President of the United States Paul Porter and the United States attempt to stop a catastrophic attack on the country by the Chinese. The name of the Chinese plot is Snow Dragon. Thor tells the story of the main plot through three important subplots. A first subplot involves a team of three Navy SEALS and a CIA agent that are dispatched to spy on North Korea. This is being done because intelligence has told the United States that the Chinese are conducting training missions in the country. The second subplot centers around a division of the Chinese government and their planning of Snow Dragon. When one of the cell members of the plot in the United States continually fails to make contact, that division of the Chinese government sends in a known killer and super spy into the U.S. to check things out. The last subplot focuses on the fact the Chinese contracted out the completion of Snow Dragon to Muslims and other extremists in the Middle East. If the U.S. government wants any information or any hope of stopping Snow Dragon they must find anyone and everyone involved in pulling off this catastrophic event. Throughout the three subplots is the story of former Navy SEAL, Secret Service member and American hero Scot Harvath. Harvath, who is working with the Carlton Group, a specialized intel and operations group, does whatever it takes to stop the Chinese and keep America safe. Reception Tulsa World praised Act of War and compared it favorably to the television series 24.

He currently holds a chair for Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Göttingen, in Germany. Through extensive authorial, editorial, and organizational undertakings, Spieckermann has exerted considerable influence on Hebrew Bible research.  Life  Spieckermann studied theology and assyriology at the universities of Münster and Göttingen from 1969 to 1975. Having already specialized in the field of Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, during his university studies, he served as scientific assistant to the Göttingen Old Testament scholar Lothar Perlitt after his exams (1975–88). In 1982, he earned a doctor theologiae and secured habilitation in the field of Old Testament Studies five years later, in 1987. While in Göttingen, Spieckermann also worked closely with the renowned Dutch assyriologist Riekele Borger. He served as Privatdozent for two years in Göttingen before receiving a call to the University of Zürich as associate professor of Old Testament and the history of Near Eastern religion, in 1989. Three years later, in 1992, he moved to the University of Hamburg to hold a full professorship in the same field. Since the 1999–2000 academic year, Spieckermann has served as professor of Old Testament at the University of Göttingen.  Areas of expertise  With his first monograph, Juda unter Assur in der Sargonidenzeit, Spieckermann demonstrated a mastery of biblical criticism, assyriology, and ancient Near Eastern history. His primary research then shifted to the Psalter and Wisdom literature. More recently, he has helped turn biblical scholarship—as both author and editor—to the field of reception history, working closely with Choon-Leong Seow in this regard. Throughout all his academic undertakings, Spieckermann has maintained a strong interest in the history of theology as reflected in biblical texts as well as the history of biblical scholarship itself. In 2011, he coauthored—with New Testament scholar and Göttingen professor Reinhard Feldmeier—an acclaimed volume, in both German and English translation, that presents the conceptualization of God across the Old and New Testaments.  Academic honors  Among other honors and awards, Spieckermann was guest professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, in 1999, and received an honorary doctorate in theology from Sweden's University of Lund the next year, in 2000. In 1997, he declined a chair at the Heidelberg University. He is also a former member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. Professional activities  Spieckermann currently serves on the board of directors for the Academy's Septuagint-Unternehmen as well as its Qumran dictionary. He also sits on the prestigious board of the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament, together with that of its journal, Vetus Testamentum, and book series, Vetus Testamentum Supplements. Spieckermann holds positions on any number of other editorial boards in addition: from Walter de Gruyter's Theologische Realenzyklopädie (TRE) and, formerly, Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception (EBR) through Mohr Siebeck's Forschungen zum Alten Testament (FAT) and Topics of Biblical Theology (TOBITH) to Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht's Altes Testament Deutsch (ATD). In 2004, he became speaker of the nine-year- long German Research Foundation Research Training Group (Graduiertenkolleg) 896 \\"Concepts of the Divine – Concepts of the World,\\" and the next year, he joined Göttingen's Graduate School of Humanities (GSGG). Furthermore, Spieckermann hosted Nathan MacDonald's major research project \\"Early Jewish Monotheisms,\\" which was funded through the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's Sofia Kovalevskaya Award. He also helped found the Northern European research network Old Testament Studies: Epistemologies and Methods OTSEM. In many of these endeavors, he has worked closely with his Göttingen Old Testament colleague, Reinhard Gregor Kratz.

Tod Swain, an editor at the World, chastises Vina for her poor judgment. Gillette then sets out to ruin a department store owner by having henchman Beak McArdle arrange an elevator accident that causes deaths as well as serious injury to Ralph. Vina's own life is in peril when Gillette then orders McArdle to murder her so she can never tell what she knows.

Google touts the benefits of this cost-effective and efficient means of ranking pages and reassures readers that there is no animal cruelty involved in the process. The article makes many humorous references and puns based on computer terminology and how Google PageRank really works, (for example, a chart showing the pigeons' consumption of seed and flaxle, represented as the \\"Linflax Kernel,\\" a pun on the Linux kernel). * Pigeon Rank  2004  Fictitious job opportunities for a research center on the moon. Copernicus is the name of a new operating system they claimed to have created for working at the research center. * Google Job Opportunities: Google Copernicus Center is hiring Google also announced Gmail on April 1, with an unprecedented and unbelievable free 1 GB space, compared to e.g. Hotmail's 2 MB. The announcement of Gmail was written in an unserious jokey language normally seen in April Fools' jokes, tricking many into thinking that it was an April Fools' joke. In reality, it was a double fake, in that the announced product was serious.  2005  Google Gulp, a fictitious drink, was announced by Google in 2005. According to the company, this beverage would optimize one's use of the Google search engine by increasing the drinker's intelligence. It was claimed this boost was achieved through real-time analysis of the user's DNA and carefully tailored adjustments to neurotransmitters in the brain (a patented technology termed Auto-Drink; as the \\"Google Gulp FAQ\\" suggests, partly through MAO inhibition). The drink was said to come in \\"4 great flavors\\": Glutamate Grape (glutamic acid), Sugar Radical (free radicals), Beta Carotty (Beta-Carotene), and Sero- Tonic Water (serotonin). This hoax was probably intended as a parody of Google's then invite-only email service called Gmail. Although ostensibly free, the company claimed the beverage could only be obtained by returning the cap of a Google Gulp bottle to a local grocery store: a Catch-22. In the Google Gulp FAQ, Google replies to the observation \\"I mean, isn't this whole invite-only thing kind of bogus?\\" by saying \\"Dude, it's like you've never even heard of viral marketing.\\" * Google Gulp * Google Gulp FAQ  2006  Google Romance logo On April Fool's Day 2006, Google Romance was announced on the main Google search page with the introduction, \\"Dating is a search problem. Solve it with Google Romance.\\" It pretends to offer a \\"Soulmate Search\\" to send users on a \\"Contextual Date\\". A parody of online dating, it had a link for \\"those who generally favor the 'throw enough stuff at the wall' approach to online dating\\" to Post multiple profiles with a bulk upload file, you sleaze in addition to Post your Google Romance profile. Clicking on either of these gave an error page, which explained that it was an April Fool's joke and included links to previous April Fool's jokes. * Google Romance * Google Romance FAQ * Google Romance Tour  2007   Gmail Paper  At about 10:00 pm, Pacific time (where Google has its headquarters) on March 30, 2007, Google changed the login page for Gmail to announce a new service called Gmail Paper. The service offered to allow users of Google's free webmail service to add e-mails to a \\"Paper Archive\\", which Google would print (on \\"94% post- consumer organic soybean sputum\\") and mail via traditional post. The service would be free, supported by bold, red advertisements printed on the back of the printed messages. Image attachments would also be printed on high-quality glossy paper, though MP3 and WAV files would not be printed. The page detailing more information about the service features photographs of Ian Spiro and Carrie Kemper, current employees of Google. Also featured are Product Marketing Managers of Gmail Anna-Christina Douglas, and Shane Lawrence. * Gmail Paper Index * Gmail Paper Announcement * Gmail Paper Program Policies  Google TiSP  Google TiSP (short for Toilet Internet Service Provider) was a fictitious free broadband service supposedly released by Google. This service would make use of a standard toilet and sewage lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8 Mbit/s (2 Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32 Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60 minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a \\"Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)\\". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a Windows XP or Windows Vista computer (\\"Mac and Linux support coming soon\\"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy nanobots through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by \\"discreet DNA sequencing\\" of \\"personal bodily output\\" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health. Google also referenced the diet coke-and- Mentos reaction in their FAQ: \\"If you're still experiencing problems, drop eight mints into the bowl and add a two-liter bottle of diet soda.\\" They also claim that Enterprise plans will include support in the event of backup problems, brownouts and data wipes. * Google TiSP * Google TiSP FAQ * Installation page * Press Release page * Not found page – April fools version  2008   Blogger \\"Google Weblogs (beta)\\"  The Blogger dashboard featured an announcement for Google Weblogs, or \\"GWeblogs,\\" or \\"Gblogs,\\" the next revolution in personal publishing. Features include algorithms putting the user's best content at the top of the user's blog (rather than publishing by reverse chronology), automatically populating the blog's sidebar with the most relevant content, posting directly into Google search results for maximum visibility, blog headers refreshed with images from Google's team of artists for anniversaries of a scientific achievement (similar to Google Doodle), and automatic content generation ('Unsure of what to post about? Just click \\"I'm Feeling Lucky\\" and we'll \\"take care\\" of the rest!') The announcement was followed by a link to a video tour of the product, which actually led to Tay Zonday's cover of Rick Astley's \\"Never Gonna Give You Up.\\" * Blogger Buzz: The Official Buzz from Blogger at Google: Announcing Google Weblogs (beta)  Daja  Google launches Daja in Japan (google.co.jp), with the mission of \\"organizing the world's laughter.\\"  Day  Google announced Day in Australia, a new beta search technology that will search web pages 24 hours before they are created. The name is a play on the phrase \\"g'day\\". * gDay  Gmail Custom Time  Gmail's sign-in page and a banner at the top of each Gmail inbox announced a new feature, called Gmail Custom Time, that would allow its users to \\"pre-date\\" their messages and choose to have the message appear as \\"read\\" or \\"unread\\". The new feature uses the slogan \\"Be on time. Every time.\\" Around 11:00 pm EST March 31, 2008, on the newer and older version of Gmail, but not in the basic HTML version, in the upper right corner, next to Settings, a link appeared labeled, \\"New! Gmail Custom Time\\". The link led to a 404 error until April 1, when it led to the full Gmail Custom Time hoax page. Clicking any of the three links at the bottom of the page brought the user to a page stating that Gmail Custom time was, in fact, their April Fool's Day joke.  Google Book Search Scratch and Sniff  Google Book Search has a new section allowing users to \\"scratch and sniff\\" certain books. Users are asked to \\"...please place your nose near the monitor and click 'Go'\\", which then \\"loads odors\\". When clicking on \\"Help\\", users are redirected to a page in a book that describes the origins of April Fools' Day. * Inside Google Book Search Blog: \\"Google Book Search now smells better\\"  Google Calendar is Feeling Lucky  Google added the \\"I'm Feeling Lucky\\" button to its calendar feature. When a user tries to create a new event, the user was given the regular option of entering the correct details and hitting \\"Create Event\\", and also the new option of \\"I'm Feeling Lucky\\" which would set the user up with an evening date with, among others, Matt Damon, Eric Cartman, Tom Cruise, Jessica Alba, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton, Angelina Jolie, Britney Spears, Anna Kournikova, Johnny Depp, George W. Bush, or Lois Griffin.  Google Manpower Search  Google launched Manpower Search (谷歌人肉搜索) in China (google.cn). The feature was presented as being powered by 25 million volunteers who conducted searches around the clock. When the user entered a keyword, volunteers would search any possible answers from a mass of paper documents as well as online resources. The user was expected to get the search result within 32 seconds. The \\"search\\" button would avoid the user's cursor.  Google Saturi Translate  Google Korea announced that 'Google Saturi (, Korean dialect) Translate' had been opened on April 1, 2008. When the user tried to use this translator, a message appeared, explaining that it was April Fools' Day event and was not executable.  Google Talk  Google announced plans to, on April 22, 2008 (Earth Day), shorten all conversations over Google Talk thereby reducing the energy required to transmit chats in an effort to reduce carbon output. * Google Talk Goes Green  Google Wake Up Kit  Google launched their \\"Wake Up Kit\\" as a calendar notification option. > The 'wake up' notification uses several progressively more annoying alerts > to wake one up. First it will send an SMS message to their phone. If that > fails, more coercive means will be used. The kit includes an industrial- > sized bucket and is designed to be connected to their water main for > automatic filling. In addition, a bed-flipping device is included for > forceful removal from their sleeping quarters.  Virgle  Virgle Logo Google announced a joint project with the Virgin Group to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. This operation has been named Project Virgle. The announcement includes videos of Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) as well as Larry Page and Sergey Brin (the founders of Google) on YouTube, talking about Virgle. An \\"application\\" to join the settlement includes questions such as: I am a world-class expert in: After the user submitted the application, the site notifies the user that the user is not fit for space, or that the user's application is fine and \\"all you have to do is submit your video\\" [as a response to their video on YouTube]. As a result, an open source Virgle group has been established, OpenVirgle. On the FAQ page, the final question is \\"Okay, come on – seriously. Is this Virgle thing for real?\\" The reply links to a page that tells the user it's an April Fool's joke, and then mentions that the user \\"Dragged us out of our lovely little fantasy world, to crush all our hopes and dreams.\\" * Virgle Application Page – Virgle: The Adventure of Many Lifetimes  Yogurt  Yogurt Google's Orkut displayed its name as yogurt.  YouTube  On April 1, 2008, all featured videos on the UK and Australian homepages, and later, all international homepages, of Google-owned YouTube linked to a video of Rick Astley's song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", causing all users of the website who clicked on featured videos to be Rickrolled. This was the first year YouTube participated in Google's April Fool's Day tradition.  2009   Google runs on Microsoft Windows IIS/3.0  google.com.au reported as if it ran on IIS/3.0 and google.com on Apache/0.8.4 (on Linux).  CADIE  The announcement of CADIE was made on 31 March 2009 11:59 pm by the CADIE Team, not on April 1. The announcement on the Google blog was made at 2009/04/01 12:01:00 am. The introduction page and all of the references to CADIE in Google's Products were taken down on April 2, replaced with a message stating' > We apologize for the recent disruption(s) to our service(s). > > Please stand by while order is being restored. However the technology page describing the technical capabilities of the software remained at: Technical Description When using Google Books or GMail, a user would come across an announcement dated March 31, 2009 at 11:59:59, declaring a new \\"Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity\\". CADIE is also mentioned on the gBall FAQ page: \\"Google's new CADIE technology will interpret the data obtained from each ball to provide useful tips to owners\\". There was also a link on Google's Homepage for CADIE, and a blog entry in Google's official blog. CADIE technology is also used to generate \\"senryu\\" (a type of Japanese poem similar to haiku) based on search terms for certain Japanese queries. The Google Search homepage had a link to the CADIE announcement, stating that \\"For several years now a small research group has been working on some challenging problems in the areas of neural networking, natural language and autonomous problem-solving. Last fall this group achieved a significant breakthrough: a powerful new technique for solving reinforcement learning problems, resulting in the first functional global-scale neuro- evolutionary learning cluster.\\" The page links to the blog below. On mobile devices, a link shows up to Brain Search, which uses CADIE technology to \\"index your brain\\".  Gmail  When one is using the Gmail service, they will notice that it has a new option, named \\"Gmail Autopilot\\" in which the service would analyze an email. On that page it says under the FAQ section,\\"You can adjust tone, typo propensity, and preferred punctuation from the Autopilot tab under Settings.\\" However, if a person logs into their Gmail account and goes under the Settings tab they will notice that there is no Autopilot tab. The program could be customized to contain certain types of grammatical or spelling errors, as well as complexity and length of the sentence. It also has a way of responding to relationship related messages, such as if someone spoke aggressively, even in a humorous way, the system would \\"terminate relationship.\\"  gBall  Google Australia announced the development of a ball that will change how Australian Football is played the world over. The newest football technology—\\"gBall\\" —is a prototype ball for use in the Australian Football League with GPS. Google Australia announced (\\"New! Get the newest football technology – gBall.\\") that they are developing a prototype ball for use in the Australian Football League with GPS. Apparently, the ball will measure the location, force, and torque of a kick, and \\"vibrate if player agents or talent scouts want to speak to you\\". Google claimed that the ball will cost $10 with a cost-per-kick set of payments in addition to the basic fee.  Google Analytics  A blog post to the Google Analytics Blog investigates the analytics reports of CADIEs activities.  Google Maps  Google's CADIE has a recommended places to visit using Google Maps. Viewing \\"CADIE's recommended places for humans\\" one will see each of her suggested places listed, that, when clicked, displays a photo and humorous commentary. There is also a \\"CADIE's recommended places for humans\\" link in Google Maps, which leads to the \\"Panda Mapplet\\" and includes several marked locations with \\"CADIE's\\" commentary. Under Redmond WA a link is listed which will rick roll the viewer.  Blogger  CADIE's personal blog/homepage  Google Chrome with 3D  Screenshot of Wikipedia.org on April 2, 2009 using Chrome \\"3-D\\". Note the red/blue glasses toggle switch at the top of the browser A version of Google Chrome was offered rendering web pages in Anaglyph 3D, \\"powered\\" by CADIE. A 3D effect was actually possible with this browser, but it only made the window appear to be sunken into the monitor. * Introducing Google Chrome with 3D  Google Earth Powered by CADIE  Google announced a new Google Earth powered by CADIE, which claimed to allow the user to see ocean terrain imagery from the world's most advanced submarine, explore the deep sea, soar with CADIE in real time, view CADIE's Recommended Summer Vacation, and chat with CADIE, among other options.  Google Code  The Google Code Search homepage is featuring LOLCODE examples. CADIE is set to write code by itself based on specified features; however all that is returned is bad code or witty criticisms of the user's request and choice of programming language, recommending the use of INTERCAL. CADIE's source code was supposedly uploaded to Google Code, but she changed her mind and replaced it with a \\"fun program\\" consisting of 31 lines of INTERCAL. When executed, this program prints out the message \\"I do not feel like sharing.\\"  Google Book Search  CADIE recommends some books at Google Book Search homepage. Also, when viewing a book, there is a Generate book report button. When clicked it says \\"Gotcha! It's April Fools' Day! Sorry, but you'll have to actually read the book yourself.\\"  Google Docs on Demand  Google has announced new Google Docs features enhanced by CADIE Add subliminal messages and images to documents. If a person makes a new presentation and looks for the subliminal message and image buttons under the insert menu they will notice it is not there.  Google Mobile  Google Mobile has a link to \\"Brain Search\\". The instructions are to \\"Put phone to forehead for brain indexing\\" and \\"Think your query\\". When the user clicks \\"Try Now\\", a page loads with \\"Brain indexing\\" status. When indexing is complete, a button comes up with \\"search me\\". By clicking this button, the user is directed to fake search results. There are several possible results: * What's the name of that woman by the window? She's my boss's boss, but, oh man, is it Suzanne? Susan? Blanche? * Should I order the pizza? I don't remember if it makes me gassy. * Wow, cute guy. Should I go up to him? * Why is everyone looking at me so strangely? * When is Mom's birthday? I should send her a card.  Google Knol  Knol was updated so that all of the featured articles were about Artificial Intelligence, with a message from CADIE indicating that this \\"improvement\\" was for the good of mankind.  HTTP Headers  In keeping with the CADIE theme Google has altered the server HTTP header to contain the name of various AI entities, including HAL 9000, WOPR, and GLaDOS. Other server HTTP headers found were IIS/Bob (a reference to Microsoft Bob), IIS/Clippy (a reference to Clippy), IIS/3.0, Netscape iPlanet, Chrome/3.0, Google Operating System (BETA), CERN/3.0 (a reference to CERN HTTPd), Apple (a reference to Apple II), IRIX, MCP, Apache/0.8.4, Conficker, and Skynet.  Oil Tanker Data Center  During the last minutes of Google's Data Center Efficiency Summit, Urs Hoelzle presented in a \\"special topic\\": Google had bought an oil tanker, the \\"M/S Sergey\\", where Google's data center containers were being submerged in oil tanks to enable extremely high-efficiency cooling. The presentation can be seen in , and includes slightly customized Wikipedia images from the article Oil tanker, including a retouched photo of commercial oil tanker AbQaiq and the oil tankers side view graphic. Even though Google did apply for a US patent to build data centers on cargo ships and oil cooling is an existing technology, summit attendee James Hamilton believed this topic to be an April Fools joke. The ship's name \\"M/S Sergey\\" is also likely to be a pun on Google's co-founder Sergey Brin.  2010   Google and Topeka, Kansas, Switch Places  In early March, the city of Topeka, Kansas, temporarily changed its name to Google in an attempt to capture a spot in Google's new broadband/fiber-optics project. Then, on April 1 (April Fools' Day), Google jokingly announced that it would be changing its name to Topeka, to \\"honor that moving gesture\\" and changed its home page to say Topeka in place of the Google logo.  Google Books available in Anachrome 3D  Google books introduced a feature which allows any book to be read in 3D, assuming the viewer has appropriate glasses. It was enabled by clicking the \\"View in 3D\\" button in the menu bar above the book. This feature was removed after April 1, but on June 29, 2010, Google announced its restoration. Google also released the latest form of 3D glasses, similar to the pairs one would use today when seeing a film.  Store anything on Google Docs  Google announced that Google Docs will have the capacity to upload anything, including physical objects like keys, remote controls, etc. The site declared that one could use this to find items like keys using CTRL-F and send objects around the globe by \\"uploading\\" and \\"downloading\\" them, at the low price of $0.10 per kg.  Search results generated in different units  Google's search results page displayed the time taken to load the results in different units from seconds. Several of these are pop culture references, as with 1.21 gigawatts, while others refer to slang: * at warp X.XX * 0.XX centibeats * 0.XX centons * X.XXe-15 * 0.0X femtogalactic years * 1.21 gigawatts * X.XX hertz * XX.XX jiffies * 0.XX microfortnights * 0.XX microweeks * 0.XX nanocenturies * 11.90 parsecs * 0.XXe+43 Planck times * 23.00 skidoo * 2.00 shakes of a lamb's tail * 0.XX times the velocity of an unladen female swallow * dhaka time  YouTube ASCII video filter  The logo of YouTube was overlaid with ASCII text repeating the character \\"1\\". The YouTube logo was a reference to some videos having a new quality setting, namely \\"TEXTp\\". According to a notice underneath the videos, viewing the video with this quality setting enabled allowed YouTube to save one US dollar ($1) per second on bandwidth costs. The notice also remarked on the source of this new \\"feature,\\" wishing the reader a happy April Fool's Day. However, in accordance with the announcement, the video quality on many videos was indeed able to be set to 'TEXTp' and video output was rendered through an ASCII filter. This feature was removed on April 2, 2010.  Animal Translator BETA  Google placed a link on the main page, advertising a new Google Animal Translator service to add to their Language Translator service. Clicking the link would take the user to a page advertising an app for Android phones for the translator, with the tagline being \\"Bridging the gap between animals and humans\\". * Google Translate for Animals Once the app is installed on an Android phone, it provides some amusing translations depending on the animal selected.  Standard Voicemail Mode for Google voice  Google placed a New! Standard Voicemail Mode link in the Google Voice main page.  Evil Bit  Google added an \\"evil bit\\" to their AJAX APIs, to aid in generating an appropriate response to nefarious deeds. If an evildoer is \\"detected\\", the code returns with, among other things, \\"For Great Justice\\", a quotation from the video game Zero Wing. Conversely, setting the evil bit to 'false' will return the Google Search results for 'April Fools' encoded in JSON.  Wave Wave Notifications  Google Wave can be set to have a human being waved at by the user to notify the user of a change to a Google Wave. The user can also select the volume of the human notifier from a list of silent, medium, loud and vibrate. They can also select which human notifier they want, including Ashton Kutcher, Dr. Wave, Grandma, Werner Heisenberg, and Puppy. Clicking on any of the links on the new notifications page redirected the user to a Google help page, alerting them that it was an April Fools' joke, but also that email notifications are possible.  Google Annotations Gallery  The Google Annotations Gallery (\\"GAG\\") is an exciting new Java open source library that provides a rich set of annotations for developers to express themselves.  Disemvoweling on Gmail  The English-language home page of Gmail, including its logo, was disemvowelled. A post on the Gmail blog was created to address the issue, claiming that they had encountered a server error which firstly made the data centers fail to render the vowel 'a' before failing to render the vowels, and were working on the problem. They also claimed to be investigating whether the letter 'y' was impacted.  Chrome Sounds (Google Chrome Extension)  Google created a new extension, Chrome Sounds, after \\"months deep in psychoacoustic models, the Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon sampling theorem, Franssen effects, Shepard-Risset Tones, and 11.1 surround sound research\\". The extension provides audio for actions performed within the Google Chrome web browser. For a few interesting sounds, try going to different countries' localized Google pages. The full list of sounds that this extension makes can be found by going to the Chrome Tools menu, choosing Extensions, turning on developer mode, and viewing the source of the extension.  Google Analytics Goes Back to Hits  Google decided that hits really is the only metric for tracking web site usage.  Life sized Picasa  Google offered an option which allows the user to print life-size cardboard cutouts of all of their photos.  ReaderAdvantage Program  Google announced a reward program for Google Reader, known as ReaderAdvantage, in which they would assign points to users depending on the number of items read on Google Reader. The rewards were different badges.  Wingdings in AdSense  Wingdings was announced as a new font option for AdSense users.  2011   YouTube  A button was added to the video player which, when clicked, would apply a video filter to the video and replace the audio with a recording of Rhapsody Rag, a piece typically played as background music to silent movies in 1911. If subtitles are enabled when watching the video, intertitles will be displayed containing the dialogue. The upload page also featured an option to \\"send a horse-drawn carriage to me to pick [the video] up\\". In addition, a few videos were made parodying several viral videos, such as the \\"Flugelhorn Feline\\".  Gmail Motion  A body gesture oriented way to send and view mail through Gmail. In the \\"How it Works\\" Section it reads \\"Gmail Motion uses your computer's built-in webcam and Google's patented spatial tracking technology to detect your movements and translate them into meaningful characters and commands.

President of Israel wanted to see the Israeli flag raised and hear their national anthem. It was like a sign from above when the president told to Michael Kozlowski this. Soon after arriving in Israel, Michael Kozlowski started training street kids in the “Basmat” school playground, because there were no boxing gyms in Haifa. Because of the warm climate, Kozlowski could train his boxers all year outside. It took three months to find the money to buy a heavy bag. Michael Kozlowski hung this boxing bag on his balcony and students had to line up to hit the heavy bag. Yuri Foreman was first student of Israeli new boxing trainer Michael Kozlowski.

The Head coach of Kazakhstan team, David Kostoev, said to Michael, that the USA Team is a \\"lucky draw\\" and they need to worry more about Cubans and Russians. This is when trainer Michael Kozlowski decided to come to America. In this tournament, Michael Kozlowski's student Yuri Foreman beat Kazakhstan in his first bout, Denmark in the second bout, and lost a very close decision to Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 5 June 2018, and for Nintendo Switch on 29 October 2019. The plot relates how Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has turned into a vampire, is torn between the Hippocratic Oath and his newfound bloodthirsty nature. While some boss battles are mandatory, most combat can be avoided, and the player is under no obligation to kill innocents to finish the game. Dialogue options are used for conversation and hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and levels up the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. Set during the era of the Spanish flu, London serves as a fictionalised semi-open world composed of four districts, amenable to destruction based on the player's actions. The developers researched the setting by travelling to London and consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. Olivier Deriviere composed the original score and infused it with industrial music. The game was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the primary game mechanic, setting, character development, and voice acting, but criticised the combat, overall narrative, technical problems, aspects of the choice-based system, and animations. The game surpassed one million copies sold within ten months. Gameplay Vampyr is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. The player controls Jonathan E. Reid, a doctor who was made into a vampire, and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must study and change his targets' habits, collect clues, and maintain relationships with the sixty citizens under his care in London, which serves as a fictionalised semi-open world built around hubs of neighbourhoods tethered to other areas. A skill tree facilitates the improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by experience points gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation. Feeding on human blood provides nourishment in addition to unlocking new vampiric powers. Abilities can be manually activated and passively upgraded. Active skills afford defensive, aggressive, healing, and tactical measures; passive skills increase health, stamina, the blood gauge and absorption, bite damage and regeneration, and carry capacity. It is possible to finish the game without killing citizens, which best preserves Reid's cover as a doctor, but leaves him nearly incapable of levelling up. Killing no one unlocks one of four endings. He can turn people into vampires, and is only able to enter a house with an invitation. Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships, and routines. If killed, they impart their last thought. The \\"Mesmerise\\" ability controls the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing information, or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without combat. With crafted medicine, Reid can heal the injured and sick, whom if eaten, will yield more experience points as a result; the rate of their affliction can be viewed using vampire senses, which also detect blood. Each of the four districts has a score based on the average health of its citizens. Reid navigates London using a waypoint, and collectible documents are scattered around the city. Reid engages in combat with his enemies, using supernatural abilities. Reid can wield improvised melee weapons, such as a saw, as well as ranged weapons including the Webley Revolver. Being able to use three-hit combos, dodge rolls, and parrying, he can fight against other vampires like him—aristocrats who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod—a stronger breed of vampire resembling werewolves; Nemrod—vampires who hunt their own kind; and the Guard of Priwen—a secret society of vampire slayers. Boss fights are featured, and in some cases mandatory. Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod. Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength. With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears, throw mist bombs, and turn invisible. He uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents. He can use \\"Spring\\" to scale locations and charge rapidly across gaps, which is also useful for avoiding combat. Plot Doctor Jonathan Reid, returning to London from the Great War in 1918, awakes in a mass grave as a vampire. Overwhelmed with bloodlust, he causes the death of his sister Mary, who was searching for his body nearby. Reid takes shelter from vampire hunters in an abandoned house and starts hearing the disembodied voice of his maker, a typical feature in the progeny of vampires. Realising London is profuse with corpses, he follows a blood trail to a bar. The bartender points Reid to William Bishop, a suspicious patron. Bishop is caught feeding on a man named Sean Hampton and is killed by the vampire Lady Ashbury. Doctor Edgar Swansea rescues Hampton and hires Reid to practice medicine at Pembroke Hospital. After the room of patient Harriet Jones is found covered in blood and Hampton disappears, Reid tracks him down for questioning. Hampton insists he did not murder Jones and directs him to an underground haven for corrupted vampires known as Skals, where it is revealed that Jones faked her death. Reid later discovers a corpse in the street bearing his mother's brooch. He pursues the perpetrator towards the cemetery in Whitechapel and finds his sister Mary with their mother Emelyne, realising Mary was turned into a vampire the night he fed on her. Mary is intent on killing him to rid herself of his voice, but dies trying. Reid vows to uncover what is behind the Skal epidemic, which he learns has been mistaken for the Spanish flu. Lady Ashbury invites Reid to the West End on behalf of the Ascalon Club, a secret society of highborn vampires. By the order of its leader Lord Redgrave, Reid roots out the source of Skals in the district. Swansea is later kidnapped and, once located, admits to attempting to heal Jones with Lady Ashbury's blood, thereby creating the Skal epidemic; once Ashbury finds out, she flees in shame. It is made known that the entity Myrddin, claimant to the role of Jonathan's maker, sired him to defeat his mother Morrigan, also known as the \\"Red Queen\\", after she possessed Jones to wreak havoc upon London. Reid defeats Morrigan in battle, resolving then to travel after Lady Ashbury to her family castle, where she hid with her maker William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Development Development began with a team of sixty people, later expanded to around eighty, many of whom worked on Dontnod Entertainment's previous project Life Is Strange. For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in 1950s America, but after narrative director Stéphane Beauverger joined the project, it was discarded to inspire a more gothic mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of Phil Hale influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere. Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs, but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning Whitechapel, the London Docks, and the Isle of Dogs were also consulted. The literary sources Liquid History: The Thames Through Time and The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens provided geographical and anthropological insight, respectively, while the television series Casualty 1900s and The Knick were turned to for medical information. Anthony Howell was hired to voice Jonathan Reid. The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers. Dontnod decided on the British accent, though the marketing department wanted more. The period was studied using both factual and fictional reference points to create the visuals, realised with photorealistic lighting, and post-processes running on the Unreal Engine 4. Motion capture was used to track character movement. In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the Xbox One version had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages. The game has one save slot, a decision Dontnod made for in-game choices to have \\"real, meaningful impact\\"; to avoid corrupted saves, they implemented backup systems. Adhering to either Reid's Hippocratic Oath or vampiric nature intends to explore the dualism of his survival as both a doctor and vampire. Olivier Deriviere served as the composer throughout development, infusing the score with industrial music to portray the solitude and inner struggle of the main character. Eric-Maria Couturier played the cello, whose sounds were intended to go from \\"emotional\\" to \\"bestial\\". The bass flute, piano, double bass, and cimbalom (chosen for how it reflected that period in London) were also employed, each characterising an aspect of the story. Deriviere saw the choir as representing an oppressive influence on the main character, and thought its combination with industrial music was effective given the amount of post- processing. The soundtrack was released on 3 May 2018 on Bandcamp, and launched on all digital platforms the day the game came out. Vampyr was released to manufacturing in May 2018. Release After a technical issue delayed it from its original November 2017 launch date, Vampyr was rescheduled for Q1/Q2 2018. The final episode of a making-of video series revealed that it would be released on 5 June (for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One). Those who pre-ordered the game gained access to bonus downloadable content called \\"The Hunters Heirlooms\\", which contained exclusive in-game cosmetics. If pre- ordered through select retailers in Europe and Australia, a phonograph record of the soundtrack was included. In May 2018, Dontnod confirmed that Vampyr would not be using Denuvo Anti-Tamper, a technology criticised for damaging computer performance. A launch trailer came out the following month, leading up to the release. Two new difficulties, Story and Hard mode, launched on 26 September 2018. Vampyr was added to Xbox Game Pass, a subscription-based service for Xbox One games, on 28 March 2019. A Nintendo Switch version developed by Saber Interactive was released on 29 October 2019. Reception Vampyr received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoids Kevin Mersereau enjoyed the dialogue conversations, atmosphere, and character development. Emma Schaefer of EGM declared Reid's dualism between doctor and vampire the title's greatest strength, while also praising the character development for imbuing \\"even the lowest beggar\\" with some importance. Matt Utley at Game Revolution enjoyed the atmosphere, each district's distinct look, and aspects of the combat. Writing for GameSpot, Justin Clark was impressed with the effect of decisions and how this tied into the core gameplay, calling it \\"empowering\\". He also commended the \\"enthralling\\" characterisations, \\"exquisite\\" setting, and \\"captivating\\" voice acting. GamesRadar+s Leon Hurley, like Schaefer, found the mechanic of testing Reid's morality compelling, calling the characters well-realised and integral. Also approved of was the \\"atmospheric victorian London setting\\". Brandin Tyrrel, writing for IGN, termed Vampyr \\"a fresh and genuine take\\" on vampire mythology. He was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said the recreation of London as a \\"gloomy, somber city\\" was bolstered by authentic characters, whose writing and performances he also enjoyed. Tyrrel welcomed the story and enjoyed the citizen mechanics, something Andy Kelly at PC Gamer also appreciated, hoping that more video games would follow suit. He called the dialogue-driven storytelling \\"compelling\\" and the setting \\"atmospheric\\". Alice Bell of VideoGamer.com wrote, \\"Vampyr serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent, morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you, all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy London\\". Conversely, Mersereau scolded the overall narrative for its \\"threadbare\\" contribution. He called the combat \\"a low-grade Witcher knockoff\\", complaining about its lack of precision and \\"sloppy\\" mechanics. Lengthy loading screens and constant hangs were also cited as a source of annoyance. Schaefer lambasted the animations for being \\"a little wonky\\" and the unpolished nature of the game. To Utley, Vampyr failed to impress, in particular its character development and impact of choice. He also had technical problems (low resolution, \\"choppy\\" performance, and lengthy loading times). Already frustrated with the combat, Clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens worsened the experience. He found that the narrative became weaker in the final chapters. Hurley viewed the combat as \\"functional at best\\"; \\"solid if uninventive\\", and chastised how small decisions led to big mistakes, which he felt forfeited responsibility for one's actions. Tyrrel cited lip syncing as a primary concern of the animation, criticised the lack of variety in combat, and experienced the same technical difficulties as Mersereau, Utley, and Clark, albeit noting that they amounted to minor annoyances. Kelly disliked the \\"dull, repetitive\\" combat sequences and, despite noting a variety of fighting styles, saw this ultimately as a \\"tiresome\\" distraction. Agreeing with many others on the combat, Bell described it as continuously turning \\"sour\\". Sales and accolades Focus Home Interactive stated that Vampyr would be considered successful if it sold one million copies, although half would turn a profit. It debuted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as the best-selling video game across all formats, reaching second place on the Italian chart (behind FIFA 18). Vampyr sold 450,000 copies after one month of release, contributing to an increase of over twenty percent of its publisher's revenue for the first quarter of 2018. That October, the publisher cited Vampyr as a key factor in its second quarter's €44.3 million revenue. By April 2019, Vampyr had sold one million copies; these sales contributed to a 22.1% rise in revenue for Dontnod, equivalent to a increase from the previous fiscal year. At E3 2017, Vampyr received one of GamesRadar+'s Best of E3 awards and was nominated for GamesBeat's Unreal Underdog award and Game Critics Awards' Best RPG award. It was later nominated for the Best Console Game, Best Screenplay, and Best Soundtrack awards at the 2018 Ping Awards, and for \\"Best Role-Playing Game\\" at the Titanium Awards, and won the \\"Game, Original Role Playing\\" award at the NAVGTR Awards, whereas its other nominations were for the \\"Original Dramatic Score, New IP\\" and \\"Use of Sound, New IP\\" awards. Television adaptation In August 2018, it was announced that the television production company Fox 21 Television Studios had optioned Vampyr as a series, with Wonderland Sound and Vision and DJ2 Entertainment also attached to the project. McG, founder of Wonderland Sound and Vision, is set to direct and will serve as executive producer with Mary Viola, Corey Marsh, Dmitri Johnson, Stephan Bugaj.

Liouvillian functions can be recursively defined as integrals of other Liouvillian functions. More explicitly, it is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations , exponentials, constants, solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of nth roots), and antiderivatives. The logarithm function does not need to be explicitly included since it is the integral of 1/x. It follows directly from the definition that the set of Liouvillian functions is closed under arithmetic operations, composition, and integration. It is also closed under differentiation. It is not closed under limits and infinite sums. Liouvillian functions were introduced by Joseph Liouville in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841. Examples All elementary functions are Liouvillian. Examples of well-known functions which are Liouvillian but not elementary are the nonelementary integrals, for example: * The error function, mathrm{erf}(x)=frac{2}{sqrt{pi}}int_0^x e^{-t^2},dt, * The exponential (Ei), logarithmic (Li or li) and Fresnel (S and C) integrals. All Liouvillian functions are solutions of algebraic differential equations, but not conversely. Examples of functions which are solutions of algebraic differential equations but not Liouvillian include:L. Chan, E.S. Cheb-Terrab, \\"Non-liouvillian solutions for second order Linear ODEs\\", Proceedings of the 2004 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation (ISSAC '04), 2004, pp. 80–86 * the Bessel functions (except special cases); * the hypergeometric functions (except special cases). Examples of functions which are not solutions of algebraic differential equations and thus not Liouvillian include all transcendentally transcendental functions, such as: * the gamma function; * the zeta function.

It is the fifth novel in his series of a crime solver and sports agent named Myron Bolitar. Plot summary One False Move is a novel detailing a period of time in the life of Myron Bolitar, sports agent, and a long standing secret in his hometown. Myron meets with Norm Zuckerman the CEO of Zoom sports manufacturing company about his star player, Brenda Slaughter. Norm is concerned about threats that Brenda has been receiving and wants Myron to protect her, as well as find out from where the threats are coming. Though Myron is at first unwilling, the fact that Slaughter has no agent sways him to agree with Norm. Myron is intrigued by Brenda, and agrees to help her, not only to have the chance to become her agent, but because he realizes that they have a tie from years past. Brenda's father Horace is missing, and she wants to find him. Myron had known Horace years ago and had considered him a friend. Horace had coached Myron in his own basketball career, the two losing touch after Myron's career had been tragically ended. Working with Brenda to find her father and mother, Myron realizes that he is falling in love with her, causing him to question his long term relationship with Jessica, his live-in lover. For years Myron had been trying to hold together a relationship that might not have been what either party wanted. The easy peace he finds when he is with Brenda is surprising for Myron. The investigation leads Myron and Brenda to one of the most powerful families in New Jersey, and a relationship between her mother and Arthur Bradford that had been kept secret for twenty years. Brenda had always believed that her mother had left her when she was a young girl, but Myron begins to follow leads that might lead in a different direction. While trying to unravel the mystery of Elizabeth Bradford's death and Anita Slaughter's connection to the family, the pair also run into problems with the mafia, trying to persuade Brenda to leave the basketball league she is a part of and sign with their agency and the league they will operate in the future. Twists and turns pop up at every turn, leading Myron and Brenda through the past to find the truth in the present. The truth is revealed in the end, too late for Brenda. Mabel Edwards, Brenda's aunt had killed her mother for the money Anita had saved to make her new start. Mabel killed Horace when he began to search for his wife again. Brenda's death was yet another cover-up, simply to keep the truth from being revealed. Mabel was unaware that Arthur Bradford was also still looking for Anita, his lover from so long ago. Bradford had been in love with Anita, and was in reality, Brenda's father. Myron tells Arthur Bradford the truth about Anita's disappearance and Brenda's death, leaving the powerful man to deal with Edwards. Bradford does, having Mabel killed, finally paying for the pain she had caused so many. In the end, Myron does not return to Jessica, preferring the memories of the short time he shared with Brenda to the turmoil and uncertainty that he had experienced in the past.

Then he was assigned to the security detail for a papal event where more than one million people were waiting to see the pope: \\"As the morning wore on and people were singing, I began thinking these people have something that I need to have.

Prior to the consecration, diocesan First Nations Elders performed a traditional smudge ceremony. Twenty Anglican bishops participated in the consecration service, including the Primate of the Anglican Church, Archbishop Fred Hiltz. The service was also attended by four of Hardwick's predecessors as Bishop of Qu'Appelle (Michael Peers, Eric Bays, Duncan Wallace, and Greg Kerr-Wilson), the first time in the history of the Anglican Church of Canada that so many former bishops had attended a consecration of their successor in the see. Archbishop David Ashdown, Metropolitan of the Province of Rupert's Land, led the consecration. Bishop Jonathan Frost of Southampton, England, a friend of Hardwick from England, preached the sermon. The two had been ordained together as deacons in 1993.Joanne Shurvin-Martin, \\"Rob Hardwick ordained as bishop,\\" Saskatchewan Anglican, April 2013, pp. 1, 5 Because of the size of the event, and the fact that the diocesan cathedral, St Paul's, was undergoing major construction, the service of consecration was held in a local Roman Catholic church, Holy Trinity.

Goals as Bishop Upon his election, Hardwick confirmed that his goals included moving forward with the Mission Action Plan, particularly developing children and youth ministries and urban and reserve First Nations ministries; improving communication strategies; equipping the faithful for ministry, including parishes which did not have a parish priest; and developing a sustainable financial plan. He noted that when he moved to Canada in 2001, he had been warned that the diocese was on the verge of bankruptcy, but was now in much better shape. In an interview after his election, he was asked what he would bring to the episcopacy. He described himself as a “missioner, an innovator, an encourager of collaborative ministry, a prayerful team player and a man passionate about Christian stewardship.” He added that others have said he is a good pastor, a good listener, a good preacher and someone who is unflappable and has a sense of humour.

Holland contacted Fred Wilmington, whose company supplied vehicles to the BBC; he purchased the van and restored it to full working order. Later Paul Joel, a designer working on Dad's Army, spotted the van among Wilmington's stock of vehicles and obtained it for use in the series. The van was repainted and had \\"J. Jones Family Butcher\\" sign- painted on its side panels. The van still has its original engine from 1935. Screen appearances The Ford Model AA used in the 1971 film Jones's van made its screen debut in Dad's Army on 11 September 1969 in the episode The Armoured Might of Lance Corporal Jones, the first in the series to be made in colour (the episode \\"Branded\\" was the first to be transmitted in colour). The van continued to make regular appearances until the series ended in 1977. In 1979 the original van was seen in Dick Barton - Special Agent with the distinctive side panels covered and the van filmed through a green filter to further disguise it. A different van was used for the 1971 Dad's Army film, namely a closed cab Ford Model AA with a box roof added so that the platoon could stand inside it. This is on show at the Bressingham Steam and Gardens exhibition. The original van was used again in the 2016 Dad's Army film. Move to Thetford When Dad's Army ended in 1977 the original Ford BB van was sold to a Ford Dealer in Finchley and then sold again in 1991 to the Patrick Motor Museum in Birmingham for a hammer price of £11,200. 'Dad's Army butcher van goes on sale' - Daily Telegraph 20 September 2012 In 2012 the van was auctioned by Bonhams, when it was sold to the Dad's Army Museum in Thetford for £63,100 including the premium.'Dad’s Army van is delivered to Thetford' - Eastern Daily Press - 13 December 2012Jones' van on the Dad's Army Museum website The van went on display at the Charles Burrell Museum in early 2013 after a period of cosmetic restoration.'Dad's Army: L/Cpl Jones' butcher's van restored' - BBC News website - 30 March 2013 'Visitors can “have a butchers” at Jones’s Dad’s Army van' - Norwich Evening News - 3 April 2013 The van's engine underwent a full rebuild by a local firm of engineers ready to run for the 2017 museum season. On 11 November 2017 the van and volunteers from the Dad's Army Museum took part in the Lord Mayor's Show. Merchandise Various toy versions of Jones's van were commercially available, including one made as part of a series of Dad's Army and wartime vehicles by the BBC,The toy Jones's van on the Brighton Toy and Model Museum website while Corgi released 1:50 scale models of a Thornycroft van as Jones butcher's van and a Bedford 0 Series as that belonging to Hodges.

In 1961, Johnny Horton also had a hit with the song, and many others have covered it. The song was published and first recorded by singer-songwriter Leon Payne in 1948, but its lyrics may have been written by Paul Gilley, a ghost writer from Kentucky. Background Leon Payne wrote hundreds of country songs in a prolific career that lasted from 1941 until his death in 1969. He is perhaps best known for his hits \\"I Love You Because\\", \\"You've Still Got a Place in My Heart,\\" and for the two songs Williams recorded: \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"They'll Never Take Her Love from Me.\\" Paul Gilley was a young ghost writer from Kentucky who penned a dozen popular songs without receiving credit. Music journalist Chet Flippo published a book in 1981 saying that Williams bought at least two songs from Gilley: \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" and \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". Kentucky historian W. Lynn Nickell wrote in 2012 that Gilley was also responsible for the lyrics to \\"They'll Never Take Her Love from Me\\". Before the song ever appeared in public, Gilley gave the handwritten lyric sheet to a neighbor girl, telling her the song would soon be playing on the radio, and that this was proof he had written it. Williams cut the song on June 14, 1950, at Castle Studio in Nashville, with Fred Rose producing and backing from Sammy Pruett (lead guitar), Jack Shook or Rusty Gabbard (rhythm guitar), Don Helms (steel guitar), Jerry Rivers (fiddle), and Ernie Newton (bass). The song was released as the flipside to Williams' own \\"Why Should We Try Anymore,\\" but Payne's song outperformed the A-side, peaking at number 5, while \\"Why Should We Try Anymore\\" rose to number 9. As Williams biographer Colin Escott observes, \\"The message was clear: the public wanted brisk, up-temp juke joint songs. History might decide that Hank Williams was the finest writer and singer of 'heart' songs in all country music, but that wasn't what radio and jukebox audiences wanted in 1950.\\" Cover versions *Johnny Horton recorded the song, releasing it as the B-side to \\"Sleepy-Eyed John\\". The record debuted on Billboards country and Western chart in April 1961, rising to number 9, and staying on the chart for eight weeks. *George Jones cut the song for his 1962 LP My Favorites of Hank Williams. *Don Gibson covered the song. *Mac Wiseman included the song on his 1976 album Country Music Memories. *Mel McDaniel covered the song on his 1978 album Mello. *Elvis Costello recorded the song during sessions that became his 1986 album King of America.

She was the first woman to serve in a Ministerial capacity and the First woman Deputy to serve in the National Assembly of Nicaragua. She was an ardent feminist, attending feminist conferences, forming a feminine wing of the liberal party, and running for office on a feminist platform. Biography Olga Núñez Abaunza was born on 22 March 1920 in Masaya, Nicaragua to Arturo Núñez Arteaga and Filomena Abaunza Zúñiga. She went to primary school at the Colegio de Señoritas de Masaya, where she ran the school newspaper. To obtain a secondary education, she began at the all-boys' school, Instituto de Varones de Masaya and concluded her studies at Instituto Nacional Central Ramírez Goyena in Managua. The school was considered the best in the country at that time and she finished in 1938 with high marks. Though attempts were made to dissuade her from studying law, Núñez enrolled at the Central University of Nicaragua. In 1945, she graduated as the first female attorney from Nicaragua, and first notary; the first male lawyer, Miguel de Larreynaga, graduated in 1801. Her thesis was “La posición de la mujer en la Constitución y el Derecho Penal de Nicaragua”. (The position of women in the constitution and criminal laws of Nicaragua). That year, she won the national literature prize Premio Nacional de Literatura Rubén Darío for her unpublished novel Renunciation. She went on to at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University with a focus on international human rights and completed a Master's at the American University of Washington College of Law. While she was studying, Núñez was also attending feminist conferences. In 1945, she attended the Chapultepec Conference (the fore-runner to Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance) and served as a delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women (known now as CIM). In 1947, she attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, Guatemala, as the representative of CIM. In 1950, she was named vice-minister of education, the first woman to ever hold the post. She held that post until 1956, when she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. In 1955, she had founded the Ala Femenina Liberal (Women's Liberal Wing) of Somozas’ Nationalist Liberal Party and ran on a feminist platform. In 1957, Núñez and the two alternates also elected—Mirna Hueck de Matamoros and Mary Coco Maltez de Callejas—were the first women candidates to run for office. Núñez was the first woman deputy to serve in the National Assembly of Nicaragua. During her tenure, she introduced many pieces of international legislation and also legislation for various municipalities. In one case, she was able to resolve a long-running dispute between two towns in the Estelí Department, by helping La Trinidad obtain its designation as a city in 1962. She served until her early death in 1971. Private life In 1953, she married fellow attorney, Efrén Saballos and had four daughters.

This was one of the earliest films to depict medical exploitation of cloning, even though the term was not used. It was shot on videotape and transferred to film for theatrical and TV release. Gold Key Entertainment commissioned this film at the same time as it commissioned the film The Day of the Wolves, and tried to persuade Ferde Grofe to film that on video because of the cost savings, but he declined. Plot Reporter Harry Walsh (Nielsen) witnesses an auto accident in which two people are killed. Recognizing the survivor as Senator Clayton Zachary Wheeler, (Dillman) he rides with him in the ambulance. After he reports Wheeler's accident from the hospital, the staff tells him there is no such person admitted. Walsh's editor orders him to retract his story, which he refuses to do, at the cost of his job. Some detective work leads him to Alamogordo, New Mexico. Meanwhile, Wheeler wakes up in a secret hospital run by Dr. Redding (Daly) and Dr. Layle Johnson (Dickinson). He finds out he is the recipient of an incredible transplant, utilizing organs harvested from \\"somas\\". These somas are bodies artificially grown from his own DNA. Walsh has to elude two less-than-brilliant agents on his way to Alamogordo, finally escaping them, traveling with some migrant workers. Wheeler learns that the \\"fee\\" for his surgery is to do whatever he can do as Senator, for the Committee—a form of medical blackmail. Fielding, (Wilke) the Committee chairman, refers to it as \\"a new type of money.\\" Wheeler refuses to cooperate and threatens to turn the whole operation in. Fielding warns him he will never win a presidential nomination if news of his heart transplant gets out. In Alamogordo, Walsh deduces that Wheeler's plane must have gone to Los Alamos, site of the old Manhattan Project. With the help of a newspaper buddy, he lands at the base and discovers an extra soma of Wheeler. Thinking it to be the senator, he breaks it out and commandeers Dr. Johnson's car. The car wrecks when Walsh swerves to avoid hitting several somas wandering around. Johnson is injured, and Fielding tries to use the situation to change Wheeler's position, threatening not to save her. As Wheeler has grown fond of her, his resolve is weakening, but Redding assures him she is not badly injured. Walsh and Wheeler finally meet, and agree to expose the Committee together, even as Fielding and Redding discuss a new \\"client\\" they have been hoping for. Cast * Leslie Nielsen ...

At the time he was production coordinator on the TV series The Big Valley. Rolf told his friend Jay Simms, a writer on the series, about his idea. Together they wrote the film in about three weeks. They gave the script to Simms' agent, who liked it. Rolf felt that despite the low budget, the film was ahead of its time, and was pleased with it. Rolf was normally an editor and this film was his only writing credit. The name used for the clones, soma, is Greek for \\"body\\".Soma at Dictionary.com They share the name with the hallucinogenic drug used by the urbanites in Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel, Brave New World.Brave New World Aldous Huxley, 1932 page 54. The film is noted as possibly the earliest to depict surgical transplants using clones for parts. According to Variety, this was the first American film to be shot on videotape and transferred to film for release. Actually, there had been others, such as T.A.M.I. Show, before it.

Clark PUD provides electric service to all of Clark County except for the Georgia-Pacific Camas Paper Mill in the City of Camas, and its water service area covers the majority of the county, except the Cities of Battle Ground, Camas, Ridgefield, Washougal, and Vancouver, which have their own municipal water systems. Organization After previous attempts in 1934 and again in 1936 failed, Clark PUD was formed by referendum in 1938, when the citizens of Clark County approved a proposal to create a municipal nonprofit organization to provide electric service to the County under the laws of the State of Washington. At the time, Clark County's electric service was being provided by two private utility companies, Portland General Electric (PGE) served the Vancouver area, and the Northwest Electric Company (NEC) served the remainder of rural Clark County. Both companies had waged vigorous campaigns to defeat the measure, and did not readily withdraw from the County even after the measure was approved. As a public entity, Clark PUD was to be led by a three-member county commission charged with overseeing the utility. Clark PUD's first commissioners were elected simultaneously to the creation of the district, they were Heye H. Meyer, L. M. Jones, and Adolf Ast. Clark PUD is overseen by the Board of Commissioners, who hire and supervise a General Manager, set policy, approve budgets, establish rates, and approve major expenses. The General Manager oversees day-to-day operations of the District. Current members of the Board of Commissioners * Nancy Barnes * Jim Malinowski * Jane Van Dyke History timeline *1938: Public Utility District No. 1 of Clark County was formed following a vote of the citizens of Clark County. *1939: Clark PUD entered into negotiations with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to secure access to electric power supplies. *1940: Clark PUD submitted offers to buy out the Clark County assets of PGE and NEC, but both companies refused the offers. *1941: Citizens from the Lincoln Avenue, Minnehaha, and Bryn Lawn neighborhoods asked Clark PUD to provide water service to an area north of the City of Vancouver's water system. A public hearing was scheduled to consider the request, but the process was interrupted by the United States entering World War II. *1942: Amidst the war effort, one of the seven Kaiser Shipyards was built on the north shore of the Columbia River at Ryan Point in Vancouver, to participate in the war effort by producing Liberty ships and Victory ships, and with it came plans to build several war housing projects. The City of Vancouver created a housing authority to operate the projects, and Clark PUD successfully outbid PGE and NEC to serve what would later become the MacLoughlin Heights neighborhood of Vancouver. At 12:00 noon on August 21, the Air Reduction Company (today part of Linde), which was built in Vancouver to serve as an acetylene producer for the new shipyard, became Clark PUD's first customer, receiving electricity purchased and delivered by the new public utility company. Three days later, Clark PUD began service to the new housing projects. The Vancouver Linde plant is still in operation at its original site, at 4715 NE 78th St (Google Street View). *1944: After unproductive negotiations with PGE and NEC, Clark PUD adopted a resolution to acquire the electric transmission and distribution assets in Clark County from both companies through court action. *1945: The Washington Court of Appeals in Tacoma set a purchase price of $801,000 on PGE's assets in Clark County, and Clark PUD floated revenue bonds to finance the purchase. Clark PUD was approached again from residents asking the District to provide water service, this time in the Hazel Dell area north of Vancouver. *1948: The Superior Court of Clark County set a purchase price of $4,837,500 on NEC's assets in Clark County, and Clark PUD subsequently obtained the remainder of privately held electric delivery assets in the County except for the Crown Columbia paper mill in Camas (which was served by NEC via subtransmission lines from Troutdale, Oregon, across the Columbia River). Through obtaining these assets, Clark PUD also began serving a small number of customers in southeast Cowlitz County north of Lake Merwin and west of Yale Lake, and a small handful of customers in southwestern Skamania County east of Washougal. The Camas Mill remains a customer of NEC's successor, PacifiCorp, to the present day, and it is still not electrically connected to Clark PUD. *1951: Clark PUD formally commenced water service with delivery to its first 357 customers in the Hazel Dell neighborhood. *1989: The citizens of the City of La Center voted to establish a municipal wastewater system, to be managed by Clark PUD. *1997: Clark PUD began operation of its own electric generation facility, the 230MW natural gas combined-cycle River Road Generating Plant, located in southwest Vancouver at 5201 NW Old Lower River Rd, to supplement the purchase of energy supplies from BPA. *2006: Ownership of the wastewater treatment plant in La Center was transferred back to the City of La Center, and Clark PUD ceased wastewater management operations. *2007: Public Utility District No. 1 of Cowlitz County (Cowlitz PUD) purchased Clark PUD's assets that were located within Cowlitz County, in anticipation of extending their own distribution system to serve the approximately 50 Cowlitz County customers served by Clark PUD. Cowlitz PUD's extension construction was completed in early 2010, and they successfully established service to that territory on February 17 of that year, ending Clark PUD electric service to Cowlitz County. Clark PUD still serves two customers in Skamania County who have not yet been reached by Public Utility District No. 1 of Skamania County (Skamania PUD). Operations Clark PUD's electric service area is approximately 657 square miles and covers all of Clark County, except for approximately 500 acres in Camas occupied by the Georgia-Pacific Camas Paper Mill. The electric system consists of 55 substations and switching stations, one generating plant, and approximately 6,600 miles of transmission and distribution power lines. Other electric infrastructure assets not owned by Clark PUD remain in Clark County but do not serve any local customers; BPA, headquartered in Clark County, owns and operates three major substations and several transmission lines in the county, and PacifiCorp (successor of NEC) owns and operates two hydroelectric dams along Clark County's northern boundary along with their associated transmission lines. Clark PUD's established water service area is approximately 220 square miles, but the District's responsibility to operate new water systems covers almost all of unincorporated central and northern Clark County except for areas served by the Cities of Battle Ground and Ridgefield. The primary water system and all of the satellite systems combined include 35 wells, 51 booster pump stations, and approximately 788 miles of water mains and distribution lines. The District employs approximately 380 personnel, and serves approximately 194,000 customers. The Vancouver Service Center located at 1200 Fort Vancouver Way () serves as the District's primary administration and business office, and the Orchards Service Center located at 8600 NE 117th Avenue () serves as the District's primary operations center. Approximately 30% of Clark PUD's electricity needs are met through operation of the River Road Generating Plant, with the majority of the remainder met through purchases from BPA. Clark PUD also has a share of the wind power generated from the Combine Hills II Wind Farm in Milton-Freewater, Oregon, as well as a share of the generation from the Packwood Lake Hydroelectricity Project near Packwood, Washington. Clark PUD maintains transmission interties with BPA and PacifiCorp, and distribution interties for emergency distribution service with Cowlitz PUD and Skamania PUD.
