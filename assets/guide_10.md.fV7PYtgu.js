Her portrait hangs in the New Hampshire State House. Early life Dame was born in Barnstead, New Hampshire (or North Barnstead) to James Chadbourne and Phebe Ayers on January 5, 1815. Dame was the youngest of five children. In 1843, Dame moved to Concord, New Hampshire where she lived until the outbreak of the Civil War, and worked at various occupations. By 1861, she ran a student boarding house. She had no formal training as a nurse. Civil War Harriet Patience Dame during the war. When war came, Dame, aged 46, approached the recruit training station at Camp Union in Concord and offered her services to officers there. Because the camp had no infirmary, Dame was put into service as a nurse. Dame served with the 2nd New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry as a matron from June 1861 to Christmas 1865 when the regiment was mustered out of service. She served without furlough through two enlistment periods. Her pay as a hospital matron was six dollars a month until 1863, when the wage increased to ten dollars a month. The regiment was mainly made up of men from Concord and Exeter, led by Col. Gilman Marston. Dame marched and camped alongside the troops, often as the only woman among a thousand men. She was appointed matron of the 18th Army Corps hospital in September 1864. Her duties included supervising other nurses, and cooking for the hospital patients, often numbering in the thousands. Marston said of her: \\"Miss Dame was the bravest woman I ever knew. I have seen her face a cannon battery without flinching while a man took refuge behind her for safety from flying shells. She was always present when most needed.\\" She saw action at first Bull Run, second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg. Dame's tending to the men went beyond medical attention; she would sometimes pick strawberries for the wounded, or write letters home for them. Dame's nursing duties varied as well; sometimes she would oversee supplies, other times she would investigate the sanitary conditions of other regiments. Dame remained at this hospital until the end of active war operations, when she reconvened with the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment. On December 25, 1865, the regiment was mustered out of service, ending Dame's service. She was twice captured in battle, and released by her captors. At the Second Battle of Bull Run, Dame was taken as a prisoner but released because she cared for Union and Confederate soldiers indiscriminately. In once instance, Stonewall Jackson authorized her return to Union lines. Post-war life After the war, Dame was appointed by William E. Chandler to a Treasury Department clerkship in Washington, D.C., which she held for twenty-eight years until 1895. She did not return to her home state until 1900. Congress voted her a military pension in 1884, though Dame always donated the money to those in needed. Dame served as the third president of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War, upon the death of Dorothea Dix and resignation of Dr. Susan Ann Edson. Dame never married. She died in Concord and was buried at Blossom Hill Cemetery. Honors * The cross of the 18th Corps, the diamond of the 3rd Corps of Hooker's Division, the heart of the 12th Corps, and a gold badge from the 2nd New Hampshire * Shortly after the Civil War, the New Hampshire legislature awarded Dame $500 for extraordinary public service. She donated most of the money to the 2nd Regiment, for the founding of a home for veterans. * Upon her death in 1900, Governor Frank W. Rollins and the state militia participated in her funeral ceremony. * In 1901 the New Hampshire Legislature commissioned that her portrait be painted and hung in the New Hampshire State House. It was the first portrait of a woman to hang there. * The Harriet P. Dame Elementary School in Concord was named in her honor. * In 2002, Dame was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the American Nurses Association.

Before becoming a historian, he also wrote fiction. He taught literature to Kim Il-sung for a short time at Yuwen Middle School in Manchuria. In China, he is primarily known for his work on the idea of the sprouts of capitalism: that proto-capitalism and class struggle had existed in the earlier Chinese history. His purge in 1958 foreshadowed the Chinese Cultural Revolution as his ideas on Chinese economic history conflicted with those of Mao Zedong. After his purge he continued to work on history, but stayed out of public until Mao's death in 1976. His work also gave a lasting effect in Korean nationalist historiography. Career Shang enrolled in the English faculty of the Peking University in 1921 and left the institution in 1926 without graduating. In 1928, Shang worked at private Yuwen Middle School as a teacher of literature and Chinese. There he taught literature and aesthetics to the future North Korean leader Kim Il-sung for six months in 1928. At the time, Shang was a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Manchurian branch. Kim credits Shang with having influenced him in his autobiography, With the Century. Kim reminisces Shang introducing him to both Chinese classics, such as Dream of the Red Chamber, and contemporary literature of Lu Xun and Chen Duxiu, as well as Russian literature, including Gorky's The Mother and Enemies. Shang reinforced Kim's views on peasant nationalism, possibly reflecting a shift of policy in the Chinese Communist Party following the second Chinese revolution (1925‚Äì1927). Shang also encouraged Kim to become a proletarian writer, always stressing the social mission of literature. Shang's influence can be seen in the political dramas Kim would author in the 1930s, such as Sea of Blood. Shang lost contact with Kim after he was arrested by the Nationalist Chinese. Shang's daughter later attested that her father had thought of Kim as \\"diligent, putting good questions both inside and outside the class.\\" Until 1939, Shang worked as an editor at a number of radical periodicals. Shang Yue became a professor of Renmin University after 1949. He was one of the historians in Mainland China who contributed to the idea of the sprouts of capitalism, describing features of the economies of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. His work was published in two volumes named Essays on the Debate on the Sprouts of Capitalism in China. His Outline of Chinese History (1954) became a widely used textbook. Shang Yue's theory of capitalism in China gained wide support until at least the Anti-rightist campaign of 1957. Shang's theory contradicted Mao Zedong's idea that indigenous capitalism in China did not exist before, but that it could have eventually developed on its own in China. Shang was purged in 1958. However, even in the early 1960s, an officially approved work by historian Jian Bozan reiterated Shang's arguments. Shang's influence finally waned during the Cultural Revolution, during which he suffered. He continued to write about history but remained out of public until Mao's death in 1976. Shang Yue lived and worked during his career at Jilin, Harbin, Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, Chongqing, Ningxia and Yan'an. According to Kim Il-sung, he was once the Chief Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of Manchuria. Before becoming a historian, he also wrote fiction. He was once famous for his collection of short stories Giant Pirates. It takes place in Xinyang, Shang's hometown. Sprouts of capitalism Shang Yue The core argument of Shang Yue's idea on the sprouts of capitalism is that proto-capitalism existed under late Ming and early Qing China from the 16th to the 17th century, as evidenced from large quantities of factory products that entered metropolitan markets. He thought that large amount of factories implied the existence of proletarian and bourgeois classes, and of a commodity economy. For him, the existence of a bourgeois class was a prerequisite for the formation of the Chinese nation. He argued that the delayed development of Chinese capitalism was caused by both the Mongol and Manchu conquests of China. Shang Yue's work was part of the efforts by Chinese historians to make the formation of Communist China seem like a natural outcome. He saw the Donglin movement as a proletarian struggle in the late Ming China, and, unlike Soviet sinologists, promoted the idea that the Chinese nation had a much more developed history of class struggle than European nations of that time. He gave China a more equal, or even more advanced, historical status compared with European society of the period. However, Mao Zedong argued that China would have developed into a Capitalist society even without foreign imperialist influence. Mao claimed that bourgeois and proletarian classes did not exist before the imperialist powers started to affect China after the Opium war. Mao thought that for China, imperialism was even worse a threat than the bourgeois class. complained that Shang Yue's theory glorified opium trade as a progressive force, and degraded Qing government and its subjects for active resistance. Shang was forced to admit in early 1958 that he had produced revisionist historiography, and was purged later that year. Jungmin Seo argues that reactions to Shang's theory show Chinese historians' fear that greater emphasis on internal proto-capitalism might divert too much attention from foreign capitalism's influence that transformed China into a semi- colonial or semi-feudal status. Chinese economic reform after Mao's death initially renewed the theory of sprouts of capitalism. However, the sprouts of capitalism is currently regarded in Chinese historiography to not have been a distinctive phase of economic development. Both North and South Korean nationalist historians adopted and advanced the theory of sprouts (MR: maenga) of capitalism to downplay Japanese influence on the origins of Korean industrialization. They claimed that industrial development had been halted by annexation of Korea in 1910. Since 1980s the South Korean historians have been largely denying validity of the theory.

His identity became public knowledge in 2012 when he came forward in the newspaper Jyllands-Posten.  Background  Storm grew up with his mother and stepfather in Kors√∏r, a working class coastal town. Early in life his alcoholic father left home, and his step-father beat him. He made friends with Arabs in his apartment complex. In school, Storm was unruly and was eventually sent to a Tvind school, where he befriended a number of criminals. He committed his first robbery at age 13, and went to jail several times for violent behavior. After jail, Storm was expelled from schools multiple times and went to special schools. In his youth, his criminal activities earned him upwards of DKK 10,000 a week. He spent the money on alcohol and drugs. At age 21, he was a trial member of the Bandidos in Kors√∏r during the Great Nordic Biker War. Storm was also a talented soccer player and boxed at a local boxing club.  Involvement with Islamic militants  Storm became a member of the motorcycle gang the Bandidos at an early age. Storm later became interested in Islam after reading a biography of Muhammad, and later converted with a friend at 19. He nevertheless continued his partying lifestyle until his arrest on June 28, 1997. While in custody, he met a Danish Muslim convert named Sulaiman. After his release, Storm moved with Sulaiman to Sulaiman's residence in England to avoid angry former members of the Bandidos. During his time there, Storm began praying five times daily and grew a beard. Storm visited the Regent's Park Mosque in London and was offered a scholarship to study Arabic and Islam at a religious, Salafi school in Yemen. Storm accepted and moved to the religious seminaries in Sanaa and Damaaj in Yemen. His faith moved in a militant direction, and he corresponded with some individuals who were later convicted of terrorism. Storm claimed to have become close with Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. After 9 months in Yemen, Storm returned to London in late 1998. He then moved to Brixton, where he met Zacarias Moussaoui (the \\"wannabe\\" 9/11 hijacker) and \\"Shoe-bomber\\" Richard Reid. He became friends with Omar Bakri Muhammad Fostok, leader of the al- Muhajiroun group. The Guardian reported that while in London, \\"Storm and his associates inhabited a world of overstayed visas, violent online videos, idolized preachers, frustration and alienation.\\". Storm and the Islamic radicals he lived with were amateurish but threatening and connected to a global network of contacts who shared ideology and purpose. In London Storm became friends with Anwar al-Awlaqi, an American-born Yemeni, who at one time was regarded only second to Osama bin Laden in the al-Qaeda network. Storm traveled to Yemen for the second time in 2006. At this time Storm started to doubt the message of radical militancy. He had problems with the incoherence within Islam in free will and predestination. Most importantly Storm had issues with the indiscriminate killing of civilians. In Storm's book, called Agent Storm: My Life Inside al-Qaeda, he wrote: \\"Now I thought of the Twin towers, Bali, Madrid in 2005, London in 2005...If they were part of Allah's preordained plan, I now wanted no part of it. My loss of faith was as frightening as it was sudden.\\"  PET agent  In the past, Storm had been contacted by MI5 and PET (Politiets Efterretningstjeneste, or Danish Security and Intelligence Service), but he had refused their offers of collaboration. However, in 2006, as he became increasingly dissatisfied with militant Islam, Storm contacted the European domestic intelligence agencies. The CIA later got involved as well, in the United States' War on Terror. According to Storm, he left Islam in 2006 and was recruited by PET as an agent, leading a double life until 2011. He further claimed to have initiated contact with PET. While working as an agent, he established front companies which ostensibly organized wilderness trips. These companies allowed him to leave for long periods of time and explain his source of income. During the course of his undercover work, Storm was involved in a mission to track Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen and pass on al-Awlaki‚Äôs whereabouts to the CIA. Storm claims that the plan involved bringing al-Awlaki a wife. According to Storm, a Croatian woman was selected and given a tracking device to carry in her suitcase, which would reveal al-Awlaki‚Äôs residence on her arrival there. Storm‚Äôs story is supported by a text message, supposedly sent by the lead officer at PET, reading ‚ÄúCongratulations brother, you‚Äôve just become rich, very rich‚Äù. The story is additionally supported by a picture Storm took of the $250,000 reward offered for his intel. Danish documentary filmmaker Nagieb Khaja had planned to film a documentary about an Islamist training camp in 2006 with Storm's help. The film was later abandoned. A second documentary fell through in 2009 when Storm left the project. On September 30, 2011, having been located, al-Awlaki was killed by an American drone strike. The significance of Storm‚Äôs intel in finding al-Awlaki is disputed. In August 2012, PET offered Storm DKK 25,000 per month tax-free for five years in return for his silence. In October 2012, Storm came forward in a series of articles published by Jyllands-Posten. When his story became public, PET issued a press release stating that they neither confirmed nor denied Storm‚Äôs story. They wrote, in part: > Normalt udtaler vi os jo ikke om m√•lene for vores operative arbejde. Det > kommer dog n√¶ppe bag p√• nogen, at PET som andre vestlige > efterretningstjenester har haft fokus p√• al-Awlaki, og at PET's operative > indsats i forhold til al-Awlaki har v√¶ret rettet mod at afd√¶kke konkrete > terrortrusler mod Danmark eller danske interesser i udlandet, herunder > eventuel kontakt mellem al-Awlaki og terrorrelaterede personer, grupper > eller netv√¶rk i Danmark.

At a July 2014 political event on Bornholm, Storm participated in a debate arranged by the International Free Press Society.  Personal life  Storm converted to Islam 1997, and married his first wife in 2000. Storm has two children from his first marriage; Osama, born in 2002, and Sarah, born in 2003. Storm and his first wife separated in 2005; he married his second wife in 2006.  Publications  In 2002, he published a Danish translation of the Islamic fundamentalist book The Islamic Creed: Questions and Answers by Muhammad bin Jamil Zeno. In August 2014, Agent Storm: My Life Inside al-Qaeda by Morten Storm with CNN reporters Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank was published by Atlantic Monthly Press.

She placed the master in the circle of Faustino Bocchi, an artist active in Brescia around the same time and known for his genre paintings with dwarfs.Maestro della Fertilit√† dell'Uovo, Grotesque Scene with Animals and Stylised Figures No. 1 at The Ruzhnikov Collection The master‚Äôs oeuvre distinguishes itself from Bocchi‚Äôs more dreamlike work through its biting, satirical edge. Identification The identity of the Master of the Fertility of the Egg has yet to be determined. Some art historians have suggested he was Bernardino Deh√≤ (1675-1717) from Cremona while others have pointed at Angelo Esseradts, known as 'il Fiammingo' (the Fleming), whose name was also Italianised as Everardi. Everardi was Bocchi‚Äôs teacher and introduced the bizarre and grotesque elements of Flemish art to Brescia. Work A grotesque scene with animals playing and a dog wrapped in swaddling clothes The works of this master typically depict grotesque figures (usually dwarfs) and animals engaging in various human activities. The works generally ignore space and are characterized by strong foreshortening. The figures are often portrayed in profile and stand out against the dark, mostly flat backgrounds. This gives them the impression of being cut out. The persons and animals in the compositions engage in disorganised actions and reactions. The compositions are full of absurd and grotesque elements and it is often difficult to make out what exactly is going on.Maestro della Fertilit√† dell'Uovo at Dorotheum The master‚Äôs raucous style appears to constitute some form of 'moral zoology'. The absurd characters are possibly intended to show the madness of the human condition, and the vanity and ridiculousness of life. The paintings usually include a banner with a mysterious saying that purportedly explains the subject of the composition. Of a pair of paintings sold at Sotheby‚Äôs (27‚Äì29 January 2005, New York, lot 369A) one is inscribed Son Capporal Dei Matti Ch osseruo beni patti (I am corporal of the fools that well observes the rules) while the other is inscribed Assai Ben Balla A chi fortuna Suona (He dances well enough who fortune plays for). The Ruzhnikov Collection holds a tryptich by this artist, which depicts a dreamlike world in which the natural order has been overturned. The work contains the artist's trademark assemblage of fantastical figures, each apparently representing a failed attempt to explain the world through astrology or mysticism. For instance, in the first one a pig is identified as an astrologer. The work's intent may have been to satirize the credulousness of people who believe the persons spreading these mystical ideas.

Yab Moung was founded by Myles Hallin (Myley Rattle) and Tom Reichelt in collaboration with several Khmer punk and metal bands, namely: Sliten6ix; The ANTIfate and No Forever. Tom Reichelt left in 2014, after that Timon Siebel & Samphors Un, two long time supporters, became major shareholders with Myley Rattle and began to run the label on the ground as a collective with various Khmer artists. The label has been partially rebranded since 2015 and is currently run and owned collectively by a group of dedicated Khmer alternative musicians with various roles within the organisation. Yab Moung Records has a studio which is located in the Kandal Province, just outside of Phnom Penh, which is also run by a collective of, predominantly Khmer, musicians and artists. About Yab Moung Records is Cambodia‚Äôs first and only alternative music label focusing largely on punk, metal, hardcore and rock music. It was the first organisation to promote Khmer metal, punk and alternative music within Cambodia. YMR is also responsible for the recording and production of the first metal and hard-core tracks ever released in Cambodia and recently has released a music video for the first Death Metal song in Khmer ever released. Yab Moung Records, in partnership with the Phnom Penh's original punk venue Show Box, hosted its official launch concert which included a line up of the original bands that drove the alternative music scene in Cambodia, as well as the showing of Cambodias first all girl punk band, Count Us In,. Yab Moung Records has been pinnacle in hosting and encouraging Khmer contemporary creative expression and organising various alternative music performances throughout Cambodia. According to YMR's social media outlets the label aims to \\"encourage Khmer creative expression and alternative music\\" throughout a variety of forums, primarily using street level advertising, social media and free releases,. YMR is an independently run record label with a collective decision making process. There is a unique alternative music scene existing within contemporary Khmer society, this is particularly apparent in Phnom Penh. The music coming from this movement is unique in South East Asia in terms of its style and drive, which is probably partly resulting from Cambodia's contemporary history, specifically the lack of direct influence within the alternative music and art scenes resulting from the Khmer Rouge Genocide. Despite an emergence of new artists, Khmer alternative music and art in remains relatively marginalised within Khmer society. Yab Moung Records had a hard time to find its place. For years it struggled with survival, with the second generation of bands Doch Chkae and Vartey Ganiva on the label finding it hard to place in Cambodian contemporary society. They constantly faced problems with money. Money for production, money for recordings, money to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the time to practice, money for equipment, promotion, events etc. On top of being based in an environment where people are not used to paying money for original content or shows. The common struggles of an artist, with a label in the back, which was managed by people for the passion and for the vision to support diversity within the Cambodian music market. In 2019, with the breakthrough of Doch Chkae playing Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany, things began to change. The NGO, Moms Against Poverty (MAP) and its Phnom Penh based NGO, MAP Cambodia (MAPC) where Doch Chkae was not only founded and formed into a band but also literarily and creatively nurtured over the years, showed interest to invest. MAP, sharing an understanding for the value of the therapeutic aspect of the arts and how important it is to build a foundation, a stable and secure surrounding for artists, especially in a developing country such as Cambodia. Yab Moung is collectively run, and was initially tied in closely with community run music and art workshops called the CAM Projects, originally started and funded by Show Box and Timon Siebel, now funded by MAP and other community organisations and relies on the work of shareholders, collaborations with musicians and artists and volunteers. Major contributors towards the development of the label pre-2015 have included: Conrad Keely, Ned Kelly, Myley Rattle and Vanntin Hoeurn. Bands/Artists representing Yab Moung Records include or have included: Sliten6ix, ANTI-fate, No Forever, Nightmare AD, Doch Ckae, Count Us In, Pork Belly Tin and Phnom Skor and Vartey Ganiva.,,,, Aims Yab Moung's Mission Statement is to encourage the development alternative Khmer music, to create accessibility and provide a platform for Khmer alternative music, art and creative expression. Name 'Yab Moung' roughly translated means 'pain in the ass' or 'annoying' in Khmer. The name was chosen collectively by Khmer alternative musicians and the labels founders Origins Khmer Music has a rich and unique history peaking in the 1960s before the Khmer Rouge Genocide. In the opening years of the 21st Century original alternative music began to emerge in Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh. At this time Yab Moung was founded by Myles Hallin (aka Myley Rattle) and Tom Reichelt with the support and motivation of several Khmer alternative bands including Sliten6ix, The ANTIfate and No Forever. The catalyst behind the formation of Yab Moung Records was the lack of a Venue in Phnom Penh which was accessible to alternative Khmer artists and musicians and the disparity between the treatment of ex-pat and Khmer artists in terms of conditions and pay. The label aims to encourage the development of a Khmer contemporary music. Yab Moung Records was started at the same time as the establishment of Phnom Penh‚Äôs first cross cultural, Khmer accessible, alternative venue, which was called ‚ÄúShow Box‚Äù It was the partial subject of an independent documentary series called 'Selapak' the first of four parts was released at the 2014 Cambodian Film Festival Show Box Show Box was conceived founded and developed by Myles Hallin aka Myley Rattle as a centre for creative expression and the alternate arts in Cambodia‚Äôs capital Phnom Penh in 2012. According to Myley Rattle it aimed to provide a venue and platform for Khmer creative expression and alternative artists. Show Box as a medium of creative expression was able to help promote and develop alternative Khmer music, visual art, creative writing and spoken word poetry. Through Show Box Myles Hallin and Joshua Page were also able to develop and initiate various community projects which supported the Show Box ethos such as the CAM Projects, which are contemporary arts and music workshops for young Khmer, in cooperation with Cambodian-based artists. Show Box was sold in early 2015 and the new owner topped supporting community development and creative expression workshops and also put an end to the long running CAM Projects in Phnom Penh. Fortunately the CAM Projects were moved out to Kandal Province, where they still continue to encourage orphans through creative expression critical thinking, music and art. Current projects Since 2019 Yab Moung has had increasd access to funds as well as the expertise of MAP to transform Yab Moung Records into a sustainable label. Alongside the label Yab Moung is developing a vocational training programme for media production and the build up of a more youth-oriented record label for the younger generation to gain practical experience. Yab Moung is currently working on several projects/releases with various Khmer alternative artists including: Vanntin \\"Tin\\" Hoeurn, Vartey Ganiva, Phnom Skor and Doch Ckae, References Record labels ","title":"Yab Moung Records"},{"id":"46445672","text":"Willy Skibby (born 20 February 1942) is a Danish former cyclist.

DSM is the only commercial supplier of this resin, which markets under the trade name Stanyl. Nylon 46 is an aliphatic polyamide formed by the polycondensation of two monomers, one containing 4 carbon atoms, 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine), and the other 6 carbon atoms, adipic acid, which give nylon 46 its name. It has a higher melting point than nylon 6 or nylon 66 and mainly used in applications which must withstand high temperatures. Nylon 46 withstands high loads and stresses at high temperatures and exposure to aggressive environments, and is therefore suitable for under- the-bonnet applications. Typical applications are to be found in the engine and transmission, engine-management, air-inlet, brake, air cooling and electronic systems. Many automotive components have also been produced in nylon 46, because of its excellent creep resistance, toughness and good wear characteristics. As a result of its intrinsic properties nylon 46 has been successfully applied in the following applications and electronics and electrical end-markets.  Development  As early as the 1930s, when Wallace Carothers produced Nylon for the first time, he noticed nylon 46 has a melting point (Tm) of 278 ¬∞C. Due to the intra-molecular deamination of butanediamine to produce pyrrole during heating, the molecular weight growth becomes difficult because pyrrole acts as a terminator in polycondensation. Without precise control over polymerization processes, one can only get a dark color low molecular weight oligomer without any commercial value. When he discovered the more valuable nylon 66, the development of nylon 46 was shelved. In 1977, pale to white high-molecular-weight nylon 46 (Mw = 45,000, inherent viscosity 2.09 in 98% formic acid at 30 ¬∞C) was produced through a solid-state polymerization (SSP) technique by Gaymans et al., which gave hope to industrialization of nylon 46. DSM cooperated with Twente University of Technology to accomplish the commercialization of nylon 46 in May 1984, and DSM announced that it had mastered the industrialized process of nylon 46. In late 1985, a 150 t/a pilot-plant was built; in 1990, a nylon 46 full scale plant was run in Geleen, The Netherlands. According to patents and the literature, one can conclude that the color of the product is key to the industrialization of nylon 46.  Chemical properties  Although there are similarities between the molecular structure of nylon 46 and that of nylon 66, the higher number of amide groups per given chain length and the more symmetrical chain structure of nylon 46 result in the higher melting temperature of 295 ¬∞C, a higher crystallinity, and a faster rate of crystallization. Nylon 46‚Äôs crystallinity is approximately 70%, compared with 50% for nylon 66. This results in a high heat distortion temperature of 190 ¬∞C for unreinforced nylon 46 and 290 ¬∞C for glass fiber reinforced nylon 46. These features give nylon 46 a technical edge over other engineering plastics like polyamide 6 and 66, polyesters and semi-aromatic polyamides (PPAs) with regard to heat resistance, mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, wear and friction behavior. Due to an advantage in cycle-time, improved processing economics, nylon 46 has significant characteristics of a high amide group concentration and a high rigidity of molecular chain, leading to a high degree of crystallization, good rigidity at high temperature and higher water- absorption.

The museum was established in 1994, a few years after the death of Nivola (1911-1988), a native of Orani, and has been expanding ever since. The permanent collection boasts hundreds of sculptural and graphic pieces by Nivola, who played a unique role in 20th century modernism as an artist who worked closely with architects. Aside from exhibiting Nivola's work, the museum produces temporary exhibitions on a regular basis. These center mainly on the relationship between art, architecture, and landscape, with a special focus on artists and movements that were close to Nivola, whose friends included Le Corbusier, Jackson Pollock, Saul Steinberg, Willem de Kooning, Alexander Calder and many other protagonists of mid-20th century art. Orani sits at an altitude of 526 meters, at the foot of Mount Gonare, in the heart of the Barbagia region. Among the notable archaeological sites in the area are approximately 30 nuraghi and several ‚Äútombs of the giants‚Äù. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Gonare at the crest of the mountain is of particular interest, as is the natural landscape on the road leading up to it. Orani excels in handicrafts. It is famous for its stonework, carpentry, and metalwork, and for tailors specializing in the use of traditional Sardinian velvet.

Developed by Hyundai Rotem as a private venture in 2012, the Korean Army declared a plan to acquire 600 6√ó6 and 8√ó8 wheeled APCs in order to help build rapid response forces molded after U.S. Stryker combat brigades, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). Hyundai Rotem, a (subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Group), made the K808/806 in competition with the Doosan Black Fox and Samsung Techwin MPV, and eventually won the competition. Development On 9 May 2016, the vehicles, officially designated as the K808 and K806, passed their final qualification tests, allowing for production to begin for deployment the next year; 600 units are to be produced by 2023. The wheeled vehicles were created to enhance the mobility and striking power of infantry over the slower K200 and K21 tracked vehicles, with the K808 designed for fast troop deployment and reconnaissance missions in front-line areas while the K806 is intended for mobile strike and reconnaissance missions in the rear. Their wheeled designs make them better suited for contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations and finding export markets. Hyundai Rotem expected an order by October 2016 for 16 low- rate initial production vehicles to be delivered to the ROKA for field trials, scheduled to last until late 2017. Production would then commence in 2018 at a rate of 100 per year. Out of 600 total wheeled armored vehicles (WAVs), there would be 100 K806 and 500 K808, designated K806 and K808 in ROKA service, respectively. Although the two variants share many performance characteristics, they have different concepts of operations: the 16-tonne (17.6-ton) K806 can perform rear-echelon roles such as facility defence and logistics convoy protection, while the 20-tonne (22-ton) K808 can conduct high-intensity combat operations alongside K1A1 and K2 main battle tanks. In September 2018, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration announced Hyundai Rotem would begin mass-producing the K806 and K808 vehicles later in the year.South Korea: K808 8x8 armored personnel carrier to be mass produced from late 2018. Army Recognition. 10 September 2018. Design The engine is located in the front on the left side, while the driver sits beside the engine to the right. The troop compartment is at the rear, accommodating 10 fully equipped soldiers plus 2 crew members. Troops enter and exit the vehicle via a rear automatic ramp in addition to 4 roof hatches. Protection The K808/806 has an all-welded armored hull that provides protection against small-arms fire and artillery shell splinters. It can be fitted with add-on armor for a higher level of protection. It is also equipped with the NBC protection system. The 8√ó8 version is more heavily armored than the 6√ó6 version. Engine Initially, the K808/806 Scorpion was fitted with a Hyundai diesel engine developing 380 hp, but later this engine was replaced with another Hyundai engine developing 420 hp with a 7-speed transmission and 2-mode secondary transmission. This engine is used in 8√ó8 configuration. The vehicle has an automatic drive-line management system, central tire inflation system, and run-flat tires. The Scorpion 8√ó8 is fully amphibious, propelled by two water jets, but the Scorpion 6√ó6 is not. Weapons The vehicle is provided with a remotely controlled weapon station armed with a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher or 12.7 mm machine gun. It can also support a two- man turret, armed with a 30 mm cannon and coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. It can also feature a manned weapon station with a 40 mm grenade launcher and 7.62 mm machine gun. In Korean service, the K806/K808 will be outfitted with a one- person protected weapon station armed with an M2HB machine gun rather than an RWS, to reduce acquisition costs, although the company could supply such systems if requested. In June 2020, Hanwha Defense was given a contract to deliver the 30 mm Anti-Aircraft Gun-Wheeled Vehicle System (AAGW) to the ROK military, a K808 chassis fitted with the twin 30 mm cannon turret of the K30 Biho.

Life and career McKenna was born in the town of Carrick-on- Suir in County Tipperary in southern Ireland in 1841. He was the seventh of nine children born to Neal McKenna and his wife, and the second of three sons. He emigrated to the United States with his family in 1849, arriving in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 1. The McKennas settled in Troy, New York, where John grew up. McKenna was a strong Irish nationalist, and in the 1860s he was one of the most prominent Irish Nationalists in the United States. He married Bridget McIntyre, and they had five children: James (1863), John Jr. (1866), Alice (1871), Mary (1875), and Charles (1877). James later became a noted physician. Little else is known about his family, upbringing, education, or early life. McKenna became a businessman in Troy, although the nature of his business is not clear. On November 23, 1870, McKenna was appointed Superintendent of Police of the city of Troy. He held this office for the next 12 years, until December 1, 1882. The outgoing mayor of Troy reappointed McKenna to yet another term as Superintendent on his last day in office. The new mayor appointed local man John Quigley the following day. McKenna continued to hold the office, however, and Quigley contested McKenna's reappointment. On March 16, 1883, the New York Court of Appeals‚Äîthe highest court in the state of New York‚Äîruled that McKenna's reappointment was not legal. As superintendent, McKenna likely was appointed to the rank of police colonel (a title he used for the rest of his life). McKenna was also a member of the New York State Militia, where he reached the rank of lieutenant. From January 22, 1874, to at least 1875 McKenna also served as a porter for the Port of New York. For reasons of ill health, White House Chief Usher Edson S. Densmore resigned from his post in late July 1887. President Grover Cleveland, a former Governor of New York, appointed McKenna the Chief Usher on July 31, 1887. McKenna's tenure did not last long. Cleveland lost re-election in November 1888. Densmore was asked to rejoin the White House in February 1889 in order to oversee preparations for the inauguration of President-elect Benjamin Harrison. President Harrison asked Densmore to stay on as chief usher on his very first day in office. Densmore agreed, and according to the Fitchburg Sentinel he was the first official of the Harrison administration to be sworn in. McKenna was not unemployed long, for that same year he was appointed an Internal Revenue agent in Boston in 1889. It is unclear how long he held this position. John McKenna died of stomach cancer at his home in Boston on December 16, 1898, at the age of 57. He was survived by his five children (his wife preceded him in death).

Common names for this genus include disc coral, scroll coral, cup coral, vase coral, pagoda coral and ruffled ridge coral. These corals are native to the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Japan and the south Central Pacific Ocean. Characteristics Members of this genus may be massive, laminar, columnar or foliaceous, but foliaceous is the most common form. They may form plates, discs or tiered structures, usually with the corallites (skeletal cups in which the polyps sit) only on one surface. The corallites have porous walls and may be sunk into the surrounding coenosteum (skeletal tissue), or form tubular raised mounds. The septa (vertical blades in the corallites) are short and arranged neatly and the columella (central point where the septa join) is broad. The coenosteum is dense and heavy. Most species are nocturnal, with the polyps expanding only at night, but Turbinaria peltata is an exception to this. Ecology Turbinaria mesenterina Members of this genus are hermatypic (reef-building) corals. They are zooxanthellate, meaning that they contain symbiotic photosynthetic protists in their tissues, and are found in shallow waters where sunshine penetrates. They are one of only three genera in the family Dendrophylliidae with this capability, the other genera being azooxanthellate (without zooxanthellae) and found in deeper waters. The crown- of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) has been causing much damage to many species of coral in the Indo-Pacific region but Turbinaria sp. are seldom attacked. Conservation status The conservation status of several species in this genus is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as \\"vulnerable\\". Like other corals, the main threats they face are climate change and ocean acidification. Rising sea water temperatures causes stress to the corals resulting in bleaching events and greater incidence of coral disease, and ocean acidification puts at risk their calcium carbonate skeletal structure. Storms seem to be increasing in severity and fishing activities can also damage reefs. Other threats include tourism, pollution, sedimentation and the introduction of alien species. Population trend statistics have not been gathered for individual species, but the general decline in coral reef habitat is used as a proxy for population decline in these corals. Use in aquaria Turbinaria spp. are sometimes kept in reef aquaria. They are hardy corals that are non-aggressive, and do best in well-lit conditions with moderate to high water movement. Species The following species are listed by the World Register of Marine Species: *Turbinaria bifrons Br√ºggemann, 1877 *Turbinaria carcarensis Nemenzo, 1971 *Turbinaria conspicua Bernard, 1896 *Turbinaria cyathiformis‚Ä† Blainville, 1830 *Turbinaria cylindrica Nemenzo, 1960 *Turbinaria disparata Nemenzo, 1980 *Turbinaria eminens Nemenzo, 1971 *Turbinaria frondens (Dana, 1846) *Turbinaria heronensis Wells, 1958 *Turbinaria irregularis Bernard, 1896 *Turbinaria mesenterina (Lamarck, 1816) *Turbinaria nitida Nemenzo, 1960 *Turbinaria patula (Dana, 1846) *Turbinaria peltata (Esper, 1794) *Turbinaria radicalis Bernard, 1896 *Turbinaria reniformis Bernard, 1896 *Turbinaria stellulata (Lamarck, 1816) References Dendrophylliidae ","title":"Turbinaria (coral)"},{"id":"46446322","text":"Harold Earl Roche (September 8, 1893 ‚Äì August 22, 1961) was a Canadian politician.

He went to Bronxville High School, New York, USA from 1935 to 45 and attended Marlborough College 1945-1948 in the UK. During his military service in Great Britain he decided to study architecture and enrolled at the Architectural Association in London in 1950.Biography at The Modern House After graduating in 1956 and working in East Africa he gained valuable work experience in the firm Lyons Israel Ellis. Subsequently, he became an architect at the London Borough of Camden under Sydney Cook. Brown left the London Borough of Camden architecture department as continuous conflicts around the construction of the Alexandra Road Estate in Camden prevailed. After a public enquiry linked to overshooting costs and exceeding deadlines tried, unsuccessfully, to blame the architect his reputation was nonetheless severely damaged. Brown and his wife lived at Winscombe Street, in the building Brown designed himself. They then moved to Dunboyne Road Estate, where as of 2015 they had lived for about six years. At the age of 73, Brown closed down his practice and studied fine art at the City and Guilds of London School of Art (BA). Brown was diagnosed with epithelioid mesothelioma in June, 2017.

He praises the nine-teenth century streets as providing \\"immediacy of relationship between house and neighbourhood\\", and \\"the traditional quality of background stuff, anonymous, cellular, repetitive\\". Similarly the modern architect should provide concepts that \\"relate each house to its neighbour and to its open space, determine the desirable relationships between housing and the attendant functions\\" Furthermore, the modernist \\"isolation of the slab\\" has to be overcome again it is \\"the architect's job to structure the environment\\".

The Ya-19 did not enter production, despite positive results from flight trials, due to the lack of development of the UT-3 and cancellation of the Voronezh MV-6 engine program, which were the result of changing priorities in the face of the Great Patriotic War. Design and development A derivative of the Yakovlev UT-3, the Ya-19was developed as a five-seat light transport by lead designer Oleg K. Antonov. The Ya-19 mated the wings undercarriage, tail unit and engines of the UT-3 with a new fuselage seating five with a single pilot. Access to the cabin and cockpit was by a door on the port side adjacent to the trailing edge. Four passengers sat in the cabin, two a side and the fifth sat next to the right of the pilot in the cockpit. In 1940 Aeroflot requested that the Ya-19 should be produced for use on short haul routes, but the increasing pace of rearmament in the Soviet Union meant that only a single prototype was built. Production was curtailed when the UT-3 failed to achieve large scale production. An ambulance version capable of carrying two stretchers, one walking wounded and a medical assistant was proposed to the VVS. A mock-up review commission approved the design but production relied on continued development of the UT-3 and Ya-19, which was curtailed due to war requirements. Use of the AIR-19 designation would have been very brief, if used at all, as AIR was dropped as a designation when A.I. Rykov was purged in one of Stalin's pogroms. Operational history The sole prototype completed manufacturer's testing in October 1939 and was then passed to the NII GVF (Nauchno-Issledovatel'skiy Institut Grazdahnskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota - civil air fleet scientific test institute), for state acceptance trials which it passed with good results.

It is native to the Indo- Pacific region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\". Description Turbinaria reniformis is a laminar species, forming horizontal plates or shallow chalices, and sometimes forming tiers. The corallites (skeletal cups in which the polyps sit) are widely separated and are only on the upper side of the plates. The corallites are in diameter, have thick walls and are either sunk into the coenosteum (skeletal tissue) or are conical in shape. This coral has a distinct rim free of corallites, and is usually a yellowish-green colour. Distribution Turbinaria reniformis has a very wide distribution with a range extending from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, through the Indian Ocean, the central Indo-Pacific, to northern Australia, southern Japan, the South China Sea and island groups in the West and Central Pacific. Ecology Turbinaria reniformis is a zooxanthellate coral. It lives in symbiosis with unicellular dinoflagellates known as zooxanthellae. These photosynthetic protists provide their host coral with nutrients and energy, but in order to benefit from this, the coral needs to live in relatively shallow water and in a brightly lit position. In conditions of thermal stress, the coral may expel the zooxanthellae, become bleached and ultimately die. It has been found that when the surrounding sea water is moderately enriched with nitrogen, the coral can better withstand thermal stress and retain its zooxanthellae.

Moghkhed Tehsil passing just south of the town of Chikhalikala & Hetisarora it is joined by the Datpadi Rever from the right, whereafter it turns south and then flows into Mohkhed Tehsil.[ Course The river receives its first tributary - a small spill off from the Kanhargaon Dam- known as the Chotti Kulbehra. It then flows southeast through Chhindwara Tehsil passing just south of the town of Chhindwara it is joined by the Bodri from the left, whereafter it turns south and then flows into Mohkhed Tehsil. Its major tributary, the Umra River, joins it from the right just south of the village of Bisapur, whereafter the Kulbehra heads east where it passes just north of the village of Chand and joins with the Pench River just southeast of the village of Chand at .  Tributaries  The river has three principle tributaries, the Chotti Kulbehra and the Umra Nala draining at its right bank and the Bodri river which is received on its left bank.  Dams  The river does not have any major project constructed across it though its course is interrupted by a series of barrages. These raise the water levels upstream and allow water to be harvested for agricultural purposes.

Gods and spirits  Statue of Kosmenk, one of the Soorts, in Tolhuin, Tierra del Fuego The religion of the Selk'nam people tends to be described as polytheistic, mainly because of the existence of various characters which are usually considered deities. However, it is necessary to clarify that according to the beliefs of the Selk'nam people, only Tem√°ukel is recognized as a god, while other characters are identified rather as mythological ancestors than gods. On the other hand, it also necessary to indicate that the characteristics attributed to these mythological ancestors are typical of those beings whom we might call gods. Because of this, it is possible to consider that the religion of the Selk'nam people was, rather, henotheistic. Thus, we have a superior being, similar to the God of the Abrahamic religions, which corresponds to Tem√°ukel; mythological gods or ancestors called howenh, of which the first to inhabit the Earth was Kenos, a creator and terraforming god, sent by Tem√°ukel; and, finally, Xalpen and her subordinates, soorts, who were inhabitants of the underworld, which were represented by men in the Hain ceremony.  Tem√°ukel  Tem√°ukel is the supreme god of the Selk'nam and Haush pantheon and, in theory, of all Selk'nam deities, is the only one that is considered a god itself, since the other deities are identified, rather as mythological ancestors. He is a primordial god, therefore, has always existed.Pueblos originarios, Cosmolog√≠a Selknam (in Spanish). He dwells in the celestial dome, in the eastern sky or Wintek and is the creator of it and the primitive Earth.  Howenh  Howenh, are gods, but they were not recognized as such by the Selk'nam people, but rather as mythological ancestors, since the only divinity as such is Tem√°ukel. The constitute the great forces of nature and terraforming elements, but before becoming such elements, they existed as humans. Among the most important are Kenos, the first howenh; Kw√°nyip and ƒå√©nuke; Kojh, howenh of the sea; Kren, howenh of the sun; Kre, howenh of the moon; Josh, howenh of the snow; and Shenrr, howenh of the wind. = Kenos = Kenos was the first howenh to inhabit the Earth. He is the creator, organizer and civilizing god in Selk'nam mythology, and the most important deity after Tem√°ukel. He was sent by him from the Celestial dome to the early Earth, with the mission of organize it and create the mythological ancestors who would shape the Earth. Coloane, F. Velero anclado: cr√≥nicas.

The film stars Clifton Tip Fredell, Kit Ryder, Billy Gray, Bob Graham, Nancy Wheeler and Russ Knight. The film was released by Warner Bros. on July 14, 1971. Production and Plot In the alternative Hollywood of 1970s, director Floyd Mutrux got the green light to produce a film about young drug addicts. Eager to tap into the youth market, and without a clue of how to do it, studio head honchos signed off on the film despite it having no viable script. It was instead based on some interviews with actual drug addicts. Dusty and Sweets McGee follows the two young addicts of the title as they idly spend their days in early 1970s Los Angeles. The camera rolls as the addicts roam the streets of LA from downtown to the beach. Car radios play the hits of the day as they aimlessly go about their drug-addicted lives. Eating hot dogs at Pink's, committing petty crime, scoring drugs and cruising the sunset strip are lovingly documented by Mutrux. There is no plot, but what evolves is a portrait of lost, young souls adrift in failed consumer society. Affluent America is all around them, shiny and sun-drenched like a beautiful California orange, but there is something rotten at the core of this fruit. Vietnam rages on, the Watts riots were still smoldering in people's minds to the South as the big, shiny convertibles rolled majestically down the endless freeways. Many neo-realist films indict society for failing to provide for its citizens economically; Dusty and Sweets McGee seems to point a finger at spiritual deficit.15 Great American Movies Influenced by Italian Neo-Realism.

He was best known for songs involving World War I and Prohibition. Career In 1912, Dave Kohn wrote a five-act dramatic play named Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, which was prepared for a tour in 1913, but this was cancelled due to the outbreak of war the following year. His 1917 song \\"The Ocean Must Be Free\\", cowritten with Lew Flint, was published with the caption \\"Dedicated to the United States Army and Navy to encourage enlistment\\". It was reviewed favorably by Billboard: \\"The Ocean Must Be Free is an exceptionally good title for a song at the present time and the words and music are as good as the title.\\" The Music News described it as, \\"a very attractive new song which has one of the best Patriotic texts yet noted.\\" After the war, it was advertised in a 1919 issue of the trade publication National Farmer and Stock Grower as a \\"splendid international song...Our boys could not help fighting for it.\\" It received praise from public figures such as John Philip Sousa and Theodore Roosevelt. Kohn performed the song himself at several venues in Illinois. In 1918, Kohn wrote the lyrics and E.C. Penn wrote the music for the song \\"Right and Justice Must Everywhere Prevail\\". He also cowrote the lyrics to 1919's \\"Peace Reigns on Earth\\" with Carolyne Lamberton, music by Bert Keene and Ernest L. Walker. In 1922, Kohn's song \\"Light Wine and Beer\\" (cowritten with George Vest Jr., music by Bert Keene) was taken up by the Anti-Prohibition Party and Association Against the Prohibition Amendment as their official song. Kohn ran a book shop on 10th Street in St. Louis in the 1920s, where he would write songs for customers on demand.

The Jar'Edo Wens hoax was a deliberately fictitious Wikipedia article which existed for almost 10 years before being spotted in November 2014 and deleted in March 2015. At the time, it was the longest-lasting hoax article discovered in the history of Wikipedia.  Origin  The \\"Jar'Edo Wens\\" article was created on May 29, 2005. It was only two sentences in length and cited no sources. It claimed to be about an Australian Aboriginal god (\\"of earthly knowledge and physical might, created by Altjira to ensure that people did not get too arrogant or self-conceited. He is associated with victory and intelligence.\\"), and was likely simply the name \\"Jared Owens\\", with different spacing, punctuation and casing. The author, an unregistered user at an Australian IP address, was active over an eleven-minute period in May 2005. Their only other contribution was to also add \\"Yohrmum\\" (likely being a re-spelling of \\"Your Mum\\") to a list of Australian deities. This was more quickly spotted and removed, however the \\"Jar'Edo Wens\\" article went on to last for almost a decade before being detected and deleted.  Spread  During its nearly decade-long existence, the \\"Jar'Edo Wens\\" hoax article was translated into other language editions of Wikipedia, including French, Polish, Russian and Turkish. Two language editions additionally included the shorter-lived \\"yohrmum\\" page. An entry was also created on Wikidata. The hoax was unwittingly copied into a book on atheism in 2012, as part of a list of 500 \\"gods and religions in history that have fallen out of favour\\".  Discovery  The hoax lasted nearly a decade on Wikipedia. New article creation had already been restricted to registered users since the Seigenthaler incident in September 2005. Although this made new fake articles more difficult to establish, existing hoax articles (especially low-trafficked ones) could more easily go unnoticed. In 2009, the article was tagged with the classification \\"multiple issues\\" including a lack of sources.Peter Bodkin, Wikipedia‚Äôs longest-lived hoax has finally been outed, 23. M√§rz 2015, TheJournal.ie, bei: Yahoo News UK & Ireland. In Englisch However it was only in November 2014 that the article was flagged as a possible hoax. It was finally proposed for deletion on March 1, 2015 and the deletion was confirmed two days later by an administrator. Wikipediocracy, a website for Wikipedia criticism, publicised the hoax on March 15, 2015, after which it was widely reported by more general news sites.

Hines, was an American actor active primarily during the silent era, who did not transition well into talking pictures. During the course of his career he appeared in over 50 films, and numerous film shorts. Life and career Born in Golden, Colorado on June 25, 1895, he was the brother to film director Charles Hines, and to Samuel E. Hines, who was a bit-part actor during the early years of sound film. In the early 1910s, Hines attended the City College of New York (CCNY), although it is unclear whether he obtained his degree. Hines made his film debut in 1914, when he appeared in several shorts and three films. He was first seen in a featured role in The Man of the Hour, starring Robert Warwick. During the remaining years of silent pictures, he appeared in almost 50 films, many of them in starring roles. His first starring role was in 1915's The Cub, directed by Maurice Tourneur Some of his more notable films included Little Johnny Jones, the first film version of the George M. Cohan musical of the same name, in which he had the title role, and the film version of Leo Tolstoy's Zhivoy trup (The Living Corpse), entitled The Weakness of Man. During the silent era, Hines also co-directed two of the films in which he starred: Burn 'Em Up Barnes in 1921 and 1923's Little Johnny Jones. Hines wrote the script for 1924's Conductor 1492, in which he also starred, and his brother, Charles, directed. With the advent of sound in the motion picture industry, Hines career went into decline. During the 1930s, he appeared in only six films, all in smaller, supporting roles. In 1938 he played his last significant film role, that of Parsons in Too Hot to Handle, which starred Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Walter Pidgeon. He appeared in only one more film, 1946's Magnificent Doll, starring Ginger Rogers and David Niven, in which he played a bit part. Hines died on October 24, 1970 at the age of 75 in Los Angeles, California. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

Proposals have ranged from streetcar, light rail, monorail, Metromover, or Metrorail extension that would connect Downtown Miami to South Beach via the MacArthur Causeway, with the light rail or streetcar options potentially having loops at both ends. Originally proposed as an elevated light rail line such as a monorail, Miami Beach city officials opposed this in favor of something less intrusive, such as a streetcar. Historically, Miami Beach has also cited concerns of unwanted downtown residents as a detriment to the South Beach image. Additionally, the unused parts of the bases of the MacArthur Causeway bridge pilings that were to be used to support the line have been used for the widening of the causeway for the construction of the Port Miami Tunnel, complicating a fully separated right of way. Officials still thought it was feasible as a light rail streetcar, and in 2014 were considering the possibility of a public-private partnership to help fund it. In 2015, the cities of Miami and Miami Beach decided to break the estimated $532 million system into three pieces; two compatible light rail loops in Downtown Miami and South Beach to later be connected via MacArthur Causeway. This was motivated by the lengthy federal studies required for a larger project. French transport vehicle manufacturer Alstom gave an unsolicited proposal to build the Miami Beach portion of the system for US$148 million as a wireless streetcar system from 5th Street to Dade Boulevard via Washington Avenue. Alstom predicts over 20,000 riders a day just on the eight to ten stations that would be on the Miami Beach segment. In 2019 and 2020, resort company Genting Group proposed a monorail BayLink system that would connect to a new Metromover station located at their proposed Resorts World Miami Casino project in the Omni area. Adrienne Arsht Center station. A rail connection to Miami Beach has long been desired due to its high ridership potential and lack of parking, automobile traffic, and other issues on the beach. Miami-Dade Transit's S bus route connecting downtown Miami to Collins Avenue is generally the highest ridership route in the Metrobus system. Additionally, there are several other bus routes connecting the two cities which also have high ridership. In 2012, a Metrorail spur connected Downtown Miami to Miami International Airport but without any plan to extend it to the beach.

The Council was founded in 1999 in response to Scottish devolution, with the principal aim of providing the Jewish community of Scotland with a single voice in dealings with the Scottish Parliament and Government, other communities, and other statutory and official bodies. The Council advances public understanding about the Jewish religion, culture and community, by providing information and assistance to educational, health, and welfare organisations. It also provides a support network for the smaller communities and individuals and families who live outside any Jewish community, and assists organisations within the Scottish Jewish community to comply with various regulatory requirements. The Council also promotes dialogue between the Jewish community and other communities in Scotland, and works in partnership with other organisations and stakeholders to encourage understanding among community groups.  History  The Council was formed in 1999, principally by the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council and the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation, after Scottish Devolution to give the Jewish community of Scotland a single voice in dealings with the Scottish Parliament and Government and other official bodies. The Council is affiliated to the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which speaks for the entire UK Jewish community on reserved matters that affect the entire UK, while the Council has the same role in relation to the Scottish Government and other Scottish bodies with regard to matters devolved by the Scotland Act that only affect Scotland. Thus the Council is autonomous with regard to matters such as justice, education, health and welfare, and community relations, whilst the Board of Deputies speaks for all Britain's Jews on reserved matters such as foreign affairs and international development.  Governance  The Council was initially established when a meeting of all Scotland‚Äôs organised Jewish communities adopted its first constitution on 30 September 1999, and was recognised as Scottish Charity no. SC029438 by the Inland Revenue on 15 October 1999. It was incorporated as a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation on 1 December 2011. Details of SCoJeC‚Äôs entry are in the Scottish Charity Regulator, and its current constitution, annual reports, accounts, and minutes of meetings can be accessed via the charity‚Äôs own website. The members of SCoJeC‚Äôs Council are the elected representatives of each of the formally organised Jewish communities in Scotland ‚Äì Glasgow (Glasgow Jewish Representative Council), Edinburgh (Edinburgh Hebrew congregation and Sukkat Shalom Liberal Community), Aberdeen (Aberdeen Synagogue and Jewish Community Centre), and Tayside and Fife (Tayside and Fife Jewish Community). Three other groups are represented on the Council: the Jewish Network of Argyll and the Highlands, Jewish students studying in Scottish universities and colleges, and Jewish people of Israeli origin living in Scotland. In addition to the elected representatives, the Council also includes up to six people who have been coopted on account of their particular expertise or experience; these have included a former judge and professor of law, a professor of social policy, a former senior civil servant, a consultant physician, and a senior social worker. In addition, we invite observers from communal organisations that serve the whole of Scotland, and members of the Jewish Community who are office-bearers of organisations to which SCoJeC is affiliated, such as BEMIS, Interfaith Scotland, and the Board of Deputies of British Jews. The Council meets four times a year. This representative democratic constitution enables SCoJeC to speak authoritatively in the name of the whole Jewish Community of Scotland to government, parliament, churches, trades unions, the media, etc, about matters of concern to Jewish people in Scotland. For example, SCoJeC regularly responds to official consultations issued by the Scottish Government, Parliamentary Committees, and other bodies, in order to enable the views of the Scottish Jewish community to be taken into account when policy is being developed on matters that affect the community. These include antisemitism and hate crime, equalities and human rights, Family Law, death registration, the census, shechitah, medico-legal matters, protection of children and vulnerable adults, charity regulation, and other matters affecting communal organisations. When preparing responses SCoJeC consults as appropriate with the leadership of the Scottish Orthodox, Reform, and Liberal communities, with relevant communal organisations such as Jewish Care, and with members of the community with particular expertise in the relevant area. The submitted responses then reflect the consensus or range of views expressed. For example, SCoJeC‚Äôs response to a Scottish Government consultation about same sex marriage was prepared in consultation with all branches of Judaism represented in Scotland. The opinions were divided, with the Orthodox Jewish view very much opposed to same-sex relationships, and the Liberal Jewish community strongly supporting the proposals. SCoJeC‚Äôs response did not express a single opinion but instead set out the official positions of the various branches of the Jewish community in Scotland. Similarly, while confirming that all branches of the Jewish community in Scotland are strongly supportive of organ donation and transplantation, SCoJeC‚Äôs response to the 2018 Scottish Parliament consultation on the Organ and Tissue Donation (Scotland) Bill presented the differing views put forward by the Orthodox, Reform, and Liberal Jewish communities in Scotland. SCoJeC only comments on matters that have an impact on the Jewish community in Scotland. For example, with regard to the Middle East, SCoJeC has stated that its role is not to express opinions about foreign affairs, or particular political issues, but when campaigning about the region sometimes becomes antisemitic rather than political, SCoJeC alerts relevant authorities to the concerns of the Scottish Jewish community.  Activities  SCoJeC's functions generally fall into three key areas, which are reflected in its strap-line, ‚Äúrepresenting, connecting, and supporting Jewish people in Scotland‚Äù: 1. Representing Scotland's Jewish Community to other external organisations, fostering relations with other communities in Scotland, and working with other communities and umbrella groups to improve community relations; 2. Connecting Jewish people in Scotland with each other, with the organised Jewish Community, and with other communities, by organising social activities, publishing information, and responding to requests for advice and assistance; 3. Supporting Jewish people in Scotland by providing support for local groups, assisting communal organisations to meet regulatory requirements, producing educational and other resources to enhance understanding of Judaism and the lives of Jewish people in Scotland.  Representation  SCoJeC promotes the understanding of Jewish religion, culture, and community, and works to provide information and assistance to local authorities, other faith and ethnic communities, and educational, health, and welfare bodies across the country. SCoJeC represents the Jewish community in Scotland to government and other official bodies by responding to official consultations on matters that affect the community such as antisemitism and hate crime, equalities and human rights, Family Law, registration and the census, shechitah, medico-legal matters, protection of children and vulnerable adults, charity regulation, and other matters affecting communal organisations. ScoJeC holds regular formal and informal contacts with Ministers, MSPs, MPs, and civil servants, and participates in various Scottish Government equality initiatives and Scottish Parliament Cross Party Groups such as those on Race and on Human Rights. SCoJeC represents the Scottish Jewish Community on a wide range of national organisations dealing with aspects of community relations, interfaith relations, Human Rights, equality matters, etc, including, amongst others, the Boards of BEMIS (the Scottish Ethnic Minority umbrella body), Interfaith Scotland, Scottish Faiths Action for Refugees and Faith in Communities Scotland. In addition, SCoJeC is also a member of advisory bodies such as the Joint Committee on Religious and Moral Education, the Scottish Government Death Registration Advisory Group, NHS Spiritual Care Committees, Police Scotland Community Advisor groups, and the Joint Faiths Advisory Board on Criminal Justice. SCoJeC also holds meetings with senior officers and officials of the Church of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, and the STUC. SCoJeC is not a political or a religious organisation; it is the secular representative organisation of the Jewish communities in Scotland, and it responds to a wide range of issues and organisations. SCoJeC makes representations on behalf of the Jewish Community in Scotland to the Scottish Government, Scottish Parliamentary committees, MSPs, and other bodies on issues concerning Jews in Scotland. For example, in July 2019, SCoJeC issued a statement in July 2019 responding to the Antisemitism in the Labour Party, calling on Scottish Labour to demonstrate leadership, support whistle blowers, and push for serious action to be taken to deal with antisemitism. In March 2018, SCoJeC sent a message of support to be read out at the annual ‚ÄúStand Up To Racism‚Äù rally in Glasgow when there were rallies against racism in the UK, Europe, America, and throughout the world as part of the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. SCoJeC represents the Scottish Jewish Community is assisting the National Records of Scotland with their planning for the next census in 2021, by asking members of the Jewish Community to test different versions of questions of particular relevance, like whether to include ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù as an option for the Ethnicity question. In 2018, SCoJeC collaborated with Jewish Policy Research (JPR) on data collection in 2018 for the significant study of antisemitism throughout Europe they conducted, together with Ipsos, for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). SCoJeC met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2018, along with Board of Deputies President Marie van der Zyl, Board of Deputies Public Affairs Director Phil Rosenberg, and Glasgow Jewish Representative Council Co-President Evy Yedd to discuss antisemitism, Scotland's Jewish community, and the impact that attitudes to Israel have on Jewish people living in Scotland. They also represented the Scottish Jewish Community by contributing a Hebrew Prayer at the 2007 and 2011 Kirking of Scottish Parliament in the presence of the Prince of Wales and Duke of York respectively.  Connecting Communities  SCoJeC works in partnership with other organisations to develop good relationships between communities. SCoJeC is represented on the Executive of Interfaith Scotland, a Scottish charity specialising in promoting and facilitating constructive engagement between different faith and belief communities across Scotland. In 2019, SCoJeC collaborated with Refugee Council Scotland to bring Berlin dance company TOTAL BRUTAL, a collaboration between an Israeli choreographer and three Syrian refugee dancers, to Glasgow and Edinburgh as part of Refugee Festival Scotland 2019. The events included a Klezmer Ceilidh and a dance workshop with Klezmer, Israeli, Syrian and Contemporary dancing ‚Äì aiming to bring together people from different backgrounds using dance. In 2018, SCoJeC took part in a discussion and kosher lunch hosted by Rt Rev Dr Derek Browning, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at the time. The theme of the discussion was the challenges facing all people of faith in Scotland today, and how shared hospitality offers as an example of how faiths can relate to one another. In 2010, SCoJeC sponsored a Symposium jointly with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow, to mark the 45th anniversary of the historic Nostra aetate, the ground-breaking declaration by Pope John XXIII following the Second Vatican Council, that set the scene for a complete transformation of relations between the Catholic Church and the Jewish Community. In 2018, SCoJeC participated in a meeting of the Cross-Party Group on Tackling Islamophobia in the Scottish Parliament to discuss Shared Experiences, Shared Challenges, and Shared Ideas alongside the Muslim Council of Scotland (MCS). The meeting concluded with the signing of a joint declaration by the representatives of SCoJeC and the MCS, stating that the organisations stand together determined to end the hatred and extremism that affect us all. In 2008, SCoJeC organised a Scottish Interfaith Pilgrimage to Israel, supported by then First Minister Alex Salmond,. The goal of the interfaith pilgrimage to Israel was to increase understanding and friendship between communities in Scotland. The idea grew out of a conversation between SCoJeC Director Ephraim Borowski, and Rami Ousta, CEO of BEMIS, the umbrella organisation for minority community organisations in Scotland, who were concerned that tensions in the Middle East may sometimes be an obstacle to the development of good relations locally. The Very Reverend Dr Finlay Macdonald, Principal Clerk, and former Moderator of the Church of Scotland, and the Director of Meem, a diversity training organisation, both joined the steering group, and around thirty people from seven different faith communities were invited to participate in the trip.  Supporting Communities  SCoJeC's work within the community aims to enable the Jewish communities in Scotland, and Jewish individuals living outwith any settled community, to connect with one another. SCoJeC provides services to all of Scotland‚Äôs Jewish communities, for example it assists the Community to comply with Protection of Vulnerable Groups regulations by advising communal organisations about relevant requirements, and carrying out Scheme Record applications on behalf of most voluntary organisations in the Jewish community (including all communal youth groups, synagogues, and educational organisations). SCoJeC also assists the Community to comply with immigration regulations by informing communal organisations about relevant requirements, and sponsoring visa applications for overseas visitors to carry out work in the community, for example to enable a visiting rabbi to perform a wedding, or to ensure that volunteer youth workers from outwith the European Economic Area can legally participate in a communal organisation's activities. SCoJeC responds to requests from local authorities, NHS boards, schools, local police, etc. for information about the needs of local Jewish residents, and liases with the Community Security Trust (CST) , the Scottish Government, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and Police Scotland to combat antisemitism and antisemitic incidents in Scotland. SCoJeC provides educational resources, and sending accredited volunteer ambassadors to visit schools throughout Scotland, in order to promote better understanding of Judaism and the Jewish community, and organises and supports social and educational events in the smaller communities and in remote venues such as Lochgilphead, Findhorn, Oban, Skye, Shetland, Arran, and the Borders. SCoJeC provides a support network for the smaller Jewish communities, for individuals and families who live in rural areas and outwith any Jewish community, and for those in and around the main conurbations who have chosen not to join the formally organised communities. It also works in partnership with other Jewish community organisations in Scotland such as Jewish Student Chaplaincy Scotland, the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation and Limmud Scotland in promoting outreach. SCoJeC's work aims to support Jewish communities, for example it publishes a quarterly newsletter, Four Corners, aiming to build a sense of community by providing information about events and activities across Scotland. SCoJeC also conducted several small-scale inquiries with funding from the Scottish Government, to find out more about the variety of experience of Jewish people in Scotland, and encourage them to identify the issues that are important to them. The first of them was \\"Being Jewish in Scotland\\" in 2013, with a follow-up in 2015 (‚ÄúWhat's Changed about Being Jewish in Scotland?‚Äù, ) and most recently in 2020, the final report being still under works. These studies provided an opportunity for a substantial number of Jewish people from throughout Scotland to address some very real concerns about security and about their relationships with the wider community. SCoJeC regularly holds events throughout Scotland to connect the Jewish community. For example, it played a central role in the Jewish Gathering hosted by Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation in October 2018 in Edinburgh ‚Äì a first nationwide get-together for Scottish Jews, bringing together around 160 Jewish people from all over Scotland ‚Äì from the Western Isles and the Grampians in the north to Galloway in the south. The programme included traditional Shabbat meals, inspiring speakers, music, and discussions. Other examples include SCoJeC's annual Chanukah community events in locations like Inverness, Linlithgow, Dumfries and Stirling, which include kosher buffets, paper-cutting craft workshops, traditional music and dance in addition to the menorah- lighting ceremony. SCoJeC organised an Early Burns Supper in 2020, when SCoJeC hosted a three-course Burns Supper together with a talk about making kosher haggis. In 2017, SCoJeC organised Exploring Scotland's Small Jewish Communities, a series of seven talks across Scotland discussing the history of the Jewish Community, which marked the bicentenary of Jewish communities in Scotland. SCoJeC also organised events as part of Refugee Festival Scotland in 2018 and 2019.  Resources  SCoJeC also produces resources aimed at furthering education on Judaism and Jewish people in Scotland, such as: * a regularly updated website with information about the Jewish Community of Scotland and its activities and concerns; * The Guide to Jewish Facilities in Scotland which gives information about communities and facilities throughout the country. The Guide is consulted by Jewish tourists, business visitors, and people thinking of moving to Scotland, as well as providing contact details of local facilities all in one place for Jewish people in Scotland; * conducting the Being Jewish in Scotland inquiries into what matters to Jewish people in Scotland, and disseminating the findings to Government, public authorities, and others. The studies helped build a better understanding of what affected the sense of security of Jewish individuals and communities, of what matters to the community, and how to improve support for Jewish people in Scotland; * Points of View, a selection of contributions to interfaith and community relations publications and events of relevance to the Jewish Community in Scotland. Members of SCoJeC and other representatives of the Community are often asked to contribute to interfaith and community relations publications and events. For example, Prof. Paul Spicker published an article about antisemitism in CommonSpace, ‚ÄúAntisemitism - If you think this article is about Israel, think again‚Äù, drawing from research data published in the Being Jewish in Scotland studies. The article discusses antisemitism in Scotland and its conflation with Israel discourses; * MEMO (Minority Ethnic Matters Overview), produced by the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities in partnership with BEMIS, and supported by the Scottish Government, is a weekly overview of information of interest to minority ethnic communities in Scotland, including parliamentary activity at Holyrood and Westminster, new publications, consultations, forthcoming conferences, and news reports. Additionally, SCoJeC publishes MEMO+, a series of occasional briefings and reports on a variety of issues of interest to minority communities; * Political Affairs Digest, a summary of political events affecting the Jewish Community (published daily during the Parliamentary Session); * Four Corners, a quarterly newsletter, providing information about events and activities across Scotland; * Scotland's Jews, documenting the history of the Scottish Jewish community, overviewing the demographics of the community and the Jewish beliefs and practices, as well as outlining Jewish concerns about health, employment and contemporary antisemitism.  Educational Resources  SCoJeC aims to increase understanding and communication around Jewish life and belief. SCoJeC offers Educational Resources such as information sessions and activities about Judaism for school and community groups. Initiatives include: * an educational project that consists of training Jewish volunteers to deliver educational talks and activities about their faith and community to schools and other groups, and to represent the Jewish community at interfaith events. The project supports the delivery of Curriculum for Excellencehttps://education.gov.scot/scottish-education-system/policy-for- scottish-education/policy-drivers/cfe-(building-from-the-statement-appendix- incl-btc1-5)/What%20is%20Curriculum%20for%20Excellence? across a range of curricular areas. Jewish topics discussed in these sessions include Shabbat and the Jewish Festivals, Jewish Life Cycle, Synagogues, and Kosher food and other aspects of daily life. * JOES Boxes (Jewish Objects for Education in Scotland), which include a range of objects such as Shabbat Candlesticks, Havdalah sets, Torah scrolls or Chanukiah, to stimulate interest about Judaism and understanding of the Jewish way of life. The boxes are designed to be an educational resource, and they are provided to every local council in Scotland (and backed up by an additional web resource).

He was President of Riggs Bank, an effective advocate of urban beautification in Washington under the influence of the City Beautiful movement, and a generous donor of land and money for Washington's parks and monuments. Glover played a critical role in the creation of Rock Creek Park, the National Zoo, the National Cathedral, Potomac Park, and Glover-Archbold Park. National Park Service historian Cornelius W. Heine, in a 1952 study of Glover's contributions, described him as \\"both a businessman and a poet.\\" In his account, the parks that Glover directly helped to create in the District of Columbia together represented some 3,200 acres, nearly half the total surface of the National Capital Parks. Early life and career Glover was born in Macon County, North Carolina, the son of Richard Leonidas Glover and Caroline Piercy Glover. His paternal grandparents were English-born socialite and poet Jane Cocking Glover and , a prominent Maryland attorney. He moved to Washington at age eight to live there with his grandmother. He started working as a teller at Riggs & Company in 1866. In the wake of the Panic of 1873, after many banks had failed, Glover was promoted to Chief Administrative Officer at age 27. He became partner and was the bank's effective leader in 1881 at the time of the death of George Washington Riggs. In 1896, the bank was converted into a national bank and he became its President. In the early 1900s he oversaw the construction of the new Riggs National Bank headquarters facing the US Treasury Building. He retired from the bank in 1921. Glover was active in the debate that led to the eventual adoption of the Federal Reserve Act and presented a plan for economic relief to the U.S. Congress in 1908. He is mentioned by Robert L. Owen together with Frank A. Vanderlip as a source of inspiration for key amendments to the Aldrich‚ÄìVreeland Act passed in 1914. He was also involved in several other business ventures, including as Director of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad, the ancestor of the Washington Metro, and as President of the Washington Stock Exchange. As a banker to congressmen and presidents, Glover was often a guest at the White House. A story by historian Carlton Fletcher describes Glover's relationship with Theodore Roosevelt, whose children played at Glover's country house, despite the men being from being different parties. Public advocacy and philanthropy In 1881, Glover started to promote the reclamation of the Potomac mud flats that extended West and South of the National Mall, and their transformation into a great public park. This idea was met with stubborn opposition from railroad companies which then had facilities on the Mall and wanted to extend them further. The reclamation work started in 1882 under the leadership of Peter Conover Hains, including the creation of the Tidal Basin. But the future use of the land was not settled before early 1897, when Glover obtained the passage of a bill establishing Potomac Park and personally persuaded President Grover Cleveland to sign it on his last full day in office. This paved the way for the McMillan Plan a few years later. The Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and many other iconic monuments of Washington, D.C. owe their existence to the creation of Potomac Park. In 1888, Glover became the leading promoter of the creation of Rock Creek Park. The project of protecting the natural area around Rock Creek had emerged a generation earlier, but several bills to materialize it had failed in Congress since a first attempt in 1866. Together with other local civic leaders including newspaper publisher Crosby Stuart Noyes and lawyer Calderon Carlisle, he successfully lobbied for bills that led to the creation of the National Zoo in 1889 and Rock Creek Park in 1890. In 1898, Glover was one of the founding members of the Washington Board of Trade, which quickly became the city's most politically powerful civic organization. Glover made major contributions to the landscape of Massachusetts Avenue NW. While living at 4300 Massachusetts Avenue, Glover contributed to its development. Glover was also attributed with helping develop Embassy Row. In 1928, when Glover provided a site for the British Legation at 3100 Massachusetts Avenue, it was the birth of what is now known as Embassy Row. The construction of the National Cathedral was launched under Glover's leadership at a meeting in his house on Lafayette Square in 1891. In 1896, anticipating on the avenue's extension beyond Rock Creek, he built his country house and estate, Westover, south of the present Ward Circle. (Westover was razed and redeveloped in the 1960s.) About a decade later, he moved there permanently and used the avenue for his daily commute downtown. Glover was also a trustee of American University, and was instrumental in its establishment on its current main campus, immediately northwest of Westover. Fittingly, when a new bridge was built in the late 1930s to carry Massachusetts Avenue over Rock Creek, it was dedicated with Glover's name. In addition to promoting the creation of parkland through his efforts in Congress, Glover also donated land of his own. In 1924 he gave some 80 acres of land which, together with a smaller gift from oil heiress Anne Archbold, daughter of John Dustin Archbold, formed Glover- Archbold Park. He also donated other tracts of land in the Eastern part of the District of Columbia. In the early 1920s, he also secured funding for the design of Arlington Memorial Bridge, which was completed a decade later. He was Vice-President and Treasurer of the Corcoran Gallery.  Personal life  Glover married Annie Cunnigham Poor (1856-1943), daughter of Charles Henry Poor, on January 10, 1878. They had two children, Elizabeth Lindsay Glover (1878-1950) and Charles Carroll Glover Jr (1888-1976). Elizabeth Glover married Ren√© de Marees van Swinderen, Dutch ambassador to the United States. Glover, his wife, their son, and his wife Marion Everett Wise Glover, were all buried in a family grave in Oak Hill Cemetery. Legacy Plaque commemorating Glover in Washington National CathedralGlover's name is carried by the Glover- Archbold Park, and by extension, the Glover Park neighborhood; the Charles C. Glover Memorial Bridge; Glover Road in Rock Creek Park; and Glover Drive, a small street south of the site of Westover (see below). His children dedicated a plaque commemorating his key contribution to the construction of the Washington National Cathedral in the church's south nave. At American University, where Glover was treasurer of the Board of Trustees from 1891-1922, the gate of the main campus on Massachusetts Avenue bears Glover's name. A student award, the Charles C. Glover Award, was established in 1950 and is awarded annually to a senior that combines citizenship with business leadership in service to the university.  Riggs Bank  In the 1880s major shareholders of Riggs National Bank were dissatisfied with antitrust rules and federal banking legislation. The legislation made it challenging for commercial banks to manage trust funds. In response, the shareholders established the American Security and Trust Company, which was founded in 1889. Where Riggs was the commercial bank arm, American Security and Trust was the trust arm. When Glover became president, he was involved American Security and Trust Company's creation. When he built the new Riggs building, he gave one wing to its use. American Security and Trust grew in the coming years, and in 1931, moved to a 10-story building across the street. Westover Also associated with Glover is the memory of his country estate, Westover. It occupied the whole 30-acre area between what are now Massachusetts Avenue NW, Nebraska Avenue NW, New Mexico Avenue NW, Cathedral Avenue NW, and the Glover- Archbold Park. The mansion of the same name, with entrance at 4300 Massachusetts Avenue, was built in 1896. In 1920, Glover gave the southern half of the estate (with entrance at 4200 Massachusetts Ave) to his son, Charles C. Glover Jr, who named it Orchard Hill and built a large Tudor-style house. After Glover's death, Westover was rented during the 1950s as the Irish Embassy. It was sold in 1959 to the National Presbyterian Church, which razed the house in 1967 but decided not to build a church there and relocated farther northeast on Nebraska Avenue NW instead. Orchard Hill in turn was razed in 1977 after the death of Glover's son. A number of residential developments were built on the site of Westover, including: The Towers at 4201 Cathedral Ave NW (1960), The Foxhall (1971), Westover Place (late 1970s), Sutton Towers (1979), Embassy Park (1981), Avalon at Foxhall (1982), and the East Campus of American University (under construction in 2015). Assessment James M. Goode, a historian of Washington, D.C., wrote of him: \\"Few if any native Washingtonians have left a more positive and lasting contribution to the city than Charles C. Glover Sr., who gave of his wealth (before the days of income-tax deductions for philanthropy) to the future public good.\\" Goode also attributes a key role to Glover in the creation of the National Arboretum by act of Congress in 1927.

She represented the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics where she won a bronze medal in the team dressage competition. After winning double silver medals at the 2018 World Equestrian Games in Tryon, NC, Laura became the first American dressage rider to be ranked No. 1 in FEI World rankings, aboard her longtime partner Verdades. Dressage career Growing up in Vermont, Laura rode her first pony at an early age when a family friend boarded two ponies at the Graves' farm. Laura and her sisters got attached to the ponies what eventually persuaded their parents to trade a washing machine and a tumble- dryer in order to keep them. At the age of 15, Laura and her mother bought a foal named Verdades from the Netherlands, a horse that eventually became her Olympic partner. Verdades however proved difficult at his early age. In 2009 she suffered a broken back after he threw her from the saddle. Following the setbacks, Laura decided to focus on her cosmetology studies and sell the horse. After briefly working in Boston, Laura decided to move to Florida and continued pursuing her career as a dressage rider after not being able to sell Verdades because of his opinionated spirit. Laura and Verdades started competing at the international Grand Prix level in 2014. At the American Dressage Championships, held in Gladstone, New Jersey, she surprisingly placed 2nd overall and qualified directly for the 2014 World Equestrian Games. In the build-up towards the World Equestrian Games, Laura and Verdades competed at the CHIO Aachen 5* event, placing 10th in the freestyle final. At the World Games, held in Normandy, France, she finished fifth in the team, fifth in the freestyle and fifth in the special dressage competitions. Graves opened the 2015 dressage season with FEI World Cup Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada, where she finished 4th, narrowly missing out on a podium finish. Later that year, she competed at the Pan American Games, which were held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She won a gold medal in the team and a silver medal in the individual dressage competition, behind her teammate Steffen Peters. In 2016, Graves competed at her first Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She won a bronze medal in the team competition and earned 4th position individually. Following year, Graves and Verdades qualified to compete at the 2017 World Cup Finals in Omaha. She eventually finished in a runner-up position, behind Isabell Werth, and thus won her first individual medal. In 2018, Graves successfully defended her World Cup Finals silver medal at the competition held in Paris, France. Later that year Laura became the first American dressage rider to be ranked No. 1 in FEI World rankings, after an impressive finish at the World Equestrian Games in Tryon, NC. Graves started the 2019 season at the Global Dressage Festival in Wellington, Florida, during which she qualified for the 2019 World Cup Finals. At the Finals, which were held in Gothenburg in April, Graves finished in a runner-up position for the third consecutive edition. On each occasion, she was pipped for the top spot by her great rival Isabell Werth.  Verdades  Verdades is a 2002 KWPN Bay Gelding (Florett As x Lilwilarda by Goya) bred by the late Peter Jan (Piet) Crum of Herveld in Holland. Verdades‚Äô sire, Florett As, was a Westphalian-based stallion. As a young horse, he was quite precocious and finished third overall in his stallion test and won the dressage portion. Later he placed third at the Bundeschampionate in Germany in dressage. He stood in both Holland and Germany at different times, but was not utilized heavily for breeding. Considering his smaller breeding record, Florett As has a good record for producing Grand Prix horses\\". Through the dam, \\"through Liwilarda, we see the influence of the Dutch Harness Horse in Verdades‚Äô pedigree. Dutch Harness Horses are carriage horses with high knee action, developed some generations back with influence from the Gelders Horse.‚Äù The Gelders Horse is a heavier warmblood type originally bred for both versatility and style: these horses needed the strength and stamina to work farms but also enough refinement and action to be stylish carriage horses. Fessenden says it‚Äôs not at all unusual for Gelders to influence the breeding of modern Dutch Warmbloods, but it is somewhat exceptional to have this much Harness Horse influence so close in the pedigree of an Olympic dressage horse.\\" In September 2018 Breyer Horses, part of Reeves International (a toy company), released a Traditional (1:9) commemorative horse in Verdades honor. Verdades is a fan favorite, USEF International Horse of Honor, US Dressage national champion, Pan American Games Dressage Gold medalist, and was called ‚Äúthe heart of the sport in America‚Äù by the Horse Star Hall of Fame.  Personal Life  Laura Graves grew up in Vermont on a family farm. She is the daughter of Ronald and Patricia Graves and has two sisters, Eliza and Lindsey. Graves' parents purchased Verdades for her when her first horse, Sunny, was retired from competition. At just 11 years old, she buried a clay model of the Olympic rings inside her fifth-grade time capsule in hopes that she‚Äôd make it to the sports world‚Äôs biggest stage one day. Laura graduated from Harwood Union High School (Duxbury, Vt.) in 2004 and went on to cosmetology school.

Karl Johann Baptist, Prince of Dietrichstein (Karl Johann Baptist Walther Sigismund Ernest Nepomuk Alois; 27 June 1728 ‚Äì 25 May 1808), was a German prince member of the House of Dietrichstein, 7th Prince (F√ºrst) of Dietrichstein zu Nikolsburg, Princely Count (gef√ºrsteter Graf) of Tarasp, Baron (Freiherr) of Hollenburg, Finkenstein and Thalberg. Born in Nikolsburg,Some sources placed Vienna as his birthplace. he was the eldest child of Karl Maximilian, 6th Prince of Dietrichstein, and Maria Anna Josepha, a daughter of Sigismund Frederick I, Count of Khevenh√ºller-Aichelberg in Hohenosterwitz. Life Karl Johann, together with his younger brother Franz de Paula, graduated from the grammar school in Vienna, and in 1749 they went to study Law at Leipzig University. Shortly after, Karl Johann and his brother made the customary Grand Tour through Europe. They travel to Hannover, the Netherlands, Belgium and then to Italy, where both princes completed their tour with a stay in Rome. They returned to the Imperial court at the end of 1752.Jan Karel ‚Äì 6. kn√≠≈æe Dietrichstein, hrabƒõ Proskau-Leslie in: rmm.cz [retrieved 21 April 2015]. The brother obtained the title of K√§mmerer, but Karl Johann, the eldest and Hereditary Prince (Erbprinz) became in one of the secret Konferenzminister. In 1756 he obtained a diplomatic post in Denmark, where he was able to negotiated a truce against the Prussians. During this trip, he became closely connected with the Freemasonry. In 1763 he travel from Copenhagen to Berlin, where he discussed with King Frederick II the investiture of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman Emperor. After returning to the Imperial court, he was highly rewarded. Shortly after his return, Karl Johann married. According to the diary of his maternal uncle Johann Joseph, Prince of Khevenh√ºller-Metsch, the Hereditary Prince apparently wasn't inclined to marry, and even was ready to renounce his rights to his brother Franz de Paula. However, thanks to the intervention of his friend Franz Moritz von Lacy, Karl Johann met Countess Maria Christina of Thun-Hohenstein, and soon became in love with her. The wedding took place in January 1764 in the Imperial court with the presence, among others, of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa. The young couple lived after the marriage at the Imperial court in Vienna. Karl Johann -together with Count (later Prince) Franz Xaver Wolfgang von Orsini-Rosenberg and Franz Moritz von Lacy- was a confidant of the future Emperor Joseph II. They often accompanied him in his travels, for example to Italy in 1769. In 1767, and as a reward for his services, Karl Johann Baptist entered in the Austrian branch of the Order of the Golden Fleece as the 782 Knight since his foundation. In 1769, Karl Johann received from his father the government of the Bohemian domains, who comprised the north of the whole Dietrichstein heritage, along with the Silesian County of Proskau. Despite his new responsibilities, Karl Johann continue to spend most of his time involved in the court life and the study of Esotericism; in consequence, the administration of his estates was in the hands of his wife Maria Christina. In late 1781 he received from his father the government over the Nikolsburg estate, and one year later, Karl Johann sold his Silesian estates, after the loss of this area in the hands of Prussia. After the fire who destroyed mostly of Nikolsburg on 14 September 1784, Karl Johann (who finally inherited the title of Prince of Dietrichstein after the death of his father one month later) moved permanently to the Imperial court in Vienna, while his wife Maria Christina stayed at the castle in ≈Ωidlochovice, where she died in 1788. In 1777 Karl Johann was named Austrian Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge. He openly followed the esoteric ways of Freemasonry: from 1780 was active in the Rosicrucianism and sometimes even regarded as the head of this movement in the Habsburg monarchy. In 1784 became the head of a separate Austrian branch. In Moravia, he founded and led a hunting Order who was called Diana Cacciatrice. The Order members wore a form of miniature hunting corner with a green-white ribbon. The Order has met mainly in hunts, and the frequent site of their meetings was Karl Johann's mansion in Kupa≈ôovice. Karl Johann was probably also involved in alchemical experiments. His personal library was fully equipped with Masonic, alchemical and esoteric books. However, in Nikolsburg Castle wasn't preserved many of his activities (historian Anton√≠n Lubo≈° mentions only laboratory vessels on alchemy there). A small part of the Masonic personal library of Karl Johann was located in Lipn√≠k nad Beƒçvou after being inherited by his great-granddaughter Gabriele of Dietrichstein, by marriage Countess and later Princess of Hatzfeld-Wildenburg. The end of Karl Johann's reign was overshadowed by his mental illness. At that time, Europe was involved in the Napoleonic Wars, which also affected Nikolsburg. In 1798 Russian troops led by General Alexander Suvorov passed through Nikolsburg in his way to Italy to fight against the French. The negotiations with the Russians for a safely pass where lead by Karl Johann's son, Hereditary Prince Franz Joseph. In 1801, the Treaty of Lun√©ville forced Karl Johann to surrender the Imperial County of Tarasp, which became part of Switzerland. In exchange, he received the swabian district of Neu-Ravensburg.Genealogisch-historisch- statistischer Almanach: auf das Jahr..., p. 428 [retrieved 18 April 2015].

Karl Johann inherited his titles and lands. Since them, the full name of the family was Dietrichstein-Proskau-Leslie. Despite all the historical events who taken place during this time, Karl Johann wasn't much concerned about it. Apparently he didn't took care about the administration of his domains and even his sons tried to place him under legal guardianship. However, in 1802 he unexpectedly decided to remarried with the low-born and 29 years younger Maria Anna von Baldtauff. Jan Karel died in Vienna aged 79. His body was buried in the family crypt in Nikolsburg. Marriages and Issue In Vienna on 30 January 1764 Karl Johann Baptist married firstly with Maria Christina Josepha (25 April 1738 ‚Äì 4 March 1788), a daughter of Jan Josef Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n, Count of Thun- Hohenstein by his first wife Marie Christine of Hohenzollern-Hechingen.

It is one of the most modern venues in Southeastern Europe with a seating capacity of 5,100 spectators. Positioned in a convenient location beside the city stadium, the arena is within walking distance of the city center and only 1.5 km away from the Ruse Central railway station. An underground parking facility for 150 vehicles is available. There are plans for the construction of a shopping mall and a five-star hotel near the arena in the future. The arena has been known by multiple names. It was first called Bulstrad Arena after insurance company Bulstrad bought the naming rights for the venue for three years. When the contract expired it was known simply as Arena Ruse. Automotive battery manufacturer Monbat AD purchased the naming rights in July 2018. The venue was renamed once again after a new three-year sponsorship agreement was signed with the OZK Insurance company.  History  Projects for the sports hall were first established in 1972 and construction commenced four years later. Work was suspended on numerous occasions throughout the 80s and the end of the socialist period completely terminated all efforts to finish the indoor arena. Works were unfrozen in 2007 when Ruse Municipality signed a contract for the completion of the sports hall with a private investor. The Bobokovi brothers, well known for their industrial businesses in the country were the private investor. They planned to build a grand shopping mall, as well as a five-star hotel in the area near the sports complex. Construction proceeded rapidly and virtually all ground works and the concrete base of the building were completed. A second, shorter period of inactivity began in 2010 and lasted three years. Ruse Municipality agreed to purchase the multiple-floor underground parking of the sports hall in 2013 and financed construction with BGN 11 million provided by the national budget. Finishing works to the arena continued for nearly two years. After numerous postponements, the mayor of the city announced an opening date of July 23, 2015 with a concert by renowned Bulgarian singer Lili Ivanova. Arena Ruse officially opened on July 23, 2015 in the presence of Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and numerous government ministers. The majority stake of the private investor in the sports arena was acquired for BGN 20 million by the Bulgarian government at the end of 2018. Sports Arena Ruse hosted three games from Group F of the EuroBasket Women 2017 qualification. The most well-attended of these was played between the national teams of Bulgaria and Greece on November 25, 2015, with around 2,000 people present. The venue was also a host of the World Volleyball Grand Prix, where the national team of Bulgaria played against Kazakhstan, South Korea and Germany. The 2018 FIVB Volleyball World Championship took place in the arena between 12-18 September 2018. Other events Significant events have included Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance, as well as British hard rock bands Nazareth and Uriah Heep. World DanceSport Federation's International Open took place in Ruse, Bulgaria on November 21, 2015. Later in the year Arena Ruse hosted a show by Sukhishvili Georgian National Ballet, and Goran Bregoviƒá nearly sold-out a concert with over 5,000 attendees. World-renowned pianist Richard Clayderman performed in front of more than 2,500 people at the venue at an event on July 7, 2016. Russian pop singer of Bulgarian origin Philipp Kirkorov performed in Ruse on his Bulgaria tour in September 2017, as well as in June 2019.

The eleventh installment in the SaGa series, the game was published by Square Enix in 2015. Designed as part of the series' 25th anniversary celebrations, it was developed with the supervision of series creator Akitoshi Kawazu. Set in an original world, the player controls an emperor or empress as they maintain their empire against magical and human threats; while there is an original narrative with a final boss, many of the events are based on the plots and characters of previous SaGa games. Gameplay revolves around exploring a world map and successfully completing battles, which enable soldiers and vassals to strengthen. The turn-based mechanics and usage-based growth system of earlier SaGa games is carried over into Imperial SaGa. The game was developed as a browser-based equivalent to the mobile phone game Emperors SaGa. Regular series composer Kenji Ito returned to compose and arrange music. The original scenario was created by Emperors Saga writer Moku Tochibori, while additional work and later scenarios by Benny Matsuyama; both of whom had worked on game projects and supplementary material for Square Enix. Since its initial release, Matsuyama has continued to contribute new scenarios for content updates. Gameplay A battle in Imperial SaGa; while adjusted for browsers, the basic gameplay is carried over from the mainline SaGa series. Imperial SaGa is a role-playing browser game in which players take the role of a line of Emperors or Empresses; their goal is the defeat enemies, expanding their territory and defending their people. Navigation takes place on a world map, with battles or story events triggering when the player reaches nodes on the map. The aim is to defeat enemies and boss opponents on the world map to advance the story and raise a character's experience level; players can fight manually, or enable Auto-battle. Combat uses a turn-based combat system, with each side using group configurations called Formations to attack, which can unlock differing attack strategies or activate passive abilities. In addition, using a special item during a boss battle with all five party members active will trigger a special attack where the entire recruited army deals a single attack, resulting in high damage. Rather than a traditional leveling system, Imperial SaGa uses the usage-based system of earlier SaGa games; actions performed in battle randomly raise a character's statistics, using a skill regularly enough raises the strength of that skill, and new skills are unlocked upon using a similar skill enough times. Each unit has health (HP) and Life Points (LP). LP decreases each time a character is defeated, with LP needing to recharge outside battle. If a character loses all LP, they are unable to take part in combat until their LP is replenished. Development and release Imperial SaGa was developed by Japanese studio Think & Feel, who had previously worked with Square Enix on the Nintendo DS titles Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings and Blood of Bahamut. Imperial SaGa was the first SaGa game developed for PC browser platforms. Development began in 2012 after Square Enix producer Kei Hirono saw the strong positive reception of the mobile game Emperors SaGa; his aim was to create an equivalent experience for browsers and begin a series of similar expansions for the SaGa franchise. Hirono acted as the game's producer, and directed by Tomotaka Shiroichi. Series creator Akitoshi Kawazu acted as executive producer and general supervisor for the project. Work on Imperial SaGa ran parallel to both the continued support for Emperors SaGa and the upcoming SaGa: Scarlet Grace. While Emperors SaGa had been a card-based battle game, Imperial SaGa was designed with gameplay similar to the rest of the SaGa series. The music was composed by Kenji Ito, who first co-composed the music for Final Fantasy Legend II and was sole composer for the Romancing SaGa games and SaGa Frontier. Ito worked on the project in parallel to creating the soundtrack for Scarlet Grace. When Hirono first contacted Ito, his request was for an original soundtrack which would also honor the series' musical legacy. The original tracks were recorded using a live orchestra. Arrangements were created for the various tracks for different story routes, handled primarily by Noriyuki Kamikura and Noritoshi Narita. The lyrics for vocal tracks were written by Kawazu. The original scenario was written by Moku Tochibori, who had previously worked on Emperors SaGa, in addition to game titles including Metal Gear Acid and Final Fantasy Type-0. Tochibori was helped in writing the scenario by Benny Matsuyama, who had created supplementary material related to Square Enix's games for publisher Studio BentStuff. Matsuyama continued to contribute to later scenarios. Commenting on his work, Matsuyama said that the characters' set personas made the scenarios easy to write. The scenario was generally supervised by Kawazu. The succession of rulers which played a part in the narrative was directly inspired by Romancing SaGa 2. During his work on the game, Tochibori's writing ended up influencing a quest for Emperors SaGa based on Romancing SaGa 2 after his scenario impressed Kawazu. The dark tone was intended to reflect both Romancing SaGa and SaGa Frontier. The promotional and original character artwork was created by series artist Tomomi Kobayashi, who was brought in to appeal to long-time fans of the SaGa series. Other new characters and redesigns of earlier protagonists being handled by Kurahana Chinatsu, noted for her work on Uta no Prince-sama. Chinatsu was brought on board the project to bring in players new to the series. Despite the contrasting styles of Kobayashi and Chinatsu, Hirono did not want to force Chinatsu to mimic the older art style, and Kawazu was pleased that her designs remained original while fitting into the SaGa series. The character sprites were created using a modern form of the \\"dot graphic\\" pixel art used in early SaGa titles. Imperial SaGa was first announced during a special livestream alongside SaGa: Scarlet Grace; the two games were announced as part of the series' 25th anniversary celebrations. Pre-registration for the game opened in May 2015, offering rewards of characters themed after Romancing SaGa 2. The game released on multiple browser platforms on June 18, 2015, with later versions launching for new browser servers in 2016. Following its initial release, general feedback was positive, with future updates addressing complaints about LP recovery rates. Later updates also added new difficulty settings and gameplay adjustments, and an official guidebook was released on December 17, 2017.

He is famous for having a Twitter account followed by more than 32 thousand people, though the real operator behind the account remains unknown. ≈ûero is the mascot of the CHP and is described as the 'standard social democratic cat'. He is as a significant icon in Turkish politics, constantly appearing on the news for outlandish and humorous political comments made on his Twitter account. ≈ûero describes himself as the 'CHP's second-hand man', second only to party leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu. His Twitter account identifies his job as 'eyeing Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu'. History ≈ûero has lived at the CHP headquarters since it was built, and is assumed to have been born in 2005. His name, ≈ûerafettin, comes from the Turkish comic book character K√∂t√º Kedi ≈ûerafettin (Bad Cat ≈ûerafettin), which has similarities with the comic strip character Garfield. His name was given to him by construction workers during the building's construction and is shortened to ≈ûero. In 2009, the CHP's expenditure on cat food and cat litter was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court of Turkey, which identified the expenditure on the cat as a misuse of party funds. ≈ûero has often been sighted on live television during addresses from the CHP headquarters given by party leader Deniz Baykal. More recently in 2015, ≈ûero appeared on live television while Ahmet Hakan was interviewing party leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu. His appearance became popular on Twitter shortly after, prompting Hakan to address the issue of a 'cat walking around' during the interview. ≈ûero has since become an easily identifiable mascot in Turkish politics. In 2008, ≈ûero was taken to a feline hospital for 14 days after suffering from depression, urethral and kidney problems. Elections 2014 local and presidential elections Provinces suffered from electricity cuts during the counting process for the local elections On March 30, 2014, local elections were held throughout Turkey to elect municipal councillors, mayors and neighbourhood presidents. Large-scale electricity cuts and electoral fraud dominated the counting process. Energy minister Taner Yƒ±ldƒ±z later attributed the nationwide power-cuts to cats entering transformers, a statement which was initially assumed to be an April Fool's joke. The statement caused uproar amongst the opposition, with the CHP deputy leader G√ºrsel Tekin calling on ≈ûero to 'assemble the CHP's cat wing' to guard the transformers during the August 2014 presidential election that followed shortly after. Tekin's response to Yƒ±ldƒ±z was seen as an indication that the CHP did not take the minister's excuses for the power-cuts seriously and attributed them to aiding the government's vote-rigging efforts instead. Following Yƒ±ldƒ±z's remarks, ≈ûero obtained the new nickname, 'the cat that didn't go into a transformer' (trafoya girmeyen kedi). On Twitter, ≈ûero promised his first 2,000 followers CHP candidacies for municipal councillor positions for the 2014 local elections. June 2015 general election In response to the Supreme Electoral Council President Sadi G√ºven saying that they had 'rounded up all the cats' in preparation for the June 2015 general election, ≈ûero tweeted 'I'm still here, come and round me up' in response. The tweet went viral shortly after and was reported by several media outlets. On 6 April 2015, a day before the CHP party candidates were announced, the candidates chosen by Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu were leaked on ≈ûero's Twitter account. On 18 April, ≈ûero predicted that the outcome of the election would be a hung parliament and would result in a CHP coalition with the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).

The range extends 16 miles south, from just east of the Van Horn Mountains. Locally known as the Candelaria Rim Rock, the Sierra Vieja comprise the southernmost tip of the Southern Rocky Mountains in North America. Sierra Vieja is Spanish for \\"old mountains.\\" Capote Peak is the most prominent in the range and is located fourteen miles northwest of Farm Road 2810. It has an elevation of 6,212 feet above sea level, with its summit rising 1,882 feet above nearby Capote Creek. The peak stands at the southeastern edge of the range. Capote means \\"cloak\\" or \\"cape\\" referring to the fog and mist that occasionally surrounds the peak. Local folklore recounts that the name may be related to the Lipan Apache Chief Capote, who lived in the region around 1850. Cultural History Archaeological evidence indicates a long history of human presence in the Sierra Vieja. When Cabeza de Vaca, the first European to explore the Big Bend in 1535, traveled up the Rio Grande, the explorer encountered a large Native American population. The extensive number of Indian sites along Walker Creek and Capote Creek are also evidence of human occupation for thousands of years. In later years, the Apache resided in the Sierra Vieja. The Native American presence in the area hindered cattle ranching until the final years of the nineteenth century. The Sierra Vieja rim has long served as an unofficial boundary, with Spanish language and culture prevailing west of the range on both sides of the Rio Grande. The range largely remains within the boundaries of several large ranches. Geology and Vegetation Large-scale silicic volcanism began in the Sierra Vieja about 39 million years ago and continued until about 35 million years ago, with the range being composed of a sequence of tertiary flow and pyroclastic rocks. The shallow, stony soils in the Sierra Vieja support live oak, pi√±on pine, juniper, conifer, cacti, and grasses. The mountains are also home to the Hinckley columbine, a variety of Aquilegia chrysantha. The plant has fern-like, delicate foliage and canary yellow flowers. It grows to three and a half feet tall and is endemic to a single site: Capote Falls in the Sierra Vieja. Capote Falls, located on spring-fed Capote Creek, is the highest waterfall in Texas at 175 feet. Despite its location in one of the driest parts of the state, it is the main drainage below the Rio Grande Rift and the Sierra Vieja on its way to the Rio Grande, and as such it consistently flows. The waterfall is located on private property.

Her work addresses women's sexual self-expression and identity online and in popular culture.  Early life  Hirsch received a BFA in sculpture from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2007, and an MFA in Video Art from Syracuse University in 2010.  Work  In 2008, Hirsch initiated the \\"Scandalishious\\" project, a series of videos posted to her YouTube account, \\"Caroline's fun fun channel.\\" Using her computer to record herself, Hirsch performed as Caroline Benton, a SUNY freshman. Many of the clips show Caroline dancing to music ranging from MGMT to Katy Perry to Meat Loaf. In other videos, Caroline reads poetry or confides to her viewers about her personal life. The channel has reached over one million views. Of her motivation in creating \\"Scandalishious,\\" Hirsch has said, > While I was growing up and becoming a woman, I hated myself. I knew I was > smart but other than that I thought I was just a disgusting girl that no one > could be sexually interested in. I started performing as \\"Scandalishious\\" > because I was tired of feeling that way. Or at least, I was tired of > appearing as though I felt that way. So I started pretending I thought I was > sexy and I quickly learned that if I pretended to be confident, people would > believe it. And then I actually became more confident as a result. Hirsch also went on to display and discuss segments of the \\"Scandalishious\\" project in galleries. In 2010, Hirsch was a participant on the VH1 reality TV show Frank the Entertainer in a Basement Affair. Hirsch went by \\"Annie,\\" one of fifteen women trying to win over Frank Maresca, himself a former reality TV contestant on I Love New York 2 and I Love Money. Hirsch's incentive in joining the show was to create a performance piece and to investigate the derogatory stereotypes surrounding women who vie for publicity. Hirsch's participation on \\"Frank the Entertainer\\" highlighted the nebulous line between performance and reality. She found herself cast as \\"the nice girl,\\" and realized \\"the non-sexualization of my character, both through my own doing and through careful editing...rendered me an inadequate partner for Frank.\\" To avoid this carefully packaged characterization, Hirsch performed an expletive- filled rap song and was promptly sent home. In an interview with Hirsch, Karen Archey suggested that reality TV itself was the medium for the performance. Even so, a compilation of clips of her appearances on the show along with her application video, entitled \\"Here For You (Or my Brief Love Affair With Frank Maresca,\\" can be found on Hirsch's website. Hirsch also participated on the TV series Oddities. After Hirsch's work with Frank the Entertainer ended, in 2011 she collaborated with performance artist Genevieve Belleveau (also known as gorgeousTaps) to create The Reality Show with gorgeousTaps. Hirsch's work with and on reality TV manipulates stereotypical tropes into which women are cast and likewise considers the power of affect (emotion) within an attention economy. As a teen in the late 1990s, Hirsch developed a significant chatroom presence. Hirsch's \\"Playground,\\" a play about a coming of age for which she was awarded a Rhizome commission, teenage girl engaging in a relationship with an adult man through an internet chatroom, debuted in 2013. The set of \\"Playground\\" consists of two desks where the actors sit at computers, appearing to chat with each other, while the textual component of their conversation is projected onto the wall behind them. The play was inspired by Hirsch's own teenage experience of meeting and engaging in a multi-year online relationship with an older man. The play was debuted at the New Museum and was presented by South London Gallery at Goldsmiths College. Hirsch also collaborated with designer James LaMarre to produce \\"Twelve,\\" an app that recreated the now-defunct AOL chatrooms of Hirsch's adolescence.

It is situated in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek north of PA 29 and Dundee Road and contributes several million gallons of acid mine drainage to that creek daily. The borehole also discharges large loads of iron and other substances. It was constructed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in the early 1970s and drains mine water from the South-East Mine Pool Complex. The discharges of the borehole have been treated by active treatment systems and artificial wetlands. Hydrology Water that flows from the Askam Borehole contains a significant amount of iron deposits. Upon exposure to air, the iron precipitates in the form of iron hydroxide, a reddish-orange compound that coats stream channels. The borehole contributes pollution to Nanticoke Creek. In the 1970s, an Operation Scarlift report found the concentration of acidity in the discharges of the Askam Borehole to be 633 parts per million and the pH was measured to be 3.7. The concentration of iron was 384 parts per million and the sulfate concentration was 1936 parts per million. The daily load of acidity was found to be and the daily load of iron was . The Askam Borehole discharges of acid mine drainage per minute into Nanticoke Creek. The discharge of the borehole can reach up to per minute during heavy rain. In the 1970s, an Operation Scarlift report found the discharge of the borehole to be 5.51 million gallons per day. Geography The Askam Borehole is located in Hanover Township, in the central part of Luzerne County. The borehole is in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, whose watershed has been deep mined and strip mined in the past. The borehole is near Dundee Road and Pennsylvania Route 29. The Askam Borehole is one of two major outlets for mine water from the South-East Mine Pool Complex, with the other being the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes. The borehole itself has a diameter of . The Askam Borehole is the main point by which the T-B mine workings discharge acid mine drainage into Nanticoke Creek. The borehole is the only source of water for the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. It discharges in two different locations. History and etymology The Askam Borehole is named after Askam, a nearby village. It was drilled in the early 1970s by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (later known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection). The borehole was created for the purpose of alleviating water pressure from an underground mine pool that was causing groundwater to flood local basements. In 1975, an Operation Scarlift report estimated that the cost of treating the borehole's discharge would be $1,011,600 per year in 1975 dollars. An active treatment system for the Askam Borehole was proposed by the Earth Conservancy by 2013. As of 2014, the Earth Conservancy has been constructing, testing, and monitoring an abandoned mine drainage treatment system at the Askam Borehole. The treatment system makes use of a technology known as the Maelstrom Oxidizer, which uses electricity to blow air across the surface of the water, causing iron to precipitate from the water before the water is moved to a holding pond and then into the stream. The treatment system is known as the Askam AMD Treatment System or the Askam Treatment System. An artificial wetland has also been used to treat the borehole's discharges. This wetland was constructed in May 1999 and has an area of . In the 2010s, the Earth Conservancy was awarded a $250,000 grant by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to clean up the Askam Borehole discharges. There are plans for the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Restoration to continue to take biological stream samples and water quality measurements in the vicinity of the Askam Borehole.

The project was first announced as the building at 451 E. Grand Ave. in July 2014, approved in December 2014, and named One Bennett Park in October 2015. The building is named for Edward H. Bennett, the Chicago architect and urban planner who coauthored the 1909 Plan of Chicago. The building topped-out in late 2018, and later opened in the spring of 2019. It is among Chicago's tallest skyscrapers. History and location The building was approved in December 2014, the same month Streeterville Organization of Active Residents approved the building. The tower will be located in the River East community of the Streeterville neighborhood, a half-block from North Lake Shore Drive. Site prep began for One Bennett Park in early 2016. Design The building was designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects who have designed similar buildings, such as 15 Central Park West, 30 Park Place, and 220 Central Park South. It will reach 843 feet at its architectural height and total 69 stories, making it the 12th tallest building in Chicago. The tower will also be overseen by GREC Architects as the Architect of Record. Consultants include Thornton Tomasetti as the structural engineer and WMA Consulting Engineers LLC as the MEP/FP Engineer and the sustainability consultant. The building has been favorably compared to buildings in New York City. It will be his second project in Chicago; previously, he created the plans for the JCDecaux bus shelters. 451 E. Grand Avenue will be built with a limestone base, while the rest of the building will be precast concrete, similar to many of Stern's buildings elsewhere. However, the concrete will be colored and textured to resemble other buildings in the Streeterville area and adhere to the neo-deco and neo-Gothic styles prevalent in Chicago. The interiors, including much of the lobby and common spaces, will be designed by Robert A.M. Stern Interiors. The top two floors will be dedicated to a mechanical penthouse designed to mirror lantern towers and other unique cornices of Chicago skyscrapers. The 68th floor will also house a tuned mass damper. Due to the tower's narrow profile, the mass damper is intended to decrease the lateral sway from wind at high altitudes and remove any motion discomfort to condominium and penthouse owners near the top. While mass dampers are often large, solid masses whose movements are controlled by hydraulic pistons, the damper in One Bennett Park will be a slosh tank damper, using a large tank of water to absorb and alleviate stress from lateral motion. Amenities and usage 451 E. Grand Avenue will feature a new 1.7 acre park by Michael Van Valkenburgh & Associates that is accessible to both residents of the new tower and of the surrounding River East neighborhood. In addition to a deck on the 44th floor, the tower will also feature green roofs on eight levels. Occupancy for the tower will include 279 apartments and 69 condominiums, with a total parking capacity of 900 parking spots for the units. While 400 of these parking spots will be reserved for residents, a majority will be available to the residents and visitors of the surrounding area, as well as the general public. The parking itself inhabits 4 stories of subterranean levels directly below the public park and tower. This contrasts to the more common model of the River East area. As can be seen in such buildings as the Trump International Hotel and Tower and even the Hancock Center, parking is usually placed within the lower levels of the building itself, usually above a ground-level retail floor. Sustainability Like many new skyscrapers in Chicago, the tower will be LEED certified for sustainability, and is currently attempting the level of LEED Silver certification. Because of this, the tower will feature several sustainable strategies, such as water-efficient toilets, sinks, and showers in both public and residential areas. Overall energy usage will be optimized with the exploitation of natural ventilation. While Chicago city code mandates that residential units have operable windows, One Bennett Park will locate common areas (such as living/dining/kitchen and bedrooms) of residential units within 25 feet or less of an operable window, allowing for maximum cross ventilation and decreasing the need for mechanical ventilation. Large amounts of vegetated open space as well as public hardscape areas made of semi-reflective materials will help to decrease the urban heat island effect while providing ample outdoor areas for residents' physical and mental health. Vegetated roof areas, such as on the large amenity deck, will also help decrease the heat island effect, as well as shrink the building's carbon footprint. The tower will also feature low-emitting and low- or zero-VOC materials on the interior, including paints and interior coatings. At least 20% of raw materials, such as structural concrete and steel, drywall, masonry, and insulation, will be sourced regionally (within 500 miles of the project site). At least 10% of the materials will be recycled. This strategy aims to decrease pollution caused by transportation of materials over long distances as well as toxins released during raw material production (as opposed to recycling and reusing materials).

Lomekwi 3 In July 2011, a team of archeologists led by Sonia Harmand and Jason Lewis of Stony Brook University, United States, were heading to a site near Kenya's Lake Turkana near where Kenyanthropus platyops fossils had previously been found. The group made a wrong turn on the way and ended up at a previously unexplored region and decided to do some surveying. They quickly found some stone artifacts on the site, which they named Lomekwi 3. A year later they returned to the site for a full excavation. Harmand presented her findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society on April 14, 2015 and published the full announcement and results on the cover of Nature on May 21, 2015.  Artifacts  Around 20 well preserved artifacts have been dug up at Lomekwi 3 including anvils, cores, and flakes. An additional 130 artifacts were found on the surface. In one instance, Harmand's team was able to match a flake to its core, suggesting a hominin had made and discarded the tool at the site. The tools were generally quite large ‚Äì larger than the oldest known stone tools, recovered in the Gona area of the Afar Region of Ethiopia, in 1992. The largest weighs 15kg, and may have been used as an anvil.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science- environment-32804177 According to Harmand, it appeared that the tool makers had purposely selected large, heavy blocks of strong stone, ignoring smaller blocks of the same material found in the area. She ruled out the possibility that the tools were actually natural rock formations, saying \\"The artifacts were clearly knapped and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks\\". Analysis suggested the cores had been rotated as flakes were struck off. The purpose of the tools found at Lomekwi 3 is unclear, as animal bones found at the site do not bear any sign of hominin activity. This is the greatest expression of late Neogene technology in human evolutionary history. Based on the buried artifacts' stratigraphic position (in undisturbed sediment) relative to two layers of volcanic ash and known magnetic reversals, Harmand and her team dated the tools to 3.3 million years ago. The finds at Lomekwi therefore represent the oldest stone tools ever discovered, predating the Gona tools by 700,000 years. Hominid evolution The date predates the genus Homo by 500,000 years, suggesting this tool making was undertaken by Australopithecus or Kenyanthropus (which was found near Lomekwi 3). Previously, evidence of stone tool use by Australopithecus has been suggested on the basis of marks on animal bones, but those findings have been hotly debated, with no scientific consensus forming on either side of the debate. Harmand said the Lomekwi 3 artifacts do not fit into the Oldowan tool making tradition and should be considered part of a distinct tradition, which she termed Lomekwian. It has been hypothesized that tool making may have aided in the evolution of Homo into a distinct genus. However, it is unclear whether the Lomekwian tools are related to those made by Homo species ‚Äì it is possible the technology was forgotten and later rediscovered. Independent researchers who have seen the tools are generally supportive of Harmand's conclusions. George Washington University anthropologist Alison Brooks said the tools \\"could not have been created by natural forces ... the dating evidence is fairly solid.\\" Rick Potts, head of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, said the tools represented a more primitive style than known human-made tools, but something more sophisticated than what modern chimpanzees do. \\"There's no doubt it's purposeful\\" toolmaking, he remarked. Paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged, who was responsible for the earlier research suggesting Australopithecus had made tools, also backed Harmand's conclusions.

Bro\\") is a Finnish former engineering company based in S√∂rn√§inen, Helsinki. The 1892 founded company grew heavily in the 1920s and 1930s by acquiring Finnish engineering companies; the products were ships, steel bridges, weighing scales, separators and other machinery. The company's separators were produced under brands Lacta and Milka and they were also produced in Sweden, Denmark and France. By the early 1930s Kone ja Silta held virtually the whole Finnish shipbuilding industry. Majority of the company ownership was acquired by W√§rtsil√§ iron works in 1935 and Kone- ja Siltarakennus was incorporated into W√§rtsil√§ Group in 1938. The acquisition was prominent due to the significant size difference of the companies, and a major step in W√§rtsil√§'s development as one of the leading engineering companies of Finland. Production was transferred from S√∂rn√§inen to Joensuu and J√§rvenp√§√§ in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The old factory area is nowadays part of Merihaka.  Name  The company name was originally written officially in Swedish Maskin- och Brobyggnads Aktiebolaget, \\"Machine and Bridge Construction Limited\\" and widely shortened Maskin o. Bro, \\"Machine and Bridge\\". The Finnish name Kone- ja Siltarakennus, shortened Kone ja Silta respectively, was used in Finnish speaking context. The company name was changed officially into Finnish in 1935, but the Swedish speaking name was used in parallel after that.Zilliacus: Ahven. pp. 138‚Äì149.  Origins  Brobyggnads Aktiebolaget, a Helsinki-based engineering company founded in 1889, got a significant order of railway bridges from the Finnish Grand Duchy in 1891. The order consisted few bridges for the northernmost part of the Karelian railway and all the bridges for the Pori railway. In order to be able to complete the order the company bought in spring 1892 Osbergs Mekaniska Verkstad, which was an 1853 founded engineering works, that had produced freight coaches and military supplies, such as ammunition transport caskets and coaches for various purposes.Haavikko: 1834‚Äì1907; chapter 7. pp. 14‚Äì15. Osbergs Mekaniska Verkstad operated in S√∂rn√§inen on a 3,5-hectare lot which it had leased from the city. The area was only partly built. After the acquisition, the company was renamed Maskin- och Brobyggnads Aktiebolaget.  Grand Duchy era  Subsequently, the production was concentrated in S√∂rn√§inen. By the beginning of the 20th century the main products were bridges and ships; shipbuilding was started already in 1891. The company built a dock on sea shore in S√∂rn√§inen. The first vessel, a tug steamer, was handed over in 1893. Steam boilers became an important part of the product portfolio. Kone ja Silta got a notable orders for ammunition and railway cargo cars from the Finnish Grand Duchy; also the Imperial Russian Military Administration became a notable customer. At the end of the 1890s the company got an order of cargo cars from the State Railways. The good order base increased the income but the company had continuously problems with shortage of cash reserves. The old Brobyggnad premises next K√∂ydenpunojankatu were sold and the company bought the land in S√∂rn√§inen from the city. The share capital was increased in 1899, although it didn't succeed in full extent due to tightened money market regulations. The Empire wanted to limit the economical independence of the Grand Duchy, and in 1902 it was announced that Finland was to be regarded as foreign country in determining toll fees. Moreover, the Russian public institutions were forbidden to order supplies from foreign countries. This created big problems to Finnish engineering companies, including Kone ja Silta, as they were very dependent on Russian market. Russian customers had typically given prepayments which had helped at maintaining cash reserves. The Imperial Russian Council of Ministers cancelled the order at the end of 1902 after deciding to seek for softer way to tie Finland into Russia. Subsequently, Kone ja Silta got a 4-million-mark order for 200 000 shrapnels.Haavikko: 1834‚Äì1907; chapter 8. p. 15. Kone ja Silta made its best result until then been during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904‚Äì1905. The situation changed in 1907, when the Council of Ministers again re-introduced prohibition of governmental orders from engineering companies of the Finnish Grand Duchy.Haavikko: 1907‚Äì1917; chapter 1. pp. 20‚Äì21. The company management was aware that a such order would come and had investigated different business opportunities. The owners considered foundation of a namely Russian ammunition factory in Saint Petersburg or finding a Russian buyer for the company; neither of the options gained response. New markets for shrapnels were investigated in Romania and Italy, and Kone ja Silta went into contact with the Swedish AB Diesels Motorer investigating possibility to start diesel engine production. These efforts did not lead to results.Haavikko: 1907‚Äì1917; chapter 2. pp. 21‚Äì22. Separator assembly and testing in Kone ja Silta. The management investigated possibility for separator production analysing number of types in the market. It was decided to develop a separator based on a Swedish invention. Kone ja Silta bought production machinery from a Copenhagen-based company that had ended separator production; also one person was recruited from the Danish company to work as financial manager of the newly founded Kone ja Silta separator department. However, the product construction was not successful and it was replaced by new type branded Lacta. The design was patented and exports started soon after. Another separator brand used was Milka. Another successful new product was pulp and groundwood machinery, for which the company bought know-how from abroad. New lines of production alongside with railway bridge projects in Lapland and Karelia as well as railway cargo car orders guaranteed the vital order basis. Moreover, Russian government started to slip from the boycott, and Kone ja Silta got few orders from the Russian government, and it produced also steamships, which operated in Russian rivers. In 1913 the company built new premises which suit better for the production portfolio. Only one year after the capacity was fully used due to outbreak of the First World War. Kone ja Silta produced ammunition and other military supplies and repaired Imperial Russian Navy ships. In the meantime, the demand of separators and other non-military supplies decreased. Although the military paid good prices for the products, getting raw material from Central Europe became impossible. The headcount was 700 before the war and it reached 3 000 in 1916. The value of Russian ruble decreased in relation to Finnish mark; in 1917 the company suffered loss of 2 million marks due to inflation of the ruble. A new separator factory, designed by architects Armas Lindgren and Bertel Liljequist, was built on nearby Haapaniemenkatu in 1916. The October Revolution in 1917 put an end to the military supply orders, and at the end of the year the company employed just barely 800 people any more. While fall of the Russian market was a major loss, the company got locomotive, train car and bridge renovation orders from the newly independent state of Finland. Kone ja Silta got orders for steam ships Carelia, Finlandia and Ostrobotnia from shipowner company Atlantic. But Atlantic fell into trouble with payments and eventually Kone ja Silta became a major shareholder of the shipping company. The company decided to run down its shipbuilding operations because the 1920s were difficult time for marine industry.Haavikko: 1917‚Äì1932; chapter 6. pp. 34‚Äì37.  Growth  Saukko at Hietalahti shipyard in 1930. SS Rigel I being launched at Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in 1936. In 1923 company Abloy, which had developed an innovative locking system, outsourced its production and marketing to Kone ja Silta. The patent was soon expired and the Abloy company was discontinued. Kone ja Silta held the rights for the brand and design and continued production of Abloy locks. The company grew heavily by acquisitions in the 1920s. In 1926 Kone ja Silta had a long order backlog of pulp machinery, which caused concerns about lack of production capacity. Therefore, Kone ja Silta bought Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad (\\"Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works\\") for 8.6 million marks in December 1926. With the acquisition Kone ja Silta got a modern workshop with a large capacity. The main line of business was repairing and building of ships, but due to low demand, the Hietalahti yard produced just 15 new vessels in 1918‚Äì1931. During 1928‚Äì1929 the Kone ja Silta production value exceeded 90 million marks, which was the highest figure since 1916. It droppen by ten million in the following accounting period and number of employees was reduced from 1,300 by nearly half. During the late 1920s the company delivered annual profit of three million marks, in 1930 the profit was just 0.8 million.Haavikko: 1917‚Äì1932; chapter 7. pp. 37‚Äì40. At the end of 1928 Kone ja Silta got offered majority of share capital of Turku-based shipbuilder Crichton-Vulcan. The yard had a good order base with significant assignments by the Finnish Navy, but it suffered of lack of capital. Kone ja Silta accepted the offer, and by end of 1931 it had already 98% ownership of the shipbuilder. In autumn 1932 Kone ja Silta bought Kotka Mekaniska Verkstad (\\"Kotka Engineering Works\\"), which owned a shipyard and engineering workshop with wide-ranging product portfolio. In addition to this, the company held number of wood processing related patents.Haavikko: 1932‚Äì1936; chapter 4. pp. 46‚Äì48. Since the beginning of the 1932 Kone ja Silta operated as a group, which owned the independent shipbuilding companies in Turku and Helsinki, and the production of the parent company was subdivided to general and separator departments. The company separator division had production in Sweden, France and Denmark.Haavikko: 1932‚Äì1936; chapter 6. pp. 50.  Great Depression  During the Great Depression in the early 1930s the sales of separators dropped. This together with the recent large acquisitions started to cause financial problems to Kone ja Silta. The company main owner Robert Mattson blamed manager Robert Lavonius about neglectful management of the separator division, in particular in the Swedish subsidiary. According to Mattson, Lavonius had transferred losses to the Swedish branch by too high invoice values. Mattson also wanted to set another engineer, his son-in-law Carl V. √ñstman, to assist the separator department manager Heikki H. Herlin. Lavonius saw this unnecessary, because the problems did not originate from production but from sales. After Lavonius fired the Swedish branch Aktiebolaget Lacta Separator manager, who was also Mattson's son-in-law, there emerged a permanent conflict between the management and main owner. As the parties could not agree the conflict, the main funding bank Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki (PYP) named an external consultant to monitor the separator division management practices. In early 1932 Kone ja Silta got a 34-million-mark ship order from Soviet Union. The order included a tanker ship, 12 tugboats and 23 motor cutters. The vessels were produced at the company's shipyards in Turku and Helsinki. The order was vital during the depression and a significant opening to the Soviet market, which led to another order in 1934. In addition, the yards built two coastal defence ships and one submarine for the Finnish Navy. The Finnish railway network development led to some bridge orders. Kone ja Silta invested on enamel production and started producing weighing scales under brand Toledo.  Takeover by W√§rtsil√§  Julius Osberg had owned 27% of the share capital in 1899. The company had become stock listed in 1915 and later the main owner with 50.4% share became √Öland-born shipowner Robert Mattson, who had created significant property during the First World War, but run into debt in the 1920s. His creditor PYP considered him unstable debtor and kept his over 20 000 Kone ja Silta shares in its vault. After Mattson's death in May 1935, the bank wanted to liquidate the property. PYP calculated being able to recover its losses, if it could sell the shares for unit price of 1 600 ‚Äì 1 700 marks. Robert Lavonius considered 1 300 marks as a realistic price, because the share value in stock exchange was 1 100 marks. The bank reduced the price to 1 500 marks in the same autumn. According to rumours, Jacob Wallenberg from the Swedish Stockholms Enskilda Bank reached over Kone ja Silta; whether this was true or not remains uncertain, but it certainly mobilised the patriotically oriented Finnish industrialists. Wilhelm Wahlforss, manager of Karelian W√§rtsil√§ ironworks, visited Lavonius on 17 October suggesting an arrangement in which Kone ja Silta would have sold its share of Crichton-Vulcan to W√§rtsil√§ for its nominal value; after this Crichton-Vulcan would have funded the pledged shares of Mattson by a loan that was to be guaranteed by W√§rtsil√§. The companies had a significant size difference: the Karelian ironworks had share capital of 30 million marks and 60 million marks' turnover, whereas the multi-industrial engineering company's share capital was 50 million and annual sales of nearly 250 million marks. Lavonius rejected Wahlforss's offer. The board of W√§rtsil√§ met on 23 October and left on the following day an offer of 1 560 marks unit price for Mattson's shares. Lavonius started urgently to collect a consortium for a competitive offer, but he could not reach the most needed board members Curt Mattson and Jacob von Julin. He tried to convince the bank representative of the board, Rainer von Fieandt, that it would be better if the ownership of Kone ja Silta was decentralised, and suggested that the subsidiaries and the consortium would share the costs of the shares. Lavonius tried intensively to collect the consortium but his efforts were wasted ‚Äì the bank and Mattson's estate representatives agreed selling the shares to W√§rtsil√§. The acquisition was sealed first in W√§rtsil√§ general meeting 8 November and signed on 15 November. The owners of W√§rtsil√§ trusted Wahlforss, and the transaction was funded by increasing the company capital. The share capital was increased from 30 million to 72 million marks within one year. The acquisition has some dubious characters. Wahlforss had deliberately invited representatives of Mattson's estate for a long meeting in a locked hotel cabinet in order to prevent Lavonius to reach them. Moreover, Kone ja Silta board member Rainer von Fieandt was also member of board in PYP, as well as in W√§rtsil√§. The acquisition was significant in the contemporary scale of the Finnish engineering industry. Many were relieved, because Kone ja Silta had ended in Finnish ownership, but there were also skeptic views. Many doubted, how could an east Finnish ironmill, which had just recently recovered from a serious funding crisis, manage a large engineering company that possessed virtually the entire shipbuilding industry of Finland. Wahlforss appointed himself chairman of the board in Kone ja Silta in December 1935. During the following months he changed the company articles radically, fired Lavonius and replaced him by Yrj√∂ Vesa. The company was delisted in November 1936 and fully incorporated into W√§rtsil√§ in July 1938.  As a W√§rtsil√§ subdivision  W√§rtsil√§ Kone ja Silta bridge construction workshop in 1949.

Still in 1938 W√§rtsil√§ bought Taalintehdas steel foundry, becoming the largest company of Finland in number of personnel. In the 1960s the Kone ja Silta works in S√∂rn√§inen had a versatile portfolio, including structures for nuclear power plants, steel bridges, pulp machinery, paper machines and printing machines. Decision of moving to larger premises was made already in the 1960s, and the production was eventually moved to a new engineering works opened in J√§rvenp√§√§ in 1970. The new factory focused on paper machine production. Production of Abloy locks was moved to a new factory in Joensuu already in 1968.  Successors  The J√§rvenp√§√§ factory was sold to Valmet in 1986 as a part of arrangement in which Valmet shipyards were moved under W√§rtsil√§ Marine. Later it became a part of Metso paper machine industry. The Abloy factory in Joensuu belongs nowadays to Swedish ASSA Abloy group. Large part of the Kone ja Silta complex in S√∂rn√§inen was demolished in 1972, giving way to Merihaka buildings. The old separator factory served for a while the 1988 founded Finnish Competition Authority (FCA).

Summary Tyler's story encompasses three generations of the Whitshank family, wandering back and forth over 7 decades of the 20th century. As in many of her previous novels, Tyler explores the resentments that develop and fester between siblings, spouses, and in parent-child connections‚Äîas well as their affectionate bonds. ‚ÄúShe predisposes her characters to crave the unattainable‚Äîparental love (in both directions), a sense of belonging, ‚Ä¶ forgiveness, amnesty from familial wrongdoing, the comfort of home.‚Äù Much of the story is built around Abby‚Äîas mother of four, as wife, as daughter-in- law‚Äîand around a sprawling Baltimore house with a huge wrap-around porch and the ‚Äúpower to draw the family back to it over generations.‚Äù The house almost acts like an additional character, interacting with builders, repairers, and family members coming and going. The story‚Äôs principal characters include a mysterious prodigal son (Denny) who has a hard time with commitment (to his family, to any job, career, project, or partner); an ‚Äúadopted‚Äù (unsanctioned) and reliable son (Stem) and his beautiful, evangelical, overly helpful wife (Nora); Abby‚Äôs husband Red, the ‚Äúmaintainer‚Äù of the capacious house that his socially mobile, ‚Äúbackwoods‚Äù father (Junior) originally built for another family; and Junior's wife (Linnie) who entrapped him at age 13. ‚ÄúGive or take a few details, this extended/blended/fouled-up family could be any of ours. That makes it ‚Ä¶ quintessential Anne Tyler.‚Äù Reviews The New York Times veteran reviewer Michiko Kakutani has reviewed many of Tyler's novels and given both glowing and highly critical reviews. This novel she found substandard: ‚ÄúIt recycles virtually every theme and major plot she has used in the past and does so in the most perfunctory manner imaginable‚Ä¶.A disappointing performance by this talented author, who seems to be coasting on automatic pilot.‚Äù A second The New York Times reviewer, Rebecca Pepper Sinkler, gave a much more positive review: ‚ÄúTyler has a knack for turning sitcom situations into something far deeper and more moving. Her great gift is playing against the American dream, the dark side of which is the falsehood at its heart:that given hard work and good intentions, any family can attain the Norman Rockwell ideal of happiness‚Ä¶‚Äù The New Yorker magazine also provided a positive, though brief, account: ‚ÄúThis airy saga examines three generations of a Baltimore family. In warm, lucid prose, Tyler skips back and forth through the twentieth century to depict the Whitshanks‚Ä¶The narrative is as nebulous and interconnected as a long conversation with a relative, peppered with family sects, well-worn anecdotes, and accounts of domestic squabbles....‚Äù Awards On April 13, 2015, A Spool of Blue Thread was one of six novels shortlisted for Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. The prize was established in 1996 for the best novel written in English by a woman of any nationality. It was also shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker Prize.

A prominent figure in the social and intellectual circles of the Bombay Presidency, primarily Poona, Chiplunkar donated his land and funds, enabling Savitri and Jyotirao Phule to start the first girls schools in India in 1851 on Chiplunkar's estate, including donating a building for the primary education of lower caste children in 1864, currently operating as the Bholagir School, Municipal School No. 4. On 19 March 1883, Chiplunkar was appointed as a member of the Poona Municipal Corporation where he effected administrative reform currently practiced, an honor given to twelve distinguished citizens including Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Jyotirao Phule, Dr. R.P. Paranjpe (KCIE), Hari Narayan Apte, Dr. Vishram Ramji Ghole, and Sir M Visvesvaraya. Chiplunkar was a founding member of the Deccan Education Society, Poona, and Fergusson College, and remained an active member of the Satyashodhak Samaj from 1858 to 1883. Known for his charismatic personality and affable nature, Hari Raoji Chiplunkar struck a friendship with the Duke of Connaught for whom he hosted a reception and banquet in 1888. Chiplunkar built the Connaught House in what is known today as Sadhu Vaswani Chowk, where the Duke and Duchess of Connaught were given a red carpet reception. It was at this banquet, on 2 March 1888 where among the royal guests, dignitaries, industrialists and preeminent families from Bombay and Poona, Mahatma Phule chose to appear as a poor farmer wearing only a short dhoti, an old shirt, and worn out shoes. He proceeded to make a stirring speech on the destitution of the untouchables and lower classes, encouraged the Duke to visit the villages of India and witness the conditions shared by nearly nineteen crore Indians living in abject poverty. He also asked the Duke convey to Queen Victoria his message about emancipating the masses through education. Social reformer Savitribai Phule was present at Hari Raoji Chiplunkar's funeral in 1896.

It is distinguished by the small size and arrangement of its leaves combined with its small spikes of white or cream flowers. Description Melaleuca quadrifaria grows to the size of a large shrub up to tall usually with dark fibrous bark, sometimes with gey or brown papery bark. Its leaves are small and arranged in alternating pairs at right angles to those above and below (decussate) so that they form four rows along the branches. The leaves are long, wide, narrow oval in shape, half-moon shape in cross-section and tapering to a blunt point or rounded end. The flowers are white or cream and are arranged in small heads or spikes on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 2 to 9 groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 9 to 13 stamens in each bundle. The main flowering time is summer and is followed by fruit which are small, roughly spherical, woody capsules, long, with a star shaped opening, scattered or in small clusters along the stems. Scaddan Road M. quadrifaria bark Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca quadrifaria was first formally described in 1886 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Southern Science Record\\". (The description was not formally published but a page proof was distributed by Mueller.) The specific epithet (quadrifaria) is derived from the Latin meaning \\"four\\" and meaning \\"-fold\\" referring to the decussate or \\"four-fold\\" arrangement of the leaves. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs from the Newdegate area and east as far as the border region with South Australia including parts of Fraser Range Station, Cape Arid National Park and Balladonia in the Coolgardie, Hampton, Mallee and Nullarbor Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in clay, sand and loamy soils over limestone on flats and around salt lakes. Conservation This species is common throughout its range and is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses Horticulture Although not an especially attractive plant for horticulture, this species is a useful shrub in arid areas with limestone soils. Essential oils The leaves of Melaleuca quadrifaria contain significant quantities of essential oils, especially the monoterpene, 1,8-cineole (Eucalyptol).

It has been a protected site since the revision of the Hamburg Monument Protection Law (Hamburger Denkmalschutzgesetz) in 2013.Denkmalliste Altona (pdf)  History  The main cemetery of Altona was planned from 1913 by Ferdinand Tutenberg, Director of Gardens of the then District of Altona. The new facility, designed as a central cemetery for the whole of Altona, was to replace the existing small church burial grounds and with its generous area of green to provide an appropriately contemporary element of town planning. Construction began in spring 1920; the first burial took place on 2 October 1923, even before the official opening on 1 November 1923. The address was given by the Mayor of Altona, Bernhard Schnackenburg, three months before his untimely death from typhus.Helmut Stubbe da Luz: Schnackenburg, Bernhard in Hamburgische Biografie, Band 2, Christians, Hamburg 2003, pp. 374‚Äì375 Tutenberg's plan was based on the concept of an \\"architectonic landscape\\" which would make possible a dignified burial even for the less well-off inhabitants of the town. To explain his intentions Tutenberg wrote in 1928: \\"A visitor to the dead will not have the view of rows of graves stretching away into the distance but through the smaller space of the little garden... will have the opportunity for inner composure\\".\\"Wer seine Toten besucht, soll nicht den Anblick weithin sich dehnender Gr√§berreihen haben, sondern soll durch den begrenzten Raum des G√§rtchens [...] die M√∂glichkeit innerer Sammlung erlangen.\\" Quoted in Barbara Leisner, Norbert Fischer: Der Friedhofsf√ºhrer. Hamburg: Christians Verlag, 1994 Thus a geometric and axial network of paths was laid out, the central axis of which was formed by the broad central avenue, now terminating in a monument honouring the fallen of World War II. To the west of this axis are alternating areas of park and woodland, and to the east the area for urn burials, laid out in concentric circles. Most burials are marked by grave steles, whereby the desired homogeneity of appearance is attained. In the wooded section however there are also some elaborate burial walls or crosses. The site has a chapel and two nurseries for the cemetery gardener. The chapel was extended by Gustav Oelsner in 1926-27 by the addition of the rectangular arcade. A crematorium was originally planned, but was never built. Up to 2012 more than 100,000 burials had taken place in the cemetery.Elbe Wochenblatt, 21 February 2012 . Viewed 24 September 2014  The present   War graves  There are 1,856 war graves from World War II, mostly civilian casualties from the bombing of Altona, but also some graves of soldiers. The present arrangement dates from the end of the 1960s, when the dead whose graves had been scattered throughout the cemetery during the war were re-buried in one spot around a high cross; the soldiers' graves are directly next to it. The graves of the bombing victims are arranged in the shape of a cross. The gravestones are in the form of either standing crosses or flat stones. The soldiers' gravestones bear only an Iron Cross and the name of deceased, without any other decoration or even the dates of birth and death.

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. The game is said to have originated in Brazil.  Objective and game play  The objective of Kemps is for a player to get four of a kind (i.e., four cards of the same rank), and then to signal this to their partner. The partner must call the name of the game to score. Prior to the game, partners confer to pick the secret non-verbal signal that will indicate to each other that they have four of a kind.https://www.pagat.com/commerce/kemps.html There are many kinds of signals, such as tapping, gesturing, or holding cards a certain way. However, signals that are below the table are illegal, and players may not make signals which have a meaning other than \\"I have four of a kind\\". Partners sit diagonal each other, with the playing surface in the middle, so that opponents have a chance to see the signals. * Each player is dealt four cards to begin the game. * Four cards are turned face up on the central playing surface. * All players may swap one of their cards for one of the central cards at any time. * If it appears that no further swaps are desired, a player will verify this (often by saying an agreed on word by all, like \\"flush\\" as in flushing the unwanted cards down the drain, or just \\"trash\\" or \\"discard\\"), clear the central four cards, and then turn up four new central cards. * Cards that have been cleared may not be retrieved, so their ranks cannot be collected in full to complete the game objective. A player may call \\"Kemps!\\" if they believe that their partner has four of a kind. If correct, the team gains a point. If not, they lose a point. If a player believes that an opponent has four of a kind, and if \\"Kemps!\\" has not been called by their partner, they may cut by calling \\"Stop Kemps!\\" (also \\"Cut!\\", \\"Counter-Kemps!\\", \\"Block!\\" or another word depending on the variant being played). When a player cuts, any opponent with four of a kind must show their cards. If they have a four-of-a-kind, then the cutting team gains a point. If not, then the cutting team loses a point.  Variations   Peanut Butter  Players call \\"Peanut Butter\\" when they believe their partner has four of a kind, and \\"Jelly\\" when they suspect their opponents. In this variant, players may use verbal signals, and agree to play a specific (odd) number of rounds at the start of the game.  Guess the Sign Kemps  In this variation of Kemps, after a correct call of \\"Kemps\\", the opposing team has an opportunity to guess the signal of the calling team. If they guess it correctly, then the point earned for the call is canceled, and neither team scores. This is used to prevent obvious signal from being used just because they work the first round.  Super series Kemps  In the Super series Kemps variation of the game four players for each side are required. The game still uses the basic principles of Kemps with two pairs competing, but at the very start both teams flip a coin and the winning side decides who will go first. There are six rounds per game, and each of the four players will play in three of the six rounds. The team who, according to the coin flip, is \\"going first\\" will have to decide their pairs for the first three rounds first. It will then swap for the second half of the game, and the other team will decide their pairs first. The supersub is a designated extra player, one for each team, that cannot call Kemps or use cards; they can only call contra-Kemps.  Three-player Kemps  Ideally played with two teams of three players each. Played the same way as normal Kemps but two of the three players must have four of a kind and the third player on the team must call Kemps. Because there is a delay for 2 of the 3 players to get four of a kind, five cards per hand are used for the fifth card to serve as decoy for the player to avoid being called \\"contra-Kemps\\" on.  Five-player Kemps (\\"Chemist\\")  In five-player Kemps, or \\"Chemist\\", each player forms two independent teams with the players sitting across from them. For this reason, each player has a unique team composition. Players directly adjacent are the only players able to counter-claim Kemps. Scoring is as in the traditional game, with a correct \\"Kemps\\" claim yielding one point for the pair of players involved in that interaction. Often this variant is played with the word \\"Chemist\\" spoken as the signal for Kemps.  You've Got Crabs  The 2018 commercial card game You've Got Crabs by Matthew Inman and Elan Lee plays as the same as the original Kemps, with some changes to team rules and a different card distribution.

His mother was Maria Louisa Roose. He had a younger brother, William Hudson Swire, born in 1830. They inherited the family business when their father died in 1847, when Swire was twenty-two years old. Later in his twenties, he went travelling in the United States and Australia.The archives of John Swire & Sons Ltd are held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/ Career Swire established Swire Bros in Melbourne, Australia in 1855. In 1865, he negotiated with Alfred Holt to expand the cotton trade with China by using Holt's Blue Funnel Line. He entered in a partnership with Richard Shackleton Butterfield, a textile manufacturer from York, and established Butterfield and Swire in Shanghai in 1867, followed by additional offices in England and the United States. A year later, in 1868, they parted ways, as Swire kept the Shanghai office and Butterfield kept the English and American operations. Swire renamed the Shanghai company Taikoo Sugar Refinery. Swire moved his main office from Liverpool to London in 1870. Together with Holt and the Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, he established The China Navigation Company to expand trade with China on the Yangtze river. Personal life He was married twice. He first married Abigail Fairrie, the daughter of Adam Fairrie, a sugar refiner from Ayrshire, in 1859. They had a son, John Swire. Abigail died in 1862. Two decades later, in 1881, he married Mary Warren, the daughter of George Warren, a shipowner from Liverpool. They had one son, George Swire.

Birner is an American linguist. Her research focuses on pragmatics and discourse analysis, particularly the identification of the types of contexts appropriate for sentences with marked word order. Research She has been part of a movement to expand the field's understanding of how information structure (one's familiarity of the referents being discussed) affects the interpretations of sentences with different word orders, especially in English utterances with constituent inversion. Inversion is the term for sentence types where the parts before and after the verb switch places. For example, (a) sentences below appear in regular, or canonical, English word order, while the (b) sentences show inversion: 1. a) Mr. Thompson was listed last. b) Listed last was Mr. Thompson. 2. a) The black cat raced into John‚Äôs kitchen. b) Into John‚Äôs kitchen raced the black cat.

The work was commissioned by the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra for the centennial of Birmingham, Alabama and was completed in 1970. The work has been recorded multiple times and remains one of Hovhaness's more popular compositions. Composition City of Light has a duration of approximately thirty minutes and is composed in four movements: #Allegro moderato #Angel of Light (Largo) #Allegretto grazioso #Finale (Largo maestoso) Though the symphony was composed for the city of Birmingham, Alabama, the city referred to in the title is one of Hovhaness's invention; Hovhaness described, \\"I was thinking of a million lights, an imaginary city...\\" He described the second movement \\"Angel of Light\\" as \\"a memory of a childhood vision I had... I was always affected by Christmas.\\" The third movement \\"Allegretto grazioso\\" is based on a dance melody Hovhaness originally wrote in high school for an operetta Lotus Blossom. Reception Music critic David Hurwitz praised the symphony for anticipating the music of Arvo P√§rt and John Tavener, adding, \\"Hearing this, it‚Äôs no wonder Hovhaness is only just coming into his own, and it‚Äôs a fitting historical irony that a composer once denigrated as backward looking should in fact turn out to be a prophet of important musical trends.\\" Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times also lauded the work, opining, \\"Enthralled with mystical Asia, Bach and mountains, Alan Hovhaness is often accused of writing formulaic, long-lined and heady counterpoint that predictably resolves into spiritually grandiose cadences. But if his music is all of a mold, in the best of it the lingering melodies are gorgeous; the fugues, fabulously opulent; the finales, downright mood- elevating.\\" Andrew Farach-Colton of Gramophone gave the symphony a more mixed response, writing, \\"...City of Light (1970) has some lovely ideas, like the surprisingly sweet and simple string melody in the middle of the 'Angel of Light' movement (beginning at 1'30\\"), and the third movement, Allegretto grazioso, which sounds like a minuet in oriental garb. The outer movements, however, outstay their welcome.\\" Conversely, Annette Morreau of BBC Music Magazine criticized the work, in addition to Hovhaness's Symphony No. 50, Mount St. Helens, commenting, \\"Both works are marshmallows, gluttonously kitsch and laboriously serious. Hovhaness‚Äôs musical style is an eclectic soup of Hollywood/Western and Hollywood/Oriental with a dash of Renaissance modalism thrown in.\\" See also *List of compositions by Alan Hovhaness References 22 1970 compositions 20th-century classical music Compositions for symphony orchestra ","title":"Symphony No. 22 (Hovhaness)"},{"id":"46448851","text":"Ray Haynes (born 24 November 1947) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray and Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Gene Conceptual translation of LSMEM1 for humans In humans, LSMEM1 is located on chromosome 7q31.1. LSMEM1 neighbors the gene IFRD1 in humans. Aliases for LSMEM1 include C7orf53, chromosome 7 open reading frame 53, and FLJ39575. The human mRNA is 1686 base pairs long and the gene contains 5 exons. The human mRNA also has a 5' UTR and a 3' UTR. The 5' UTR goes from mRNA position 1 to 341, and the 3' UTR goes from mRNA position 738 to 1686. Protein The protein LSMEM1 encodes in humans is 131 amino acids long and has a molecular weight ranging from 14.2-14.5 kDal. Its isoelectric point in humans is about 5, making it slightly acidic. LSMEM1 is an integral membrane protein and a transmembrane protein Besides its transmembrane segment, it is mainly made up of coils and relatively few beta strands. As its name implies, LSMEM1 only has one transmembrane segment. The predicted post-translational modifications to the human LSMEM1 protein are glycation and phosphorylation. There is no predicted signal peptide for the human protein. Homology/Evolution Phylogenetic tree for select orthologs of LSMEM1Human LSMEM1 evolutionary rate in comparison to a fast-evolving and a slow-evolving protein.There are no known paralogs in humans for LSMEM1. Orthologous proteins exist mainly in mammals, birds, and reptiles. There are also more distant orthologs in amphibians and sarcopterygii. LSMEM1 does not show up in invertebrates, fungi, or prokaryotes. LSMEM1 also contains a conserved domain of unknown function DUF4577. When the human protein encoded by LSMEM1 is compared to a known quickly evolving protein (fibrinopeptides) and a known slowly evolving protein (cytochrome c), LSMEM1 appears to be slowly evolving. Expression In humans, LSMEM1 is very highly expressed in skeletal muscle. In humans, LSMEM1 also shows high expression in nerve tissue, moderate expression in the uterus, testis, bone marrow, heart, and intestines, and low expression in the brain and pancreas. It also shows expression in both the fetal and adult stages of life in humans. LSMEM1 is predicted to have a 615 base pair promoter in humans just upstream of its transcriptional start site. Interacting Proteins Some transcription factors that are predicted to bind to the promoter of LSMEM1 in humans are: SRF, EVI1, SOX, ETS, LTSM, and TALE transcription factors. Many of the transcription factors thought to bind to the LSMEM1 promoter in humans have activity in biological processes like cell differentiation, cell cycle, cell growth, and development. There are 3 main proteins thought to interact with the human protein encoded by the gene LSMEM1 that were determined via two-hybrid screening (LSMEM2 and MAL) and reconstituted complex (APP) experiments. A reconstituted complex experiment detects interactions between purified proteins in vitro. The 3 proteins thought to interact with LSMEM1 are: MAL, APP, and LSMEM2. All three of these interacting proteins are integral membrane proteins, just as LSMEM1 is. Clinical Significance LSMEM1 expression levels in humans are greatly decreased in septic skeletal muscle. For humans, the LSMEM1 protein has 17 SNP missense mutations within its coding sequence. The LSMEM1 protein has been shown to be prevalent in the serum of patients with Parkinson's disease and that it binds to diagnostic biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease as a protein antigen.

No charges were brought, but Manney was fired from the force. As a result of the shooting and subsequent protests, Milwaukee police officers were equipped with body cameras. Background Dontre D. Hamilton (1983 ‚Äì April 30, 2014), of Milwaukee, was 31 years old at the time of his death. Hamilton had a history of mental illness. In 2013, he had made a suicide attempt by stabbing both sides of his neck and had been hospitalized. According to Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, Hamilton had a prior history of arrests in Milwaukee which were \\"directly connected to mental health issues.\\" Hamilton's family stated that Hamilton had been treated for schizophrenia but was not violent. In the days before his death, Hamilton told his family that he was \\"tired and hungry, and that somebody was going to kill him.\\" Shooting On April 30, 2014, Manney shot Hamilton fourteen times, killing him. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel summarized the events as follows: No additional weapons were found on Hamilton's person. Aftermath Investigation The investigation was carried out by the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation, a statewide agency, but the lead agents for the investigation were former Milwaukee police officers. The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office conducted an investigation. In December 2014, District Attorney John Chisholm found the use of force to be in self-defense and declined to prosecute. A federal investigation took place, and was closed in November 2015, with federal authorities determining that there was insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Manney. Firing of Manney After the shooting, Manney applied for duty disability, saying the shooting and its aftermath caused him to experience severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney after the shooting. In March 2015, a three-member panel of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission unanimously upheld the firing, sustaining and confirming the two conclusions of an internal investigation, which determined that: #Manney had conducted a frisking process without a reasonable suspicion. #Manney did not follow departmental \\"Defense and Arrest Tactics.\\" The firing does not affect Manney's pending disability application. Lawsuit In 2014, Jovan Blacknell was retained by the family of Hamilton. In 2017, the Hamilton family received a 2.3 million dollar settlement from the City of Milwaukee. Protests Dontre's brother, Nate Hamilton, has also since co-founded the Coalition for Justice, an organization that has led rallies, marches, and street clean-ups. The Black Lives Matter movement has also protested Hamilton's death. Policy changes In the aftermath of Hamilton's death, \\"Hamilton's family members worked with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Police Department and other city leaders to have all officers receive Crisis Intervention Team training, considered the gold standard for working with people in psychiatric crisis, by 2017.\\" Additionally, eight Milwaukee aldermen and a majority of the Milwaukee Common Council, called in December 2014 for equipping all city police officers with body cameras on an expedited basis. In October 2015, the Fire and Police Commission approved, by a 4‚Äì1 vote, a new policy requiring \\"most Milwaukee police officers to wear body cameras at all times while on duty, though they will not be required to have the devices always activated.\\" A four-phase implementation process was developed, and officers began to wear the cameras in October 2015. However, following a similar police shooting of a Milwaukee black man in 2016, the Milwaukee Police Department was criticized for not submitting a review of its new patterns and practices. Film In 2017, the film The Blood is at the Doorstep was released, which features Hamilton's family in the immediate months following his death. Directed by Erik Ljung, it was nominated for a SXSW Grand Jury Award, and won a Golden Badge Award at the Wisconsin Film Festival.

More generally, the circumcenter of mass may be defined for simplicial polytopes and also in the spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In the special case when the polytope is a quadrilateral or hexagon, the circumcenter of mass has been called the \\"quasicircumcenter\\" and has been used to define an Euler line of a quadrilateral.. The circumcenter of mass allows us to define an Euler line for simplicial polytopes. Definition in the plane Let P be an oriented polygon (with vertices counted countercyclically) in the plane with vertices V_1,V_2,ldots,V_n and let O be an arbitrary point not lying on the sides (or their extensions). Consider the triangulation of P by the oriented triangles O V_i V_{i+1} (the index i is viewed modulo n). Associate with each of these triangles its circumcenter C_i with weight equal to its oriented area (positive if its sequence of vertices is countercyclical; negative otherwise). The circumcenter of mass of P is the center of mass of these weighted circumcenters. The result is independent of the choice of point O. Circumcenter of mass of a polygon. Properties In the special case when the polygon is cyclic, the circumcenter of mass coincides with the circumcenter. The circumcenter of mass satisfies an analog of Archimedes' Lemma, which states that if a polygon is decomposed into two smaller polygons, then the circumcenter of mass of that polygon is a weighted sum of the circumcenters of mass of the two smaller polygons. As a consequence, any triangulation with nondegenerate triangles may be used to define the circumcenter of mass. For an equilateral polygon, the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide. More generally, the circumcenter of mass and center of mass coincide for a simplicial polytope for which each face has the sum of squares of its edges a constant. The circumcenter of mass is invariant under the operation of \\"recutting\\" of polygons. and the discrete bicycle (Darboux) transformation; in other words, the image of a polygon under these operations has the same circumcenter of mass as the original polygon. The generalized Euler line makes other appearances in the theory of integrable systems. Let V_i=(x_i,y_i) be the vertices of P and let A denote its area. The circumcenter of mass CCM(P) of the polygon P is given by the formula : CCM(P)=frac{1}{4 A}(sum_{i=0}^{n-1} -y_i y_{i+1}^2+y_i^2 y_{i+1} +x_i^2 y_{i+1}-x_{i+1}^2 y_i, sum_{i=0}^{n-1} -x_{i+1} y_i^2+x_i y_{i+1}^2+x_i x_{i+1}^2-x_i^2 x_{i+1}). The circumcenter of mass can be extended to smooth curves via a limiting procedure. This continuous limit coincides with the center of mass of the homogeneous lamina bounded by the curve. Under natural assumptions, the centers of polygons which satisfy Archimedes' Lemma are precisely the points of its Euler line. In other words, the only \\"well-behaved\\" centers which satisfy Archimedes' Lemma are the affine combinations of the circumcenter of mass and center of mass. Generalized Euler line The circumcenter of mass allows an Euler line to be defined for any polygon (and more generally, for a simplicial polytope). This generalized Euler line is defined as the affine span of the center of mass and circumcenter of mass of the polytope.

In 1881, he established a branch office in Chicago, which acquired cattle for his Rhode Island slaughterhouse. By 1884, fertilizer was his main business, under the name of the Darling Fertilizer Company. He also served as director or president of several companies including the Pacific National Bank of Pawtucket, the Pawtucket Gas Company, and the Swan Point Cemetery Company. Darling commissioned and was the sole owner of the Music Hall Building on Pawtucket's Main Street. The Music Hall building had a 1700-seat theater on the second floor, with three seating sections: an orchestra, balcony, and second balcony. It was considered one of the most beautiful buildings in Pawtucket. The building originally hosted opera and vaudeville performances; later it showed motion pictures. The Music Hall Building was demolished in 1970 as part of a downtown urban renewal project.

Traditionally, design criteria for FSM synthesis were speed, area or both. Following Moore's law, with technology advancement, density and speed of integrated circuits have increased exponentially. With this, power dissipation per area has inevitably increased, which has forced designers for portable computing devices and high-speed processors to consider power dissipation as a critical parameter during design consideration.M. Pedram and A Abdollahi, ‚ÄúLow Power RT-Level Synthesis Techniques: A Tutorial‚ÄùDevadas & Malik, ‚ÄúA Survey of Optimization Techniques targeting Low Power VLSI Circuits‚Äù, DAC 32, 1995, pp. 242‚Äì247  Background  Synthesis of FSM involves three major steps: # State minimization: As the name suggests, the number of states required to represent FSM is minimized. Various techniques and algorithms like implication tables, row matching, and successive partitioning algorithm, identify and remove equivalent or redundant states. # State assignment or encoding involves choosing boolean representations of the internal states of FSM. In other words, it assigns a unique binary code to each state. Selection of the right encoding technique is very critical. Since a wrong decision may result in an FSM that uses too much logic area, is too slow, consumes too much power, or any combination of these. # Combinational logic minimization uses unassigned state-codes as don't-care in order to reduce the combinational logic.  Existing encoding techniques  Following are some of the techniques which are widely used for state encoding: * In one hot encoding, only one of the bits of the state variable is \\"1\\" (hot) for any given state. All the other bits are \\"0\\". The Hamming distance of this techniques is 2. One hot requires one flip-flop for every state in FSM. As a result, the state machine is already ‚Äúdecoded,‚Äù so the state of the machine is determined simply by finding out which flip-flop is active. This encoding technique reduces the width of the combinatorial logic and, as a result, the state machine requires fewer levels of logic between registers, reducing its complexity and increasing its speed. * In binary encoding, the number of bits (b) per state depends on number of states (n). The relationship is defined by the equation: b = log2(n) In this technique, the states are assigned in binary sequence where the states are numbered starting from binary 0 and up. Clearly, the number of flip-flops used is equal to the number bits(b). Since Binary encoding uses the minimum number of bits (flip-flops) to encode a machine the flip-flops are maximally utilized. As a result, more combinatorial logic is required to decode each state when compared to One Hot. Requires fewer flip- flops when compared to One hot but hamming distance can be as worse as number of bits(b). * Gray Encoding In Gray code, also known as reflected binary code, state are assigned such that consecutive state codes differ by only one bit. In this encoding also the relationship between number of bits and the number of states is defined by b = log2(n) Number of flips-flops used and the complexity of the decoding logic is same as Binary encoding. But the hamming distance in Gray code is always 1. * Other encoding techniques Output based encoding, MUSTANG,S.

Computer-Aided Design, Vol. CAD-7, No. 12, Dec. 1988, pp.129@1300 NOVA,T. Villa, A. S. Vincentell, ‚ÄúNOVA: State Assignment of Finite State Machines for Optimal Two-Level Logic Implementation,‚Äù IEEE transactions on CAD. VOL. 9 NO. 9. September 1990, pp. 905-924  Motivation  The main idea in the design of state encoding for low power is to minimize the Hamming distance of the most probable state transitions, which reduces switching activity. Thus, a cost model for minimizing power consumption is to have a minimum-weighted Hamming distance(MWHD). For counters, Gray coding gives minimum switching activity, and thus is suitable for low-power designs. Gray encoding suits best when state change are sequential. In arbitrary state changing, FSM Gray code fails for low-power designs. For such FSM, one-hot encoding guarantees switching of two bits for every state change. But since the number of state variables needed is equal to the number of states, as states increase, one-hot encoding becomes an impractical solution, mainly because with an increased number of inputs and outputs to the circuit, complexity and capacitive load increase. Binary coding is worst for low power since the maximum Hamming distance is equal to the number of state variables. The need to have a solution for arbitrary state changing FSM has led to several state encoding techniques which focus on reducing the switching activity during state transitions.  Techniques   Column-based approach for low-power state assignment  L. Benini and G. De Micheli, \\"State assignment for low power dissipation\\", IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, vol. 30, no. 3, 1995, pp. 258‚Äì268 This approach aims to reduce power dissipation by sequential circuits by choosing state assignment which minimizes the switching activity between state transitions. Thus the combinational part of FSM has lower input transition probability and is more like to give low power dissipation when synthesized. This algorithm uses boolean matrix with rows corresponding to state codes and column corresponding to state variables. Single state variable is considered at a time and try to assign its value to each state in FSM, in a way which is likely to minimize the switching activity for the complete assignment. This procedure is repeated for the next variable. Since minimization technique is applied column by column this technique is called as Column based.  Multi- code state assignment  Multi-code state assignment technique implements priority encoding by restraining redundant states. Thus state can be encoded using fewer state variables (bits). Further, flip-flops corresponding to those absent state variables can be clock-gated.X. Wu, M. Pedram, and L. Wang, Multi-code state assignment for low power design, IEEE Proceedings-Circuits, Devices and Systems, Vol. 147, No. 5, pp. 271‚Äì275, October 2000.  Profiling-based state assignment  http://mmc.tudelft.nl/sites/default/files/eggermont.pdf This technique utilizes dynamic loop information extracted from FSM profiling data for state assignment in-order to reduce switching activity. Following are the steps this technique uses: # FSM state profiling collects information about the dynamic behavior of the FSM for a relevant input data set # Loop detection searches for loops in the state trace and each loop is stored and counted to obtain the frequency of the loops. # State assignment assigns state variables to each state based on the data gathered in the first two steps in order to minimize the switching activity. There are three algorithm to assign state variables, :::* Basic DFS state assignment algorithm :::* Loop-based DFS state assignment algorithm :::* Loop-based per-state heuristic state assignment algorithm  Other techniques  * Some techniques encode state transition graph(STG) to produce two-level and multi-level implementations targeting low powerK Roy and S Prasad.

By anecdotal accounts the roots of Mrenh kongveal appear to be uniquely Khmer. The mrenh kongveal are small in stature with bodies comparable in size to human children, and are fond of mischief. Offerings are often left to them when seeking their help. The etymology of the name given these spirits is not entirely evident in the component meanings. The Khmer word mrenh by itself is fishermen's slang for \\"one who catches fish\\" or, as a derivation from Sanskrit, \\"cancer\\". Kongveal means \\"herdsman\\", \\"guardian\\" or \\"keeper\\". Originally they were perceived to be nomadic beings in the jungle, where they were the guardian herdsmen of wild animals, especially social animals that travel in herds, such as elephants. Hunters, farmers and mahouts (elephant trappers), would make baskets to leave offerings for mrenh kongveal, to bring luck in the hunt, to help them capture young elephants and buffalo, or to ward wild animals away from their crops. Today mrenh kongveal are thought of as akin to supernatural guardians, associated with a person, place, or institution. They protect or offer guidance to their benefactors, usually through telepathy (heard as whispers) or influencing dreams. They can't be seen by adults but belief holds that they can make themselves appear to children between the ages of 6 and 14 who are \\"pure of heart\\", and many Cambodians claim to have seen mrenh kongveal as children.  Romanization  There is no single accepted system of transliterating the Khmer alphabet. The spelling used is that most commonly found in Western scholarly work. Variants include m'ring kung veal, mereng kung veal, merang keng veal, mre√± ganval and mr√©n kongvial. Notes  References  *BuddhasƒÅsanapandity (1967), Dictionnaire cambodgien, Tome 1, K.M.

It is similar to Melaleuca plumea with its pink or purple flowers but is distinguished from that species by its lack of fluffy hairs on the flowers and its spherical clusters of fruits. Description Melaleuca rigidifolia is a bushy shrub with fibrous bark usually growing to a height of about . Its leaves are arranged alternately, long and wide, glabrous and linear, lance-shaped or narrow oval in shape. The flowers are deep pink to purple, in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter with 4 to 9 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 2 to 6 stamens. Flowers appear between July and December. The fruit that follow are woody capsules long forming almost spherical clusters. M. rigidifolia leaves and flowers M. rigidifolia fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca rigidifolia was first formally described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la classe physico-mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint- Petersburg\\". The specific epithet (rigidifolia) is from the Latin words rigidus meaning \\"stiff\\", \\"hard\\" or \\"inflexible\\" and folia meaning \\"leaves\\" referring to the stiff leaves of this melaleuca. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca rigidifolia occurs in and between the Stirling Range, Albany, Lake Cronin and Esperance districts in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in a range of vegetation associations and soils on salty claypans and gravel pits and sometimes near railway lines.

The church was commissioned in 1606 by the Marchese Cesare de Soresina Vidoni, in part to house his brother Pietro, who had become a monk in the Order of Discalced Carmelites, and established a convent alongside this church. The exterior was left unfinished in part to demonstrate the vows of poverty of the order. In 1805, the order was suppressed and the remaining monks were relocated to Lodi and Crema. This church was joined to the parish church of San Clemente, thus adding the name. The church has three chapels on each side. The semi-Corinthian columns are odd, since they end in laurel, and not acanthus, leaves. The main altarpiece once held a painting depicting the Virgin and child with St Bishop Imerio and St Jerome, by Luigi Miradori. He also painted a canvas with Saints of the Carmelite order.Nuova guida di Cremona, by Giuseppe Picenardi, Cremona, 1820, pages 224-226. The main altarpiece is now a Virgin and Child by Margherita Caffi. The first chapel altarpiece on the right depicts the Virgin and Child with St. Anthony (1687) by Giovanni Battista Natali. The third chapel has Rest on the Flight to Egypt by Luigi Miradori (known as il Genovesino). In the first chapel on the left is an altarpiece depicting St John preaching in the Desert by Roberto De Longe, while in the third chapel there is a St Teresa in Prayer (1648) by Angelo Massarotti.

Early years Riordan was born at Mareeba, Queensland, to parents William Riordan and his wife Mary (n√©e Walsh) and was educated at state schools in both Chillagoe and Cairns. When he left school he worked as a meatworker, miner, cane-cutter, and navy. He spent about eight years working on the wharves in Bowen, ending up as secretary of the Waterside Workers' Federation. Political career Riordan first entered politics as an alderman on the Town of Bowen council. In March 1936, the member for the state seat of Bowen, Charles Collins, died and a by-election was held on the 20 June of that year. Riordan was nominated as the Labor Party candidate and went on to win the seat over John Smith of the Country Party. He held the seat for eight years before surprisingly losing to Fred Paterson of the Communist Party at the 1944 state election. After losing his seat, Riordan found work as a field officer for the State Employment Council and in 1947 he was the private secretary to his nephew, Bill Riordan, who was the Minister for the Navy in the Second Chifley Ministry. At the 1950 state election, Riordan stood for the reincarnated seat of Flinders, defeating the Country Party candidate, Mr G. H. Stuart by 297 votes. He held the seat unopposed in 1953, and remained the member until his death the next year. During his time in Parliament, Riordan was Temporary Chairman of Committees on four occasions between 1941 and 1952, Government Whip from 17 December 1942 until 14 April 1944, and Secretary for Mines and Immigration from 10 March 1952 until his death. Personal life On 5 May 1930, Collins married Violet Alice Locke (died 1993), and together had ten daughters. Along with his Nephew, Bill Riordan, Ernest Riordan had two brothers who were also members of the Queensland Parliament.

The theater, part of the Paramount Theatres chain, debuted with a matinee showing of Rhythm on the River, starring Bing Crosby and Mary Martin. Purchased by Griffith for $165,000 in 1970 and renamed the Pussycat, he created three different theaters within: the Pussycat, the center theater, was a 900-seat theater that showed adult films including Deep Throat; the Kitty Cat featured female performers; and the Tomcat featured male performers.

The siege was lifted on 3 February 2016, as a result of a Syrian government offensive. Background Fighting in the Aleppo Governorate began on 10 February 2012. Over the next five months, major clashes left large parts of the rural countryside under rebel control, while the provincial capital, Aleppo city, remained firmly under government control. On 19 July 2012, rebel forces stormed the city and the battle for Aleppo began, which reached a stalemate by September that dragged on over the following years, with the city divided between the two opposing forces. Siege Map of the siege The majority-Shiite towns of Nubl and al-Zahraa, with a combined population of 35,000‚Äì60,000, were placed under siege by the opposition group the Free Syrian Army (FSA), starting in July 2012. Movement out of Nubl was severely curtailed and relied on goods being airlifted by the Syrian Army. Although relations between the inhabitants of Nubl and the surrounding villages were normally friendly, during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, anti-government supporters from nearby Sunni villages claimed that Nubl and al-Zahraa hosted pro-government militias that launched attacks against opposition supporters. There were numerous tit-for-tat kidnappings between Nubl and pro-opposition villages in the vicinity.Hendawi, Hamza. In Syria, Sunni rebels besiege Shiite villages. Yahoo News. Originally published by Associated Press. 2012-10-18,Landis, Joshua. Clinton Helps Shape New Syrian Gov in Exile Syria Comment. 2012-11-01. After months of rebel siege and continuous reciprocal kidnappings, popular committees in the two towns agreed to begin negotiations with Sunni rebels on 27 March 2013. The agreement to negotiate was organised by Kurdish parties from the neighbouring Kurd Dagh region, controlled by the Kurdish-led PYD. The talks were to be brokered by Kurds, and several kidnapped individuals had been freed on both sides. Over the following years, the only land route that brought some food and essential goods came from the Kurdish-held town of Afrin, to the north. In mid-2013, 125 Hezbollah fighters were sent via helicopters to reinforce the government defenses. In February 2014, al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front and other Islamist groups captured the al-Ma‚Äôamel industrial area in the south of al-Zahraa. On 23 November 2014, the al-Nusra Front, along with other Islamist factions, started a three-front assault on the two towns and seized the industrial area southeast of al-Zahraa. They also advanced into the eastern outskirts of Nubl, which they targeted with dozens of mortar shells and dozens of hell cannon shells, after capturing buildings that were part of the first government line of defense. Beside the regular government troops, the towns were defended by its villagers. By the next day, both areas were recaptured by government forces. Between eight and 43 rebels were killed during the two-day offensive. Local civilians greet Syrian Army soldiers following the siege's end On 8 January 2015, a new rebel offensive, led by the al-Nusra Front, was launched against Nubl and Al-Zahraa. The first attack wave succeeded in breaking the first defensive line in both East Nubl and South Al-Zahraa in the factory area and lasted during the night. The attack was repelled by NDF and Hezbollah troops leading to the death of 14 rebels and 11 pro-government fighters. The rebels also lost four tanks, three of which were seized. Before being forced to retreat from the eastern part of Nubl, the rebels managed to capture the town's first and second roundabouts. During the fighting, a series of air raids reportedly destroyed rebel reinforcement convoys coming from Al-Maayer. The next day, a second attack was also repelled. By 14 January, the military secured Nubl and claimed that al-Nusra suffered 250 dead during the offensive. In mid-February, the Syrian Arab Army and its allies launched a major offensive in the northern Aleppo countryside, with the aim of cutting the last rebel supply routes into Aleppo city, and relieving the rebel siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa. They quickly captured several villages, but bad weather conditions and an inability to call up reinforcements stalled the government offensive. A few days later, the rebels launched a counter-offensive, retaking two of four positions they had lost to Syrian government forces. During the fighting in February 2015, 18 members of the Iraqi Shiite militant group Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba were reportedly killed while defending Nubl and Al-Zahraa. On 17 April 2015, the NDF and Hezbollah recaptured the al-Ma'amel industrial area and by 19 April, Syrian government sources reported that 44 rebels and 12 soldiers had been killed. Breaking siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa On 1 February 2016, a new offensive was launched by the military to reach Nubl and Al-Zahraa. By 2 February, they had captured three villages and part of a fourth, advancing to within three kilometers of the two besieged towns. Throughout 1 and 2 February, 320 air-raids were conducted against the rebels. At the same time, Hezbollah and government fighters from Nubl and Al-Zahraa launched their own assault and reportedly managed to gain some ground on the outskirts of the nearby town of Bayanoun. On 3 February, the military had finally broken the rebel siege on the two Shiite towns, after securing the village of Mu‚Äôarrassat al-Khan, where the approaching force and fighters trying to break out from the two towns linked up. The pro-opposition SOHR reported the advance, which also cut the last northern rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo city, was assisted by \\"heavy\\" Russian air strikes. An opposition politician described the government's encirclement of Aleppo as a \\"horrible development\\", while in contrast the mayor of Nubl stated the rebel siege was \\"cruel and caused much hardship\\". More than 100 rebels, 64‚Äì66 soldiers and 18‚Äì45 civilians were killed during the operation. Among the dead were 11 rebel commanders, 20 pro-government fighters from the two towns and 14 Iranian IRGC members, including Iranian 2nd Brigadier General Mohsen Ghajarian. In all, more than 500 Russian and Syrian air-strikes and barrel bombs hit rebel positions during the two-day offensive. The following day, the military advanced further and captured the town of Mayer, adjacent to Nubl and Al-Zahraa, as well as reportedly Kafr Naya. Meanwhile, further north, the Kurdish YPG seized two villages from the rebels.

Her interdisciplinary work explores a wide range of cultural and artistic forms, including documentary film, memoirs, music and dance performances, literature, and visual art. Early life and education Ann Cvetkovich was born to Joseph J. Cvetkovich and Valerie Haig-Brown, who were married at the time. Ann grew up in Canada, being raised in Vancouver and Toronto. She moved to the U.S. in 1976 in order to attend Reed College, receiving her B.A. in English and Philosophy in 1980. She then attended Cornell University, completing her Ph.D in English Literature in 1988. Ideas and scholarship Cvetkovich's scholarship is wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. While some of her early work is historical, dealing with Victorian literature and mass culture, most of her work engages with more contemporary cultural texts and political issues. All of her work, though, is shaped by her interest in feeling as both a subject of exploration and framework for analysis. In her article, ‚ÄúHistories of Mass Culture: From Literary to Visual Culture‚Äù (1999), Cvetkovich expresses her concern about her seemingly unrelated interests ‚Äì her engagement with both the Victorian and the contemporary, as well as both the literary and the visual ‚Äì and discusses the way they are interconnected: While many scholars in cultural studies draw distinctions between affect, feeling, and emotion, Cvetkovich does not emphasize the differences between these categories.For example, see Rather she uses both affect and feeling ‚Äúin a generic sense,‚Äù where affect is ‚Äúa category that encompasses affect, emotion, and feeling, and that includes impulses, desires, and feelings that get historically constructed in a range of ways.‚ÄùAnn Cvetkovich, Depression: A Public Feeling (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 4. She favours the term feeling, though, because it retains ‚Äúthe ambiguity between feelings as embodied sensations and feelings as psychic or cognitive experiences.\\"Cvetkovich, Depression, 4. Cvetkovich's work is associated with the Public Feelings project, which was begun in 2001.Ann Cvetkovich, ‚ÄúPublic Feelings,‚Äù The South Atlantic Quarterly 106, no.3 (2007): 460. It is not only a feminist project, but also a queer project, though ‚Äúit is not always announced as such.‚ÄùCvetkovich, ‚ÄúPublic Feelings,‚Äù 461. The Public Feelings project is interested in the relationship between the public and political and the private and affective. It emphasizes the significance of everyday life and affective experience. One of the cells of the project is Feel Tank Chicago, which came up with the idea of ‚Äúpolitical depression,‚Äù a concept Cvetkovich works with substantially in her book Depression: A Public Feeling (2012). Scholars aside from Cvetkovich whose work is associated with the Public Feelings project include Lauren Berlant, Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz, Deborah Gould, Rebecca Zorach, Kathleen Stewart, Lisa Duggan, Mary Patten, Janet Staiger, and Ann Reynolds. Cvetkovich's scholarship engages with various genres and artistic media and is often collaborative. Amongst other topics, she has analyzed and discussed AIDS documentaries and films; butch and femme sexualities and emotions; go-go dancing in relation to sexuality and activism; Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic; and oral interviews with Afghan Americans in relation to 9/11. She has also interviewed artists and photographers such as Allyson Mitchell, Sheila Pepe, Tammy Rae Carland, and Zoe Leonard, engaging with their visual works in her scholarship. Overview of major works Mixed Feelings: Feminism, Mass Culture, and Victorian Sensationalism (1992) Mixed Feelings is based on Cvetkovich's PhD dissertation, which she completed at Cornell University in 1988.Ann Cvetkovich, Mixed Feelings: Feminism, Mass Culture, and Victorian Sensationalism (New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1992), ix. It grew out of Cvetkovich's ‚Äúown mixed feelings about a feminist politics of affect,‚Äù and argues that the effects of affect are not always liberating;Cvetkovich, Mixed Feelings, 1. rather, affect can ‚Äúcall attention to and obscure complex social relations, and can both inspire and displace social action.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Mixed Feelings, 5. Thus, Cvetkovich's study is a nuanced exploration of affect and politics. In looking at the figure of ‚Äúthe transgressive and/or suffering woman‚Ä¶Cvetkovich traces the construction of affect as both natural and particularly female, and as therefore potentially transgressive and requiring regulation and control.‚ÄùPamela Gilbert, \\"Review of Mixed Feelings,\\" Studies in the Novel 26, no.4. (1994): 438. While Cvetkovich interrogates the way Marxist, feminist, Foucauldian, and psychoanalytic theories have engaged with affect, she also draws upon these approaches in her study. Important to Cvetkovich's argument is the idea that affect should not be viewed as natural, but instead as historical. In Mixed Feelings, Cvetkovich primarily explores the politics of affect in relation to Victorian sensationalism in the 1860s and 1870s. While she focuses mostly on traditional Victorian sensation novels such as Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Ellen Wood's East Lynne, she also looks at works that are not typically read as Victorian sensationalism. One chapter looks at George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, where she reads Gwendolen's ‚Äúdramatic interiority‚Äù in relation to the affective power of sensation novels.Cvetkovich, Mixed Feelings, 129. Another reads Karl Marx's Capital as a sensationalist narrative; while most of the works Cvetkovich studies sensationalize the figure of the middle-class woman, Capital sensationalizes the male worker's body.J. Gerard Dollar, \\"Book Review: Mixed Feelings,\\" Victorian Studies 37, no. 2 (1994): 334. Although Mixed Feelings focuses primarily on Victorian sensationalism, the book also contains discussions of AIDS activism and the politics of affect in relation to ACT UP. An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures (2003) In An Archive of Feelings, Cvetkovich argues for a wider view of trauma that moves beyond those who experience it directly by also taking into consideration its everyday and cultural effects. She states, ‚ÄúI am interested not just in trauma survivors but in those whose experiences circulate in the vicinity of trauma and are marked by it. I want to place moments of extreme trauma alongside moments of everyday emotional distress that are often the only sign that trauma's effects are still being felt.‚ÄùAnn Cvetkovich, An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures (Durham: Duke University Press, 2003), 3. Furthermore, Cvetkovich not only sexualizes and queers trauma in her book, but she also critiques the pathologization of trauma and argues for a broader understanding of therapy. She breaks the binary ‚Äúoften animated in trauma studies scholarship between acting out (frequently pathologized or designated unhealthy) and working through (often viewed as psychologically positive).‚ÄùErica Meiners, \\"Book Review: An Archive of Feelings,\\" NWSA 16, no. 3 (2004): 224. Cvetkovich suggests that the public cultures formed around trauma ‚Äì trauma cultures ‚Äì can have therapeutic effects. Collapsing the boundary between privatized emotion and the public and political, ‚Äúaffective life can be seen to pervade public life.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Archive of Feelings, 10. As its title suggests, Cvetkovich's book is ‚Äúorganized as ‚Äòan archive of feelings,'‚Äù and is ‚Äúan exploration of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded not only in the content of the texts themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Archive of Feelings, 7. According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives of gay and lesbian cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the very concept of the archive.Cvetkovich, Archive of Feelings, 7-8. Cvetkovich's sources ‚Äì her archive ‚Äì include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory. An Archive of Feelings focuses specifically on lesbian and queer trauma. Cvetkovich explores works on butch and femme sexualities in relation to trauma and touch, as well as the complex relationship between incest, lesbianism, and queerness; here, she analyzes performances by Tribe 8 at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and works by Margaret Randall and Dorothy Allison. Another section of Cvetkovich's book discusses trauma and queer diaspora in Frances Negr√≥n-Muntaner's film, Brincando el charco; Pratibha Parmar's film, Khush; and Shani Mootoo's novel, Cereus Blooms at Night. Furthermore, An Archive of Feelings contains substantial discussion on AIDS activism, particularly in relation to the organization ACT UP. Drawing upon oral interviews with lesbians who participated in ACT UP ‚Äì as well as memoirs about caretaking during the AIDS crisis ‚Äì Cvetkovich seeks to place lesbians back into the history of ACT UP during a time when the organization was ‚Äúin danger of being remembered as a group of privileged gay white men without a strong political sensibility.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Archive of Feelings, 158. In their testimony, these interviews and memoirs form an archive of feelings, producing a lesbian public culture where affective life and political life coalesce. Depression: A Public Feeling (2012) In Depression: A Public Feeling, Cvetkovich looks at ‚Äúdepression as a cultural and social phenomenon rather than a medical disease.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Depression, 2. She interrogates the biological model of depression and suggests the significance of both cultural criticism and individual experience as alternative ‚Äì and perhaps even more important ‚Äì knowledges of depression. Situating her work in relation to the larger Public Feelings project, she links the private world of feelings to the public world of politics, associating depression with neoliberal capitalism. While Cvetkovich explores how feelings of depression ‚Äúare produced by social forces,‚Äù she also emphasizes the ordinary and everyday aspects of depression and tries to capture ‚Äúhow it feels.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Depression, 14. Thus, her work is influenced by Eve Sedgwick's argument for a reparative critical approach.Gillian Harkins, \\"Review of Depression: A Public Feeling,\\" Feminist Theory 15, no. 2 (2014): 209. Divided into two sections, Cvetkovich's book is part personal memoir and part critical essay. Drawing together these genres of writing, Cvetkovich's aim is to produce ‚Äúa cultural analysis that can adequately represent depression as a historical category, a felt experience, and a point of entry into discussions not only about theory and contemporary culture but about how to live.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Depression, 23. The memoir section of Cvetkovich's book, ‚ÄúThe Depression Journals,‚Äù focuses on the feelings of anxiety and despair surrounding important events in her academic career ‚Äì finishing her dissertation, landing an academic job, and getting a contract for her first book ‚Äì as well as how these feelings affected her everyday life (for example, while grocery shopping). Although she notes her experiences with medication and therapists in the hopes of overcoming her depression, she focuses more substantially on the ordinary things that helped her move out of being ‚Äòstuck': swimming, writing, spending time with friends, doing yoga, going to the dentist. The critical section of Cvetkovich's book provides analysis into some of the topics brought up in ‚ÄúThe Depression Journals.‚Äù Playing a part in Cvetkovich's memoir, spirituality and religion are also discussed in her critical essay. For Cvetkovich, acedia ‚Äì ‚Äúa form of spiritual crisis‚Äù that is understood to be an historical precursor to depression ‚Äì can help provide an alternative to the medical model.Cvetkovich, Depression, 85. Cvetkovich's critical essay also explores the relationship between depression and histories of racism and colonialism, tying ‚Äúhistory and depression into the emotional crises that undergird race studies.‚ÄùLinda Saladin-Adams, \\"Book Review: Depression: A Public Feeling,\\" The Journal of American Culture 37, no.2 (2014): 220. Furthermore, looking at the artistic work of Sheila Pepe and Allyson Mitchell, she views ‚Äúcrafting as a model for creative ways of living in a depressive culture.‚ÄùCvetkovich, Depression, 159. Reception and influence Cvetkovich's work has received attention from both the academic and queer community. Depression: A Public Feeling was reviewed by Elaine Showalter ‚Äì a well-known feminist critic ‚Äì as part of her piece in The Chronicle of Higher Education, ‚ÄúOur Age of Anxiety.\\" While Showalter also feels the worries Cvetkovich articulates about academia, she is ultimately critical of her emphasis on depression in higher education. She asks, ‚ÄúBut how does focusing on academic anxiety bring light to the discussion in general?‚Äù Depression: A Public Feeling, though, has also received much positive attention, being a finalist for the 25th Annual Lambda Literary Awards. Furthermore, the book was interpreted and performed by Dynasty Handbag as part of the event, ‚ÄúOtherwise: Queer Scholarship into Song.‚Äù Other works of Cvetkovich's have also been inspirational for artists. Tammy Rae Carland's 2008 photographic project entitled An Archive of Feelings takes its name from Cvetkovich's book by the same name.Ann Cvetkovich and Tammy Rae Carland, \\"Sharing and Archive of Feelings: A Conversation,\\" Art Journal 72, no. 2 (2013): 71. An Archive of Feelings is perhaps Cvetkovich's most influential work, and has been taken up in several academic fields. These include sexuality studies, queer theory, American Studies, and women and gender studies. For example, in Feeling Backward: Loss and the Politics of Queer History (2007), Heather Love relates her work to Cvetkovich's, noting that ‚ÄúAn Archive of Feelings, makes backward feelings central.‚ÄùLove, Feeling Backwards, 158. Mel Y. Chen also draws from ‚Äúthe affective politics of Ann Cvetkovich's important work on lesbian cultures of trauma‚Äù in their work on animacies.Mel Y. Chen, Animacies: Biopolitics, Racial Mattering, and Queer Affect (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 215. Furthermore, Jack Halberstam's ‚Äúinterest in a queer archive‚Äù is influenced by ‚ÄúCvetkovich's concept of archive of feelings, a term central for Halberstam.‚ÄùSara Edenheim, \\"Lost and Never Found: The Queer Archive of Feelings and Its Historical Propriety,\\" Differences 24, no. 3 (2014): 37. Similar to Cvetkovich, Halberstam sees an archive as ‚Äúnot simply a repository‚Äù but ‚Äúalso a theory of cultural relevance, a construction of collective memory, and a complex record of queer activity.‚ÄùHalberstam, In a Queer Time and Place, 169-70. While Cvetkovich's work has been influential, it has also received some criticism. Perhaps the most well-known of these critiques occurs in Eve Sedgwick and Adam Frank's article, ‚ÄúShame in the Cybernetic Fold: Reading Silvan Tomkins.‚Äù Speaking of Cvetkovich's engagement with affect in her first book, Mixed Feelings, they state: Sedgwick and Frank's critique of Cvetkovich's first book, however, is merely used as a way to challenge the ‚Äúhygiene of‚Ä¶antiessentialism‚Äù in poststructuralist theory.Sedgwick and Frank, \\"Shame in the Cybernetic Fold,\\" 515. In a footnote, they state that there are numerous other theorists (including Sedgwick herself) that are more steeped in the ‚Äúroutines of theory‚Äù of which they accuse Cvetkovich, and who are ‚Äúmore directly responsible for their popularization.‚Äù However, they chose to critique Cvetkovich's book because using a new scholar's work would allow them to more ‚Äúeffectively defamiliarize[]‚Äù the ‚Äúcritical practices‚Äù they are challenging.Sedgwick and Frank, \\"Shame in the Cybernetic Fold,\\" 512.

It shares some features with Melaleuca diosmifolia but has creamy yellow flower spikes (rather than yellow-green) and a lower, more spreading form. Description Melaleuca ringens is a dense, spreading shrub which sometimes grows to about tall but usually much less and up wide. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long and wide, glabrous except when very young, oval or lance-shaped, tapering to a point and with a stalk about long. The flowers are creamy-yellow coloured, arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering or sometimes between the leaves. The spikes are long, about in diameter and contain 10 to 60 individual flowers. This species flowers prolifically but like those of some other melaleucas, the flowers have a sickly-sweet smell. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 7 to 11 stamens. The flowering season is mainly spring and is followed by fruit which are bell-shaped, woody capsules about long and wide in clusters, the sepals remaining as teeth around the rim of the fruit. M. ringens leaves, flowers and fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca ringens was first formally described in 1992 by Frances Quinn, Kirsten Cowley, Lyndley Craven and Bryan Barlow in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (ringens) is from the Latin ringens meaning \\"gaping\\" in reference to the wide opening of the fruit. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca is confined to the D'Entrecasteaux National Park in the Warren biogeographic region growing in dense heath in sand over limestone. Conservation Melaleuca ringens is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only a few locations and is not currently in imminent danger. Use in horticulture Melaleuca ringens is sometimes marketed as a dwarf form of Melaleuca diosmifolia.

He was born in 1944 in the Rika Khana neighbourhood of Kabul, Afghanistan, to illiterate parents. He is married to Sp√¥jma√Ø Ra‚ÄôOuf Zari√¢b with whom he has three daughters. He received a degree in journalism from Kabul University, and pursued further education in Wales and New Zealand. Zaryab writes in Dari, the variety of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan. On his return to Afghanistan in the early 1970s he took a job with the prominent Zhwandoon Magazine as a crime reporter. He has said that he sought the job because it gave him material for his stories. He has continued to work as a print and TV journalist and editor throughout his career and currently (spring of 2015) works as an editor for Tolo TV in Kabul, Afghanistan‚Äôs largest private broadcaster. He has also held government positions in the Culture Ministry of Afghanistan. Zaryab lived in exile in France during the 1990s but returned to Kabul after the fall of the Taliban. His wife and three daughters live in Paris, France. Despite critical and commercial success as an author in the 1970s his ability to make a living from writing has suffered along with the prospects of the Afghani middle and intellectual classes since the time of the 1979 Soviet invasion.

It originally aired on January 19, 2012. The episode was written by Brian Young and directed by John Dahl. Plot Bonnie (Kat Graham) has a new dream where she sees herself ready to open the fourth coffin of Klaus‚Äô family but Klaus (Joseph Morgan) stops her the last moment and locks her inside of it. A woman comes and opens it and Bonnie recognizes her mother, Abby (Persia White). She talks to Elena (Nina Dobrev) about it and tells her that the witches are trying to send her a message and that her mother can help them open the coffin. Bonnie and Elena start searching for Abby and when they find her, they drive at her place to meet her. Stefan (Paul Wesley) calls Elena asking her if they found Abby but Elena lies to him so he will not follow them. Stefan knows that Elena is lying and gets on his way to Abby‚Äôs house as well. In the meantime, a hybrid appears at Abby‚Äôs house. Bonnie and Elena knock the door but no one answers until Jamie (Robert Ri'chard) appears and lets them in. He explains that he is the step son of Abby and when Abby gets home, Elena leaves to let Bonnie alone with her mother. Bonnie asks her help but Abby, after she used all of it to entomb Mikael few years ago, does not have her magic anymore. Outside the house, Elena runs into Stefan and they fight because Elena lied. Jamie- compelled by Klaus' hybrid- shoots Stefan with wooden bullets and ties up Elena. Bonnie hears the gunshot and tries to get out to check what happened but Abby drugs her and gets her into her car. Elena manages to untie herself, knock Jamie down and helps Stefan remove the wooden pieces from his chest. She also tells him that she kissed Damon (Ian Somerhalder) while Abby takes Bonnie to the hybrid. Bonnie does not want to say where the coffins are but Abby convinces her to do it to save her life while at the same time she writes her a message telling her to warn her friends about it. Later on, Abby tells Bonnie that she is willing to help her if she gets her magic back and Bonnie is the only one who can help her with that. Back in Mystic Falls, Klaus gets into the witch house where he finds Damon. He manages to make the witches reveal the coffins to him but the fourth one is missing. Damon tells Klaus that he is the one who took it and witches do not know where it is. In the meantime, Tyler (Michael Trevino) apologizes once again to Caroline, this time for biting her, and she tells her that he called her father, Bill (Jack Coleman), to help him break the sire bond to Klaus. To do that, Bill tells him that he has to turn into a wolf until he manages to make the transition painless. That way, he will not feel like he owes Klaus and he will not be sired to him anymore. Alaric (Matt Davis) starts dating Meredith (Torrey DeVitto). Damon, who believes that she might be the one who killed Brian, goes to the hospital to warn her but she injects him with vervain and takes his blood. When Alaric finds out, he asks her for explanations and she reveals to him that when she cannot do anything as a doctor, she uses vampire blood to help her patients. The episode ends with Stefan coming back home and being mad at Damon for kissing Elena and for letting Klaus take the coffins. Damon says that he managed to hide the fourth one and also reveals that he took the dagger out of the chest of one of the siblings. Back at Klaus‚Äô place, Elijah (Daniel Gillies) wakes up and Klaus is surprised to see him.

Reviews \\"The Ties That Bind\\" received positive reviews. Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating saying that the episode returned to the more typical twists and turns of the show. \\"If last week was more about the evolution of character with a little plot momentum thrown in, tonight was just the opposite. Ticking off plot boxes was more the focus [...] The reason these plot grinding episodes don‚Äôt feel like complete drags is they are all cleverly rooted in character motivations, which keeps the entire affair from careening off into the deep end of the plot churning pool.\\" Diana Steenbergen of IGN rated the episode with 8/10 pointing out that \\"...unfortunately, a lot of Damon's coolest stuff this week happened off screen [...] Finding out that Damon had decided to free Elijah was the best surprise of the night.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.8/5. \\"[The show] does many things very well: snark, romance, violence, twists, turns, bubble baths. But what the show has truly succeeded at over two-plus seasons has been a constant, fascinating through-line; a theme for each set of episodes that anchors the action and gives fans something to anticipate; a destination, if you will, a payoff to the incredible build-up.\\" Robin Franson Pruter ofForced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that it was a solid episode. \\"This episode isn‚Äôt extraordinary. Nothing big happens in it. One test of a TV series is how well its ordinary episodes, the ones without those major plot twists that get everyone talking, stand up to repeat viewing. \\"The Ties That Bind\\" does well. [...] [The episode] might not be full of memorable events, but it holds up solidly as a middle of the season episode. It illustrates that The Vampire Diaries, and good television in general, is not just about plot.\\" E. Reagan from The TV Chick gave a good review to the episode saying that it was pretty good and also commenting positive on Elijah's return. Reagan also pointed out that she is \\"super interested to see what happens with Bonnie and her mom.\\" Caroline Preece of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode even though she pointed out that after last week's high, it was probably inevitable that the latest episode would be a little bit of a disappointment. \\"...the real talking point is Elijah's surprise return. He couldn't be more welcome, and his presence should make for a cracking episode when it returns.\\" References External links * 2012 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 3) episodes Television episodes about dreams ","title":"The Ties That Bind (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"46450330","text":"Todd Anthony Dulaney (born December 20, 1983) is an American gospel musician, and former baseball player.

He belonged to the first generation of professionally trained Indonesian architects. Early life and education Liem was born in Semarang into a Peranakan Chinese family. His father, Liem Tjing Swie, was a successful textile merchant, and thus able to give his children a good Dutch education. Between 1920 and 1926, he studied architecture at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux Arts in Paris. He also gained experience while in Europe, working for a few leading architects of the day, such as Michel de Klerk and Eduard Cuypers. In 1926, he went to the Harvard-Yenching Institute in Peking to prepare for a career as a university lecturer. His life in China, however, was cut short by the chaos engendered by the Sino-Japanese War. Career in Indonesia In 1929, Liem returned home to the Dutch East Indies. The colonial authorities were initially reluctant to allow him to settle back in his homeland due to Liem's perceived leftist sympathies. His return was eventually facilitated by character references given by a number of community leaders, including the parliamentarian Loa Sek Hie. Liem was obliged not to engage in political activities. At first, he was also compelled to stay at Loa's residence in Menteng before eventually being allowed to return home to Semarang. His work can be divided into two periods: his pre- and post-war work. His pre-war work was influenced by the Amsterdam School, but always respectful of the tropical environment. His interiors betrayed the influence of the Arts and Crafts Movement, as well as the vocabulary of Chinese decorative traditions. A lot of his buildings before the Second World War were commissioned by prominent members of the 'Cabang Atas', or the established Chinese elite of colonial Indonesia. These included the politician Loa Sek Hie; the businessman Oei Tjong Hauw, son of Asia's wealthiest tycoon Majoor Oei Tiong Ham; their family company, the powerful multinational corporation Kian Gwan; the politician Han Tiauw Tjong and the landlord Tan Liok Tiauw. His work was interrupted by the Japanese Occupation, after which he moved yet again to Batavia. His post-war work included many state commissions for the newly independent Republic of Indonesia. Many of these new commissions were of national scale and importance, and reflect a minimalist kind of functionalism and sensibility. In 1959, Liem, together with Frederich Silaban and other pioneering architects founded the Ikatan Arsitek Indonesia, or the Indonesian Institute of Architects. In 1965, he left for the Netherlands with his family in order to ensure a good education for his daughters. During his trip there, Liem fell ill and died in Rijswijk in on July 28, 1966.

She has acted in several films such as Twenty Nine (1969) and The Wild Geese (1978). Miller gained notoriety for being married to Formula 1 race driver James Hunt (in 1974), and leaving him for Richard Burton in 1976.  Biography  Miller grew up in Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) with her parents, a twin sister and a brother. By the age of 24, she was a successful fashion model in Britain. She was known for being one of the \\"beautiful people\\" and for getting whatever she wanted easily. In 1974, she met Hunt in Spain. He proposed to her only weeks later, and they were married the same year. The couple were considered \\"one of the sporting world's most happily married couples.\\" The couple spent their honeymoon in Antigua with one of Hunt's close friends, also newly married, and then settled in Spain for tax reasons. Later, Miller described feeling that Hunt's career came ahead of everything else in his life. He was also frequently unfaithful and the marriage floundered. In December 1975, Burton met Miller at a Swiss ski resort and invited her to return to New York with him. Their relationship developed quickly and Burton left Elizabeth Taylor for Miller. Burton allegedly paid Hunt $1 million as part of the divorce settlement between Hunt and Miller. Miller claimed that part of the reason she initially became involved with Burton was so that she could make Hunt jealous. Miller divorced Hunt in Haiti in June 1976. After her divorce from Hunt, she and Burton had a honeymoon of sorts, and were married in August 1976 in Arlington, Virginia, U.S.A. During their marriage, Miller was reported to be jealous of Burton's ex-wife Taylor. An interesting anecdote involves Miller's jealous insistence that, while Burton was appearing in a revival of Camelot in Toronto, a page from the program displaying an advertisement of Taylor's jewelry line must be removed from every copy or Burton would not go on. Trying to keep peace with his wife, Burton acquiesed and the theatre's staff had to remove the offending page from thousands of copies of the program. The marriage between Burton and Miller ended in their 1982 divorce, which was settled in Haiti. Miller married a third time, to American millionaire Jack Cawood, a real estate developer in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and the couple moved to the United States. Ron Howard's 2013 film, Rush recounts the intrigues surrounding her former husband, Hunt, and the role of Miller is played by Olivia Wilde. At the time, it was reported that Miller was living on the Spanish island of Ibiza.

Before coming as a 'planter' to Fermanagh, Thomas Blennerhassett had a varied career including being Captain of Guernsey Castle. He was a literary man who wrote several books including Directions for the Plantation of Ulster. He was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Leonard Blennerhassett (died 1639). The castle moved to local Maguire hands when his widow, Deborah, married Rory Maguire, leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 in Fermanagh, who died in 1648. The castle subsequently returned to Blennerhassett hands, to Henry, son of Sir Leonard, who became MP for Fermanagh in 1664, and High sheriff for the county. However, by 1697 the house was being reported as ruinous. Features In 1618/19 Captain Nicholas Pynnar reported the castle as being 'a house of stone and lime, slated, two and a half storeys high'. A church was also begun and a small village of six houses. Two and a half storeys remain standing, with a square tower and loopholed windows. It is built of limestone with, on the north side, an inset centre section with a tower-like projection on either. The tombstones of the Blennerhassetts are in the grounds.

The project was organized by a reform organization based in the United States, Baohuang Hui. Unlike the reactionary Boxers, these reformers were modernizers. The Manchu government had supported the Boxers, but these reformers‚Äîof whom Sun Yat-sen was representative, opposed the government. The boycott was put into effect by merchants and students in south and central China. It made only a small economic impact, because China bought few American products apart from Standard Oil's kerosene. Washington was outraged and treated the boycott as a Boxer-like violent attack, and demanded the Peking government stop it or else. President Theodore Roosevelt asked Congress for special funding for a naval expedition. Washington refused to consider softening the exclusion laws because it responded to deep-seated anti-Chinese prejudices that were widespread especially on the West Coast. It now began to denounce Chinese nationalism.Howard K. Beale, Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power (1955) pp 212‚Äì252 The impact on the Chinese people, in China and abroad, was far-reaching. Jane Larson argues the boycott, \\"marked the beginning of mass politics and modern nationalism in China. Never before had shared nationalistic aspirations mobilized Chinese across the world in political action, joining the cause of Chinese migrants with the fate of the Chinese nation.\\"Jane Leung Larson, \\"The 1905 anti-American boycott as a transnational Chinese movement.\\" Chinese America: History and Perspectives (2007): 191-98, Quoting page 191, ExcerptGuanhua Wang, In Search of Justice: The 1905-1906 Chinese Anti-American Boycott (Harvard East Asian Monographs, 2002).Sin-Kiong Wong, \\"Die for the boycott and nation: Martyrdom and the 1905 anti-American movement in China.\\" Modern Asian Studies 35.3 (2001): 565-588.  Cold War  During the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, the U.S. provided economic and military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek regime against the Japanese invasion. In particular, the \\"China Hands\\" (American diplomats known for their knowledge of China) also attempted to establish diplomatic contacts with Mao Zedong's communists in their stronghold in Yan'an, with a goal of fostering unity between the Nationalists and Communists.John Service, The Amerasia Papers: Some Problems in the History of US ‚Äì China Relations (Berkeley, CA: Center for Chinese Studies, U of California Press, 1971), 191 ‚Äì 192. However, relations soured after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the relocation of the Chiang regime to Taiwan, together with the start of the Cold War and rise of McCarthyism in U.S. politics. While the U.S. initially expected the Chiang regime to quickly fall, China and the U.S. fought a major undeclared war in Korea, 1950‚Äì53 and, as a result, President Harry S. Truman began advocating a policy of containment and sent the United States Seventh Fleet to deter a possible communist invasion of Taiwan. The U.S. signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan which lasted until 1979 and, during this period, the communist government in Beijing was not diplomatically recognized by the U.S. By 1950, virtually all American diplomatic staff had left mainland China, and one of Mao's political goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favourable to capitalism.Michael M. Sheng, \\"Chinese Communist Policy Toward the United States and the Myth of the 'Lost Chance,' 1948‚Äì1950,\\" Modern Asian Studies 28 (1994); Chen Jian, China's Road to the Korean War: The Making of the Sino-American Confrontation (Columbia University Press, 1994) Mao initially ridiculed the U.S. as \\"paper tiger\\" occupiers of Taiwan, \\"the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself\\" and \\"monopoly capitalist groups\\", and it was argued that Mao never intended friendly relations with the U.S.Michael M. Sheng, Battling Western Imperialism: Mao, Stalin, and the United States (Princeton University Press, 1997) ch 1 However, due to the Sino-Soviet split and increasing tension between China and the Soviet Union, US President Richard Nixon signalled a diplomatic re-approchement with communist China, and embarked on an official visit in 1972. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were eventually restored in 1979. After Mao's death, Deng Xiaoping embarked on economic reforms, and hostility diminished sharply, while large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the U.S. placed economic and military sanctions upon China, although official diplomatic relations continued.The West Condemns the Crackdown, New York Times, 5 June 1989.  From 1990  Anti-American and Chinese nationalist sentiments surged following the Yinhe incident of 1993, where a Chinese ship was detained by the US Navy in international waters, allegedly containing chemical components headed for Iran, but was eventually cleared after months of inspection.\\"No chemical arms aboard China ship\\", New York Times, 6 September 1993. The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1996 has led the Chinese government to be concerned about a supposed China containment policy, and began viewing the United States as responsible for major issues that arise in the bilateral relationship between China and Taiwan, as the Chinese government believed that American support of Taiwan is an effort to weaken China. During this time, there was also a sense of disillusionment with the U.S among Chinese intellectuals, and popular books such as China Can Say No criticized U.S. foreign policy towards China and promoted grass-roots Chinese nationalism. Relations became severely strained by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, which was reported by U.S. media as an intelligence error, but cited in several foreign sources and believed by many Chinese to be deliberate. The bombing, alongside the perceived lack of apology from the U.S., led to mass protests in Beijing and other major Chinese cities. In 2001, diplomatic relations were further damaged by the Hainan Island incident, where a collision between a U.S. and Chinese aircraft resulted in the death of the Chinese pilot and detention of the 24 American crew. While the Chinese government officially condemned the September 11 attacks, The Washington Post recorded the mixed reactions among the general public after it had been reported: ‚ÄúWhile average Chinese routinely approach Americans to offer condolences for Tuesday's terrorist attacks, many others in their offices, schools and Internet chats have voiced satisfaction at what they describe as a well-deserved blow against U.S. arrogance.‚Äù A 2001 Harris poll conducted 2 months afterwards also showed that Beijing respondents were much more likely to disapprove of the U.S. government's military actions against terrorism compared to Japanese, South Korean, and American respondents. However it was noted that the Chinese discourse primarily revolved around revenge against U.S. state policy instead of hatred for Americans, and a 2002 survey of Chinese netizens in light of 9/11 found that \\"international cooperation\\" was among the policies most would favour for fighting terrorism. A Chinese media report on the 2019 anniversary of 9/11 also suggested there to be more restrained rhetoric online in discussing the topic compared to the past. = Obama administration = The election of US President Barack Obama in 2008 also signified a shift in American foreign policy towards China, and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a \\"Pivot to Asia\\", or rebalancing of U.S, strategic and economic interests in East Asia, specifically freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea. This move is widely seen as attempts to counter Chinese interests in the region, and in response, the Chinese military began their own buildup in the region, such as the creation of its own Air Defense Identification Zone. Recently, in 2009, Luo Ping, a director-general at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, criticized America's laissez-faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the United States Treasury would start to print money and depreciate the value of the U.S. dollar, thus cheapening the value of China's purchase of U.S. bonds. Chinese hackers have also conducted cyberwarfare against American institutions. Furthermore, China's leaders present their country as an alternative to the meddling power of the West. In 2013, 53% of the Chinese surveyed had a \\"very unfavorable\\" or \\"somewhat unfavorable\\" view of the U.S. A poll of 500,000 Chinese netizens, conducted by Hong Kong's Phoenix Television suggested that 60% of those surveyed agreed Osama bin Laden's death was a sad event because \\"he was an anti-US warrior\\". However, another report by Public Radio International documented more mixed responses on Chinese social media, and noted that most users did not care about his death. Quartz suggested that certain Hollywood films such as Django Unchained were allowed to slip past China's film censorship, because they depicted a negative view of American society. It alleges that the film \\"depicts one of America's darker periods, when slavery was legal, which Chinese officials like to use to push back against criticism from the United States\\". = Trump administration = There has been a significant increase in anti-US sentiment since American President Donald Trump launched a trade war against China, with Chinese media airing Korean War films. In May 2019, Global Times has said that \\"the trade war with the U.S. at the moment reminds Chinese of military struggles between China and the U.S. during the Korean War.‚Äù According to SET News, a minority of Chinese online believe that the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan is a genetic bio-attack executed by United States.

The Hindu calendar also has a lunar new year, which is religiously more significant, and falls on different dates in the Amanta and Purinamanta systems prevalent across the Indian subcontinent. The solar cycle year is significant in Odia, Punjabi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Bengali calendars. The day represents specific solar movement according to ancient Sanskrit texts. Mesha Sankranti is one of the twelve Sankranti in the Indian calendar. The concept is also found in Indian astrology texts wherein it refers to the day of transition of sun into the Aries zodiac sign. The day is important in solar and lunisolar calendars followed on the subcontinent. Mesha Sankranti falls on 13 April usually, sometimes 14 April. This day is the basis for major Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist festivals, of which Vaisakhi and Vesak are the best known. It is related to the equivalent Buddhist calendar-based New Year festivals in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, parts of Northeast India, parts of Vietnam and Xishuangbanna, China; collectively referred to as Songkran. Etymology The phrase Mesha Sankranti consists of two Sanskrit words. Sankranti literally means \\"going from one place to another, transference, course change, entry into\\" particularly in the context of sun or planets, while Mesha means sheep or Aries constellation.Sankranti, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany The term Mesha Sankranti connotes a specific day based on time keeping practices developed in the ancient Sanskrit texts of the Vedanga field of study called Jyotisha and later texts such as the Surya Siddhanta. Observance Many regional calendars have two elements: lunar and solar. The lunar element is based on the movement of the moon and counts each month from either new moon to new moon, full moon to full moon,or the day after the full moon to the next full moon.Frank Parise (2002) The Book of Calendars The lunar element forms the basis of religious calendars and begin the year in Chaitra.L.D.S.

Background The earliest mentioned document or decree referring to the Royal Guards of Poland dates back to the reign of King John II Casimir. In 1650, the newly established regiment under the command of foreign mercenaries and military commanders was entirely incorporated into the regular, main forces of the Crown over which the monarch or ruler was personally responsible and accountable for. The guards served at the royal courts of Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki (reigned as Michael I), John III Sobieski, Augustus II the Strong, Augustus III and the last king of Poland Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus. The first commander-in-chief of the modern regiment was Field Marshal Jakub Henryk Fleming, who held this post between 1717 and 1732. Guard was in service directly to the King and was paid out of the Treasury of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following a reform and the re-organization carried out in 1710, other small units directly serving for the monarch were either incorporated into the Royal Foot Guard regiment or broken down into reserves. This act was a punishment for siding with King Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski during a war with Augustus II the Strong. Reorganization in 1717 After the reorganization carried out in 1717, the Royal Foot Guards were regarded and considered as one of the most exceptionally trained, strongest and largest military formations of the Crown and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Since 1756 both the elite land troops and the mounted units served as the Royal Guard and performed a compulsory guard drill in front of Wilan√≥w Palace, the Saxon Palace and the Warsaw Royal Castle for the monarch's pleasure and perhaps for public spectacle or entertainment. Since the soldiers were responsible for protecting the palace or the royal residence, therefore they were also responsible for the protection of the reigning monarch and the royal family. Later period On October 3, 1789, after the nomination of the 26-year-old Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski to the rank of Major-General of the forces, he briefly took command of the Royal Foot Guards. Most likely, Poniatowski held the position until the spring of 1790, when he was sent as an envoy to Podolia. On the orders of King Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, on June 16, 1792, the Royal Guard soldiers and officers were dismissed or transferred to the newly created 15 Regiment. Such actions were possibly influenced by the tense economic and financial situation of the Commonwealth. Following this decision, the remaining soldiers were mobilized into two newly established units; a Battalion of Grenadiers and Battalion of Fusiliers. The Royal Guards consisted of the most exceptionally trained soldiers and most exceptional officers of the Polish Army in the late eighteenth century. The Royal Guards actively participated in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising and were responsible for the defence of Warsaw. Dress and uniform Royal Guard's uniform consisted of a red cloth jacket with white lapels and a blue or turquoise vest. An infantry soldier of the Royal Guards Regiment was armed with a flintlock rifle with an attached bayonet, possibly originating from a Prussian rifle model dating from 1722 and then upgraded by the Saxons and manufactured in the town of Suhl. An officer was required to always wear a broadsword at his side. Deputy officers had a shorter version of the rifle, but also were responsible for having a ceremonial saber and a pistol. Each soldier was equipped with a backpack and pouches in addition to a leather belt slung over his shoulder with a wooden insert and prepared sites in the form of holes or pockets for loads. During the colder seasons, the soldiers also received red coats, similar to those worn by the British Army.

Founded by veterinarian Jes√∫s L√≥pez Estudillo in the 1960s, it is a civil association created to preserve over 300 different species of birds, both Mexican and the rest of South America, Africa and Asia, mostly endangered. The association‚Äîformerly known as Wildlife ()‚Äîalso has a space for breeding and conservation of the most endangered species. The Nest is the most diverse aviary in the world and the third largest in Latin America. The logo is the quetzal, as Jes√∫s L√≥pez Estudillo was the first to achieve captive breeding of the bird, which had been a traditional symbol of freedom, characterized by not being able to survive outside its native habitat. History The origins of the Nest began in the era of the sixties, when the veterinarian Jes√∫s L√≥pez Estudillo decided to buy land with eight acres containing 10,000 trees and plants devoted to research, conservation and breeding of endangered birds. His passion for these animals led him to bring together endangered birds and perform several experiments to recreate their habitat so they could be kept in captivity. Thus, he could observe their behavior and thereby create projects that would allow the reproduction and repopulate the species most threatened by human activity and climate change. The space was mainly open to the scientific community specializing in birds, but to promote information sharing, the site was opened to the public in 2003 as an environmental education center. It allows humans to interact with nature and is designed for younger generations to teach them of the importance of conserving these species. Logo The representative bird of place and that is within your logo is the quetzal (pharomachrus), as Dr. Jos√© L√≥pez Estudillo was the first to successfully recreate their habitat. In 2012, the incubator birth of one of the chicks quetzal was aired on the Internet. The importance is that the breeding season of this bird is only once a year, where the female produces 2 eggs. This bird is an important part of the pre-Hispanic mythology, as his name is known in Nahuatl as gorgeous or beautiful. Formerly, feathers that are characterized by up to 90 cm long, were part of the plume of the Emperor Moctezuma, and elderly priests. Other areas Jaguar in captivity The site added exhibition areas for cats, primates, raptors, and exotic birds, focusing on the expanded problem of extinction.

Based on Psalm 46, it was composed in July 1765 during Mozarts' stay in London on the Mozart family grand tour as a gift for the British Museum along with one other supposed work: a set of variations in A major, K. 21a. Score The 23-bar work is scored for four voices: soprano, alto, tenor and bass, and is written in time. Lyrics God is our refuge, our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble, a present help in trouble. Influence As the manuscript for this work is still intact, one can find two separate, distinct handwritings: Wolfgang's, and his father's Leopold. It can be seen that Wolfgang most likely wrote the tempo markings, key signatures and clefs, as well as all of the notes. Leopold was suspected to have a hand in the written words after bar seven, as the young Wolfgang seemingly had trouble judging the amount of space necessary to fit in the written text (as can be seen by the wave pattern of the bar lines near measure 7). The work was possibly based on a given melody at the time of composition; perhaps stemming from a composition written in 1765 of similar character by Jonathan Battishill. God is our refuge shows many stylistic similarities to that of 16th century English church music, which Mozart was undoubtedly exposed to whilst traveling London at the time.Zaslaw, Neal.

He was the architect of several landmark buildings in India such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India building, Chennai, Ram Mohan Palace, Kochi which was once the seat of the High Court of Kerala, Subramania Bharati Monument, Ettayapuram, Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Adyar and the Reserve Bank of India building, Nagpur. The Government of India honoured him in 1957, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation. Biography LIC building, Chennai Rammohan Palace, Cochin in 1944 Reserve Bank building, Nagpur Laxman Mahadeo Chitale was born in a family with meagre financial resources in 1892 in the small village of Parshuram which is around 8kms away from Chiplun, in the district of Ratnagiri of the western Indian state of Maharashtra. With a penchant for drawing, he secured a scholarship from Sayajirao Gaekwad III, then Maharaja of Baroda, and studied draughtsman's course at Kala Bhavan Technical Institute, Baroda. During this period, Chitale got an opportunity to meet Henry Vaughan Lanchester, a known architect, who hired him as his assistant. In 1922, when Lanchester shifted to UK, Chitale accompanied him. There, he joined the School of Architecture of London University for higher studies and continued learning at School of Town Planning. Later, he qualified as an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, followed it by securing the fellowship of the institute. Chitale returned to India in 1929 and took up the job of an assistant consulting architect at the Public Works Department, Madras where he worked for three years. In 1932, he resigned from the government service and founded L. M. Chitale and Son, reportedly the first private architectural firm in South India. One of the first assignments he took up was for Annamalai University to design their library, administration building and convocation hall, to be built at Chidambaram. This was followed by a project for Andhra University, on recommendation from Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, who was the vice chancellor of the university. He also constructed a house for the former vice president of India in Mylapore. The next notable project was the Oriental Life Assurance Co (Later day Oriental Insurance Co.) building along Armenian street in George Town, Chennai, which was the first multi storied building in Chennai with six floors and a basement which served as the vault. This basement was later acquired by Kothari Group who converted it as the vault of Madras Safe Deposit Company, the first safe deposit company in South India. When World War II broke out in 1941, Chitale was appointed as the Regional Camouflage Officer by the State government assigning him with the responsibility of camouflaging the city from night time raids. Chitale later brought out a book based on his work during the time, under the title, Air Raids and Civil Defense. He also carried out a series of talks which came to be known as Lantern Lectures, as he used the cinema slide projection techniques during the talks. After the war, Chitale went back to commercial architecture and designed buildings for several other insurance companies, the best known among them being the Life Insurance Corporation building, a 14 floor high rise building on Mount Road, reported to be the first skyscraper in the city. He was the architect of several other known buildings in various parts of the country such as Ram Mohan Palace in Kochi, Reserve Bank of India building in Nagpur, Monument for Tamil poet, Subramania Bharati at Ettayapuram, Central Leather Research Institute building in Adyar and many other colleges and universities. He was also associated with academics and chaired the Board of Studies of Drawing and Architecture at University of Madras from 1941 to 1946 and served as a member of the All India Board of Technical Studies in Architecture and Regional Planning. The Government of India awarded Chitale the fourth highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1957. He died, aged 68, in 1960; his wife, Leelavathi, who hailed from Tarapur in Maharashtra, preceding him in death. The couple had a son, Srikrishna Laxman Chitale, who is also an architect and heads of the firm his father founded.

Consecutive sampling is typically better than convenience sampling in controlling sampling bias.

History The Institute was founded in 1970 by Daniel Wildenstein as the Fondation Wildenstein, and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company (Wildenstein & Co.) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations. It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son Georges, which have been added to by subsequent generations. Daniel Wildenstein established the Wildenstein Index Number used by the Institute to identify paintings. It publishes catalogues raisonn√©s and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin. It describes itself as a center for research in art history.Institute web site It is currently headed by Guy Wildenstein. Controversy The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonn√© and is regarded as the \\"official\\" authenticator of Monet paintings. Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate Bords de la Seine √† Argenteuil after an investigation by Fiona Bruce (a journalist) and Philip Mould (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme Fake or Fortune?, which first aired on 19 June 2011. The Institute has featured again on the programme, variously accepting and rejecting the team's efforts. Another controversial finding featured on Fake or Fortune?, first aired July 2015, involved a painting purported to be by Pierre-Auguste Renoir held at Picton Castle, Wales. The Bernheim-Jeune is one of several sources that established provenance for the \\"Picton Renoir.\\" The BBC investigators unearthed several lines of authenticity, including additional levels of provenance with photographic records of sale and forensically matching pigments and canvas to Renoir. The Bernheim-Jeune geune Gallery had approved the painting as genuine and have included it in Renoir's catalogue raisonn√©. The Wildenstein Institute declined to accept the painting citing insufficient evidence. In 2011, a police raid discovered and seized 30 paintings valued at tens of millions of pounds from the Institute's Paris headquarters (see: Guy Wildenstein#Criticism).

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\". Description Turbinaria stellulata tends to be submassive with encrusting margins and does not produce vertical structures to any extent. The corallites are about in diameter and have thick walls. This coral is a zooxanthellate coral that houses symbiont dinoflagellates in its tissues. It is usually some shade of brown or green, but other colours sometimes occur, depending on which species of symbiont is present. Colonies are dome-shaped and grow to a diameter of about . Distribution and habitat Turbinaria stellulata occurs in the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea and Madagascar to tropical Australia, southern Japan and the South China Sea. It occurs on upper reef slopes at depths from 2 to 15 metres (6 to 50 ft ), and unlike other corals in its genus Turbinaria, it seems to avoid turbid water. Biology As a zooxanthellate coral, Turbinaria stellulata gets part of its nutritional needs from the photosynthetic symbionts in its tissues, but also extends its polyps to feed, mostly at night. Colonies are either male or female and are broadcast spawners. All the colonies in an area liberate their eggs and sperm into the sea in a spawning event which is synchronised with the phases of the moon. The planula larvae that develop form part of the plankton and eventually settle in a suitable location on the seabed. Status In general, the threats that stony corals face include global climate change with the resulting rise in the temperature of sea water, ocean acidification, increased severity of storms which damage reefs, increased frequency of El Ni√±o events, coral bleaching and the increasing incidence of coral diseases. The population trend of Turbinaria stellulata has not been monitored but as a shallow water coral it is affected by these factors. It has a wide range but is an uncommon species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\".

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\". Description Turbinaria mesenterina is encrusting or forms flat or vase-shaped plates with corallites only on one side. The corallites are conical and about in diameter. This coral is quite variable in form, depending on depth and water conditions. It is very common in the Arabian area on sand and other sediments, and there it forms groups of vertical, interlocking plates which are usually greenish yellow, greenish grey or greyish brown. On upper reef slopes, colonies consist of upright or tiered plates, and in deeper water the plates are horizontal. Distribution and habitat Turbinaria mesenterina is present in the Indo- Pacific region, its range extending from East Africa and the Red Sea to Taiwan, French Polynesia and eastern Australia. It is common in most reef environments and may be the dominant coral species in turbid habitats. Ecology Turbinaria mesenterina is a zooxanthellate species of coral, housing symbiotic dinoflagellates in its tissues. It thrives in turbid water, and is tolerant of high levels of sedimentation. It can clear sediment off its surface within a few hours and may benefit from feeding on organic matter present in the sediment. It has been suggested that higher levels of sedimentation on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia may result in dominance of the reef community by a small number of tolerant species of coral such as T. mesenterina. Status Turbinaria mesenterina has a very wide distribution and is common throughout its range. It is collected for the aquarium trade, with Indonesia being the largest exporter. The reefs where it lives are being progressively damaged and rising sea water temperatures causes stress to corals. It is susceptible to coral diseases and bleaching, and although no particular population trend is apparent, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\".

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\". Description Turbinaria peltata may be foliaceous or encrusting, and tends to form thick, flat plates, often in overlapping tiers. The colonies may be several metres in diameter. The corallites are found on a single side of each plate and are about in diameter, being either immersed in the skeleton or raised on tubular mounds. On the upper surfaces of larger colonies, two-sided ridges or cylindrical columns may form. The calyces are in diameter, circular and leaning towards the plate margin. The septa are arranged in three cycles, the third one often being reduced or absent. The septa are granulated and the columella is domed and spongy, or alternatively, has a central plate. The polyps of this species are often extended to feed during the daytime. They have thick tentacles up to long. This coral is usually some shade of grey or brown. It is a zooxanthellate coral that houses symbiont dinoflagellates in its tissues. Distribution and habitat Turbinaria peltata is native to the warm waters of the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the coast of East Africa to Taiwan and American Samoa. It is common in most shallow water habitats such as rocky foreshores and shallow reef slopes, especially in areas of turbid water. Biology Colonies of Turbinaria peltata grow by extra-tentacular budding. This means that new corallites grow between existing ones, outside the corallite walls. The new corallites tend to be small and make the surface appear more crowded. Conservation status The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of Turbinaria peltata as being \\"vulnerable\\". Although it is a common species with a widespread distribution, it faces a number of threats. It is collected for the aquarium trade, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification cause stressful conditions and make it more susceptible to coral bleaching and coral diseases. Localised threats include fisheries, damage to reefs, tourism, pollution and sedimentation.

They invited him to explore media opportunities in the Queensland capital. That, combined with the launch of World Expo 88 finally convinced him to head north and he joined radio 4BK. This began an 11-year stint in South East Queensland media, including involvement with the launch of 90.9 Sea FM on the Gold Coast,90.9 Sea FM followed by on-air stints with Brisbane radio stations 4KQ, B105List of B105 personalities#Gregg Easton and finally FM104 Triple M.4MMM#Former Notable FM104 MMM on-air staff  Tasmania  In 1999 Easton began management training, returning to RG Capital (owners of the Sea FM network), as Assistant Network Program Director and Network Music Director following their recent purchase of a group of Northern Tasmanian radio stations. He moved to Launceston to establish it as the radio network hub for other RG Capital stations located in Devonport, Burnie and Scottsdale. In 2000, Easton completed the Australian Film, Television and Radio School ‚Äì Radio Program Management Certificate, graduating with a Distinction. The following year he was nominated for an Australian Commercial Radio Award for Best Music Director. He also provided voice-overs for the statewide Southern Cross Television based in Launceston.  Return to Canberra  In 2003, after two- decades, Easton returned to the national capital, joining the on-air line-up at the Capital Radio Network's 2CA as the station's Music Director before eventually becoming Program Director. In 2009, he entered full-time study at the Canberra Institute of Technology to learn new media, journalism, communications and PR. He graduated with an Advanced Diploma of Journalism in 2010. A further two years at the University of Canberra saw him graduate with 1st Class Honours for a Bachelor of Journalism. He also helped oversee the rebirth of the campus radio station ‚Äì UCFM. During this time Easton commenced a television journalism internship with Southern Cross News in Canberra in 2011 before staying on for a further two years. He moved to WIN News as a reporter in 2013. He returned to radio in April 2016 accepting a position with Australia's largest regional radio operator Grant Broadcasters, taking on a journalist/ presenter role hosting the Far South Coast's flagship Morning Show. He can now be heard on 2EC covering a large section of the New South Wales East Coast from north of Batemans Bay to the other side of the Victorian border. He is also involved in a Content/ Music Management role.  Motor racing  Growing up in the outer Sydney suburb of Castle Hill, Easton began racing mini-bikes as a small boy. Later moving up to larger motocross bikes. While growing up, he was a regular spectator at Sydney's Amaroo Park and at the age of just 10, announced to his parent's that he had set a long-term goal to one day drive in the Bathurst 1000 at Mt Panorama. Several years later he completed a professional Defensive Driving Certificate at Amaroo Park and then went on to complete courses in Advanced Driving and Skid Control at Oran Park. His final Driving Course saw him gain his provisional CAMS race-licence. After moving to Brisbane, he covered the 1988 Bathurst 1000 as a motor racing journalist and it was here he established contacts in the sport that later helped him move into racing Sports Sedans at Lakeside Raceway. At the completion of the required number of race meetings he obtained his open race licence, followed by his international Super Licence that would permit him to race at meetings such as the Bathurst 1000. While working for the Gold Coast's 90.9 Sea FM, Easton used his motor racing knowledge and experience as a commentator for the Gold Coast's Indy Car Race from its inaugural year in 1991 through to 1994. Gregg Easton steers his Toyota through \\"The Dipper\\" at Mount Panorama in the 1993 Bathurst 1000A dream offer to co-drive a Group A Toyota Corolla in the 1992 Sandown 500 followed by the Bathurst 1000 saw Easton achieve his childhood goal from 20 years earlier.1992 Tooheys 1000 After purchasing the Corolla the following year, he established Easton Motor Sport, overseeing his own Group A motor-racing team throughout the year, including an entry in the 1993 Bathurst 1000.1993 Tooheys 1000 Expansion of his racing commitments though began to put pressure on his employment with Brisbane radio station 4KQ, who had no interest in supporting his motor racing involvement, and he was eventually let go. In 1994, the Australian Touring Car Championship became an exclusive V8 Category and Easton Motor Sport entered a V8 Commodore for that year's Bathurst 1000. It was his last Bathurst 1000, as from the following year onwards he re-focused on his full-time media career. In 2000 he participated as a driver at a motor-racing event, at Tasmania's Symmons Plains Raceway.

Zagem or Bazari () was a town in the southeast Caucasus, in the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kakheti. It flourished from the 15th to the 17th century as a vibrant commercial and artisanal centre. In the 1550s, it became a dependency of the Karabakh‚ÄìGanja province of Safavid Iran. The fortunes of the town were reversed by Safavid military actions in the area in 1615. By the 1720s, the town had been reduced to an insignificant hamlet. The settlement was located in what is now the Zaqatala District of Azerbaijan, but no evidence of the town remains at the site. The toponym Zagem is found exclusively in non-Georgian sources; Georgians knew it as Bazari, meaning \\"bazaar\\".  Etymology and location  Called Bazari (\\"bazaar\\") in the Georgian sources, the town was variously known to the Persian authors as Zagam, Zagham, or Zakam, and to the European accounts as Zagem, Zagen, Zagain, Zegharn, or Seggen. The non-Georgian forms are probably related to the toponym tsagam (—Ü–∞–≥—ä–∞–º), meaning \\"a blackberry bush\\" in Lezgian, a language of the neighboring mountainous tribe. The town lay in the river plain of Alazani (Qanƒ±x), on the left bank of that river, in the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan, where a homonymous village is still found some 25 km south of the city of Zaqatala, close to the border with Georgia.  History  Early history The town named Bazari is first documented in Georgian sources in 1392. Owing to its location on a road from Gremi in Kakheti to the neighboring country of Shirvan and proximity to major regional trade routes, as well as due to relative peace and stability achieved by the Bagratid kings of Kakheti, the town of Bazari/Zagem became an important regional commercial and crafts centre, settled by the Georgian, Jewish, Armenian, and Muslim communities. In the 16th century, it emerged as the economic capital of Kakheti and home to a royal residence. Not infrequently, for the contemporary Persian and Turkish sources, \\"the ruler of Zagam\\" was a synonym to the king of Kakheti. In the 1550s, the Safavid military leader and official Qalich Beg, son of Oveys Beg Pazuki, assumed the governorship over the town, and ruled for nine years. Zagem's notability as an economic hub is further emphasized by the existence in the town of a mint, which issued silver coins (abbasi) in the name of Safavid shahs and became known to modern scholars with the discovery, in 1967, of two such coins in Birkiani in northeastern Georgia. In total, about 80 coins produced by the Zagem mint have been found throughout the South Caucasus, dating from to or . Vicissitudes On 7 October 1604, the vicinity of Zagem was the arena of a battle between the Kakhetian and the Turkish-Kumyk armies. The Kakhetian crown-prince George employed 40 musketeers from the retinue of the Russian ambassadors Mikhail Tatishchev and Andrei Ivanov and led his 5,000-strong force to defeat the Turks and force the Kumyks under Sultan-Mut into flight. On 12 March 1605, the same Russian diplomats witnessed in Zagem a royal parricide in which Prince Constantine, apparently at the order of Shah Abbas I of Persia, killed his reigning father Alexander II and elder brother Crown Prince George, the last year's victor over the Turks, and had their entourage massacred. Sack of Zagem King Teimuraz I of Kakheti as depicted by the Italian missionary Teramo Castelli. Under Teimuraz's rule, Kakheti was invaded by Shah Abbas I of Persia and Zagem was sacked in 1615. Beginning in March 1614, Shah Abbas I undertook a systematic military campaign with the aim to bring Kakheti more firmly into the Safavid empire. To this end, the shah conducted a reorganization of the occupied Kakhetian territory which modified its ethnic and demographic structure. The Kakhetians revolted in 1615 and Shah Abbas returned with his army to deal with the rebels. His commander-in-chief in Shirvan, Yusuf-Khan, advanced with a Qizilbash force consisting of the Ustajlu, Baylat, and Pazuki tribes from the east through Shakki and laid waste to Zagem. The story of the town's destruction is described by the Safavid-era historians Iskandar Beg Munshi and Fazli Isfahani Khuzani. The latter, a Persian official responsible for the task of counting booty after the sack of Zagem, recorded 700 Jewish and Georgian captives, 2,000 severed heads, and 30,000 tumans excluding the booties hidden by the troops. Fazli then went on to report the success to Shah Abbas, who was headquartered near Ganja. Shah Abbas renounced his right over one-fifth of booty, only taking 3 boys and 2 girls. According to the Russian church historian Sergey Belokurov (1891), among the treasures of Zagem looted by the Persians was the chiton of Jesus, which was, in March 1625, presented by the shah's envoys to the Russian tsar Michael I in Moscow. The surviving population of Zagem‚ÄîChristians, Muslims, and Jews‚Äîwas then deported to Persia's interior and mostly resettled to the localities in Mazandaran such as Farrokhabad to help develop the area. A Jewish deportee, Khoja Lale Zar ebn Ya'qub, played an important role in silk trade in the Safavid empire. The vacated lands of Zagem were occupied by the Turkic Qizilbash nomads headed by Bektash Beg Torkman, himself a son of a Qizilbash chieftain and a Georgian princess. Zagem was never able to recover from the blow dealt in 1616. King Teimuraz I of Kakheti was able to return to the town for a couple of times. It saw a modest revival in the 1630s and early 1640s, but then went in decline and fell under the rule of Safavid regional governors. According to Muhammad Ibrahim b. Zayn al-'Abidin Nasiri's chronicle (c. 1730), by the end of the Safavid period the governor of Zagam was the governor of the Shams al-Dinlu tribe. With the 1722 demise of the Safavid empire and the ensuing chaos at its Caucasian periphery, Zagem lost all vestiges of its past importance as a commercial outpost and faded away.

The term was coined and prescribed by pickup artists. Negging is often misunderstood as straightforward insult rather than as a pick-up line, in spite of the fact that proponents of the technique such as Erik von Markovik and Neil Strauss traditionally stress it is not an insult. Erik von Markovik, who is usually credited with popularising the term negs, explains the difference thus: \\"A neg is not an insult but a negative social value judgment that is telegraphed. It's the same as if you pulled out a tissue and blew your nose. There's nothing insulting about blowing your nose. You haven't explicitly rejected her. But at the same time, she will feel that you aren't even trying to impress her. This makes her curious as to why and makes you a challenge.\\"Erik von Markovik, \\"The Mystery Method: How to get beautiful women into bed\\", St Martin's Press, 2007 Neil Strauss, in his book Rules of the Game, also stresses that the primary point of the technique is not to put women down but for a man to disqualify himself as a potential suitor. On this account he refers to negs as \\"disqualifiers\\", although the technique described in the book is recognisably the same as von Markovik's. Strauss is equally clear that negs should not be used as insults: \\"a disqualifier should never be hostile, critical, judgmental, or condescending. There's a line between flirting and hurting. And disqualification is never intended to be mean and insulting.\\" The term has been popularized in social media and mainstream media.

Through his efforts, and with the assistance of the Greek authorities, the majority of the city's Jewish community was saved during the Holocaust.  Life  Moshe Pesach was born in Larissa in 1869, and studied Jewish literature and philosophy at Thessaloniki. From 1892 he was active in the Jewish community of Volos as a rabbi. In the early 20th century, the city of Volos had a vibrant Jewish community: from ca. 500 in 1896, it rose to ca. 2,000 in 1930, before falling drastically to 882 members in 1940, due to emigration to the large cities of Thessaloniki and Athens or abroad. In 1939, he was awarded the Gold Cross of the Order of the Phoenix by King George II of Greece. Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Pesach was active in the underground network helping stranded Allied servicemen escape occupied Greece to the Middle East. During the early years of the Occupation, Volos was controlled by the Italian army. In 1943, as the Germans began to deport the Jews in their zone of occupation in Thessaloniki and Macedonia, the city received refugees, and many Jews of Volos began to flee the city to Athens or the surrounding countryside. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, the Germans took over the city. On 30 September, the German commandant, Kurt Rikert, summoned Pesach to his office and demanded a list of all Jews and their property within 24 hours, ostensibly for the purpose of determining food rations. Suspecting the Germans' real motives, Pesach managed to secure an extension of the deadline to three days, and immediately contacted the local Greek authorities: the mayor, chief of police, and the bishop of Demetrias, Joachim Alexopoulos. The latter contacted the local German consul, Helmut Scheffel, with whom he was befriended, and who confirmed that the Jews should leave as soon as possible. Provided with false identity papers and with a letter from the bishop to the local clergy to assist however possible, about 700 of the city's Jews dispersed in the countryside, where several even joined the partisans. About 130 Jews, mostly those without means, remained behind. They were rounded up by the Germans on 24‚Äì25 March 1944 and sent to the death camps. 117 Jews from Volos were killed in the camps, 12 were executed there, and about 30 died of privations and starvation, but Pesach's actions saved 74% of the Jewish citizens of Volos, the second highest percentage in Greece after Zakynthos (where the entire Jewish community survived). Pesach himself survived among the partisans in the mountains, but his wife died from the privations, and his two sons, who taught Judaism in Thessaloniki and Didymoteicho, were captured and executed by the Germans. After liberation, Pesach returned to Volos, becoming chief rabbi of Greece in 1946. He was honoured by the Allied Middle East Headquarters with a diploma, and in 1952, King Paul of Greece decorated him with the Order of George I. In April 1955, Volos was hit by a devastating earthquake. The aged rabbi was forced to live in a tent, later forfeiting his house in order to build a new synagogue in the same spot. He died on 13 November 1955. In 1957, the remains of Pesach and his wife Sara were brought to Jerusalem and interred next to Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel. His extensive library was transferred to the Ben-Zvi Institute. On 16 April 2015, Pesach's role was commemorated at a special ceremony by B'nai B'rith and the Jewish National Fund at the Forest of the Martyrs in Jerusalem.

Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral has a wide range but is rare except in a few subtropical localities. The main threats faced by this and other corals are related to climate change and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification.

Rosemarie Schwarzw√§lder has owned the gallery since 1987. Before that, she was the gallery‚Äôs director since 1978. Schwarzw√§lder has made the gallery the international renowned institution that it is today.Artnet states: 'With the exhibition Zeichen, Fluten, Signale - neukonstruktiv und parallel (Signs, Waves, Signals‚ÄîReconstructive and Parallel), Rosemarie Schwarzw√§lder presented a program in 1984, which featured basic elements that have proven relevant in numerous solo and group exhibitions up to the present. International positions of abstraction and concept-based art in the areas of painting, sculpture, installations, photography, and video have maintained a continuous presence in the program of the gallery.' http://www.artnet.com/galleries/galerie- schwarzwaelder/  History of the Site  The rooms in which the Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan is located have served as an art gallery since 1923, when Otto Kallir-Nirenstein founded the Neue Galerie. Kallir-Nirenstein was Jewish and had to flee the country in 1938, when Austria was annexed to Nazi Germany. After living in Paris, he immigrated to New York, where he founded the Galerie St. Etienne (‚ÄúSt. Etienne‚Äù being ‚ÄúSt. Stephan‚Äù in French). He is credited with introducing Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Oskar Kokoschka to the US. The gallery in New York still exists today and is run by his granddaughter, Jane Kallir. After he left Vienna, Vita K√ºnstler served as the head of the Neue Galerie until 1952.  History of Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan  In 1954, Monseigneur Otto Mauer took over the gallery, giving it the new name Galerie St. Stephan (it was later renamed Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan in 1964). Under this new name, the gallery would go on to become known as one of the most long-standing art institutions in Vienna. When Otto Mauer first founded the gallery, the cultural climate in Vienna was not very open to avant-garde art. He therefore took it upon himself to create a unique place where these artists could express themselves. With his dedication and remarkable intellect, he focused on content from the beginning. He created a platform for artists like Herbert Boeckl, Wolfgang Hollegha, Josef Mikl, Markus Prachensky, and Arnulf Rainer to exchange ideas about art. He was well-known all over Europe as an orator, collector, organizer, and friend of artists, and he worked to establish the gallery on an international level and initiated an active dialogue with the international avant-garde art scene. In 1958, he organized the first of many international art talks, bringing together art theoreticians and artists from Austria and the world in the Seckau Abbey in Styria. This taking stock of trends within contemporary art on a regular basis would become a gallery tradition that continues to this day. Otto Mauer remained the director of the Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan until his death in 1973. His gallery‚Äôs program included Art Informel, contemporary architecture, installations (including those by Joseph Beuys), conceptual painting, and contemporary sculpture. In the 1960s, the artist :de:Oswald Oberhuber curated several exhibitions in the gallery in which he often included his own artworks. After Otto Mauer died in 1973, he became the director of the gallery and continued its tradition of art education. He was primarily interested in conceptual art, and he worked to present the newest trends in his gallery exhibitions. As an artist, his work was in permanent flux. In the 1970s, the Wiener Gruppe (a group of poets and writers) held readings at the gallery. The Viennese Actionism presented performances, and in 1975 Valie Export hosted the exhibition ‚ÄúMagna,‚Äù which focused on female creativity. The Grazer Autorenversammlung (Graz Association of Authors) also held several readings in the gallery. When Rosemarie Schwarzw√§lder became the gallery‚Äôs acting director in 1978, she turned the gallery‚Äôs focus toward specific projects. Because culture did not have a very high social standing in Vienna at the end of the 1970s, the Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan made it its mission to promote culture by organizing and hosting exhibition projects as well as other events, such as concerts, lectures, discussions, readings, and performances. It thus helped to create a climate that was more open to new artistic phenomena from outside of Austria. Through projects revolving around so-called ‚Äúnew sculpture‚Äù and ‚Äúnew geometric art,‚Äù the gallery gained a new standing in the international discourse. The exhibition ‚ÄúZeichen ‚Äì Fluten ‚Äì Signale. Neokonstruktiv und parallel‚Äù (Signs, Floods, Signals: Neo-Constructivist and Parallel) in 1984 featured young Austrian, Swiss, and German artists like John Armleder, Helmut Federle, Imi Knoebel, Franz Graf, Brigitte Kowanz, Heimo Zobernig, and :de:Gerwald Rockenschaub. The gallery thus turned its focus toward abstract art, conceptual art, and Minimal art and began also to work with American artists. In 1987, Rosemarie Schwarzw√§lder also became the owner of the gallery. Since then, she has consistently pursued two goals: to recognize current trends in art and to approach these from a thematic, historical, and cultural point of view. The exhibition project ‚ÄúAbstrakte Malerei aus Amerika und Europa‚Äù (1986) juxtaposed two generations of artists from two continents and featured Helmut Federle, Imi Knoebel, Gerhard Richter, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, and Robert Ryman.Abstrakte Malerei am Beispiel von drei europ√§ischen und drei amerikanischen Malern / Abstract Painting of America and Europe. Helmut Federle, Imi Knoebel, Gerhard Richter, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Hg.

The exhibition ‚ÄúKulturen ‚Äì Verwandtschaften in Geist und Form‚Äù (1990) explored parallels between twentieth-century abstract art and forms of abstraction from pre-Columbian cultures in South America, the South and Northwest of the US, Thailand, Japan, and China.Kulturen ‚Äì Verwandtschaften in Geist und Form, Hg.

Following the tradition of Otto Mauer‚Äôs international art talks, the Galerie n√§chst St. Stephan held symposiums for these exhibitions.

Hidden between the Ampezzo valley and the high Val Badia, it was built by Austrians between 1897 and 1901 as a fortification against attack from the Italians on the Falz√†rego and Valparo. During World War I it was a favorite target for the Italians, and the fort was destroyed as there was inadequate artillery to defend it. Forte Tre Sassi is one of three preserved sites which make up the Great War Museum in the Dolomites. The fort houses a museum and an information center. History The Forte Tre Sassi is located at an elevation of . It was constructed by Austrians in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. Situated between Sass de Stria and Piccolo Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige), it was part of the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border in the late 19th and early 20th century. Rendered unusable due to a bombing by the Italians on 5 July 1915, the ruins remained in a state of disrepair until the advent of the 21st century, when the fort was restored by the local administration of Ampezzo, with the assistance of the Lacedelli family. Museum The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War. The museum was established on 27 September 2002 and opened to the public on 12 August 2003. It houses the historical artifacts of World War I collected by the Lancedelli family and it is also managed by them. A man dressed as a World War I soldier stands guard outside the facility. The exhibits were collected over a period of 45 years and the museum is reported to have an attendance of 20,000 visitors a year.

It is a small tree with papery bark on the trunk, pendulous branches and white to greenish-yellow flowers between February and November. This species should not be confused with Callistemon salignus. If that species were to be moved to the genus Melaleuca, as proposed by some authors, its name would become Melaleuca salicina. Melaleuca saligna has its stamens arranged in bundles; the stamens of Callistemon salignus/Melaleuca salicina are all free. Description Melaleuca saligna is a small tree with white, grey or brown papery bark which grows to about or sometimes twice as high. Its leaves are light green, narrow elliptic in shape, long and wide. There are 3 to 7 longitudinal veins with a distinct mid-vein. The flowers are white to greenish yellow, arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering or in heads in the upper leaf axils. The spikes contain 5 to 15 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 6 to 9 stamens. Flowering occurs in the dry season between February and November and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long. Taxonomy Melaleuca saligna was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Repertorium Botanices Systematicae. The specific epithet (saligna) is a reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species to those of one in the genus Salix, family Salicaceae.

The Society of Divine Vocation is a religious institute of Pontifical Right.

The Vocationist Fathers believe themselves to be specially called by God as vocation experts, counselors and midwives in the Church.

According to Fr. Giustino, other religious institutes wait for vocations and welcome them, while the Vocationists, personally and purposely, go out searching for them, especially through their catechetical schools and other apostolates. In other words, their activities are highly riveted on matters of vocation and in all, their immediate objective, though not their goal, is to see people being guided to properly discern their vocations and being helped to realize them by responding appropriately to God‚Äôs call in their lives.

Nayib Bukele ran as the candidate of the centre-right GANA party and became the first president since Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte (1984‚Äì1989) not to have been elected as the candidate of one of the country's two major political parties, the FMLN and ARENA. He is also the founder of the political party Nuevas Ideas. He was previously elected mayor of Nuevo Cuscatl√°n on 11 March 2012. He was also elected mayor of San Salvador on 1 March 2015, and took office on 1 May 2015. He contested and won the elections to both public offices under the banner of the left-wing Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front party. A populist, during his presidency he has been criticized by the opposition of governing in an authoritarian manner, especially after sending soldiers into the Legislative Assembly to encourage the passage of a bill and allegedly to overthrow the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador. This action, his handling of endemic violence in El Salvador, and his strict response to the COVID-19 pandemic have led some academics to describe him as an autocrat, authoritarian, or a dictator. Early life Nayib Bukele was born on 24 July 1981, in San Salvador. He is a son of Olga Ortez de Bukele and Armando Bukele Katt√°n. According to The Times of Israel, Bukele's paternal grandparents were Palestinian Christians from Jerusalem and Bethlehem while his maternal grandmother was Catholic and his maternal grandfather was Greek Orthodox. His father later converted to Islam and became an imam. \\"Nayib\\" is a hispanicized version of the Arabic name \\"Najib.\\" Nayib founded his first company at age 18. An article in the digital newspaper El Faro said that Bukele owns Yamaha Motors El Salvador, a company that sells and distributes Yamaha products in El Salvador. He was also the Director and President of OBERMET, S.A. DE C.V. Mayor of Nuevo Cuscatl√°n On 11 March 2012, he was elected mayor of Nuevo Cuscatl√°n, in the department of La Libertad, representing a coalition of the FMLN with 2754 votes (49.72%) and CD 108 votes (1.95%), for a total of 2862 votes (50.68%), defeating the incumbent ARENA party, which won 2585 votes (46.67%). He took office on 1 May 2012. Mayor of San Salvador Bukele at the beatification of √ìscar Romero, with then-vice president √ìscar Ortiz and his wife. In the municipal elections of 2015, he won the mayoralty of San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador, representing a coalition of the FMLN with the PSP that won 89,164 votes (50.37% of total). His main challenger, businessman and former deputy Edwin Zamora (ARENA), won 82,288 votes (46.49%). The latter party had controlled the city during the previous six years. Bukele took office on 1 May 2015.

Expulsion from the FMLN On 10 October 2017, Nayib Bukele was expelled from the FMLN, accused by the FMLN Ethics Tribunal of promoting internal division and performing defamatory acts against the political party. Nayib challenged these Acts from FMLN that were unethical and corrupt, illuminating much of the wrongdoing that FMLN had done over the years, including acts from former president Funes. Nayib Bukele did not attend the hearing scheduled for 7 October 2017 by the FMLN Ethics Tribunal, arguing that they were biased in favor of the plaintiffs. Election as President After Bukele's expulsion from the FMLN, his aspirations towards 2019 moved in the direction of participating in the presidential elections as an independent who rejects the current political system. Nayib Bukele started the movement Nuevas Ideas (\\"New Ideas\\") with the goal of making it a political party where he could run as a candidate for the presidency of El Salvador. Following the announcement of his presidential aspirations, he was opposed by both the ruling FMLN party on the political left, and ARENA on the right as they blocked any attempts for him to found his own political party and politically cancelled any party that he has attempted to use for his candidacy, as they did so with Cambio Democr√°tico. Arena and FMLN have now joined together (in and outside of the assembly) to challenge all of the actions and proposals that Bukele attempts to implement. Nayib eventually joined the centre-right Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA) party to mount his presidential bid. On 3 February 2019, Bukele announced that he had won the presidential elections with ease. Challenger Hugo Mart√≠nez of the FMLN conceded defeat. He won 53% of the vote, thereby eliminating the need for a run-off election. He is the first candidate to win the presidency since the end of the Salvadoran Civil War who did not represent either of the major two parties. In his victory speech he declared, ‚ÄúToday we have turned the page on the postwar period.\\" Bukele assumed office on 1 June 2019. Bukele announced a cabinet of sixteen people made up of eight men and eight women. One of the last to be appointed was Maria Luisa Hayem who was the Minister of the Economy.

The book was first published by Ambo Anthos in 2009. It was translated into English by Sam Garrett, published in Great Britain in 2012, and the United States in 2013. The book became an international bestseller with many translations and has been adapted into three films. Plot The story is narrated by Paul Lohman, a former history teacher. He and his wife Claire meet at a fancy restaurant in Amsterdam with his elder brother Serge, a prominent politician and contender for the position of Dutch prime minister, and his wife Babette. The plan is to discuss over dinner how to handle a crime committed by their teenage sons, Michel and Rick, respectively. The violent act of the two boys had been filmed by a security camera and shown on TV, but, so far, they have not been identified. The parents have to decide on what to do. They debate over dinner causing tension throughout the evening.  Composition  The book belongs to the genre of stories told by an unreliable narrator. The story is organized in sections that are headed by the sequential courses of the dinner, from aperitif to digestif, and frequently interrupted by some form of disruption during the meal as well as flashbacks. The novel starts with what appears to be a skeptical \\"attitude towards the fashionable, the fancy and the fussy\\" that may appeal to the reader only to turn‚Äî\\"slowly and fiendishly\\"‚Äîto make the reader think about the nature of their own indignations. Reception By 2012 the book had already sold a million copies in Europe. Arifa Akbar (The Independent) noted that the \\"sly\\" and \\"riveting\\" novel seems to head in one direction, then \\"is galloping down another, unexpected path\\" and finds that it \\"may thrill, chill or cheat\\", whereby its \\"spectacular style triumphs over substance\\". The book was twice reviewed by The New York Times. Janet Maslin found the morality of the story \\"really sickening\\", none of the four characters at the dinner is \\"really sane\\" and compared it negatively to Gillian Flynn‚Äôs Gone Girl where the characters are vicious but also sympathetic. Claire Messud noted a \\"bracing nastiness\\" in the book as more and more secrets are disclosed. She opines that The Dinner is, to some extent, \\"attuned to a distinctly European society, one simultaneously more ostentatious in its apparent \\"civilization\\" and more ashamed of its underlying savagery\\". Alex Preston (The Guardian) indicated that the book is about the nature of evil and found it to be a well-paced and entertaining novel that shows \\"brutal violent creatures\\" under \\"the thin facades of decency and manners.\\" Lisa Zeidner (The Washington Post) recognized black humor in the novel as in the unlikely choice of a public restaurant for the delicate discussion. She opined that Koch illustrates the absurdities of our privileged daily lives and pokes fun at \\"Dutch mediocrity\\".

Poster controversy A Mothers and Fathers Matter poster referencing surrogacy, together with a Fine Gael poster denying that the issue was relevant. The 'No' posters published by MFM during the Marriage Equality campaign were widely criticised as an attempt to sow confusion and to conflate different issues (such as surrogacy) with the Marriage Equality Referendum. On 24 April 2015, an Irish Times journalist, Conor Pope, filmed and confronted individuals who were removing some of the group's posters from Gardiner Street.'Vote No' posters taken down Conor Pope, YouTube Channel Responding, the Yes Equality campaign condemned the removal of any posters, but pointed out that their canvassers had also been abused and threatened. One Dublin hotel (notorious for courting publicity) offered a discount to guests who took down 'No' posters. Some claimed that the 'No' posters were insulting to single parents, adoptive parents and heterosexual and same-sex parents who had availed of assisted human reproduction. One such mother said \\"The poster is nonsense ‚Äì it implies that surrogacy is simply for same-sex couples. There are many parents, myself included, that have had children thanks to the help of other people. To say that I am not the mother of my children because I could not biologically carry them is an insulting suggestion, and one that is clearly aimed at shaming families that do not conform to this group‚Äôs narrow view of what constitutes a family.‚Äù T√°naiste Joan Burton described the posters as \\"demeaning\\", saying \\"The notion that people who have been raised in anything other than the kind of perfect family situation that the No people describe, frankly, I find it undermining of people in a way I think is regrettable.\\" In early May 2015, the couple featured in the stock photos used on MFM posters denounced the use of their image in the No campaign. Releasing a statement through Amnesty International, they said \\"We completely support same-sex marriage, and we believe that same- sex couples should, of course, be able to adopt, as we believe that they are equally able to provide children with much-needed love and care. To suggest otherwise is offensive to us, and to many others.\\" On 7 May, the retired Archdeacon of Dublin, Gordon Linney, described the posters as homophobic, saying that the posters' \\"real target is gay people and a crude attempt to discredit them as suitable parents. This is where we can talk candidly about homophobia because the implication is that gay people are at best incapable of caring for children or at worst a danger to children.\\" The independent Referendum Commission received \\"dozens\\" of complaints about the posters, and pointed to a statement on their website on the question, which reads \\"The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 deals with parentage in the cases of donor‚Äìassisted births but not with surrogacy. The Act has been passed and will be enacted regardless of the outcome of the marriage equality referendum.\\" They added \\"In view of the number of complaints regarding the surrogacy poster, the Commission may comment further in the coming weeks.\\" Carol Coulter, former Irish Times legal affairs editor and director of the child care law reporting project, also wrote that the referendum had nothing to do with surrogacy, and pointed out that where it was legal, such as in the UK, it was mostly availed of by heterosexual, married couples.

It is the home ground of club Cove Rangers. History Cove Rangers started planning to move from their old Allan Park ground in the mid-2000s, as this formed part of their unsuccessful pitch for Scottish Football League membership in 2008. Initially, the move was tied in with the New Aberdeen Stadium proposals, as Calder Park would also have served as a training facility for Aberdeen FC. Planning permission for this project was refused in August 2012, as Aberdeen City Council opted to examine other possibilities for development in the area. Cove Rangers then decided to press ahead with a new stadium by themselves, as Allan Park did not meet Scottish Football Association licensing criteria. Aberdeen City Council accepted the first stages of planning permission for Calder Park in November 2014. The new stadium was originally planned to be ready for the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Cove Rangers left Allan Park in April 2015, having sold the ground to a housing developer. The club reached agreements to ground-share with four other clubs during the 2015‚Äì16 season. The club submitted a planning application in March 2016. The plans included a stand with 312 seats, an \\"all- weather\\" 3G (artificial) pitch and 110 car parking spaces. A sponsorship deal with the Aberdeen-based Balmoral Group in December 2016 included naming rights for the Calder Park ground, which will be known as the Balmoral Stadium. Construction work was being undertaken in October 2017, with a target date for completion of February to March 2018. Cove continued to ground-share during the 2017-18 season, with their Scottish Cup tie against Falkirk and SPFL promotion playoff matches being played at Harlaw Park in Inverurie. Balmoral Stadium was officially opened in July 2018, with a friendly match between Cove Rangers and Aberdeen which had to be abandoned after Cove player Jordon Brown suffered a serious injury.

The Virgin Mary with her mother The porch The entrance to the south porch The bulk of the porch was built between 1606 and 1617 by the Ma√Ætre de Plougastel and the finishing touches were added by Roland Dor√© (sculptor). The porch gives access to the nave and is in a m√©lange of Gothic and Renaissance styles. On the outside of the porch there are two decorated friezes and two triangular pediments completed by two narrow gargoyles. There is a niche on the fa√ßade containing a statue of Saint Miliau sat on his throne and at the very top is a \\"clocheton\\" topped with a lanteron. The voussures and pi√©droits of the porch's arch have carvings from the base upwards that recount stories from the Old and New Testament and these should be read by starting on the left side and moving across to the right. These carvings start with the temptation of Eve on the left side and Adam and Eve's expulsion from paradise on the right. Next is a depiction of Eve as a mother and Adam as a labourer on the left and Ca√Øn's murder of his brother coupled with Noah's ark on the right. Next there is a scene showing the sacrifices of Ca√Øn and Abel on the left, with Noah collecting grapes on the right and then Noah is shown, clearly in drunken state with wine. We then move to the New Testament with the Annunciation, the Nativity juxtaposed with the visitation, followed by the Adoration of the Magi and the angels and shepherds attending Jesus' birth. Finally, on the left there is a depiction of the Flight into Egypt and on the right the Circumcision. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles set in elaborate niches and Renaissance style daises. Under the apostles, there is a frieze with various heads depicting the cardinal sins and three reliefs.

Life and career  Lowell Gilmore first worked as a stage manager on the 1929 Broadway play The First Mrs. Fraser, but got his chance as an actor when he replaced actor Eric Elliott in the play.Lowell Gilmore (IBDB) This was the start to a successful Broadway career in the 1930s with plays like The Wind and the Rain (1934), The Taming of the Shrew (1935) and Leave Her to Heaven (1940). He made his film debut in Jacques Tourneur's war drama Days of Glory (1944) with Gregory Peck, where he was featured in an extensive role as Peck's second-in-command.

Another notable role was the District Commissioner in the Oscar-winning adventure film King Solomon's Mines (1950) with Deborah Kerr. Although Gilmore was born in the United States, the \\"suave-looking, wavy-haired supporting actor\\" often portrayed British characters like doctors, officers and aristocrats.NY Times: Lowell Gilmore His roles were often dapper and sometimes also cads and villains.Lowell Gilmore (IMDB) One of his best roles was probably as the Duke of Gloucester (the future Richard III) in The Black Arrow (1948), where he played him as a semi-sympathetic and charming, semi-villainous character. While his film roles got somewhat smaller in the 1950s, he played in numerous television series like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Jack Benny Program. Gilmore also appeared as Pontius Pilate in the television series The Living Christ Series (1951) and the film Day of Triumph (1954).

Diamond is an American psychologist and feminist. She is a professor of developmental psychology and health psychology at the University of Utah. Her research focuses on sexual orientation development, sexual identity, and bonding. She is best known for her 2008 book, Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women's Love and Desire. In this book, she discusses the fluidity of female sexuality, based on her study of 100 non-heterosexual women over a period of 10 years. She concluded that the term bisexual did not truly express the versatile nature of many of her subjects. Therefore, she calls \\"for an expanded understanding of same-sex sexuality\\". Early life Diamond became interested in feminism after Betty Friedan gave a talk at her high school. She studied feminist theory at the University of Chicago and joined the board of the Chicago National Organization for Women. During this time, she came out as a lesbian and decided to pursue research into same-sex sexuality instead of activism. In 1993, she received her B.A. in Psychology from the University of Chicago. She then started graduate work with Ritch Savin-Williams at Cornell University, where she earned her M.A. in 1996, and her Ph.D. in 1999, both in Human Development. Work At the University of Utah, Diamond was an assistant professor from 1999 to 2005, and an associate professor from 2005 to 2012. She became a professor of psychology and gender studies in 2012. She serves on the editorial boards of Developmental Psychology, Archives of Sexual Behavior, and various other journals. Her research focuses on same-sex sexuality, adolescent females, and human bonding. In her studies of sexual fluidity, she has found that some women report variability in their sexual orientation identity. Diamond is clear that sexual orientation is not chosen, but that identity can shift non-voluntarily for some women. The sexually fluid women she studied did not \\"experience those changes as willful\\", and some even resist them. Diamond says that conversion therapy cannot remove same-sex attraction. Describing herself as a feminist scientist, Diamond says \\"there are a lot of scientists who just cling to the scientific method and believe they are totally objective and I think they are full of bunk. But, I have met a lot of feminists who say there is not a way to collect data without being oppressive, that data has no meaning, the world is socially constructed and I think that is bunk too.\\" Diamond has also researched attachment theory as the basis for love and sexual orientation, and the association between relationships and psychobiological health. Diamond was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Award by the APA Committee on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns in 2011; the Distinguished Book Award by the International Association of Relationship Research (IARR) in 2010; and the Distinguished Book Award for her book Sexual Fluidity by the American Psychological Association, Division 44 in 2009. She received a number of other honors during her scientific career. Publications Among other works, she authored: *Diamond, L.M. (2018).

After Ed Fast was appointed Minister of International Trade in 2011, Harper asked him for a blueprint prioritizing trade in Canada's foreign policy. On November 27, 2013, Fast delivered a comprehensive report on a Global Markets Action Plan. History Harper's government was highly concerned to maintain Canada's competitive position in international trade, which is equivalent to more than 60 percent of Canada's annual gross domestic product; one out of five jobs was created by the global market presence. In 2007, the government launched its Global Commerce Strategy for expanding Canada's trade network, strengthening its competitive position in its traditional markets, and extending its reach to new emerging markets. The strategy was successful and led Canada to finalize seven different free trade pacts. It also activated an Economic Action Plan 2012 with the wider participation of Canada's business community to identify new markets, strengths and opportunities. Finally they all came out with the new Global Markets Action Plan on November 27, 2013 to achieve these objectives. Target markets The plan targeted distinctive three different markets; * emerging markets with broad Canadian interests; * emerging markets with specific opportunities for Canadian businesses; and * established markets with broad Canadian interests. Key elements The plan included the following key elements: * a new trade promotion plan utilizing state resources and services to optimize the commercial interests of Canada in key markets abroad successfully; * ensuring that Canada's trade policy tools are prioritized toward initiatives that will yield the maximum economic benefits to Canadian workers and businesses; * constantly promoting Canada's position to access the world's two largest markets‚Äîthe European Union and the United States with total customers-base of more than 800 million, and well over half of the entire global marketplace; and * renewed stakeholder linkages to ensure that government priorities are in sync with the needs of businesses, and that the plan adapts to changes in the global economy. Advisory council Ed Fast installed a nine-member advisory council consists of Canada's leading corporate leaders. Trade promotions Business Development Bank of Canada at Hamilton, Ontario; the bank's mandate is to help create and develop Canadian businesses through financing, growth and transition capital, venture capital and consulting services, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. Global Markets Action Plan was planned in a way to make significant impact on Canada's trade-promotion efforts facilitating Canadian businesses to optimize their export potential in overseas markets; which creates jobs and opportunities for workers and their families in Canada. Small and Medium- sized Enterprises(SMEs) In March 2015, Harper permitted a $50 million financial assistance over a period of five years to facilitate the Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on market research and participating trade missions; the funding would help approximately 500 to 1000 entrepreneurs in Canada yearly to reach their full export capacity. =Five-Year Target to Increase SMEs Exporting to Emerging Markets= Global Markets Action Plan outlined how to support Canada's critical SME sector to establish in emerging markets. The ultimate goal of the strategy was to increase SME export presence in emerging markets from 29 percent to 50 percent by 2018 and from 11,000 to 21,000 companies; this growth would create over 40,000 net new jobs. ::::::::::::::::::::::: Ed Fast - Minister of International Trade =Steps to improve the SMEs= * reducing the small-business tax rate to 11 percent; * increasing the income limit for the small-business tax rate from $300,000 to $500,000; * implementing the \\"one-for-one rule\\" to cut unnecessary red tape, saving Canadian businesses more than $22 million in administrative burden as of June 2014, as well as 290,000 hours in time spent dealing with red tape; * improving access to capital for innovative entrepreneurs by launching the Venture Capital Action Plan; * supporting the hiring of apprentices with the Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit, a non-refundable tax credit equal to 10 percent of the eligible salaries and wages payable to eligible apprentices; and * increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) for small business owners from $500,000 to $800,000, and indexing this new limit to inflation. On account of indexation, the LCGE limit increased to $813,600 for 2015. Trade Commissioner Service Harper extended another $42 million over five years to enhance the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service, with $9.2 million per year thereafter. The funding would facilitate the expanded trade services: Canada opened four new trade offices in China, bringing the total number of offices there to 15, with more than 100 trade commissioners; and it strengthened its support network in India, where there are eight offices and nearly 50 trade commissioners. There were more than 25 trade commissioners being trained placing in number of business associations in order to gain better understanding of the Canadian exports.

Speech Communication, Volume 9, Issue 4, August 1990, Pages 351-356. Biology and medical topics In 2011, Seneff began publishing articles on topics related to biology and medicine in low- impact, open access journals, such as Interdisciplinary Toxicology and eight papers in the journal Entropy between 2011 and 2015. According to food columnist Ari LeVaux, Seneff's work in this area has made her \\"a controversial figure in the scientific community\\" and she has received \\"heated objections from experts in most every field she's delved into\\". In 2013, she coauthored a paper that associated the herbicide glyphosate with a wide variety of diseases such as cancer and disorders such as autism. Discover magazine writer Keith Kloor criticized the uncritical republication of the study's results by other media outlets. Jerry Steiner, the executive vice president of sustainability at Monsanto, said in an interview regarding the study that \\"We are very confident in the long track record that glyphosate has. It has been very, very extensively studied.\\" Seneff's claim that glyphosate is a major cause of autism and that, \\"At today's rates, by 2025, half the kids born will be diagnosed with autism,\\" has also been criticized. For example, Pacific Standard noted that, contrary to Seneff's claims, many scientific reviews have found that the rise in autism rates over the past 20 years is due to changes in diagnostic practices, and that a number of studies, including a 2012 review in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, have found little evidence that glyphosate is associated with adverse development outcomes. Seneff and her MIT colleagues have also published on the health impacts of fat and cholesterol consumption in America. Based on this work, Seneff claimed that Americans are suffering from a cholesterol deficiency, not an excess. In 2014‚Äì2016 Seneff was proposed as an expert witness for litigators seeking damages from Pfizer associated with their cholesterol drug Lipitor,Memorandum of Decision: Sullivan v. Pfizer, No. 3:14-cv-1374 (MPS), U.S. District Court, Connecticut, March 4, 2016. but the court dismissed the claim largely because Seneff lacked expert status and failed to provide credible evidence linking Lipitor to any specific harm. Response from scientists and academics Clinical neurologist and skeptic Steven Novella criticized Seneff's Entropy publication for making \\"correlation is causation\\" assumptions using broad statistical extrapolations from limited data, saying \\"she has published only speculations and gives many presentations, but has not created any new data\\". Scientists and scholars such as Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist, and Jeffrey Beall, a library scientist known for his criticism of predatory open access publishers, have separately criticized Seneff's paper for misrepresenting the results and conclusions of other researchers' work. Lowe and Beall also noted that Entropy and its publisher, MDPI, have a known history of publishing studies without merit. A 2017 Review Article written by Kings College of London researchers and published by Frontiers in Public Health called Seneff's glyphosate health-risk research claims \\"a deductive reasoning approach based on syllogism\\" and \\"at best unsubstantiated theories, speculations or simply incorrect.\\"Facts and fallacies in the debate on glyphosate toxicity, by Robin Mesnage and Michael N.

He served his country as ambassador successively in China, France, Poland and East Germany. Life Abrassimov was born in Boguszewsk, a recently expanded but still small village in the eastern part of Belarus. The village's economic importance had been much enhanced when the local land-owner agreed to the erection of a station along the new railway line, which had opened in 1902, linking Vitebsk, ≈Ωlobin and Orsha to the rapidly expanding rail network of the Russian Empire (which included Belarus). Peter Andreievitch's father was a farmer who fought in the First World War and in the ensuing Civil War that followed it in the Russian Empire. He was killed in fighting near Orsha while a member of a Red Guardbattalion, leaving his widow to bring up Peter and his sister. In 1933 Abrassimov's own specialty had become the electro-technical industrial sector. By 1939, however, he was attending the Belarusian State University in Minsk, studying History. It was only in 1940, as the worst of the Stalinist purges were coming to an end, that he joined the Communist Party. Till 1941 Abrassimov worked in government and trades union institutions, after which he became an officer in the Red Army and, during the Great Patriotic War, an officer in the Belorussian partisan movement which at the time was operating behind German lines with approximately 35,000 men. By the end of the war he had earned four Soviet military medals. Between 1946 and 1952 he served as permanent representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic Ministerial Council in the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. In this position he worked directly under Alexei Kosygin and was able to preside over a period of strong economic recovery for Belarus, with the establishment of tractor and automobile plants as well as the creation of major agricultural enterprises. He subsequently became first deputy president of the Belorussian Council of Ministers and Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee. At the same time he resumed his studies in History at Minsk University. Between 1950 and 1958 Peter Abrassimov was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Abrassimov's career in the diplomatic service began in 1950 or 1956 with a posting to China. From 1957 till 1961 he was the Soviet ambassador to Poland. His term in Warsaw directly followed the rehabilitation of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka who earlier in the 1950s been disgraced, imprisoned and expelled from the party for \\"right wing-reactionary deviation\\" but who in 1956 became First Secretary of the Polish Party. Abrassimov and Gomu≈Çka formed a good working relationship of mutual trust. In 1961, to the surprise of many in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Abrassimov was recalled from Warsaw and appointed as First Secretary of the party committee in the then relatively underdeveloped Smolensk region. The background was a scathing speech by the national leader, Nikita Khrushchev, concerning the collapse of agriculture in various regions including that around Smolensk. Abrassimov knew the region, and he had only respect for its hardworking people. He listened in silence to Krushchev's critical speech to a Central Committee plenum, but directly afterwards asked to be appointed to the Smolensk Regional Party Committee First Secretary job: his request was unhesitatingly granted, and he energetically devoted himself to addressing the matters highlighted by Krushchev. At the end of 1962 he returned to his ambassadorial career, appointed to head up the Soviet Union's important diplomatic mission in the German Democratic Republic in succession to Mikhail Pervukhin, taking up his appointment at the start of 1963. Building on an approach he had developed during his time in Warsaw, he proved a new kind of post-Stalin Soviet ambassador. He took a relatively high-profile approach, visiting factories and exhibitions, and appearing on television. Media reports appeared in the west suggesting that he was a consummate actor, and his involvement in negotiating the four-power agreement over the future of Berlin which he personally signed on behalf of the Soviet Union 3 September 1971 left him far better known in West Germany than the Soviet ambassador to West Germany. Abrassimov proved highly quotable, and attracted attention with protests against Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik (\\"No rose without the thorns\\" / \\"Keine Rose ohne Dornen\\"). On 12 May 1971 the Warsaw Pact War Council convened in East Berlin, followed by a larger than usual series of summer military exercises by the alliance member states. Peter Abrassimov was the only civilian to participate in these exercises. Later in 1971 he received a communication from Leonid Brezhnev who had scheduled a visit to Paris later in the year. The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was relatively fresh in the minds of the French political establishment, and Abrassimov was instructed to take over the Soviet ambassadorship there to prepare for the Brezhnev visit. He remained in Paris for two years after which he returned to Moscow and took a position as a department head with the Party Central Committee. In 1975 he was sent back to Berlin where he served a second stint as Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, remaining in post this time till 1983. His years as ambassador were not without Soviet-East German tensions. During the early 1960s the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev was interested in exploring a less confrontational relationship with the west while the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, remained uncompromisingly hard-line in his attitude to the west in general and in his country's relationship with West Germany specifically. The decision suddenly to erect the Berlin Wall in August 1961 was naturally taken by the East Germans in full consultation with the Soviet ambassador. From the East German perspective The Wall represented a necessary desperate attempt to save the state which appeared to be in the process of losing its entire working age population. With Abrassimov as Soviet ambassador in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, who had earlier enjoyed close relations with Soviet leader Josef Stalin, found he enjoyed far less direct contact with the Soviet leadership in Moscow. In 1963/64, when Ulbricht moved to control air traffic flying into West Berlin, it was Abrassimov who prevented the move. He actively opposed East German reluctance to conclude a belated post war peace treaty with West Germany, and in 1966 set up direct links with Willy Brandt, then the mayor of West Berlin, without telling the leadership of the East German ruling SED (party). Abrassimov also participated regularly in meetings of the East German cabinet, something which had never happened when Mikhail Pervukhin was the Soviet ambassador. The relationship between the Soviet ambassador and the East German leadership did not improve with the appointment of a new East German leader, Erich Honecker, in 1971. During the 1980s Abrassimov's growing propensity to meet regularly with western ambassadors to Berlin without reference to his East German host government did not help matters. In 1983 he was seen to be becoming ever more paternalistic and autocratic in his ambassadorial office, and following the death of Leonid Brezhnev at the end of 1982, Honecker managed to persuade Moscow to replace Abrassimov because of the extent of his \\"interference in East German domestic politics\\". Back in Moscow he served as chair of the National Committee for Foreign Tourism between 1983 and 1985. Between 1985 and 1986 he served, briefly, as the Soviet ambassador to Japan.

He is an all-rounder who bats right-handed and bowls right-arm fast-medium. His elder brother Krunal Pandya is also an international cricketer. Early years Hardik Pandya was born on 11 October 1993 in Surat, Gujarat. His father, Himanshu Pandya, ran a small car finance business in Surat which he shut down and shifted to Vadodara when Hardik was five; he did so in order to facilitate his sons with better cricket training facilities. He enrolled his two sons (Hardik and Krunal) into Kiran More's cricket academy in Vadodara. Financially weak, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a second-hand car to travel to the cricket ground. Hardik studied at the MK High School until ninth grade before dropping out to focus on cricket. Hardik made steady progress in junior-level cricket and, according to Krunal, \\"won a lot of matches single- handedly\\" in club cricket. In an interview with the Indian Express, Hardik revealed that he was dropped from his state age-group teams due to his \\"attitude problems.\\" He added that he was \\"just an expressive child\\" who does not \\"like to hide his emotions.\\" According to his father, Hardik was a leg spinner until the age of 18 and turned to fast bowling at the insistence of the Baroda coach Sanath Kumar.  Domestic career  Pandya has been playing for Baroda cricket team since 2013. He played a vital role in Baroda winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in the 2013‚Äì14 season. In the 2015 season of the Indian Premier League, he scored a quick fire 21 runs off 8 balls and grabbed three important catches to help Mumbai Indians beat Chennai Super Kings by six wickets and was awarded the man of the match. After the first qualifier against Chennai Super Kings, Sachin Tendulkar called over Hardik and told him that he will play for India in the next 18 months. Within one year he was chosen to play in the Indian squad during 2016 Asia Cup and 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Later on against Kolkata Knight Riders, in a must-win situation for Mumbai Indians to remain in the race for the top 4 teams, he scored a quickfire 61 off 31 balls to win the match for his side and earn his second man of the match award in the season. He was also awarded the 'Yes Bank maximum sixes award' for the same match. In January 2016, he slammed eight sixes during his innings unbeaten 86 to guide Baroda cricket team to a six- wicket win over Vidarbha cricket team in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Indian Premier League In 2017, against RPS, it was the last over in Mumbai Indians‚Äôs innings batting first and Hardik Pandya smashed 30 runs in that one against bowler Ashok Dinda, making it a record, although later, Mumbai lost the match. In the 2018 IPL Player Auction, he was retained by the Mumbai Indians for Rs. 11 Crores. He had a decent league in that season, with his bowling more impressive than batting. In the 2019 season, he dominated with his batting, and bowling equally. Playing 16 matches, he made 402 runs and took 14 wickets, averaging 44 and amassing 28 fours and 29 sixes totally in the season. He was the Super Striker of the Season of Mumbai Indians, with his strike rate over 170, but overall, just fell short of Andre Russell, who had a rate of 205. Against the Kolkata Knight Riders, in a target of 232 in 20 overs, Hardik made a quick fire 91 off just 34 balls expecting his team to get over the line, but that did not happen as MI fell short of 33 runs. For his performances in the 2019 IPL season, he was named in the Cricinfo IPL XI International career  T20Is  Pandya made his Twenty20 International debut for India on 27 January 2016 at the age of 22, picking up 2 wickets against Australia. His first Twenty20 International wicket was Chris Lynn. In the second T20I against Sri Lanka cricket team at Ranchi, he batted ahead of Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni and hit 27 off 14 balls before becoming hat-trick victim of Thisara Perera. In Asia Cup 2016, Pandya smashed an 18-ball 31 helping India post a respectable score against Bangladesh. Later on, he also picked up a wicket to secure the win. In the next match against Pakistan he bowled his best figures of 3 for 8 which restricted Pakistan to 83. In a 2016 World Twenty20 match against Bangladesh on 23 March, Pandya took two crucial wickets in the last three balls of match's final over as India beat Bangladesh by one run. His career best bowling figures of 4 for 38 was achieved in the 3rd and final Twenty20 International against England on July 8, 2018, he got 33 Not Out in 14 balls, hitting the winning runs with a six off Jordan. Hardik became first Indian to take 4 wickets and score above 30 runs in a T20I in the same match.  ODI career  Pandya made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against New Zealand on 16 October 2016 at Dharamshala. He became the fourth Indian to be named player of the match on ODI debut after Sandeep Patil, Mohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul. In his first ODI innings as a batsman, he scored 36 runs from 32 balls. In the group stages of ICC Champions Trophy, Pandya hit three consecutive sixes off Imad Wasim in the same over before rain stopped play. On 18 June 2017, in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval, he struck a 43-ball 76 in a losing cause, after coming in with India at 54/5 following a top order collapse. He was selected in the ODI XI of the year 2017 by Cricinfo. In April 2019, he was named in India's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. On 27 June 2019, in the match against the West Indies, Pandya played in his 50th ODI.  Test career  Pandya was included in India's Test squad as a batsman for their home series against England in late 2016, but was eventually left out after he injured himself while training in the nets at the PCA Stadium. He was named in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in July 2017 and played his first Test on 26 July in Galle. In the 3rd and the final Test match against Sri Lanka at Pallekele, Pandya scored his maiden Test century, and set the record for becoming the first Indian batsman to score a Test century just before lunch. He also set the record for scoring the most runs in a single over of a Test innings for India, scoring 26 runs. This century was his first century in international cricket.  Personal life  Pandya got engaged to an Indian based Serbian dancer and actress Nata≈°a Stankoviƒá on 1 January 2020. On 30 July, their first child, a boy, was born.  Controversy  In January 2019, Pandya appeared with teammate K. L. Rahul on the show Koffee with Karan, and made several controversial comments which were met with immediate public backlash. During the interview, Pandya spoke about how he had proudly informed his parents of his first sexual encounter, which was well-received by them. He also proclaimed that he likes to \\"observe how women move\\" at high-end bars and nightclubs, as well as on social media and then went on to liken himself to a black person saying, \\"I'm a little from the black side so I need to see how they move\\". The public categorized his monologue as indecent, derogatory, misogynistic and disgraceful. Pandya apologized for his remarks by saying that he had gotten carried away by the nature of the show. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) responded to the controversy by saying, \\"It will be considered whether players should even be allowed to appear on such shows which have got nothing to do with cricket.\\" The BCCI found the comments as very crass, sexist and cringeworthy, and was not impressed by the apology, seeking appropriate legal action into the matter as it was a breach of conduct. Both Pandya and Rahul were handed a suspension until a pending investigation and were called back from the ongoing tours of Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, on 13 January 2019, Gillette suspended their brand association with Pandya for its Mach3 razor. On 24 January 2019, after lifting the suspension on Pandya and Rahul, the BCCI announced that Pandya would re-join the squad for the matches in New Zealand.

Rules Ga√´tan Beaujannot (left) and Alain Rivollet (right) presenting Concept in 2013. Concept during play. Concept is a guessing game where players have to guess a concept, such as a word, a name, or a phrase. The players who know the target concept provide hints by marking its attributes and attributes of related concepts on the game board with different-coloured markers, while other players guess. Giving verbal hints is not allowed. The official rules state that the game is played with teams of two players each. On each team's turn, they draw a card and choose a concept from there. Each card has three difficulty levels (blue, red and black) with three concepts each. The team then places a green question mark on the picture illustrating the main category of the concept. They can then further specify the concept with green cubes defining the attributes of the concept and optionally also specify related concepts with red, blue, yellow and black exclamation points and accordingly coloured cubes. The other teams then try to guess the concept. The player who guesses correctly gains one double VP (Victory Point) token while the team who chose the concept gain one single VP token each. The game then proceeds with the next team. Once every double VP token has been used, the game ends. The player with the most VPs wins. The game rules state that using teams is not mandatory, the game can also be played with each player playing against each other.  Reception  The game received generally positive reviews with Board Game Quest suggesting that it provides \\"a good amount of fun in a very accessible game\\" and Board Games Land describing it as \\"a perfect alternative to Charades\\".

Rules Indigo is a game for two to four players. The idea of the game is to collect jewels from the board by laying tiles. The board takes the form of a hexagonal grid, with one tile present at the centre and six at the edge, with even intervals. The rest of the board is empty. On the centre tile are six jewels: one sapphire and five emeralds. The six tiles at the edge have one topaz each. The edges of the board between the tiles with topazes are marked with the players' colours. Depending on the number of players, a player can either have an edge all to his/her own, share an edge with another player, or both. On a player's turn, he/she places a tile anywhere on the board. The tiles have paths on them. If the tile touches another tile's edge having a jewel on it, the jewel travels along the formed path, only stopping when it hits empty space, the board's edge, or another jewel. A jewel reaching the board's edge is removed from play, becoming the property of the edge's owner. If the edge is shared between two players, one player gets the jewel and the other gets a duplicate jewel from storage. If two jewels collide, both are removed from play, not becoming any player's property. On the centre tile, the sapphire may only be moved after all five emeralds are already in play. The game ends when no jewels remain on the board. Then the players' jewels are scored. A sapphire awards 3 points, an emerald 2 points, and a topaz 1 point. The player with the most points wins.

He was the brother of Panagiotis and Georgios Sekeris. Early life  Athanasios studied in Dimitsana‚Äôs School. He then followed his older brother to Istanbul, where he completed his studies and started working as a merchant. In 1816, he settled in Odessa as co-partner of his brother.  Career  In 1817, Nikolaos Skoufas introduced Anathos and Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos to the Filiki Eteria. The last one was hosted by Athanasios Sekeris in his house in Odessa. During that time, the headquarters‚Äô transfer to Istanbul was decided. Before Skoufas‚Äô departing to Istanbul, he revealed to Athanasios the Supreme Leader and appointed him as co-leader with Odessa as the headquarters and responsible for Bessarabia. When Skoufas departed Odessa, he took Anagnostopoulos and a reference letter for his brother, Panagiotis Sekeris. A few weeks later, he met Panagiotis and introduced him to the Filiki Eteria. This introduction was crucial because, through Panagiotis, the Filiki Eteria jointed Istanbul‚Äôs merchants. They gave financial assistance to Athanasios, while their influence and skills facilitated its expansion. Athanasios decided to return home when the Greek War of Independence began. He left Odessa in late August 1821. He served as the head of a military unit in Tripolitsa in several battles. In one battle he was wounded in his right hand. After the death of his brother Georgios, he tried to receive appointment to some public post and to be compensated for his family's sacrifices to the Revolution. In 1823, he was appointed plenipotentiary of Tripolitsa province in the Second National Assembly at Astros, and in 1824 he was appointed as prefect of Old Patras. From 1828 to 1831 he was member of the provincial council of elders of Nafplio. From 1835 until 1843, he was president of a court of first instance. In 1844, Sekeriswas dismissed from his post as magistrate and he became superintendent and warehouse worker at Public Revenue of Argos‚Äô municipality. The year of Athanasios' death is unknown.

The silver hoard consisted of two parts with a total weight of before conservation and consisted of, among other things, 14,295 coins most of which were Islamic from other countries. A third deposition containing over of bronze scrap-metal was also found. The three caches had been hidden under the floorboards of a Viking outhouse sometime during the 9th century.  Discovery  On Friday 16July 1999, a team of reporters from the Swedish television TV4 were in the socken of Othem on Gotland to film a cultural feature from Almedalen Week. They chose to do a segment on the problem with looting of archaeological sites with archaeologist Jonas Str√∂m acting as their guide along with Kenneth Jonsson, a professor of numismatics, who happened to be on the island at that time. Spillings farm was selected for the filming since about 150 silver coins and bronze objects had been found there earlier by the landowner Bj√∂rn Engstr√∂m. With filming complete, Str√∂m and Jonsson decided to continue their survey of the field. Twenty minutes after the TV-crew had left, they heard a strong signal from their metal detector, which led them to the smaller of the two silver caches. A couple of hours later and only from the first find, they received another signal from the detector: The site was hurriedly cordoned off, back-up crew from the museum was sent for, permission for an archaeological excavation was immediately sought at the County Administrative Board and guards were posted. However, instead of keeping the find a secret, the Gotland Museum decided to go public with the find immediately. During the first weekend, over 2,000 people visited the excavation site. Some days later, the metal detector indicated a third metal cache approximately from the first find. The archaeologists concentrated on uncovering the two first finds before starting with the third. Due to the size of the hoards and the fragility of the objects, the bottom layers of the depositions were encapsulated in plaster. Only when they tried to lift the finds out of the soil did the archaeologists realize how heavy the hoards were. The smaller weighed and the larger one . An attempt to X-ray the finds at the local hospital failed because they contained so much silver that the X-ray plates remained blank. The larger find was intact but the smaller had been damaged by a plough. A previous landowner who visited the excavation commented that he had found metal wires around the find-spot several years earlier, but thinking that they were only steel wire, he had thrown them away. It was therefore concluded that the treasure had originally been even larger. With the two first caches taken care of, the third deposition was excavated almost a year after the first discovery. It contained over of bronze scrap-metal, most of which had been partially melted into a 'cake'. This find was deemed even more valuable since very few finds contain such large amounts of bronze intended for smelting.  Further excavations  Location of depositories in the stone foundation at Spillings Additional excavations were conducted in the summer of 2000 and in 2003-06. Remnants of wood, iron rivets and mounts as well as a lock mechanism were found, leading to the conclusion that the caches had been stored in chests. An extended survey and excavation revealed the foundations of a building and indicated that the hoards had been placed under the floorboards of what would probably have been a warehouse, shed or storage rather than a dwelling since it had no hearth. Carbon dating showed that the building had been in use between 540 and 1040. The foundations and the remaining postholes indicated a regular Viking Age structure, about with a slanting sedge-covered roof, much like other similar finds on Gotland. It had been built on an older Iron Age foundation.  Find  The silver deposits were roughly square-shaped with rounded corners, about , suggesting that they had been in sacks of cloth, leather or pelt, inside boxes or chests of wood. In the bronze deposit were found substantial pieces of wood and iron, such as fittings, ironwork, nails and a lock-device, showing that the bronze had been kept in a sturdy chest. A carbon dating of the chest dated it to approximately 675, making it older than the objects stored inside it. Although silver hoards and treasures are not unusual on Gotland, this was an exceptionally large find. One explanation may be found in the location near some of the island's best and most significant harbours during the Viking Age. The silver in the caches would have been enough to pay the tax to the Swedish king for all of Gotland for five years. The following surveys and excavations of the fields surrounding the find-site showed that the site had been inhabited continuously over 1,000 years up until the 19th century. Over 700 more objects were retrieved, such as objects of bronze and copper, fired clay, clothes pins, a piece of glass, tile pieces, chains, needles, glass beads, slag, iron nails, polished semi-precious stones and brick. The Spillings Hoard is the world's largest Viking silver treasure. A finder's fee of SEK 2,091,672 (approx. US$242,400) was paid to the landowner for the treasure, although the real value of it is much higher. It was the largest amount of money ever paid for a find in Sweden, according to director of the Swedish National Heritage Board Sven G√∂the. The hoard was dated to have been hidden some time after 870‚Äì71. The treasure is on permanent display in the Gotland Museum. , more than of silver from over 700 caches deposited between the 9th and 12th centuries have been found on Gotland. This includes 168,000 silver coins from the Arab world, North Africa and Central Asia.  Silver depositions  The caches contained silver objects ranging from coins, bars, thread and hacksilver to be used as raw material, to jewelry such as fingerings, bangles and pendants. Much of the material had been bundled up to correspond with the mark-weight system of the Viking Age, in which made one mark. Almost 60% of the find consisted of 486 bangles or parts thereof, making it the largest ever find of such silver jewellery . Most of the bracelets weighed around 100 grams under the mark-weight system and were of traditional Gotlandic design, a number of them have very detailed ornamentation. There were also bangles of British and Western Scandinavian design as well as plain, undecorated fingerings of Finnish and British design, known as ring money. Khazar coin, 800 Of the 14,295 coins found, 14,200 were Islamic dirhams, four were Nordic (from Hedeby), one was Byzantine and 23 were from Persia. The earliest, a Persian coin, dates from 539 and the latest from 870. Many of the coins (as well as the bangles) had marks that may have been made when the purity of the silver was tested. There were several imitations and fakes among the coins. The illegal copies were made from good silver, but made in other places than where the originals were minted. All in all, 69 different minting locations from 15 present-day countries were identified in the hoard. During the conservation work of the larger hoard (No 2) it became evident that the larger objects had been placed at the bottom of the cache and the smaller ones, ending with the cut coins, had been strewn on top.  Moses coin  One of the most noted coins in the hoard, dated to 800, is from the Khazar Kingdom and designated the \\"Moses Coin\\". According to written sources the Khazars are believed to be Jews, but few objects have been found to support this claim. The coin is inscribed with \\"Moses is the messenger of God\\" instead of the usual Muslim text \\"Muhammad is the messenger of God\\".  Bronze deposition  The \\"cake\\" from the bronze cache Excavated in the same manner as the silver hoards, the bronze cache was encapsulated on site and transported to the Gotland Museum for further examination. The objects were removed layer after layer from top to bottom until the large melted 'cake', about in diameter was uncovered. Most of the bronze objects were broken, fragmented or partially melted, suggesting that they were kept in the heartwood chest to be used as raw material for new artifacts. Individual finds consisted of parts of, and some complete, necklaces, bangles, fingerings, pins for clothes and mounts for drinking horns. The bronze objects span a period of 200‚Äì300 years and are mostly of Baltic origin or possibly Russian with only a few of them Scandinavian. Even though several scholars have been involved in identifying the deposition, no consensus have been reached regarding why the hoard was collected or the dating of it. Two theories are that it was either the stock of a foundryman living on Gotland, or booty from a Viking raid that was hidden under the floor of the outhouse.

The First Congregational Church was at the time heavily indebted due to the costs of a cathedral-style building which had a 176 foot high tower, more than 100 rooms, auditoriums, and a gymnasium. The church had 1,500 members at Fifield's arrival, but after Fifield initiated a major increase in activities membership rose to over 4,500 in the beginning of the 1940s and the debt was paid off in 1942.

Fifield strongly opposed a merger of the Congregational Christian Churches with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ. The merger was approved by a clear majority of the general council of the Congregational churches in 1949, and Fifield became part of the minority movement that tried to stop the merger from going through.

The message was mainly directed towards Congregational, Presbyterian and Episcopal ministers and laymen through radio and television programs and a monthly magazine Faith and Freedom with William Johnson as editor and James C. Ingebretsen as a major contributor. Fiefield and the organization attracted the attention of philanthropist J. Howard Pew and former President Herbert Hoover whom Fifield met and with whom he corresponded. In 1940, Fifield gave a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers at the Waldorf Astoria New York where he praised capitalism and business leaders, while denouncing Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. The speech, which underlined that Christian leaders and religious arguments were crucial in the effort to promote a free-market agenda, was exceptionally well received. In 1949, Spiritual Mobilization started broadcasting a short radio program called \\"The Freedom Story\\". By late 1951 the program, which included brief remarks by Fifield, was broadcast on more than 800 radio stations.

Family  Ehrhardt's uncle was the successful locomotive manufacturer and inventor Johann Heinrich Ehrhardt. Career Around 1864 he studied and worked at the company Richard Hartmann in Chemnitz, which was the largest Saxon company. Patents and start-ups He registered 128 patents in the German Empire. In 1891 he patented the process that became known as the \\"Ehrhardt'schen pressing and drawing method\\" for the manufacture of seamless tubes. He influenced the development of the recoiling gun. The Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901 mountain cannon was named after him. He founded in 1878, among other things, a metal and arms factory in Zella St. Blasius, 1889, the Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik AG in D√ºsseldorf, 1896, the Eisenach car factory and the Blasius 1903 Ehrhardt Automobil AG. In 1920 at the age of about 80, Ehrhardt resigned from the leadership of Rheinmetall. Commercial vehicle Heinrich Ehrhardt taught in 1903 in his hometown of Zella St. Blasius. He created the Gustav Ehrhardt Automobile AG for passenger utility vehicles. This automobile factory, which was housed in the Maschinenfabrik has existed since 1878. Since 1903 trucks were built for the imperial army administration. From 1906, subsidized by the German Reich, only trucks were built. Purchasers had to establish that the army would have access to them in case of war. The Ehrhardt truck years had eleven types. Its gross vehicle weight ranged from 2.5 to 6 tons. A balloon defense special vehicle was built with eight tons dead weight at the start of the war. In 1924 two types of trucks were built with 35 hp and 80 hp. In 1925 the commercial vehicle industry was shut down. Passenger cars Ehrhardt initially had 31.2 percent ownership in the joint-stock company vehicle factory Eisenach (FFE). This was the vehicle factory that became Germany's third auto maker. Guns and bicycles were manufactured under the \\"Wartburg\\" brand, and by the end of 1898 car production had begun under the same name. The Wartburg motor car was modeled after the French two- cylinder engine \\"Decauville\\". Ehrhardt's son Gustav led the plant in Eisenach. Its 1,300 workers made the firm one of Thuringia's largest. In order to convince the public and shareholders of the quality of the \\"Wartburg\\"-Motorwagens, Heinrich Ehrhardt and a companion drove up a steep road to show that the car could handle the climb. In 1903, Ehrhardt withdrew after losses and disagreements other shareholders. The Decauville license was taken away. He founded Ehrhardt Automobil AG, making luxury cars, such as the \\"Emperor class\\" limousine. A brochure from 1911 shows an output of 50 hp from 8 liters capacity. The price was 26,000 marks.
