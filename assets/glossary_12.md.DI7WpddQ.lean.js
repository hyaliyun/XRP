He is perhaps best remembered today for having created roles in plays by George Bernard Shaw and for appearing in King John (1899), the earliest known example of any film based on Shakespeare, Early life Calvert was born in Manchester, Lancashire one of eight children, and the third son, of the actors Charles Alexander Calvert and his wife Adelaide Calvert (baptised April 1836 - died 20 September 1921).Richard Foulkes, ‚ÄòCalvert, Charles Alexander (1828‚Äì1879)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 8 May 2017 He was educated privately in Manchester and in Germany. Although actively discouraged by his parents from taking up acting as a career, Louis Calvert made his theatrical debut in Natal in South Africa in 1878 before moving on to appear in Australia and then returning to Great Britain in 1880. During the 1880s he trained at Sarah Thorne's School of Acting at Margate, Kent, and went on to appear with Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in London and toured with Lillie Langtry in the United States.Richard Foulkes, ‚ÄòLouis Calvert (1859‚Äì1923)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 9 April 2011 Theatrical career Calvert as Andrew Undershaft (left) and Harley Granville-Barker (right) as Adolphus Cusins in Major Barbara (1905) He played Mark Antony to Frank Benson's Julius Caesar, and for the Manchester Committee of the Independent Theatre Society he staged and produced an Elizabethan-style version of Richard II in 1895. This innovative production brought Calvert to the attention of actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who made him co-producer of his production of Henry IV, Part 1 at the Haymarket Theatre in May 1896, and again with Julius Caesar at Her Majesty's Theatre in January 1898. He appeared in Ben Greet's 1897 production of Macbeth at the Olympic Theatre. Macbeth on 'Shakespeare & the Players - the Plays' Emory University He appeared as Casca in Tree's 1899 production Julius Caesar, and as Cardinal Pandulf in The Life and Death of King John in the same year, which was filmed as King John (1899), the earliest known example of any film based on Shakespeare. For Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre Calvert played Francis Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1900,'Notes on the Foreign Stage' The New York Times 7 January 1900 and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing in 1905.Original illustration from the production - Folger Shakespeare Library Of Calvert's interpretation of Dogberry, George Bernard Shaw wrote in the Saturday Review: \\"To Mr Calvert [the dialogue] is as natural as his native speech; he makes it clear, expressive and vivid without the least preoccupation.\\"Shaw, George Bernard 'The Dying Tongue of Elizabeth' Saturday Review 11 February 1905 In 1904 Calvert created the role of Tom Broadbent in George Bernard Shaw's John Bull's Other Island at the Royal Court Theatre under the management of J.E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker. At the same theatre, and under the same management, he appeared in Shaw's You Never Can Tell in 1905, and created the role of Andrew Undershaft in Major Barbara in November 1905.Original programme for Major Barbara (1905) - 'The Quintessential G.B.S. : Stage & Screen' - Brown University Library Calvert also appeared in the silent film David Garrick (1911)Calvert on the Internet Movie Database Later years Richard Bennett (left) and Louis Calvert (right) in the English adaptation of Leonid Andreyev's He Who Gets Slapped (1922) Calvert frequently toured the United States, and in 1909 he was appointed as the actor-manager of the New Theatre in New York, where his responsibilities were to direct and star in productions of English plays, and especially the works of William Shakespeare with a company made up of British and American actors. The first play staged was Antony and Cleopatra in November 1909 and starring E. H. Sothern and Julia Marlowe. The production was not a success; nor was the next production, Twelfth Night in January 1910. However, Calvert returned to his theatrical roots with his staging of A Winter's Tale in March 1910 which was a success largely due to his use of ensemble acting and Elizabethan staging. He directed Major Barbara at the Playhouse Theatre in New York City in 1915,'Major Barbara - 1915 Broadway' on broadwayworld.com and an Elizabethan-style version of The Tempest for the Shakespeare tercentenary in 1916. Calvert spent his latter years in the United States, where he already had numerous relatives, becoming a teacher of Shakespearean acting in various universities and academies. He appeared with Richard Bennett in the 1922 English adaptation of Leonid Andreyev's He Who Gets Slapped. His last theatrical appearance was in The Adding Machine, which ran from March to May 1923. Louis Calvert married twice: first to the actress Rose Roberts. The marriage was dissolved. Next he married the actress Violet Fenton, with whom he had two daughters, Beatrice 'Ray' Calvert and Patricia Calvert. He died at his home on West 55th Street in New York City on 18 July 1923.

The words are often used as professional jargon rather than as universally applicable terms or concepts. Examples of relevant fields in which the words are useful include reproductive biology, virology, microbiology, parasitology, entomology, and poultry husbandry. Since the words are widely used in the various disciplines, there seems to be little present prospect of replacing them with universal, definitive, and distinct terms. Meaning The terms embryonated, unembryonated and de-embryonated respectively mean \\"having an embryo\\", \\"not having an embryo\\", and \\"having lost an embryo\\", and they most often refer to eggs. In Merriam-Webster the earliest known use of the term \\"embryonated\\" dates from 1687, while Oxford gives a reference dating from 1669. =Embryonate= The term embryonate can be used as an adjective to mean embryonated, or as a noun to mean one containing an embryo (e.g. \\"We selected only the embryonates and discarded the rest\\"). Embryonate can also be used as an intransitive verb meaning to develop an embryo (e.g. \\"In 2-4 weeks after deposition in soil, they embryonate if the soil conditions are suitable\\"). =De-embryonate= De-embryonate refers to the removal of embryos from seeds or similar reproductive units, typically in physiological studies. As with embrionate, it can either be a verb, noun or adjective. In some contexts the term \\"embryonectomy\\" may be used.Lin, Paul P. C.: Effects of methylglyoxal-bis (guanylhydrazone) and abscisic acid on polyamine metabolism in embryonectomized barley seeds. Pub: Plant Growth Regulation Volume 3, Numbers 3-4, 257-268, For example, loss of the embryo may result from the activity of seed predation by insects.M. Al Jabr Ahmed : Effect of Bruchid Beetles (Bruchidius Arabicus Decelle) Infestation on the Germination of Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne) Seeds : American Journal of Environmental Sciences 4 (4): 285-288, 2008 ISSN 1553-345X Usage There often is confusion in applying the term to various classes of unfertilised eggs and trophic eggs, depending on the area of expertise. =Virology= In virology, eggs of domestic poultry are used for culturing viruses for research purposes. Viruses generally can propagate only in live cells, so only a fertilised egg with a good supply of growing embryonic tissue is useful. Practitioners call such an egg embryonated, as opposed to merely fertilised, because they're referring to an advanced stage of development, not merely after fertilisation. =Entomology= In entomology, an egg sometimes is called unembryonated until it contains a visibly segmented embryo. An unembryonated egg might be a trophic egg, probably (but not necessarily) unfertilised or at least infertile. Such an egg will not contain a viable zygote. Alternatively, \\"unembryonated\\" might refer to an egg that is \\"immature\\", not yet well into the process of development. These are likely to take a long time to hatch, as opposed to eggs that are laid partly incubated and ready to hatch soon after, or even at the time of oviposition. \\"Unembryonated\\" can also describe an empty shell, such as a nit, the egg of a louse that has already hatched or has died. However, this usage is rarely described. Burgess (1995) states: \\"We have...come to reserve the term \\"nit\\" for the hatched and empty egg shell and refer to the developing embryonated egg as an \\"egg\\"\\". =Helminthology= In helminthology, the state of development of an egg is often relevant to particular phases of the life cycle; commonly the visible presence of an embryo is an important criterion for egg \\"maturity\\". Use of this definition of embryonated is common in certain scientific literature. For example: \\"...Immature eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool. Eggs become embryonated in water\\".Robert W. Tolan, Jr.; Fascioliasis Due to Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica Infection.

Racing career Ballabriggs' racecourse debut was in a 2-mile National Hunt flat race at Uttoxeter on 14 May 2006. He was ridden by Stephen Craine and finished 5th of 15, beaten 23 lengths, at odds of 13/2. For the next two seasons he campaigned unsuccessfully over hurdles, before switching to chasing in December 2007. At Catterick on 18 January 2008, he was ridden for the first time by Jason Maguire who would go on to be the jockey with which he is most closely associated. At the sixth time of asking, and having finished runner up three times, he finally got off the mark as a chaser, winning a Class 4 Beginners' Chase at Bangor. In 2010, the gelding came to the fore as a chaser, winning five races in succession, including the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at the Cheltenham Festival at odds of 9/1. Then in 2011, Ballabriggs had his greatest moment, winning the 2011 Grand National at Aintree Racecourse. Ridden by Maguire, the horse's odds were between 14-1 and 20-1 before the race, but he unexpectedly remained in the leading pack for most of the race, before pulling out in front over the final fences. Ballabriggs finished ahead of Sam Waley-Cohen's Oscar Time in second, and Tony McCoy's Don't Push It in third. Dehydrated in the unusually hot weather, Ballabriggs immediately returned to the stable after the win, instead of going to the winners enclosure as tradition dictates. It was the first time only the jockey entered the winner's enclosure without his mount. Following his Grand National win Maguire received a five-day ban for excessive use of the whip, Ballabriggs having been driven so hard he required oxygen after the race. The horse never won again following his National success, although he contested two more Grand Nationals, finishing 6th in 2012, and pulling up in 2013, the final race of his career. Retirement He was retired on 13 April 2013 after pulling up in the 2013 Grand National and returned to live on the Isle of Man with owner Trevor Hemmings. He had run 28 races, winning 7.

Like many other buildings built for Freemason meeting places, it shows Classical Revival architecture. Named a city landmark in 1976, the more than 386,000-square-foot building stands 185 feet high and has more than six million cubic feet of space. There are 14 levels with six full floor and eight mezzanine levels. The Temple's ground was broken in 1923 and dedicated in 1926. Created by well-known architectural company Eames & Young with consulting architect Albert B. Groves, it features classic Greek Ionic style exterior architecture with various styles throughout the interior. The Masonic Temple is built in three receding stages, which is symbolic of the three steps in Masonry. Constructed of Bedford limestone with gray granite trim, the main lobby is finished in marble with other rooms featuring its original wool carpet. One of the property's many highlights is an unfinished theater with 2,200 seats. The lobby has a 38-foot mural titled ‚ÄúThe Origins of Freemasonry‚Äù, which was created in 1941 by Jessie Housley Holliman and dedicated by Senator Harry S. Truman. It is the only surviving mural by noted African American artist Holliman in a St. Louis public building. The Temple's history includes many prominent guests. It houses the former office of then- Senator and Freemason Grand Master Harry S. Truman before he became President of the United States. Charles A. Lindbergh was initiated and participated as a mason at the Temple before his renowned 1927 flight. In 1980, Escape from New York with Ernest Borgnine filmed a scene on the Temple's steps. Borgnine, a Mason, attended Masonic meetings in the building. The ground and first floors and the first-floor mezzanine have areas where the general public is admitted only on days when a meeting is held, which is currently 10 per month. The second floor contains the Eastern Star quarters. Third and fourth floors and their mezzanines were designed to house the Blue Lodges with the potential for eight Blue Lodge halls. The four halls and the fourth floor were not completed, and one area on the third floor was made into a dining room. Fifth and sixth floors were designed to house three of the York Rite organizations, which are known as the Chapter, Council and the Commandery. Most of the building is non-sectarian, but the fifth floor features Christian symbolism. The fifth level hall is 100‚Äô long, 75‚Äô wide and 48‚Äô high.

Draper in 2001. The novel is the third and final installment in the Hazelwood High Trilogy. It depicts the story of an eighteen-year-old African American senior Keisha Montgomery, who is attracted to the twenty-three-year- old track coach Jonathan Hathaway. Plot summary Eighteen-year-old Keisha Montgomery is still recovering from the suicide of her ex-boyfriend, Andy, after she broke up with him. While having the support of her friends and family, she starts to go out. She joins the track team and there meets Jonathan Hathaway, the twenty-three-year-old coach, and principal's son. During a track meeting, a girl named Rita begins arguing with Jonathan. He denies what they were talking about and after shouting some choice curse words, she runs into the woods, never to return to school. Over time, he begins to smooth talk her and they finally become a couple. Her parents disapprove of him being five years older and forbid her to see him. Against their wishes, she continues to see him discreetly. Her friends attempt to warn her about his true ways but she refuses to listen to them. Leon Hawkins, a friend with feelings for Keisha, also tries to warn her. Ignoring everyone's warnings, she uses Leon to cover up her tracks when Jonathan asks her to the Valentine's dance. After the dance, Jonathan takes Keisha to his apartment and he attempts to engage in a sexual moment with her. After seeing her refusal to 'cooperate', Jonathan attempts to force her with a knife. Keisha cuts him and eventually manages to escape. She seeks the help of a homeless woman named Edna who sees her running in the snow. She takes Keisha in and gives Keisha a phone to call her parents. Finally safe in her home, she tells her parents her experience and apologizes sincerely. She also notes her refusal to attend school, as she feels ashamed.

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Missouri. Missouri recognizes same-sex marriages.

On November 14, 2013, Governor Jay Nixon issued an executive order allowing same-sex couples married in other jurisdictions to file a combined Missouri income tax return if they file their federal return jointly. A lawsuit aiming to reverse his order, Messer v. Nixon, was filed in Cole County Circuit Court on January 8, 2014. The ACLU filed a lawsuit, Barrier v. Vasterling, challenging the state's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions in state circuit court on February 1, 2014. On October 3, Judge J. Dale Youngs ruled that Missouri's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions violated the plaintiffs' right to equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions. On October 6, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced the state would not appeal the decision. = Lawsuits = Glossip v. Missouri Department of Transportation Kelly Glossip sued the state for survivor benefits after the death of his husband, a highway patrol officer. After the trial court dismissed his suit, Glossip appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled 5-2 against Glossip in October 2013, saying his claim was denied on the basis of his marital status, not his sexual orientation.Glossip v. Missouri Department of Transportation and Highway Patrol Employees' Retirement System No. SC92583 (Mo., 2013) State of Missouri v. Florida In June 2014, St. Louis officials licensed four same- sex marriages in order to provide the basis for a lawsuit when the state ordered them to stop the practice. St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison found for the plaintiffs on November 5, ruling that Missouri's refusal to license same-sex marriages violates the Missouri and federal constitutions. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster did not to seek a stay of the ruling's implementation. He and the Recorders' Association of Missouri said Judge Burlison's order only applied to the city of St. Louis, where the city's marriage license department began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. St. Louis County, where an official said \\"We believe it's a county- by-county decision\\", began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples the next day. Lawson v. Kelly On June 24, 2014, the ACLU filed Lawson v. Kelly in Jackson County circuit court on behalf of two same-sex couples who had been denied marriage licenses in Jackson County. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster had the case moved to federal district court, where U.S. District Court Judge Ortrie D. Smith ruled for the plaintiffs on November 7. He ordered Jackson County to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but stayed his order pending appeal. Despite the stay, Jackson County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples immediately following the decision. On November 21, the plaintiffs asked Judge Smith to lift his stay in light of State of Missouri v. Florida, noting that the state has no position on the request. Attorney General Koster filed notice of appeal in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 5.  Walsh & Nance v. Friendship Village of South County  After a senior housing complex rejected a married lesbian couple, a housing discrimination lawsuit was filed in 2018 by the National Center for Lesbian Rights and the ACLU of Missouri. The lawsuit argued that this was a case of sex discrimination. A federal judge dismissed the case in 2019, claiming that the discrimination occurred not on the basis of sex but rather sexual orientation, and that the federal Fair Housing Act does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. The plaintiffs appealed to the 8th Circuit. The 8th Circuit has chosen to wait for the Supreme Court to issue related rulings that are expected in Spring 2020. (Those expected rulings include Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.) =U.S. Supreme Court ruling= On June 26, 2015, the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v.

On July 7, Governor Jay Nixon issued an executive order directing all state agencies to comply with that ruling, while also rescinding his earlier, narrower executive order with respect to same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, which his new ordered superseded.

Trans advocacy and birth certificate changes On April 22, 2013 case 13AR-CV00157 was heard before the Missouri courts on the matter of a transgender name change with amendments - the accompanying amendments dealt with an explicit granting of the petitioner the right to change gender with the Missouri Department of Revenue and other venues pertaining to the use of state identification. On May 20, 2013 case 13AR-CV00240 was heard before the Missouri courts, with a partial delay, on the matter of gender affirmation and recognition. Although Mo. Ann. Stat. ¬ß 193.215(9) was not completely invalidated via court orders 13AR-CV00157 and 13AR-CV00240, the orders effectively silenced the discriminatory law until repealed by order of a federal court or by legislative action. The ruling in 13AR-CV00240 that silences Mo. Ann. Stat. ¬ß 193.215(9) reads, in brief, as follows, \\"...it is found that said request of relief is proper and that such change will not be detrimental to the interest of any persons, nor be against the interest of the state or of any given establishment ... Wherefore, the court understands that select circumstances, such as this case, require judicial intervention in order to prevent discrimination. Moreover, the explicit requirement of surgical procedures or medications that may be deemed unsuitable, dangerous, or unnecessary to the Petitioner by medical assertion shall be given relief notwithstanding Mo. Ann. Stat. ¬ß 193.215(9)...\\" Because of the judicial precedent established in the case of 13AR-CV00240 there are many transgender individuals and lawyers seeking similar relief in other restrictive states. A court order will be needed with certified proof of change of sex (this certified proof will need to be printed on the hospital's official letterhead including the attending physician's licensing and contact information; also, the certification needs to state \\"The Petitioner's physical sex has been altered and the surgical changes are irreversible in accordance with Mo. Ann. Stat. ¬ß 193.215(9)\\"). All amendment questions or issuance of an amended certificate of birth should be referred to the Missouri Bureau of Vital Statistics and any legal questions concerning the process should be referred to a lawyer. Any changes on the birth certificate will be noted on the original copy of the birth record and marked \\"amended\\" on the abstract copy with the corresponding authority (law) listed. The original birth certificate, not including the abstract copy, will have the old name and gender struck through with the corrected name and gender typed above the strike-through. Any challenges to this process will have to be filed in a district or federal court after a circuit court has denied petition.https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=40802 See also * PROMO References External links * Lawson v.

It was originally aired on April 20, 2011. The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Michael Spiller. In the episode, Mitchell and Cameron are looking to assign legal guardians for Lily in case anything were to happen to them, and are secretly assessing their family members. But no one is impressive, as they witness Jay giving Manny a dose of tough love, Claire secretly taking Luke to a child psychologist to assess his development, and Haley and Alex getting into some delinquent activities at school. \\"Someone to Watch Over Lily\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The episode was viewed by 9.83 million households and received a 3.8 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it the lowest rated episode of the season tying with \\"Mother Tucker\\". Plot Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) are looking for a legal guardian for Lily in case the two were to die, and are secretly assessing their family members. After turning down the option of Claire (Julie Bowen) and Phil (Ty Burrell) to be the ones, Mitchell is trying to convince Cameron that Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) can be the best guardians while Cameron says that his family could be Lily's guardians, something that Mitchell rejects saying that Cam's family is in Missouri, far away from everything Lily knows. Jay takes Manny (Rico Rodriguez) to a store and Mitch and Cam go with them. While they are discussing about who can be Lily's guardian, they witness Jay making Manny ascend a rock climbing wall in a sports store. In the meantime Gloria took Lily with her for a walk and she pierced her ears. When everyone comes back home and sees that, the discussion of Jay and Gloria being the best guardians comes up again. Meanwhile, Claire is secretly taking Luke (Nolan Gould) to a child psychologist to assess his development because she is worried about him. Phil finds out about it and he is already there, surprising Claire. After the session is over, Claire and Phil are fighting about something Claire said to the psychologist; that she is afraid that Luke is turning into Phil. While they are fighting, they get into their cars to get back home, accidentally leaving Luke behind. Back home, while they are talking, they realize that they left Luke behind and they panic. On their way to go and find him, someone brings Luke back home by limousine. Listening to his story and how he managed to find someone to bring him back home, Claire says that he is an incredible kid and she should not be worried. Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley's friend Gabby (Rachael Marie) break into their school and spray shaving foam into a classmate's locker, for which a security guard arrests them. Mitch and Cam want to make the announcement about who will be Lily's guardians. Mitch is ready to say that they will be Claire and Phil but Cameron, after a discussion he had with Manny about Jay, interrupts him and says that Jay and Gloria will be the ones. That makes Gloria really happy. Claire is not that happy with that decision and she is trying to ask why they did not chose her and Phil since they are raising three kids amazingly. While saying that, Phil tells her that they have to go because their daughters had vandalized the school. Production \\"Someone to Watch Over Lily\\" was written by co-executive producer Bill Wrubel, his sixth writing credit for the series.

All of the band's works have been released via Bridge 9 Records, aside from the album Travels, which was initially released via Topshelf Records, but was later reissued on Bridge 9 Records. Their studio album, Letters Home, was released on July 16, 2013 and debuted at number 72 on Billboard Top 200 chart, number 1 on the vinyl chart and number 13 on the Current Alternative Album chart. They released an album in 2015 titled, Abandoned and in 2019 they released their self-titled album. Defeater has toured with the likes of La Dispute, Carpathian, Comeback Kid, Bane, Energy. and Miles Away. They supported August Burns Red in 2013. They played the second stage at Hevy Music Festival 2011 and appeared on the second half of the 2013 Vans' Warped Tour, playing on the Monster Stage. Musical style and lyrics Defeater is a melodic hardcore band who like to take \\"creative liberties\\" when crafting songs. According to guitarist Jay Maas, \\"There's a prevalent thing in this genre where if you're not doing what hardcore bands have been doing for the last 25 years almost verbatim, you're fucking up.\\" Defeater also showed their softer side with the four acoustic tracks at the end of their second studio album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights. Lyrically, Defeater is a concept band. All of their music serves as narration over one overarching story, telling of the struggles of a working class New Jersey family in the Post-World War II Era. Vocalist Derek Archambault stated in a 2009 interview that all of Defeater's work would take place within this story. Their debut album, Travels, established the story and characters. It tells of a younger brother, born to an abusive, alcoholic father who is a veteran of the war. An older brother who looks down on him and admires his father despite his many faults and an addict mother who gave up trying to find something better when they were children. He grows up in a household that doesn't want him and eventually runs away from home after killing his father while protecting his mother. He attempts to survive as a drifter before settling in New York City. There he meets another homeless man singing, which inspires him to return and fix the wrongs he left behind. However, in the years that passed, his mother died and the only thing waiting for him is his brother and no chance for redemption. Their EP Lost Ground tells the story of the beggar from \\"Prophet in Plain Clothes\\" in Travels, a homeless street performer whose song inspires the younger brother to stop running from his past and problems. Lost Ground reveals the Prophet's past, an African American World War II veteran that returns home only to find his service and sacrifice means nothing and is shunned for the color of his skin. Hopeless, he becomes an alcoholic train hopper and street performer, singing of his struggles in order to survive hoping that maybe he can change someone's life for the better. Empty Days & Sleepless Nights returns to the New Jersey family, this time centered around the older brother of the protagonist of Travels and covers the time span directly from the moment in \\"Forgiver Forgetter\\" when the father is murdered by the younger brother, up to the younger brother's return in \\"Debts\\", albeit from the elder's perspective. The older brother, still struggling to cope with the breakup of his family, begins working to support his heroin addicted mother, all the while under the pressure to live up to the father he idolised and the burning hatred of his brother wishing vengeance on him the moment he returns. However, eventually he decides to settle down and gets married, but his marriage quickly begins to suffer as his drinking takes its toll on him and an old bookie demands payment for his father's debts. After pushing the bookie too far, he knocks the elder brother unconscious in a bar fight. The elder brother returns home later that night to find his wife raped and murdered. With nothing left to live for and his mother's death brought on by her addiction, he works and waits for his brother to return home. Letters Home features the life of the father of the family, structured in reverse chronological order, each song is a letter that the father wrote while serving in WW2. The album covers the father's life prior to \\"Blessed Burden\\" in Travels, showing his shattered state of mind as he struggles to cope with his failed marriage and trauma experienced in war. All the way to his learning of his own brother's death in the Pacific which is the catalyzing event that triggers his downward spiral into alcoholism and domestic abuse. The latest album is titled Abandoned and it is following the story of the Catholic priest in the song \\"Cowardice\\" from Travels. After being saved while fighting in the Western front of WW2, he returns to America and joins the priesthood to pay his debt despite not believing in God. He struggles with heroin addition and has an ongoing affair with the mother from the previous albums. After she overdoses (told both from the older sons point of view in \\"Empty Days and Sleepless Nights\\" and from the priest's point of view in \\"Abandoned\\"), the priest continues a downward spiral until the younger son from Travels visits him, as described in both \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Cowardice\\" from the priest and younger son's perspective respectively. The younger son from \\"Travels\\" visits the priest seeking absolution for the murder of his father, his brother, and the abandonment of his mother but finding none, kills himself by jumping from the top of the church. The album ends with the priest burying the son and reveals that the younger son was the product of the ongoing heroin fueled affair between the priest and mother from the family in the main story. The fact he was a product of an affair was alluded to several times on previous albums. Almost two months after the release of Abandoned Defeater parted ways with guitarist Jay Maas citing both personal and creative differences. On March 5, 2019, the band released a music video for \\"Mother's Sons\\" and announced their self-titled album, produced by Will Yip, will be released May 10, 2019.

The Teton fault is located at the base of these mountains. The Teton fault is a normal fault located in northwestern Wyoming. The fault has a length of 44 miles (70 km) and runs along the eastern base of the Teton Range. Vertical movement on the fault has caused the dramatic topography of the Teton Range.Byrd, J.O.D., Smith, R.B., Geissman, J.W. (1994) The Teton fault, Wyoming: Topographic signature, neotectonics, and mechanisms of deformation. Journal of Geophysical Research (99). No. B10. p. 20095‚Äì20122.Pickering-White, B.J., Smith, R.B., Husen, S., Farrell, J.M., Wong, I. (2009). Seismicity and earthquake hazard analysis of the Teton- Yellowstone region, Wyoming. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research. (188) p. 277‚Äì296  Geologic setting  The Teton fault is located in a unique geologic setting. The fault is on the boundary of four major geologic provinces: the Basin and Range, Idaho-Wyoming Thrust belt, Rocky Mountain Foreland, and the Yellowstone volcanic plateau. The Basin and Range province is a region of east-west crustal extension. This province adds tension perpendicular to the fault line causing the fault blocks to move apart. The Idaho-Wyoming Thrust belt is located south of the Teton fault and is a region of thick and deformed crust that prevents the fault from extending farther south. The Rocky Mountain Foreland is located east of the Teton fault and is a region of thicker crust. This section of crust is heavier and adds to the vertical downward force on the hanging wall of fault. The Yellowstone volcanic plateau is a region of uplift and expansion that influences both vertical and horizontal forces on the Teton fault. The Teton fault is unique in that it dips or slopes to the east. The majority of major faults in the Basin and Range province dip to the west. The unique dip of the Teton fault can be explained by the subsidence of the Snake River Plain. The Snake River Plain is located to the west of the Teton fault and was formed by the migration of the Yellowstone hotspot forming prehistoric calderas across southern Idaho. As this section of crust cools it tends to subside causing the footwall of the fault to tilt down toward the west. The Teton fault is also an important feature in a larger region of seismic activity called the Intermountain Seismic Belt. This region extends from western Montana south to northern Arizona.Smith, R.B., Byrd, O.D., (1993). The Teton fault, Wyoming: seismotectonics, Quaternary history, and earthquake hazards. Geology of Wyoming: Geological Survey of Wyoming Memoir. No. 5, p. 628‚Äì667.  Geologic history  The development of the Teton fault has been influenced by many past geologic events. In the Precambrian, extensive plutonism caused metamorphism and deformation of the region that would become the Teton Range. During the Mesozoic and early Tertiary, the region underwent compression and crustal thickening. This formed thrust faults and folds. In the Late Tertiary, compressional forces ceased and extensional forces began. This led to the development of the Basin and Range province beginning 20‚Äì17 million years ago. The age of the Teton fault is somewhat controversial. Most estimates range between 2 and 13 million years old with a consensus that most of the movement on the fault occurred within the last 2 million years. Rates of movement on the fault have changed throughout time. At the end of the Pinedale glaciation 16,000 to 14,000 years ago, slip on the fault increased. This was likely due to changing stresses on the fault as glaciers melted.Hampel, A., Hetzel, R., Densmore, A.L. (2007). Postglacial slip-rate increase on the Teton normal fault, northern Basin and Range Province, caused by melting of the Yellowstone ice cap and deglaciation for the Teton Range? The Geological Society of America. (35). No. 12. p. 1107‚Äì1110. The largest known earthquakes on the fault in recent history occurred around 4800 and 8000 years ago. The long intervals between large earthquakes on the fault are consistent with other normal faults in the Intermountain Seismic Belt.  Fault movement  Representation of the Teton fault block. Uplift and erosion of the footwall has resulted in the Teton Range The Teton fault is a normal fault. Therefore, movement on the fault is primarily in a vertical direction. Movement on the Teton fault occurs on a plane that averages a strike of N10¬∞E and dips 45¬∞ to 75¬∞ to the east. The 44 mile length of the fault is broken into three segments. These segments may move separately or with other segments. The southern segment extends from the town of Wilson, Wyoming north to Taggart Lake. The middle segment extends from Taggart Lake to the south end of Jackson Lake. The northern segment extends to the north end of Jackson Lake. The Teton fault is somewhat unusual in the amount of movement that has occurred over a relatively short amount of time. The amount of movement on the fault over its lifetime has been estimated to range from about 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6‚Äì9 km). Some evidence suggests total displacement on the fault may be as high as 36,000 feet (11 km). The average rate of movement on the fault for the late Quaternary is about 1.3 millimeters per year.  Earthquake hazard  The earthquake hazard in the Teton-Yellowstone region is the highest in the intermountain west. Large earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 to 7.0 are estimated to occur in this region roughly every 200 years. However, the Teton fault contributes very little in the way of seismic activity as large earthquakes on the fault occur every 1600 to 6000 years. Most large earthquakes in the region are associated with the Yellowstone caldera and other faults in the area. In a study conducted from 1986 to 2002, it was found that the Teton fault had very little seismic activity. Despite its lack of recent seismic activity, it is believed that the Teton fault could produce a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. An earthquake this large would cause severe ground shaking and potential liquefaction in the valley of Jackson Hole. This would damage or destroy infrastructure and buildings not built to seismic standards. An earthquake could cause the valley of Jackson Hole to tilt slightly to the west altering stream and river channels as well as changing groundwater levels. This could cause flooding in some low-lying areas. A large earthquake would also have the potential to trigger other hazards such as landslides, rockslides and avalanches.

Along with his wife Indira Jaising, he is a founder-member of the Lawyers Collective. He was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health from August 2008 to July 2014. He is currently and acting member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy. Notable cases With the Lawyers Collective Grover led the Naz Foundation's legal case for the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which was a law criminalizing homosexuality in India. Grover led the Lawyers Collective court case against Novartis regarding an interpretation of Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights which would determine the patent status of antiretroviral drugs in India. The result of the case was that the Lawyers Collective prevailed and certain drugs became ineligible for patenting, thus keeping the price of the medications in line with generic medication costs. Grover represented the Cancer Patients Aid Association as an attorney and won the legal fight against drug maker Novartis on the issue of patent of cancer drug Glivec. On the night before Yakub Memon was scheduled to be executed, Anand Grover along with other senior lawyers of the Supreme Court, sought appointment from the Chief Justice of India, H. L. Dattu at his residence. After the Chief Justice constituted a 3 Judge bench, Grover argued for the mandatory 14-day period between the rejection of the mercy plea of a condemned prisoner, and the execution of the death warrant, as per the guidelines set by the Supreme Court of India in the Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India case. Grover argued that an earlier mercy petition submitted to the President was by his brother, and that since all the legal remedies available to the prisoner, including a curative petition, stood exhausted only a day before his scheduled hanging, only the final mercy petition submitted by Yakub himself must be taken into account while evaluating upon the 14-day period. However the Supreme Court rejected the argument noting that Yakub had not disowned the earlier mercy petition by his brother. The bench commented that delaying Yakub's hanging anymore would amount to travesty of justice. Grover expressed disappointment and unhappiness over the judgement and termed it as a tragic mistake. Grover represented Shreya Tripathi in her successful efforts to obtain bedaquiline for the treatment of her extensively drug- resistant tuberculosis.

Les grands pharmaciens: Labarraque (1777-1850) (Revue d'histoire de la pharmacie, 1950, Volume 38, no. 128, pp. 97-107). was a French chemist and pharmacist, notable for formulating and finding important uses for \\"Eau de Labarraque\\" or \\"Labarraque's solution\\", a solution of sodium hypochloriteMyers, R. L. 100 Most Important Chemical Compounds - A Reference Guide (ABC-CLIO, 2007) p. 260. widely used as a disinfectant and deodoriser.Labarraque, Antoine-Germain, Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale, volume 28 (1859), columns 323-324. Labarraque's use of sodium and calcium hypochlorite solutions in the disinfection of animal gut processing facilities and morgues, as well as his published reports of their application to treat gangrene and putrescent wounds in living persons in the 1820s, established this practice long before Ignaz Semmelweis employed the same solutions to prevent \\"cadaveric particles\\" from traveling from hospital dissecting rooms to patient examination rooms, starting in 1847. These findings and practices are notable for providing an empirical discovery of antisepsis, starting some 40 years before Pasteur and Lister began to establish the theoretical basis of this practice. Labarraque's solutions and techniques remain in use to the present day. Life and work =Early years and career= Labarraque was born in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques department, on May 29, 1777, the son of Fran√ßois Labarraque and Christine Sousbielle. He spent over 2 years as a pupil of a pharmacist called Pr√©ville in Orthez, but was then drafted into the army as a \\"Grenadier de la Tour d'Auvergne\\". He was promoted to battlefield seargent, and eventually became pharmacist-in-chief at the military hospital of Berra. He contracted Typhus and after his recovery was discharged from the military in 1795. Having taken a liking to Pharmacy, he went to Montpellier to study under Jean-Antoine Chaptal. He then went to Paris, where he worked as a pharmacist and studied at the \\"College of Pharmacy\\" under various teachers including Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. He qualified as a master of Pharmacy in 1805, and in the same year published a work, \\"Sur la dissolution du phosphore\\" (on the dissolution of Phosphorus) followed by \\"Sur les electuaires\\" (On electuaries).\\"A medicine to be taken by licking or sucking; a substance of the consistence of honey for coughs etc.\\" The century dictionary and cyclopedia, volume 4 (1896). He became a member of the \\"Soci√©t√©s de pharmacie et de m√©decine\\" in 1809 after presenting a paper, \\"Sur les teintures alcooliques et quelques exp√©riences sur la teinture alcoolique de benjoin\\" (Alcoholic tinctures and some experiments on the alcoholic tincture of Benzoin). Subsequently, Labarraque took part in several commissions to examine presentations made to the society. =\\"Labarraque's solution\\"= In France (as elsewhere) there was a need to process animal guts in order to make musical instrument strings, Goldbeater's skin and other products. This was carried out in premises known as \\"boyauderies\\" (gut factories) and was a notoriously dirty, smelly and unhealthy business. In or about 1820, the Soci√©t√© d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie nationale offered a prize for the discovery of a method, chemical or mechanical, which could be used to separate the peritoneal membrane of animal intestines without causing putrefaction.Knight, Charles. Arts and sciences, volume 1 (Bradbury, Evans & Co., 1867) p. 427. Labarraque experimented with different compositions, finding that a solution of \\"chloride of lime\\" (calcium hypochlorite) had better anti-putrid properties than the already-known \\"Eau de Javel\\" (dilute water solution of sodium hypochlorite, first produced for bleaching purposes by Claude Berthollet in 1789), but caused slower detachment of the gut mucous membrane. He therefore preferred Eau de Javel, which also had the advantage of being cheaper than chlorinated solutions based on potassium salts. Labarreque won the society's prize of 1,500 francs, by showing how a number of these solutions that were made from free chlorine and later gave rise to it, could be employed both to fumigate the workshops, and to loosen the membranes one from another without allowing the offensive odour to escape. He freely acknowledged the part that his predecessors, such as Berthollet (1748‚Äì1822), had played in his discovery. =Invention of antisepsis techniques with chlorine= In 1824, Labarraque was called in to assist after the death of King Louis XVIII, who had died of extensive gangrene. The putrefied body emitting a foul odour long before death, which the chemist was able to remove by covering the body with a sheet soaked in chlorinated water.Corbin, Alain. The Foul and the Fragrant: Odor and the French Social Imagination (Harvard University Press, 1988) pp. 121-2. He was awarded the Prix Montyon, in 1825, by the \\"Acad√©mie des Sciences\\",Andras G√©d√©on. Science and technology in medicine (Springer, 2006) p. 181-2. and, in 1826, a medal by the Acad√©mie de Marseille, for his work on \\"the application of chlorides to hygiene and therapeutics\\". He was made a member of the \\"Acad√©mie de M√©decine\\" (1824), L√©gion d'Honneur (1827) and the \\"Conseil de Salubrit√©\\" (council of health, 1836). Labarraque's research resulted in chlorides and hypochlorites of lime (calcium hypochlorite) and of sodium (sodium hypochlorite) being employed not only in the boyauderies but also for the routine disinfection and deodorisation of latrines, sewers, markets, abattoirs, anatomical theatres and morgues. They were also used, with success, in hospitals, lazarets, prisons, infirmaries (both on land and at sea), magnaneries, stables, cattle-sheds, etc.; and for exhumations, embalming, during outbreaks of epidemic illness, fever, Blackleg (disease) in cattle, etc. Labarraque's chlorinated lime and soda solutions had been advocated in 1828 to prevent infection (called \\"contagious infection\\", and presumed to be transmitted by \\"miasmas\\") and also to treat putrefaction of existing wounds, including septic wounds.Scott, James, transl. (1828). On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine Published by S. Highley. In this 1828 work, Labarraque recommended for the doctor to breathe chlorine, wash his hands with chlorinated lime, and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the patient's bed, in cases of \\"contagious infection.\\" During the Paris cholera outbreak of 1832, large quantities of so-called chloride of lime were used to disinfect the capital. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). Labarraque's discovery helped to remove the terrible stench of decay from hospitals and dissecting rooms, and, by doing so, effectively deodorised the Latin Quarter of Paris. These \\"putrid miasmas\\" were thought by many to be responsible for the spread of \\"contagion\\" and \\"infection\\"- both words used before the germ theory of infection. Perhaps the most famous application of Labarraque's chlorine and chemical base solutions was in 1847, when Ignaz Semmelweis used (first) chlorine-water, then cheaper chlorinated lime solutions, to deodorize the hands of Austrian doctors that Semmelweis noticed still carried the stench of decomposition from the dissection rooms to the patient examination rooms. Semmelweis, still long before the germ theory of disease, had theorized that \\"cadaveric particles\\" were somehow transmitting decay from fresh cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known Labarraque's solutions as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). Coincidentally the solutions proved to be far more effective germicides and antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis only knew that soap was less effective, but not why), and the success of these chlorinated agents resulted in Semmelweis's (later) celebrated success in stopping the transmission of childbed fever. Long after the illustrious chemist's death, during the Custer campaigns in North Dakota (1873-4), chief-surgeon, Dr. Henry H Ruger (known as \\"Big Medicine Man\\" by the Indians) used \\"Eau de Labarraque\\" to prevent further deterioration in cases of frostbite.Bunyan, John. The Bunyan Method (Seafield Press, 2007) p. 31. Available for free download at Lulu.com. Much later, during World War I in 1916, a standardized and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite and boric acid was developed by Henry Drysdale Dakin. Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment of a wide variety of open wounds, long before the antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution is still employed in wound irrigation, where it continues to be effective against multiply-antibiotic resistant bacteria (see Century Pharmaceuticals). =Death= Antoine Germain Labarraque died near Paris on December 9, 1850.

It was fought between anti- government rebels and military forces loyal to the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Following the Second Battle of Brega, in which pro-Gaddafi forces captured the town, Ajdabiya was the only major rebel-held city left en route to the rebel capital of Benghazi. The battle for Ajdabiya had been cited as a potential turning point in the conflict on which the fate of the whole rebellion against the Gaddafi government may be decided. On 26 March 2011, Libyan rebels, backed by extensive allied air raids, seized control of the frontline oil town of Ajdabiya from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's forces. During the first phase of the battle, pro-Gaddafi forces seized the strategic road junction leading to Benghazi and Tobruk, and captured most of the city. The city centre remained in rebel hands, but was surrounded by pro-government forces and cut off from outside assistance. After the second phase, anti- Gaddafi forces recaptured the road junction and cleared loyalist forces from the city, sending them retreating down the Libyan Coastal Highway towards Sirte.  Events  = Prior to the battle = Ajdabiya was the site of anti- government protests on 16‚Äì17 February 2011 in which up to 10 people were said to have been killed, some by pro-government snipers.Black, Ian. \\"Libya's day of rage met by bullets and loyalists\\".

The Daily Telegraph, 20 February 2011. = First phase = On 15 March 2011, government forces advancing from Brega (which they had captured just a few hours earlier) hit Ajdabiya with a rolling artillery barrage. Air and naval strikes also hit the city. The city had been subjected to airstrikes for the previous three days. Rebels had stated on 13 March, that they would defend the city to the death. However, as soon as the attack started, all of the rebel forces that were not local (from Ajdabiya) were in full retreat, with some of the civilian population, toward Benghazi. Following the artillery strikes, loyalist ground troops attacked. The rebels had expected the loyalists to come in from the west, and they did. However, another separate government force had outflanked the rebels and attacked the city from the south. The loyalists quickly overran the western rebel defences and took the western gate into the city. Also, government soldiers had taken the eastern gate of the city, preventing any more rebels from retreating toward Benghazi. The city was surrounded and the junction at Ajdabiya was under government control, opening the way for them to Benghazi. After the encirclement was complete, government battle tanks went into Ajdabiya all the way to the city center. They encountered the rebel remnants and street fighting ensued. While the fighting was going on in the streets, two old rebel air-attack fighters, sent from Benghazi, attacked the government naval ships that had been pounding the city from the sea. According to independent news sources, only one ship was hit, while the rebels claimed they hit three warships, of which two sank. After a few hours, most of the city was under government control, however, in order to avoid surprise attacks by hidden rebels during the night, the tanks retreated to the outskirts of the city. The rebels thought they had won. However, just before midnight, a new round of artillery fire hit Ajdabiya, coming from the loyalist forces that were all around the town. On 16 March, fighting continued with neither side having the upper hand in the battle or in full control of the town. Government forces returning from the front said in interviews that rebel resistance was fierce. During the day, a force of rebel reinforcements, coming from Benghazi, came to within a few kilometers from the eastern entrance to the city before they were engaged by loyalist troops. They made a small corridor to link up Benghazi with Ajdabiya, but pro-Gaddafi troops still had a strong presence on the eastern outskirts of the city. Also, rebels had managed to retake the southern entrance to the city, while the western entrance was still under government control. Three rebel helicopters had attacked pro-Gaddafi forces on the highway at the west entrance where they were preparing for a final push into the city with more weapons, ammunition and troop reinforcements coming in from Sirte. (in Arabic) Just after midnight on 17 March, government troops attacked the southern gate of the city. After three hours of fighting they had retaken it. Later during the morning loyalist forces closed the corridor on the eastern side of the city. With this, the city was once again firmly surrounded. While the fighting was going on in Ajdabiya, more government troops landed from the sea, in an amphibious attack, at the small oil port town of Zuwetina, that is to the north on the road between Ajdabiya and Benghazi. The town fell quickly to loyalist forces. However, rebel leaders claimed that they had surrounded the government landing force and were engaging them. The next day the rebels claimed, several of their fighters, along with a number of civilians, were killed and 20 government soldiers captured in fighting at the port. = Second phase = With a no-fly zone put in place on 19 March, and air-strikes on Gaddafi's force's supply and tank convoys, the rebels on 20 March, started an advance from Benghazi to attempt to reach Ajdabiya. Along the way, they retook the town of Zuwetina. On 21 March, advancing rebel forces from Benghazi attempted to attack Ajdabiya, trying to relieve the rebels inside the city and drive out the loyalist troops. However, their attack was repelled by government troops supported by fire from tanks and multiple rocket launchers. The rebels retreated to a checkpoint from the city. That night, U.S. aircraft fired on some loyalist positions at Ajdabiya, that were reported to be shelling the city. The next morning, rebels, along with a Guardian reporter that was with them, claimed that the plumes of smoke from the city were from government targets that were hit by the U.S. air-strikes the previous night. The rebels claimed that at least three loyalist tanks were destroyed at the eastern entrance to the city by Coalition air-strikes. An Al Jazeera news crew filmed the wreckage of one tank at a checkpoint that was established by the rebels as part of the frontline. On 23 March, coalition jets launched air-strikes against Gaddafi forces at the eastern gate. People fleeing the city stated that only the center of the city remained in rebel hands while the suburbs were under government control. Reporters from the Independent were led on a two-day tour of Ajdabiya by the government and saw no evidence of large-scale destruction that was claimed by the rebels. On 24 March, Gaddafi's forces were still holding the main east and west gate areas of the city and most of the town, except the city centre, and managing to hold off the advancing rebel troops from entering the city with the help of mortar and artillery fire. Late on 24 March, some outside rebel forces managed to get into Ajdabiya, and the situation in the city was becoming fluid, with large parts of the town changing sides. During the night, British fighter jets launched air-strikes on Gaddafi force's tanks and armored vehicles. By 25 March, the western and central part of the city were controlled by the loyalists while the eastern part was controlled by the rebels. Early in the morning, the opposition council relayed a message to Gaddafi's forces in the city through local tribal leaders. They called upon the loyalists to lay down their weapons and surrender. However, government troops refused the offer of surrender and the rebels were starting to mass on the edge of the city for an offensive to attack Ajdabiya. During the afternoon, four rebel multiple rocket launchers, that were brought to the frontline, started firing on loyalist positions. Government artillery responded to the attack. Just before evening, the rebel offensive on the Gaddafi controlled areas of the city was called off after forward rebel units were repelled by loyalist armored units at the gates of the town further continuing the stalemate. During the night, some rebel units were still managing to get into the city through the corridor established the previous evening and British aircraft destroyed seven loyalist tanks in and around the city.http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2011/03/2011326135528826662.html By this point, the city was divided between the loyalist-held western side and the rebel-held eastern side. On 26 March, rebel fighters in Ajdabiya claimed to be in control of the city, a claim confirmed by Al Jazeera reporters on the ground. Libya's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said government forces pulled out of Ajdabiya after another night of coalition strikes, Reuters reports. He accused Western forces of directly aiding the rebels.Libya forces pull out from Ajdabiyah -official Rebels then headed to Brega and managed to capture the city.

Aggenstein) Josef Naus (1793‚Äì1871) was an officer and surveying technician, known for leading the first ascent of Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze. Variations of his name are Karl Naus or Joseph Naus.  Life and career  Naus was born on 29 August 1793 in Lechaschau / Tyrol or, according to other sources, Reutte.Bosls bayerische Biographie by Karl Bosl. Accessed on 9 Apr 2011. He was the son of a judge and came from a family that had probably immigrated from Belgium or the Netherlands to Tyrol in the 17th century. As a young man Naus studied surveying. He joined the Bavarian Army in 1813 and did wartime service against Napoleon in 1814/15 he did wartime service against Napoleon, before joining the Royal Topographic Bureau. In 1820, together with a group of officers and men, Lieutenant Naus was given the task of producing the Werdenfels map for the Topographic Atlas of Bavaria. In the course of this work, on 27 August 1820, Naus made the first recorded ascent of the Zugspitze with his assistant, Maier, and mountain guide, Johann Georg Tauschl.Deutschlands h√∂chste Gipfel: 35 Touren von der K√ºste bis zu den Alpen by Herbert Farr. Accessed on 9 Apr 2011. In 1824 Naus became a lieutenant. In 1851 he was promoted to major general and sent to Ulm as commandant of the imperial fortress there. He retired in 1857, but was reactivated in 1866 and appointed as Quartermaster General and head of the Survey Office. He died on 6 September 1871 in Ulm.  Background  In September 2006 the German Alpine Club announced that the first ascent of the Zugspitze could have been made before the middle of the 18th century. The basis of this speculation was the rediscovery of an historic map from the 18th century that depicted the Zugspitze region. On this map routes were marked to the summit region, but not, however, to the actual summit. A chronology with relatively realistic information about the routes to the summit reinforced the surmise. But the map did not indicate whether the mountain was scaled by hunters or smugglers.Deutscher Alpenverein: Panorama ‚Äì Magazin des Deutschen Alpenvereins. 58. Jahrgang, Heft 5.

Development The Skyhopper design was started in 1944 by two North American Aviation engineers from Kansas City. They had previously partnered on the Commonwealth Skyranger and worked on the B-25 program. It was engineered to the then current Civil Aeronautics Administration CAR-04 standards criteria of the time. As a light aircraft under construction during wartime, permission needed to be granted for tools and materials by the CAA. Design The single-seat low-wing aircraft was intended to be open cockpit, but was redesigned to have a full canopy. The fuselage is welded steel tubing. The wings use spruce wood spars and ribs with fabric covering. The controls are actuated with push/pull tubes. The stabilizers are covered with mahogany plywood. The Skyhopper I is the plans built version of the prototype introduced in 1958. Operational history The prototype was test flown from Fairfax Airport in Kansas City in March 1945. In 1946, The effort to produce the aircraft as a production certified aircraft under the company name Aviation Boosters Inc. was dropped, but Gene Salvay retained the rights to the aircraft where it could be built as a homebuilt aircraft. Variants * Skyhopper I - original version of the skyhopper. Continental 50 hp engine. * Skyhopper II - designed in 1962 to sit two passengers side by side via a widening of the Skyhopper 10 fuselage design. It was built by Ralph Thenhaus of Van Nuys, California. * A two-seat tandem modification of the Skyhopper was built using a Continental O-200 engine. * Trefethen Sport-Aire II - A wider fuselage tricycle gear version based on Stark's Super Skyhopper jigs.

Bates, (also of Eyedea's rock band Carbon Carousel), bassist Casey O'Brien, and local rappers Kristoff Krane (also of Abzorber), Carnage, and Mazta I. The group started playing shows at local hip-hop oriented venues where much of the audience which showed up was expecting the music be similar to Eyedea's solo work and work as part of Eyedea & Abilities. However the Eyedea and Friends show's actually consisted entirely of extended freestyles with freely improvised instrumental backing this lend to disappointment and anger in many of the fans who in turn booed and threw objects at the group. After the first tour the group stopped performing for a while due partly to the negative reaction. However the project was revived with the new name Face Candy and found a better reaction to the music playing now that fans knew what to expect and through playing Jazz venues where the crowds were more receptive to the group's sound. During this time (2005) the album This Is Where We Were was recorded live while touring the Midwest. It was eventually released on November 21, 2006.

Its distinctive arrow-like shape derives from the way it includes condition-unique (0,n) or (n,0) points into the plot via an epsilon factor. Definition An RA plot, like its cousin, the MA plot, is a re-scaled and (45-degree) rotated version of a simple two- dimensional scatter plot of a versus b where a and b are equal-length vectors of positive measurements. This rescaling and rotation allows for better visibility and emphasis of important outliers points that vary between the two measurement conditions.Dudoit, S, Yang, YH, Callow, MJ, Speed, TP. (2002). Statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Stat. Sin. 12:1 111‚Äì139 Essentially it is a plot of the log ratio [R] vs the average log [A] of each pairing of the elements of a and b. Unlike an MA plot, however, because the RA plot takes non-negative integer counts as input, it must employ work-arounds to include mathematically invisible points (such as points where one or both element(s) of the pair is zero). If we modify our original a (or b) vector via: : a = begin{cases} a + varepsilon, & text{if }a = 0  a, & text{if }a > 0 end{cases} where : 0 < varepsilon < 0.5 then R and A can be defined as: : R=log_2 (a / b) : A=frac12 times (log_2 a + log_2 b) R, like M, is plotted on the y-axis and represents a log (fold change) ratio between a and b. A is plotted on the x-axis and represents the average abundance for a coordinate pair. The RA plot provides a quick overview of the distribution and size of a dataset consisting of non-zero counts. Etymology The acronym prefix \\"R.A.\\" is sometimes pronounced as the one syllable word \\"ray\\" because of the plot's strong resemblance to a geometric ray. This characteristic arrow-like shape derives from two key features: on the right at the vector origin, a long asymptotic tail, and on the left (forming the arrow head) two (often dense) patches of condition-unique points. Work-arounds for point visibility and inclusion =Condition unique points= Because a large portion of the pairs of a and b contain zeros in one or both conditions, they are impossible to plot as-is on a log scale. Other MA plotting functions artificially include these condition-unique points in the plot by spreading them vertically as a \\"smear\\" on the left or horizontally as a \\"rug\\" at the very top and bottom of the plot. In an RA plot, by contrast, the uniques are included via addition a small epsilon factor (between .1 and .5) which places them in a more statistically appropriate location in the plot. =Overplotting= Another problem with plotting this (or any) type of count data is overplotting which is solved in the RA plot by jittering the points out away from each other but no so far as to merge with other coordinates. The result of this feature is a patchwork-like appearance to the plot that fades away as the A increases.  Packages  The caroline CRAN R package contains the only known implementation of an RA plot. However, the meta-transcriptomics \\"manta\\" R package provides a wrapper around this RA plot implementation and is used for assessing fold change in transcription of genes (the points) while simultaneously visualizing each gene's taxonomic distributions as individual pie chart points.Schruth, D. & Marchetti, A.

Innovators and pioneers in the bogolan fine arts movement, the Groupe traveled throughout Mali, researching the bogolan traditions and practices, including the symbolic alphabet, as well as the traditional structure, uses, and colors encoded in bogolan cloths. This enabled them to understand the significance and teachings of the cloths which were in danger of being lost. They abandoned modern painting methods and have worked with traditional Mali art materials such as vegetal pigments found in clay and plant dyes, using them on locally grown, hand-woven cotton cloth. Etymology In the Bamana language, Kasoban√© means \\"prison is finished, we are free\\" which signifies the Groupe's avoidance of materials that are not their own and the use of materials that are naturally occurring in Mali instead. History The members of the Groupe met as students at the Institut National des Arts Institute National des Arts (L'INA) in Bamako in the mid-1970s. At that time, bogolan was rarely seen in urban areas and was fabricated only by rural women. The study of bogolan was also strictly forbidden at the art academy. The Groupe includes Kandioura Coulibaly, Kl√®tigui Demb√©l√©, Boubacar Doumbia, Souleymane Goro, Baba Fallo Keita, and N√©n√© Thiam. Coulibaly rallied five other like-minded artists who fought to employ it in their paintings as a way to reference their Malian heritage. The members of Groupe Bogolan Kasobane subsequently conducted in-depth research throughout Mali, living in villages for months and becoming integrated into the communities. From village practitioners, they learned the vocabulary of symbolic ideograms as well as the meanings of the traditional colors and patterns encoded in bogolan. Their first exhibition occurred in 1978 in S√©gou, Mali and was followed by another the following year in Bordeaux, France. Since the mid-1970s, the Groupe has used bogolan to adorn boubous, and have created bogolan ensembles for members of social groups. In 1983, Groupe Bogolan Kasoban√© was awarded the Laureat du Concours de Peinture first prize at the Salon BIAO, Goethe Institut, Yaound√©. Their first American exhibition was at the Walter Reade Theatre Gallery at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City in 1998. In 2009, its members were artists in residence at the Residential College in Arts & Humanities at Michigan State University. Works Groupe Bogolan Kasoban√© has interests in cultural preservation and historical research. The group formed specifically to revitalize the bogolanfini textile-dying technique, working the traditional cotton cloth created from handspun and handwoven bands. Along with the collective Atelier Jamana, Groupe Bogolan Kasoban√© is the most successful and best-known producer of bogolan fine art clothing. The Groupe has also contributed costumes and sets for films including Guimba the Tyrant, which received first prize for costumes and set at the 1995 FESPACO, and Taafe Fanga, which received the prize for art in Japan. Their massive composition, A Tribute to the Anonymous Artists is a tribute to fundamentally anonymous artists.

Their heads with the title of Beyg, Beyk or Beg (lit.\\"lord\\") were the Aghas of Senneh (\\"Masters of Sanandaj\\") and ruled their fiefdom during the time of four hundred years when the Safavids (r. 1501-1722), Afsharids (r. 1736‚Äì1796) and finally Qajar dynasty (r. 1785‚Äì1925) reigned in Iran.Zarrinkafsch: \\"Transition of Tribal Nobility to Urban Elite\\", in: Qajar Studies, Vol. VIII, 2008, p. 97 ff.; see also: The Zarrinkafsch (Bahman-Qajar) Webpage http://www.zarrinkafsch- bahman.org Origin and meaning of the name About the origin of the name \\"Zarrinnaal\\" various stories are told: One says the family's ancestor rode in a battle against a foreign power a horse with golden horseshoes (Persian Zarrin Naal) and therefore was named after.Oral tradition by Ahmad Khan Zarrinnaal. Another says that this ancestor was sent as Persia's envoy to the Mughal Empire for border negotiations with the Indians. To show his wealth on this special ceremonial occasion and to convince his partners to agree, he once put golden horseshoes on his horse. When he took a ride the animal lost its horseshoes, people picked them up and so forth nicknamed him Zarrinnaal.Oral tradition by Kazem Khan Zarrinnaal. This also reports M. Lesan ol-Molk in his historical chronicle.Lesan ol-Molk: Nasekh at-Tawarikh, Vol. 3, p. 439. In fact there was a certain Mohammad Ali Beyg sent as ambassador to the Mughal court by Shah Abbas! A third story tells us that this ancestor wanted to marry a shah's daughter but the king denied to give him his daughter's hand. Thus, he rode on a horse with golden horseshoes to impress the king and finally could pick up his bride.Oral tradition by Sakineh Zarrinnaal and Manijeh Vali. However, after this man his entire clan was called in the very same way and his descendants were entitled \\"Zarrinnaal\\" in honour to that forefather. In fact the term naal or to be more precise na'al (ŸÜÿπŸÑ) means in modern Persian of today \\"horseshoe\\", but also is Nominative Singular of the Arab word na'eleyn meaning \\"shoes, slippers\\",Junker/Alavi: Farhang-e Farsi Almani, 2002, p. 808. and was the common term for slippers. So, like Zarrinkafsh the term Zarrinnaal means \\"Golden Shoe\\" as well, but in a more elaborated Arabized way often used in former times and especially among the Kurds. Tribal heads and their history When the Persian shahs conquered their empire and established their supremacy over the western Kurdish principalities the Zarrinnaal family began to reach local prominence in Kurdistan. Its members were installed in military and administrative posts and aided the Ardalan rulers (r. 1187 to 1867) in governing their province.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari- ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 1‚Äì11. =Mohammad Ali Beyg Zarrinnaal= Mohammad 'Ali Beyg, Ambassador to the Mughal court. Mohammad Ali Beyg called Zarrinnaal (lit. \\"Golden Horseshoe\\"), whose family belonged to the clan of Zarrin Kafsh, had been settled in Kurdistan minimum since the year 1448 A.D. and possessed the area of Sanandaj as their hereditary fief, was ordered by Shah Abbas I the Great to make war on the Ottomans; and on August 24, 1605 with the aid of his troops from the Mokri tribes could reconquer the Turkish occupied Kurdistan Province for Persia. After that he was made vicegerent (Persian vali) of that area and reigned probably from 1609 to 1615 as governor and was head of the administration and army, chief judge and legislator. There, he himself and his entire tribal confederacy (Persian il) were known and henceforth called by the name of \\"Zarrinnaal\\".Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 11. In 1631 Mohammad ‚ÄòAli Beyg was the ambassador sent to the Mughal court by Shah Abbas of Iran, arriving in time for the New Year festival in March 1631. Iran and Mughal India went in negotiations about the province of Kandahar, once part of the Mughal empire, then given by Humayoun to Shah Tahmasp and annexed by Humayoun's successor Akbar. In 1622 Shah Abbas had reconquered Kandahar as his rightly possession and a treaty with Jahangir should secure this status quo. Mohammad Ali Beyg remained in the Mughal empire until October 1632, during which time his portrait was painted by the royal artist, Hashim. The painting is inscribed in Persian ‚ÄòLikeness of Mohammad ‚ÄòAli Beyg, ambassador, the work of Hashim‚Äô. =Mohammad Zaman Beyg= Mohammad Ali Beyg's son Mohammad Zaman Beyg was a merchant and traveller.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 10. After Shah Abbas I's death in 1629 the Ottoman vizier Khusrew Pasha attacked the Kurdistan Province in 1634 and destroyed its capital city of Hassanabad. But next to it Sehna or Senneh, the modern city of Sanandaj was built as new residence and capital for the Ardalan emirs by Vali Soleyman Khan Ardalan (r. 1636 to 1657). Thus, the entire Kurdish tribal elite moved to the new capital of Sanandaj, which became a prosperous city. Thereby the name of Sanandaj comes from the Kurdish terms Sena meaning \\"soltan\\" or \\"ruler\\" and Daj (or Dezh) meaning \\"fortress\\", and thus means \\"The Ruler's Fortress\\", which refers to the Vali's stony fort on top of the city peak Teppeh-ye Painshahr (Teppeh-ye Tous- Nowzar).Ayazi: A'iney'-ye Sanandaj, 1981, p. 31; Ardalan: Les Kurdes d'Ardalan, 2004, p. 40, fn. 112; see also: Zarrin Kafsh. In 1638 the common modern Turkish-Persian border was established at the foot of the Zagros Mountains between Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau. =Mahmoud Beyg Soltan= Mohammad Zaman Beyg's son Mahmoud Beyg Soltan was army captain and provincial sub-governor (soltan).Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 9. In Safavid time the military aristocracy of the emirs was divided in the three ranks of khan (i.e. \\"magnate\\", title of military commander), beyg (i.e. \\"lord\\", title of tribal chief) and soltan (i.e. \\"ruler\\", title of provincial sub-governor). =Mohammad Beyg= Mahmoud Beyg Soltan's son Mohammad Beyg was vicegerent (vali) of the Afghans (i.e. Pashtuns) after he was deputy governor (nayeb-e vali) in today's Afghanistan.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 8. The province of Afghan with its capital of Kandahar belonged to the Safavid Empire until 1709. =Hajji Eskandar Beyg-e Afghan= Mohammad Beyg's son Hajji Eskandar Beyg-e Afghan was a leader of the Afghans (Persian beyg-e afghan) and after his arrival in the Kurdistan Province from a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca he settled there again at Sanandaj.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 7. In 1709 Ghilzai-Afghan rebels under their chief Mirwais Khan Hotak rose against the Persians, killed the Safavid governor of Kandahar, the Georgin Gurgin Khan (King George XI of Kartli), they declared their independence and finally caused the downfall of the Safavids when they seized and at last sacked the Safavid capital city of Isfahan in 1722. =Abbas Beyg Vazir= Hajji Eskandar Beyg's son Abbas Beyg was vizier of Persia (vazir-e Iran), had issued 18 children and was the head of his tribe (Persian ra'is-e il).Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari- ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 6. He served under Nader Shah Afshar (r. 1736‚Äì1747), who reinstated the Persian monarchy but was a brutal tyrant too, and was murdered by his own emirs in 1747. The Afshar and Qajar emirs allied with one of the shah's envoy and minister, Hossein Ali Beyg Bastami, while on a campaign entered the ruler's tent and cut off his head and also killed his two other ministers, Bader Khan and Abbas Beyg Vazir. =Oghli Beyg I.= Abbas Beyg's son Oghli Beyg I. was landlord (Persian mallak) of a big estate in the Kurdistan Province under the Valis of Ardalan.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 5. =Ali Beyg Monshi-bashi= Oghli Beyg's son Ali Beyg Monshi-bashi was in the year 1799 chancellor and chief secretary (Persian monshi-bashi) of Vali Amanollah Khan Ardalan I (r. 1797‚Äì1825), one of the most powerful and popular rulers of KordestƒÅn.Zarrinnaal: Surat-e asƒÅmi-ye aƒüƒÅd-e pedari-ye Zarrinna‚Äòal, 1967, no. 4.

His two sons struggled for power over their father's domains, fought against each other and a civil war broke out until Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar deposed Reza Qoli Khan and terminated the Ardalan rule after Amanollah Khan's II. death. Like most of all Kurds Oghli Beyg II. was a Sunni Muslim but for political reasons converted to the Shiite faith of Islam, the main religion in the Persian Empire. Oghli Beyg wanted to join his own family with the new established Qajar dynasty by marriage, and asked for the hand of Princess Noor-Jahan Khanom, the 9th daughter of Crown Prince Abbas Mirza Nayeb as-Saltaneh.Buyers: \\"The Qajar Dynasty\\", 2001, p. 8/qajar5.

Mirza Zaman Khan was born in Sanandaj by Noor Jahan Khanom at the Khosrau-Abad residential palace in 1842 and died at Tehran 1906. Himself from a family of Ardalan court grandees, responsible for army supplies, he got an extensive education in Arabic, literature, calligraphy and arithmetic. On July 1, 1859 young Master Zaman joined the Shah's camp when Nasser al-Din Shah visited with his entourage the Kurdistan Province on a royal tour and stayed in its capital town of Sanandaj for three days. He entered the royal tent, paid obedience to the Shah and offered his service. Because the Vali of Kurdistan was not able to satisfied the wishes of the Shah's retinue and several of them were getting angry, the court departed from Kurdestan taking young Zaman with it. Via Tabriz and Maragheh he then moved to Tehran and reached the capital on October 19, 1859.Busse: History of Persia under Qajar Rule, 1972, p. 341; Mostofi: Administration and Social History, 1995, I, p. 60. In 1867 Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar finally terminated the Ardalan rule in Kurdistan by deposing the last Vali and removing him with his own uncle Prince Farhad Mirza Mo'tamad ad-Dowleh as governor of the Kurdistan Province. Zaman settled then permanently in Tehran, moving from the Ark district to that of Oudlajan in the city's north-eastern part where the nobility had its residences and founded in 1868 a family. Some samples of his handwriting convinced his superiors at court to give him an employment at the imperial court offices and so he became a bureaucrat in the governmental administration. His career started there as a clerk (Persian Mirza) and he was in charge of fiscal duties of the government, administration and military, responsible for the Kurdistan Province in special. In 1872 with the improvements of Prime Minister Mirza Hossein Khan Moshir ad-Dowleh Mirza Zaman worked for the Ministry of War, and finally got the post of lashkar- nevis (lit. \\"army scribe\\", i.e. muster-master), who was chief paymaster of the troops and head of military administration. Until 1904 he worked in this office which became the hereditary post in his family for three generations and documented all costs and vouchers of payment of the entire soldiery of 200,000 men of that time. Mirza Zaman was honorary called Agha (lit. \\"Sir\\") by Nasser al-Din Shah and the former tribal title of Beyg, used in the family‚Äôs past, changed in that of a superior Khan (\\"magnate\\"), according to common Persian customs of calling landowners of old provenance with this not only hereditary but also adoptive sobriquet.Migeod: Die persische Gesellschaft unter Nasirud Din Schah, 1990, p. 54. He then also became vizier of Kurdistan and finally governor of that Persian province.Barjesteh: \\"The Afshartous (Qajar-Quvanlu) Family\\", 2010, p. 215. Furthermore, Agha Mirza Zaman Khan became military adviser to the Shah, and wrote books about military history and astronomy, also. Pari Soltan Khanom Pir-Bastami in 1871, photograph taken by her cousin Ali Khan Vali In 1867 Agha Mirza Zaman Khan Kordestani married Pari Soltan Khanom Pir-Bastami Zarrin Khanom (\\"Golden Lady\\"), daughter of Mohammad Hossein Khan Bastami (Moayyeri) Mir Panj and by Effat ad-Dowleh Khanom Qajar, and hence granddaughter in paternal line of Doust Ali Khan Moayyer al-Mamalek and in maternal line related to the Qajar dynasty. They had three children: *Agha Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Zarrinnaal Lashkar-nevis Nasr-e Lashkar, the father of the future Zarrinnaal family *Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Zarrinkafsh, the father of the future Zarrinkafsh family *Banou Fatemeh Soltan Khanom Afshartous, the mother of the Afshartous family and General Mahmoud Afshartous in particular =Agha Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Nasr-e Lashkar (1868‚Äì1930)= Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Zarrinnaal Nasr-e Lashkar, 1910 Agha Mirza Zaman Khan Kordestani's eldest was Agha Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Zarrinnaal, entitled for his merits in military sector with the aristocratic title Nasr-e Lashkar (lit. \\"Defender of the Army\\") by the Shah. He was born in 1868 at Tehran and died there 1930 on his estates at Doshan- Teppeh in eastern Tehran. He got a private education in writing, arithmetic and reading and in fencing, poetry, hunting, horsing and calligraphy and then he started military service. At the Tehran military academy (madresseh-ye nezam-e dowlati) he studied weapons technology and martial law. After his studies he entered service at court and became, like his father, military adviser to Nasser al-Din Shah and was also honorarily called Agha. Firstly he became lashkar-nevis and chief secretary of the army 1904 to 1906. Until the end of the Qajar rule 1925 he held several posts as head of the military administration, especially in the Army Law Court Department (majles-e mohakemat-e vezarat-e askari) of the Ministry of War (vezarat-e jang). Under Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1896‚Äì1906) and Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1906‚Äì1909) he was military instructor to the Persian troops 1906 to 1909 and after that host inspector with the military rank of a nazem 1909 to 1915. As well, at the time of Mohammad Ali Shah he became conservative member of parliament (majles). With the nickname \\"Kordi\\" he was a delegate for Kurdistan and one leader of the royalist conservative wing (etedahiyun), supporting Mohammad Ali Shah's efforts to return to absolutism, because both men feared that the British dominated parliament could strengthen more English influence in Persia during the Great Game. In the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar (r. 1909‚Äì1925) he was senior public prosecutor at martial court (moddai ol-omum koll-e nezam), which was instituted 1915 by Prince Abdol-Hossein Mirza Farmanfarma as minister of justice and war 1915 to 1925.Floor: \\"Change and Development in the Judicial System of Qajar Iran\\", 1992, p. 144, fn. 67. For his loyal service to the Qajars he got parts of Nasser al-Din Shah's imperial hunting area east of Tehran, called Doshan-Teppeh. This sandy area became the base for the family, when it was cultivated in the days of Reza Shah Pahlavi by Nasr-e Lashkar's sons and villas and summer residences of Tehran's court elite were built there, naming it \\"Zarrinnaal-District\\" (mahalleh-ye zarrinnaal). It was situated next to Meydan-e Baharestan (Baharestan-Square) with the Parliament Building (called Baharestan lit. \\"Place of Springtime\\") directly behind the old Shemiran-Gate, at a quarter between the Khiyaban-e Baharestan and Khiyaban-e Mazanderan, Khiyaban-e Vahid Dastgerdi and Khiyaban-e Jaleh (today Khiyaban-e Mojaheddin-e Eslam). The two main streets were the Khiyaban-e Zarrinnaal (\\"Avenue Zarrinnaal\\" today Khiyaban-e Shahid Homayoun Nateqi) and Khiyaban-e Khorshid (\\"Avenue Khorshid\\" today Khiyaban-e Shahid Meshki).See: Tehran.

When he boasted of his faithfulness to her, she reprimanded him in letters by saying his boasting of such matters did not do him any credit. She furthermore let him know that she had diligently mourned his mother for three years and arranged the funeral, which she implied were much more difficult tasks than remaining faithful. She also commented that spending some months without sexual relations would have been good for him, seeing as he was getting older and needed to preserve his energy. He took her admonishment without rancor and they continued to correspond with each other in verse. On her way to visit her husband in exile in Jongseong, Song Deokbong composed a much-praised poem whilst passing through an area called Macheonryeong. She was seen as a virtuous woman writer.

She was a younger sister of Euphemia \\"Effie\\" Gray, who married Millais in 1855 after the annulment of her marriage to John Ruskin. Note that the spelling of her name was, after around 1861, sometimes \\"Sophy,\\" but only within the family. In public she was known as Sophie and later in life, after her marriage, as Sophia. From the late 1860s she suffered from a mental illness which seems to have involved a form of anorexia nervosa. In 1873 she married the Scottish entrepreneur James Caird and together they had a daughter. She died in 1882, probably as a result of her anorexia. Background Sophie Gray was born in October 1843 to Sophia Margaret Gray, n√©e Jameson (1808‚Äì1894), and George Gray (1798‚Äì1877), a Scottish lawyer and businessman. Her maternal grandfather, Andrew Jameson, became Sheriff-substitute of Fife.Mervyn Williams (2012) Effie Effie Gray (1828‚Äì1897), known initially to the family as \\"Phemy,\\" was the first of fifteen children, and Sophie was the tenth‚Äîthree sisters, one also named Sophia Margaret, predeceased her. Two of her five elder brothers died before her birth and two passed away before she was seven.See family tree in Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais at pp 240‚Äì1 The family lived at Bowerswell, a house re- built in 1842 near the foot of Kinnoull Hill, south-east of Perth. As a child, Gray frequently visited and stayed with her sister Effie in London with her husband, the critic and artist John Ruskin. To an extent Effie, who was fifteen years older than Sophie, acted as a kind of second mother to her and Effie's other siblings. From a young age Gray was exposed to the increasingly strained circumstances of the Ruskins' unconsummated marriage.Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais, chapter 12 In fact, through her increasing presence in the Ruskin household, Gray may, in some respects, have been a convenient chaperone for her elder sister, whose largely independent social life tended to attract comment.Robert Brownell (2013) Marriage of Inconvenience According to Effie, Ruskin's manservant, Frederick Crawley, expressed to Gray his concern that other servants might spread gossip \\"all over Camberwell.\\" Gray's governess of three years, a French woman named Delphine, appears to have been discharged by the Grays in March 1854 because of Gray's habit of confiding in her. Effie Gray's flight from Ruskin and marriage to Millais On 25 April 1854 Effie left her husband on the pretence of visiting her parents in Scotland. Gray had been staying with the Ruskins, at their home in Herne Hill since just after Christmas 1853 and appears to have been complicit in her sister's flight. She and Effie were seen off in silence by Ruskin at the recently opened King's Cross station, where, accompanied by Crawley,Ibid. they boarded a train for Edinburgh. However, Gray alighted at Hitchin, Hertfordshire where her parents were waiting. Her mother took her place on the train, while she and her father returned to London to deliver a package from Effie to her solicitors. That evening a citation of nullity was delivered to Ruskin, together with certain effects such as Effie's wedding ring and her keys.Phyllis Rose (1983) Parallel Lives, \\"Effie Gray & John Ruskin\\". The following day Gray and her father returned to Scotland by steamer. Effie was granted a decree of nullity on 20 July 1854. The previous summer, she, Ruskin, and his prot√©g√© John Millais had spent four months together in the Scottish Highlands, during which time she and Millais formed a close and increasingly intimate bond.Franny Moyle (2009) Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites. In early 1854, Millais painted a portrait of Gray for her parents. Through her regular visits to his studio in Gower Street, London, where she impressed Millais by her patience, Gray was able to act a go-between with Effie. During this period, Ruskin's mother (to whom her son was close) appears to have indulged Gray, while, at the same time, casting aspersions on Effie, who was under considerable stress. For his part, Ruskin sometimes accompanied Gray on walks, in the course of which he too spoke slightingly of his wife, possibly seeking to turn Gray against her. Effie's surviving letters to her parents suggest that Gray kept her well informed of such adverse criticism. After the annulment of her marriage, Effie avoided Millais for some time, although he remained in contact with the girls' mother. Effie and Gray, whose governess was not replaced, spent much of the summer at St Andrews, on the coast of Fife, with their younger sister, Alice Elizabeth Gray (1845‚Äì1929). They went for walks together and Effie, who had been well educated herself, acted as the others' teacher. The following year, Millais came up to Bowerswell, where they were married in June 1855. Gray as model Autumn Leaves. Alice Gray is on the far left. For the next few years Gray continued to sit for Millais. After he and Effie moved to Annat Lodge, close to Bowerswell, she was readily available for this purpose, but while it seems she was beginning to displace Effie herself as a favored subject, it is unsurprising that Effie wanted to keep herself out of the public eye to a degree, following the very public dissolution of her marriage. In the words of art historian Suzanne Fagence Cooper, whose biographical chapter about Gray (2010) provides the fullest account of her life, Gray \\"changes before our eyes from a child to a stunning teenager.\\" This change can be traced in three works by Millais: Autumn Leaves (1855‚Äì56), Spring (or Apple Blossoms) (1856‚Äì1859) and, most strikingly, in a small, but \\"unnerving\\" portrait of her at the age of 13, entitled Portrait of a Young Lady, or simply Sophie Gray (1857).Tate Britain, Millais, 2007, pp.134-135 Charles Edward Perugini also painted a portrait of Gray as a young woman; the date is not known with certainty and for some years it was attributed mistakenly to Millais.http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5089471 Millais's Spring (Apple Blossoms), with Gray on the far left. =Autumn Leaves and Spring= In Autumn Leaves, Gray is one of four girls beside a smoking bonfire of leaves. Her sister Alice is also in this picture, together with two local girls at the right procured by Effie. Of the four, only Gray appears to be verging on womanhood.Barringer, Rosenfeld & Smith (Tate, 2012) Pre- Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde, pp. 160-161 In the later Spring, eight girls (whose ages ranged from 12 to 15) recline in an orchard. Gray is depicted in profile, wearing a colourful, striped robe, with long flowing hair, while Alice lies a somewhat provocatively with a blade of grass in her mouth. =Sophie Gray and Gray‚Äôs relationship with Millais= Sophie Gray is a sensual, knowing, and direct image, which, almost inevitably, has provoked questions about the nature of Millais's relationship with his sister-in-law. There was undoubtedly a strong affection between them, which may well have grown into mutual infatuation. According to Mary Lutyens, who researched the lives of Effie, Ruskin and Millais, it was rumoured that Effie had to send Gray away because of concerns that she and Millais were growing too close, however there is no clear evidence of a more intimate relationship between them. Gray's parents were content for Millais to chaperone her ‚Äì for example, on an overnight train to London ‚Äì and, whatever the truth of any rumour, Effie remained close to her sister and often invited her to stay after she and Millais moved back to London in 1861. When Gray later became ill, Effie visited her frequently. Unlike Millais's 1854 portrait of Gray, his later work was not kept by the family. It was sold to George Price Boyce, a friend of Millais's Pre-Raphaelite brother, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who painted a portrait of Fanny Cornforth, a lover he shared with Boyce,J.B. Bullen in Oxford Today, Michaelmas Term 2011, vol 24, no 1 to hang alongside that of Gray. Entitled Bocca Baciata (\\"the mouth that has been kissed\\") after a theme in Boccacio's Decameron, Rossetti's picture (1859) was described by William Holman Hunt, another member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, as \\"remarkable for gross sensuality of a revolting kind ... I see Rossetti as advocating as a principle the mere gratification of the eye.\\"Letter to Thomas Combe, 12 February 1860, quoted in As Cooper has remarked, this \\"after-life\\" of Sophie Gray demonstrated its \\"erotic potential.\\" The two pictures, by Millais and Rossetti, hung side-by-side in the exhibition \\"Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde\\" when the exhibition was on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., demonstrating two strands of Pre-Raphaelite conceptions of female beauty in, respectively, the forms of realism and Aestheticism.

It is clear from letters at the time that she was suffering from anorexia nervosa. She also became restless and obsessed with music, especially piano playing. Her speech was often incoherent. In March 1869 Millais wrote to William Holman Hunt that Gray had \\"been ill a whole year, and away from home, with hysteria.\\" At the request of the Grays, Millais placed Gray at Manor Farm House, Chiswick under the care of Dr Thomas Harrington Tuke (1826‚Äì88), a leading practitioner in mental illness.Br Med J 1888 June 23; 1(1434):1364 Tuke had treated Millais's friend, the painter Edwin Landseer, and, a year or so after Gray came to him, was involved in the case of Harriet Mordaunt, respondent in a scandalous divorce action.Elizabeth Hamilton (1999) The Warwickshire Scandal Gray lived with the family of one of Tuke's colleagues until she was well enough to move to lodgings in Hammersmith in 1869 and then back to Bowerswell in Perth. Although the state of her health fluctuated, it was to remain a problem for her and a concern to others for the rest of her life. =Marriage to James Caird= On 16 July 1873 Gray married James Key Caird (1837‚Äì1916), a Dundee jute manufacturerThe James Caird Society who had courted her for several years. Caird was disliked by her family, who thought him two-faced and who were still mindful of Effie's disastrous marriage to Ruskin. They would have been aware also that the port of Dundee had, for some time, been taking trade away from Perth. However, attempts to dissuade Gray from going ahead with the wedding were muted by fears of triggering a further collapse of her health. The Cairds' only child, Beatrix Ada, was born in 1874. The father was notably absent during Gray's confinement, thereby intensifying bad feeling with her family. In 1875, he forbade Gray from staying with Effie on her way to France and, generally, at a time when his business was expanding, he seems to have been both inconsiderate and uncaring towards her. Final years Millais's 1880 portrait of Gray, oil on canvas, 50 x 32 in., Geoffroy Richard Everett Millais Collection During her final years, Gray spent much of her time alone with Beatrix, mostly living between Dundee and Paris. In 1880 Millais painted a final portrait of her, which was exhibited at the new Grosvenor Gallery. Mary Lutyens wrote of it that Millais \\"perhaps more than anyone, knew the secrets of Sophie's short life, and in her hauntingly sad expression portrayed an old sadness of his own.\\"Kendall Smaling Wood, Christies catalogue, Victorian and Traditionalist Pictures, 2008. The portrait hung in Effie and John Everett Millais's house at Palace Gate, London, and remains in the family. By the 1880s Gray had become increasingly emaciated (the effects largely hidden from others by the weight of late Victorian clothing), and in 1882 returned to the care of Tuke. She died on 15 March 1882, aged 38. Tuke gave the cause of death as exhaustion and \\"atrophy of nervous system, 17 years.\\" Rumors that Gray committed suicide have never been substantiated. Millais painted a lovely portrait of Gray's daughter, Beatrix Caird, in 1879,It last sold at Sotheby's London, on June 9, 1994 (¬£90,000) and is in a private collection. It was exhibited in the \\"Millais: Portraits\\" show at London's National Portrait Gallery in 1999 (catalogue 37). http://preraphaelitepaintings.blogspot.com/2009/03/john-everett-millais- portrait-of.html but she died in 1888 at age 13. James Caird subsequently used his wealth to support Ernest Shackleton's Trans-Antarctic expedition of 1914‚Äì1917, and was a significant benefactor to the city of Dundee. He became a baronet in 1913.

The show was held in honor of Bruiser Brody who had been stabbed to death by Invader I backstage at a WWC show in Bayam√≥n on July 16, 1988. It was the second memorial event held for Brody in Puerto Rico since the IWA Puerto Rico's Bruiser Brody Memorial Show in 2000, and the first time a Brody memorial show was held by the WWC. The first Bruiser Brody Memorial Cup consisted of a three-day tour from July 15 to July 17, 2005 with shows at the Lenin Lopez Coliseum in Guayanilla, the Juan Ram√≥n Loubriel Stadium in Bayam√≥n, and the Wilfredo Toro Coliseum in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico. Nine professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card for first two nights and seven on the final night. The main attraction was a two-ring, thirty-man \\"Bunkhouse Stampede\\" battle royal dedicated to Brody which was won by Sabu. Other featured matches included The Sandman defeating Sabu in a \\"hardcore\\" match and Full Impact Pro's The Market Crashers (Dow Jones and NASDAQ) beating Black Thunder and Chris Joel. Chris Joel defended the WWC Puerto Rican Championship against Eric Alexander, WWC World Tag Team Champions Joe Bravo and Vengador Boricua defeated The Market Crashers (Dow Jones and NASDAQ), and Eddie Col√≥n won the WWC Universal Championship from Diamante in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. The Bruiser Brody Memorial Cup tour returned for a second year being held from June 23 to June 24, 2006, at the Frankie Colon Sports Complex Arena in Ponce and at the Pep√≠n Cestero Arena in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on both nights of the event's card, with five including championships. The main event for the first show was a tag team match which saw Eddie Col√≥n and Shane defeating Black Pain and Orlando Jordan via disqualification. The second night's main event was the \\"Bruiser Brody Cup\\" battle royal which was won by Abbad after eliminating Abdullah the Butcher; Abbad had lost to Abdullah the Butcher in a Bloodfest match on the undercard. Other featured matches included WWC Junior Heavyweight Champion Brent Dail defeating Superstar Romeo, Black Rose defeated Lady Demonique for the WWC Women's Championship (with Stacey Col√≥n as the special guest referee), Hurac√°n Castillo and Chicky Starr defeating WWC World Tag Team Champions Tim Arson and Rico Suave by disqualification, and Alex Montalvo beating WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Champion El Bronco to win the title. A match for the then vacant WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship between Eddie Col√≥n defeated Orlando Jordan, and refereed by Carlos Col√≥n, ended in a no-contest when Col√≥n was awarded the match by disqualification. Although this marked the last Brody memorial tour, the promotion held one last \\"Bruiser Brody Cup\\" battle royal at the WWC 34th Anniversary Show in 2007 in which Fidel Sierra and Ricky Santana were declared the co-winners. While these shows were not widely promoted outside Puerto Rico, the promotion received some criticism from the internet wrestling community. Brody biographer Emerson Murray, who interviewed WWC owner Carlos Col√≥n while doing research for \\"Bruiser Brody\\" (2007), claimed that Col√≥n \\"was tight-lipped but friendly\\" and, although having \\"nothing but good things to say about Brody\\", avoided talking about Brody's murder while promoting the then upcoming memorial show. The New Zealand Pro Wrestling Informer (NZPWI) website referred to the WWC as \\"the bastion of no-taste promoting\\" for holding one of the shows in the same stadium where Brody was killed as well as featuring Invader I on the card. In his review of the event, however, Armando Rodriguez of 411mania.com wrote that \\"the weeks surrounding the Bruiser Brody Memorial Cup where really exciting and full of good matches\\" and that the July 16th show of the 2005 Bruiser Brody Memorial Tour was \\"one of the best shows of the year\\". A few U.S. wrestlers, such as The Sheik and The Market Crashers (Dow Jones and NASDAQ), have considered their participation in the shows one of the highlights in their career.

The village is situated just east of Minnesund, near the border with Hedmark. The name of the hamlet resulted from the operation of gold mines here from 1758 and until 1907 with several interruptions in between. Dating from 1721, copper mines had operated in Eidsvoll. About 1749, Ole Wiborg found a small gold nugget in the copper mine. By 1759, the Brustad Mines Ltd were in operation and a smelter was constructed. However, the ore consisted more of copper than gold. In 1792, Bernt Anker became sole owner and managed the operation until his death in 1805. Lyssj√∏ Copper Mining remained in operation until 1807. In 1897, an English-based company, Golden Mint Mines Ltd., resumed operations. The Brustad Mine was reopened employing up to 120 workers. A smaller mine, Santander Mine, west of administration facility was also opened. The ore was processed by a large crusher at Gullverket. Homes were constructed for managers and workers. But the operation was far from profitable. The best year of 1902 only 50 kg gold were recovered, which did not cover expenses. By 1907 the operation was bankrupt. Today, local shops, schools and virtually all workplaces are closed. The buildings are a mix of small farms, newer houses and vacation properties in a hilly, forested landscape.

The road, however, runs northwest to southeast and the bridge crosses perpendicular to the creek causing a sharp turn in the road on the east side of the bridge, and a more gradual bend on the west side. As designed by John Lewis the bridge was wide and long including the approaches. Five arches cross the creek with the center arch long, and the arches next to it long. The outside arches are long. Supporting the eastern approach is a sixth arch, long, which is about east of the creek. The bridge is constructed of cut stones, but they are only laid in regular courses on the spandrels and on the top of the parapet. The bridge was widened in 1928 by removing all the stone facing on the north side of the bridge, extending the arches north with concrete rather than stone, and resetting the facing. This expansion added a third lane of traffic and a sidewalk on the north side. Rounded columns supporting pedestrian viewing bays were added on the north side of the piers. Shorter angular columns were added on the south side of the bridge.HAER History The area on the \\"Pahkehoma\\" Creek was purchased by William Penn from the Lenni Lenape tribe in 1684 and eventually sold to Thomas Ruyard of London. In 1699 Edward Lane bought the land from Ruyard, and the purchase was confirmed by Penn in 1701. About 1706 the first section of the Perkiomen Bridge Hotel was built on the west bank of the creek, just to the north of the current bridge site, then known as Phillips Ford. In 1728 the Lenni Lenape released their claim on land in the area for \\"two guns, six coats, six blankets, six duffel match coats, and four kettles,\\" in effect selling the land again.Borough of Collegeville - A Brief History , accessed April 9, 2011. A second hotel was built in the area by 1770, to accommodate the traffic between Philadelphia and Reading. Several wooden bridges, including a pontoon bridge, were built across the ford before 1797, but they were all destroyed within a few years by springtime flooding.Thomas, 1984, Item 8, p. 2 The Pennsylvania Legislature approved a lottery in 1797 to raise funds for the bridge, eventually raising $20,000. The bridge was completed in 1799 at a cost of $60,000, opening on November 2.

John Pugh Samuel Beard John Burk Henry Priest Undertakers of Masonry George Boyer Carpenter John Lewis Architect and Superintendent The bridge was not completely paid for, so tolls were collected for five years after its construction.HAER, p. 3. Increased road traffic followed the completion of the bridge, and with the start of regular stage coach service between Philadelphia and Reading, the hotel next to the bridge became an overnight stop marking the halfway point of the trip.Thomas, 1984, Item 8, p. 2. Turnpikes were created from Germantown to the east end of the bridge in 1804, and from the western end of the bridge to Reading about 1816, but the trip across the bridge remained toll-free until 1867. In that year a toll booth was constructed on the western end of the bridge, and outraged residents burned it down before any tolls could be collected. In 1872 a toll booth was erected on the eastern end. This time residents obtained a court order prohibiting the collection of tolls within a mile of the bridge, then they burned down the toll booth.HAER, pp. 3-4. Trolley tracks were laid on the south side of the bridge in 1896, eventually connecting Norristown to the south with Trappe on the north. A historical society sued to keep the tracks off the bridge, but the trolley company built the tracks without permission, presenting the court with a fait accompli. The trolleys ran until 1933.HAER, p. 4. To avoid the necessity of curved approaches, the American Automobile Association lobbied for the removal of the old bridge in 1938, to be replaced by a steel and concrete bridge. No major changes to the bridge occurred however and in the 1980s the new routing of US 422 removed much of the heavy traffic from the bridge.HABS, p. 5.

The society has an international membership and its aims are to establish and maintain standards of typography and to provide a forum for debate.  History  The ISTD was originally formed as the British Typographers' Guild (BTG) in 1928 when Vincent Steer and friends met in a Sicilian restaurant in Holborn, to found the society. Steer recognized the need and the potential for the creative typographer's skills in a world where most 'design' was carried out through compositors' layouts. From his own background in printing, and the opportunity to observe the trade in America, he determined to develop the profession of typography in the UK, and to that end started the British Typographers Guild with six other like-minded founding members. In 1953 the guild became the Society of Typographic Designers (STD), and in 1999, recognizing its influence in other countries, and at the behest of then President Colin Banks, it became the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD).  TypoGraphic  TypoGraphic is the journal of the ISTD and was first published in 1971. Selected writings from 30 years of TypoGraphic were published in an anthology in 2001. A complete set of TypoGraphic journals is available at the St Bride Library.  ISTD International Typographic Awards  The ISTD runs the International Typographic Awards which are held as an appraisal of current standards in typographic design and are judged by some of today's leading graphic, interactive and typographic design specialists: * A Certificate of Excellence, awarded to all finalists, signifies a high standard of design in conjunction with a high standard of typography. * Premier Awards, awarded to designers of outstanding submissions, are offered for work that has not only met the criteria for the award of a Certificate of Excellence, but which is also considered outstanding by a majority of the jurors. * The winning submission, selected from all of the Premier Awards, is judged to be the most significant typographical achievement, exemplifying excellence. The ISTD Awards are held every three years: there were awards in 2011 and 2014, and the next award will be given during 2017.  Categories of membership  The ISTD has several categories of membership, some with designatory postnominals: * Honorary Fellowship (HonFISTD) is awarded in recognition of outstanding typographic design work, or significant contribution to the aims of, or service to, the ISTD or the typographic industry. * Fellowship (FISTD) is awarded in recognition of the nominee's professional standing or for their services to the ISTD. * Membership (MISTD) is open to all practising typographers, graphic designers, and educators who show, by submission of their typographic design work, or through evidence of competence in their field of activity, that their professional ability has reached the high standard required by the ISTD. * Student Membership is open to students who are successful in the Student Assessment. * Corporate Membership is open to design organizations, companies, and other commercial institutions to support the ISTD. * Institutional Membership is open to educational institutions involved in the delivery of typographic studies. This offers a range of benefits including reduced submission fees for students submitting projects for assessment and teaching materials from the ISTD education archive.  ISTD Student Assessment  The annual Student Assessment, started in 1975, allows students to gain entry to the ISTD. This is achieved by assessment of their work applied to a rigorous brief (five new project briefs are published in October each year), and is open to those registered on a recognised full-time undergraduate or postgraduate course. Assessment is carried out by teams of practicing designers and typographic educators. Student Assessments are held in England, Ireland, Middle East, South Africa and Australia to deal with the submissions relating to each location. These are coordinated by the ISTD Education Team under the aegis of the Education Director.

Its occurrence in captive birds has been recorded, although it is a relatively rare abnormal behaviour. Causes =Toxins= Polydipsia can be the result of a bird having ingested a toxin, or overconsumption of natural substances. For example, in pet birds, crackers, snack items, chips, fast foods, and canned vegetables (unrinsed) if eaten in sufficient quantities may cause a mild salt toxicity (5-10 times requirement) and subsequent polydipsia. Polydipsia can result from zinc poisoning to which caged birds may be particularly susceptible because of the zinc coating often used on birdcage bars. Polydipsia has been experimentally induced in pigeons, budgerigars and ducks, by the administration of lithium chloride (LiCl). The polydipsic effect was greatest in budgerigars, a desert- dwelling species with a well-developed fluid retention system, and least in ducks, a species with an efficient sodium-secretion system.Hardy, W.T. and Westbrook R.F. 1981. Lithium-induced polydipsia in birds: A comparative study and analysis of electrolyte excretion. Physiology and Behavior, 27: 575-583 =Symptom of disease= In waterfowl, polydipsia can be a symptom of duck virus enteritis. Polydipsia has also been listed as a symptom of many diseases, including *Nephrogenic diabetes insipdus *Diabetes insipidus *Diabetes mellitus *Renal glucosuria *Vitamin A deficiency *Liver disease *Renal disease *Hypercalcemia? *Hyperthyroidism? *Hyperadrenocorticism? *Hypervitaminosis D3 *Elevated dietary sodium *Excess dietary protein *Excess fruit consumption =Brain lesions= In hens, lesions of the supraoptic hypothalamus of the brain can result in polydipsia.Ralph, C.L. 1960. Polydipsia in the hen following lesions in the supraoptic hypothalamus. American Journal of Physiology, 198:528-530 =Psychogenic= Polydipsia sometimes occurs under housing or experimental conditions which purportedly lead to stress or frustration. Growing parent stock of meat-type chickens (broilers), subjected routinely to chronic food restriction, show increased drinking after a single daily meal along with other oral stereotypies. Expression of these activities is correlated positively with the level of restriction imposed, and is thought to be controlled mainly by central dopaminergic mechanisms.Savory, C.J. and Mann, J.S., 1997. Is there a role for corticosterone in expression of abnormal behaviour in restricted-fed fowls? Physiology & Behavior, 62: 7-13 Under experimental conditions where birds receive reinforcements on a strict schedule, for example receiving one pellet of food each minute often indicated by a tone or other stimulus, the birds may develop polydipsia. Under these conditions it is called schedule induced polydipsia or sometimes, adjunctive drinking.Hamm, R.J., Porter, J.H. and Kaempf, G.L. 1981. Stimulus generalization of schedule-induced polydipsia. Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behaviour, 36: 93‚Äì99Palya, W.L. 1980. Stereotyped adjunctive pecking by caged pigeons. Animal Learning and Behavior, 8: 293-303 Genetics Some strains of hens are polydipsic, drinking almost twice the normal amount of water. It has been suggested that a recessive major gene is involved in this condition. Similarly, a quail line that exhibits polyuria was found to be fixed for an autosomal recessive mutation that also induced polydipsia.Minvielle, F., Grossmann R. and Gourichon, D., 2007.

The company was founded by Dave Petrillo and Dave Jackson, mechanical engineers from Pennington, New Jersey. They made prototypes in their basement, then in 2011 started refining and producing them in rented space at Sherrill Manufacturing in Sherrill, New York, a former Oneida silverware factory that had changed its business model to hosting startups and small companies in 2010, after Oneida had moved most of its manufacturing overseas in 2004 but had left a small amount of business with the factory under contract. The company received help on manufacturing costs from Sherrill and raised money on Kickstarter in 2011. The team decided to continue with production in the United States, rather than moving to Mexico, as was their initial plan. A similar concept using phase change materials, but integrated into the walls and bottom of a cup, had been invented by the Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics in 2009. Some reviews show Joulies work while others have expressed doubts over the product's effectiveness. After doing some tests, they reported that the product does not work very well if at all.

The d-dimensional depolarizing channel can be viewed as a completely positive trace-preserving map Delta_lambda, depending on one parameter lambda, which maps a state rho onto a linear combination of itself and the maximally mixed state, :Delta_lambda(rho)=lambdarho+frac{1-lambda}{d}I. The condition of complete positivity requires lambda to satisfy the bounds :-frac{1}{d^2-1}lelambdale 1. Qubit Channel The single qubit depolarizing channel has operator-sum representation on a density matrix rho given by :Delta_lambda(rho) = sum_{i=0}^{3} K_i rho K_i^dagger, where K_i are the Kraus operators given by :K_0 = sqrt{1-frac{3lambda}{4}} I, K_1 = frac{sqrt{lambda}}{2} X, K_2 = frac{sqrt{lambda}}{2} Y, K_3 = frac{sqrt{lambda}}{2} Z and {I,X,Y,Z} are the Pauli matrices. The trace preserving condition is satisfied by the fact that sum_{i}K_i ^dagger K_i = I. Geometrically the depolarizing channel Delta_lambda can be interpreted as a uniform contraction of the Bloch sphere, parameterized by lambda . In the case where lambda=0 the channel returns the maximally-mixed state for any input state rho, which corresponds of the complete contraction of the Bloch- sphere down to the single-point frac{I}{2} given by the origin.  Classical capacity  The HSW theorem states that the classical capacity of a quantum channel Psi can be characterized as its regularized Holevo information: :lim_{ntoinfty}frac{1}{n}chileft(Psi^{otimes n}right) This quantity is difficult to compute and this reflects our ignorance on quantum channels. However, if the Holevo information is additive for a channel Psi, i.e., :chileft(PsiotimesPsiright)=chileft(Psiright)+chileft(Psiright) Then we can get its classical capacity by computing the Holevo information of the channel. The additivity of Holevo information for all channels was a famous open conjecture in quantum information theory, but it is now known that this conjecture doesn't hold in general. This was proved by showing that the additivity of minimum output entropy for all channels doesn't hold, which is an equivalent conjecture. Nonetheless, the additivity of the Holevo information is shown to hold for the quantum depolarizing channel, and an outline of the proof is given below. As a consequence, entanglement across multiple uses of the channel cannot increase the classical capacity. In this sense, the channel behaves like a classical channel. To achieve the optimal rate of communication, it suffices to choose an orthonormal basis to encode the message, and perform measurements that project onto to the same basis at the receiving end. = Outline of the proof of the additivity of Holevo information = The additivity of Holevo information for the depolarizing channel was proved by Christopher King. He showed that the maximum output p-norm of the depolarizing channel is multiplicative, which implied the additivity of the minimum output entropy, which is equivalent to the additivity of the Holevo information. A stronger version of the additivity of the Holevo information is shown for the depolarizing channel Delta_lambda. For any channel Psi: :chileft(Delta_lambdaotimesPsiright)=chileft(Delta_lambdaright)+chileft(Psiright) This is implied by the following multiplicativity of maximum output p-norm (denoted as v_p): :v_pleft(Delta_lambdaotimesPsiright)=v_pleft(Delta_lambdaright)v_pleft(Psiright) The greater than or equal to direction of the above is trivial, it suffices to take the tensor product the states that achieve the maximum p-norm for Delta_lambda and Psi respectively, and input the product state into the product channel to get the output p-norm v_p(Delta_lambda)v_p(Psi). The proof for the other direction is more involved The main idea of the proof is to rewrite the depolarizing channel as a convex combination of simpler channels, and use properties of those simpler channels to get the multiplicativity of the maximum output p-norm for the depolarizing channel. It turns out that we can write the depolarizing channel as follows: :Delta_lambda(rho)=sum_{n=1}^{2d^2(d+1)}c_nU_n^*Phi_lambda^{(n)}(rho)Un where c_n's are positive numbers, U_n's are unitary matrices, Phi^{(n)}_lambda's are some dephasing channels and rho is an arbitrary input state. Therefore, the product channel can be written as: :left(Delta_lambdaotimesPsiright)(rho)=sum_{n=1}^{2d^2(d+1)}c_nleft(U_n^*otimes Iright)left(Phi_lambda^{(n)}otimesPsiright)(rho)left(U_notimes Iright) By the convexity and the unitary invariance of the p-norm, it suffices to show the simpler bound: :left(Phi^{(n)}_lambdaotimesPsiright)(rho)_ple v_p(Delta_lambda)v_p(Psi) One important mathematical tool used in the proof of this bound is the Lieb‚ÄìThirring inequality, which provides a bound for p-norm of a product of positive matrices. The details and the calculations of the proof are skipped, interested readers are referred to the paper of C. King mentioned above. = Discussion = The main technique used in this proof, namely rewriting the channel of interest as a convex combination of other simpler channels, is a generalization of the method used earlier to prove similar results for unital qubit channels.C. King, Additivity for unital qubit channels The fact that the classical capacity of the depolarizing channel is equal to the Holevo information of the channel means that we can't really use quantum effects such as entanglement to improve the transmission rate of classical information. In this sense, the depolarizing channel can be treated as a classical channel. However the fact that the additivity of Holevo information doesn't hold in general proposes some areas of future work, namely finding channels that violates the additivity, in other words, channels that can exploit quantum effects to improve the classical capacity beyond its Holevo information.

Archaeology In 2011, during road construction on Highway 9, an elaborately decorated Viking sword was excavated. The sword is decorated with gold-leaf and silver thread. The weapon appears to feature both ancient runic symbols as well as Latin characters and Christian symbols. Archaeologists have yet to decipher the meaning of the mixed characters. The sword was found buried next to a battle axe and several ancient silver coins. The sword likely belonged to a wealthy Viking who was both a farmer and a warrior who sailed to the British Isles with King Cnut the Great. The finding prompted further archaeological study in Langeid, as it may have been a wealthy Viking-era town involved in ironwork weapons production.

The islands of Trom√∏y and His√∏ya lie to the north and northwest. The small islands of √Ür√∏ya and Havs√∏ya lie to the southwest. A part of the island is included in Raet National Park. History Graves from the Iron Age exist in two places on the island: Lakseberget and St√∏ttavla. Historical records show a permanent settlement on Merd√∏ dating back to at least the 1300s, and that the settlement occurred in close association with the ever increasing shipping traffic on the Skagerrak. Merd√∏ is marked as an outport on every old Dutch maritime map since 1580, and it was one of the most important ports along the Skagerrak. Merd√∏ harbor is located on the northern shore of the island of Merd√∏, facing the village of Revesand on the island of Trom√∏y, about to the north. The inn, customs station, and shipyard on Merd√∏ are mentioned in writings from the 16th century. Later, a school and shops were established on the island. There is a well-preserved old house which is now the Merd√∏gaard museum, which belongs to the Aust-Agder museum in Arendal. There are two compass designs cut into the mountains with the date 1654. There are also two cannons that were placed on the island in the 1700s for the defense of the town of Arendal that still can be seen. In the 19th century, fishermen and their families lived on the island along the sea. In 1900, there were 26 inhabited houses with a total of 144 residents. At the beginning of the 20th century, the sailing season ended and there was no longer the same need for the ports. The customs station was closed in 1960, the unloading station was closed in 1971, and the post office was closed in 1975. Recreation In the 20th century, Merd√∏ became more and more a holiday and tourist destination. The island gradually depopulated completely, but the houses are still used as summer homes for vacationing families. Merd√∏ also has a large number of cabins that were built during the 20th century. Merd√∏ has several nice swimming areas with good sandy beaches, and it is a popular destination for people in the Arendal area. There are ferries to and from the car-free island every half hour during the summer season. During the low season and all year round, both ferry companies offer taxi boat services.

This is now codified in the United Kingdom's Companies Act 2006, section 170. Facts Shareholders in Nixon's Navigation Co. wanted to sell their shares, and requested that the company's secretary find purchasers. Some directors of the company purchased the shares at ¬£12.10s per share, which price was based upon independent valuation. After the sale, the shareholders discovered that before and during the negotiations for that sale, the board of directors had been involved in other negotiations to sell the entire company, which would have made those shares substantially more valuable had they come to fruition. The plaintiff sued, claiming breach of fiduciary duty, in that the shareholders should have been told of these negotiations. Judgment Swinfen Eady J held the directors owed duties to the company and not shareholders individually. Significance Percival v Wright is still considered to be good law, and was followed by the House of Lords in . However, it has been distinguished in at least two subsequent cases. In Coleman v Myers [1977] 2 NZLR 225 and Peskin v Anderson [2001] BCLC 372 the court described this as being the general rule, but one which may be subject to exceptions where the circumstances are such that a director may owe a greater duty to an individual shareholder, such as when that shareholder is known to be relying upon the director for guidance, or where the shareholder is a vulnerable person.

Also known under his mother's name, Ermolaev. His father, Georgiy Fyodorovich Kollontay (1897-1954), an artist, was sent to the camps in 1938 (released in 1946, rehabilitated posthumously); his mother, Ekaterina Ilyinichna Ermolaeva (1922-2001), was a translator (English, modern Greek). Biography In 1971 graduated from the Music College attached to the Moscow Conservatory with a double major in piano and in theory/composition. In 1977 received his diploma in piano from the Moscow Conservatory, studying under Professor V. V. Gornostayeva; continued as her assistant in 1979. In 1978 earned his diploma in composition under Professor A. S. Leman. From 1979 member of the Union of Composers of the USSR (RF). Between 1979 and 2003 taught at the Moscow Conservatory (intermittently; first as an assistant to V. Gornostayeva; from 1982 as a faculty member), and, from 1989 to 1991, at the Gnessin Musical Pedagogical Institute (special piano). Beginning in 1991, performed various duties at Moscow churches (altar server, choir singer, guard). Since 2003 professor (piano) at Tainan National University of the Arts (Taiwan, ROC.). Among Mikhail Kollontay's students are: N. V. Moukhina, M. A. Soboleva, A. V. Sidenko, O. A. Tutova, Lin Yu-Ying (ÊûóÊò±Áë©), Kao Pei-Hsin (È´òÂüπÈ¶®), Shen Yu-Lin (Ê≤àÂ¶§Èúñ), Huang Kuan-Che (ÈªÉÂÜ†Âì≤), Chien Jay (ÈÑ≠Êù∞), Wang Yi-Hsing (‰∏ÄÂπ∏ Áéã), and Bang-Shyuan Chen (Èô≥ÈÇ¶ÁéÑ). Composition Kollontay's artistic style was formed under the influence of Russian Church music (from childhood sang in church choirs), the tradition of liturgical reading, the culture of early Russian singing and folklore (worked in the folk music department of the Moscow Conservatory; went on folklore expeditions). All this contributed to the liberation his intonation and his rhythmic, modal and compositional thinking, and to the formation of his own individual style. The following have performed Kollontay's works: Yu. Bashmet, A. Boreiko, N. Burnasheva, A. Golyshev, Schostakovich State Quartet, E. Denisova (Austria), K. Dillingham (USA), I. Zaydenshnir, F.

Early life  Melvin Eugene \\"Gene\\" Salvay was born in Kansas City, Missouri. Gene's father, Israel David Salvay (b:1889 in Veisiejai, Lithuania) was a fashion designer and pattern maker; his mother, Anna (Kiansky) Salvay (b:1895 in Starodub Russia) worked as a seamstress in order to get her sons, Seymour Nathan Salvay (b:1916; Hump Pilot in WWII and, later, Vice President of Milgram Food Stores, Kansas City, MO) and Gene through high school and training as aeronautical engineers.  Education  Gene graduated Central High School, Kansas City, MO, in 1936. That same year, he won 1st place nationally in the Fisher Body coach-building contest with a model of a horse-drawn carriage. The next year, he won 2nd place nationally in the Fisher Body auto-design contest. He continued his education at Curtiss- Wright Technical School, Glendale [Airport], CA from which he received his engineering degree in Spring 1941: Design courses at Curtiss-Wright were given at the school's campus in Glendale; its more technical engineering courses were given at Caltech.  Career  Salvay went to work for Rearwin, designing the Rearwin Skyranger, later the Commonwealth Skyranger. During World War II, Salvay went to work at North American Aviation in Kansas City developing the B-25 Mitchell. Salvay partnered with a fellow North American Aviation engineer Stark to design the Salvay-Stark Skyhopper in 1944. Initially planned to be a production aircraft, it became an early post-war Homebuilt aircraft. He also helped develop the Morrisey \\"Nifty\\", which was the basis for the later Varga Kachina aircraft. Salvay later became the chief engineer for North American Sabreliner Salvay became the Director of Structural Design for the B-1 Lancer bomber. Later Salvay became director of Lockheed's Trans Atmospheric Vehicle program. Salvay encouraged Australian aircraft engineers to work with American companies to share experience. Family life In 1952, Salvay married Betty May Goodman. In 1964, Salvay moved to Encino, California.

It is no longer good law, as it stipulated that a \\"subjective\\" standard of competence applied.

Judgment =High Court= Romer J held that some of the directors did breach their duty of care. But they were not liable to reimburse, because an exclusion clause for negligence was valid. And even in absence of exclusion clauses, in his view, ‚Äòfor a director acting honestly himself to be held legally liable for negligence, in trusting the officers under him not to conceal from him what they ought to report to him appears to us to be laying too heavy a burden on honest businessmen.‚Äô Though he felt ‚Äòsome difficulty‚Äô with the distinction, negligence would need to be ‚Äògross‚Äô to visit liability.

Facts Former members of the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) sued the directors for failing to disclose that they had plans to demutualise. They claimed that they could have received ¬£35,000 had they stayed in the club, but had given up their membership. They claimed that the directors had breached a duty owed to them as shareholders to inform them of the upcoming demutualisation plan. The RAC applied to have the claims struck out as having no prospect of success as directors did not owe a duty to individual shareholders. The RAC succeeded in having the claims struck out at first instance before Neuberger J, and the claimants appealed to the Court of Appeal. Judgment The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The only judgment was given by Mummery LJ. Although there were several grounds in the appeal, the main proposition for which the judgment is traditionally cited is that directors do not owe a general duty to shareholders, although they may owe a specific duty to a shareholder if there has been an assumption of responsibility. In this case there was no suggestion of such an assumption of responsibility, and so the claims were struck out. Counsel for the claimants accepted that the fiduciary duties owed by the directors to RAC do not necessarily extend to the individual members, and that, in general, directors do not, solely by virtue of the office of director, owe fiduciary duties to the shareholders, either collectively or individually. The court cited with approval the headnote in Percival v Wright [1902] 2 Ch 421 that: In his judgment Mummery LJ noted that the apparently unqualified width of the ruling had, over the course of the previous century, been subjected to increasing judicial, academic and professional critical comment. But that, as a general rule, it was right that directors should not be over-exposed to the risk of multiple legal actions by dissenting minority shareholders. The existence of fiduciary duties owed by the directors to the company do not however necessarily preclude, in special circumstances, the co-existence of additional duties owed by the directors to individual shareholders. In such cases individual shareholders may bring a direct action (as distinct from a derivative action) against the directors for breach of such duty. The court relied upon Stein v Blake [1998] 1 All ER 724 (at 727D and 729G per Millett LJ) for the principle that a duality of duties may exist. In addition to requiring special circumstances to give rise to such a duty, for a shareholder to have a valid claim breach of such a duty must have caused loss to the shareholder directly (eg. by being induced by a director to part with his shares in the company at an undervalue), as distinct from loss sustained by him by a diminution in the value of his shares (eg. by reason of the misappropriation by a director of the company's assets). It was affirmed that the fiduciary duties owed to the company arise from the legal relationship between the directors and the company directed and controlled by them. However any fiduciary duties owed to the shareholders do not arise from that legal relationship. They are dependent on establishing a special factual relationship between the directors and the shareholders in any particular case. Events may take place which bring the directors of the company into direct and close contact with the shareholders in a manner capable of generating fiduciary obligations, such as a duty of disclosure of material facts to the shareholders, or an obligation to use confidential information and valuable commercial and financial opportunities, which have been acquired by the directors in that office, for the benefit of the shareholders. The court referred to examples from other common law jurisdictions where special circumstances had been held to exist which justified the imposition of fiduciary duties on directors to individual shareholders. In the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in Coleman v Myers [1977] 2 NZLR 225 and in the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Brunninghausen v Glavanics [1999] 46 NSWLR 538 fiduciary duties of directors to shareholders were established in the specially strong context of the familial relationships of the directors and shareholders and their relative personal positions of influence in the company concerned. But on the facts of the case before them, no such special relationship was claimed, and the actions failed. Review The Court of Appeal's decision in Peskin v Anderson has generally been treated as authoritative in relation to the principle to which it relates. It has not been doubted in either subsequent judicial decisions or in academic commentary. In Gower and Davies - Principles of Modern Company Law the editors state: \\"This principle has now been fully accepted in English law as a result of the recent decision in Peskin v Anderson\\".

The party was founded in January 2006 by a group of Independent councillors on Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, described as \\"dissident former \\"old labour\\" councillors\\". At that time they had seven councillors, and in the local elections that May they fielded 17 candidates. They have contested council elections since. The party leader is Phillip Birkinshaw, but there are no whips and membership is only open to councillors and candidates, which the party says is to prevent influence from being exerted in the background by a party structure or powerful individuals. All candidates pay their own expenses. After the 2007 elections the Group had 22 councillors, and 24 after the 2008 elections. Despite threatening to overtake Labour as the largest party on Barnsley Council in 2008, BIG's fortunes have dramatically altered, being reduced to 5 councillors after suffering massive losses in the 2012 Local Elections, and with the Group only able to field 5 candidates in 2015 and reduced to four councillors in 2016. The Group was further reduced at the 2018 local elections, fielding just two candidates in the Dodworth and Stairfoot wards, losing in both and being reduced to two councillors (Philip Birkinshaw in Dodworth and Gill Carr in Worsbrough-both next up for election in 2020).

Biography Born in Montreal into a merchant family, Montigny first saw military action as a volunteer on the expedition against Schenectady in 1690. Two years later he went to France with Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, and was in 1693 stationed the capital of Acadia, Fort Nashwaak, where he led the local Abenaki and Mi'kmaq in raids against the English (See Battle of Fundy Bay.)While posted there he also engaged in trade and commerce, sometimes in conflict with his military duties. In 1696 Montigny was on d'Iberville's expedition against Pemaquid, an English fort on the northern frontier with Acadia. In this action he began a close association with the Abenaki war leader Escumbuit, who also joined Montigny on d'Iberville's Newfoundland campaign later in 1696, in which most of the English settlements on Newfoundland were destroyed. Montigny was given an independent command by d'Iberville, in which he traveled along the coast, destroying settlements and fishing stages as he went. Despite the destructive nature of the expedition, it had no long-lasting implications, as the English quickly returned, rebuilding and fortifying some of the settlements. Montigny was promoted to lieutenant in 1700. In 1704 he was sent back to Acadia, where he helped orchestrate raids against English settlements, and worked to convince the Abenakis to resettle closer to French settlements. In the winter of 1704/5 he brought a band of Abenakis to Newfoundland, where they attempted to repeated d'Iberville's 1696 expedition under the direction of Daniel d'Auger de Subercase. They once again destroyed a number of English settlements, but were unable to capture St. John's, the English capital. In 1706 Montigny went to France with Escumbuit, where they were received by King Louis XIV. He was a member of an expedition sent in 1709 to dispute a possible English advance on Lake Champlain. The English never reached beyond the southern end of the lake, and the only action was a brief skirmish near Crown Point. He was awarded the Order of Saint Louis in 1712, and in 1721 was given command of a frontier fort on Green Bay, where he maintained good relations with the Fox, and was visited by his friend Escumbuit. By 1726 he had returned to Montreal, and in 1730 he was made commandant of Fort Michilimackinac, a post he held for three years before finally retiring. He died in Montreal in 1737. He was twice married, and had seven children.

It is the story of a young girl growing up in Texas. Plot In the summer of 1899, Calpurnia Virginia Tate is about to turn twelve and worries about the adult responsibilities that loom on the horizon. She would much rather swim in the river near her family's pecan plantation just outside the tiny town of Fentress, Texas than learn to cook, knit, and play the piano. One day, noticing two different types of grasshoppers in the lawn around the house, Callie finally decides to find a copy of Charles Darwin's infamous book The Origin of Species. After a disastrous encounter with a lady librarian, Callie is forced to search for the illicit book elsewhere. Little does she know that there is a copy in her very own house in the personal library of her Granddaddy. An imposing and distant figure, Callie must work up her courage to ask him about her grasshopper conundrum and relay her own theory about why the grasshoppers around the house are two different sizes. This begins an easy sort of friendship between granddaughter and grandfather. Soon Callie is spending most of her time with Granddaddy, catching specimens of wildlife for his collection and learning about natural sciences at his side. When she is not tramping and trapping with Granddaddy, Callie finds herself sadly incapable at the skills her mom so desperately tries to teach her. She can't cook anything other than soft-boiled eggs and cheese sandwiches. Her needlepoint is \\"straggly and pitiful.\\" Her piano-playing, while adequate, is unexceptional. All of this is painfully obvious to poor Callie when she is compared to her best friend Lula. Lula is a perfect lady, excelling at all of the pursuits at which Callie fails so miserably. In fact, her proper ladylike demeanor has three of Callie's six brothers falling in love with her during the course of the summer. Callie fears that her free-roaming days may be at an end, though, when she receives a frightening Christmas gift: a book from her mother entitled \\"The Science of Housewifery.\\" Throughout the novel, Callie must learn to balance her own independent and curious personality with the restrictions placed on a girl at the turn of the 19th century. As new inventions are presented in Callie's life, she adjusts and evolves, first with the wind machine her brother brings home, then with a marvelous new beverage called Coca-Cola. Ultimately, though, it is the introduction of the telephone in the small Texas town that symbolizes the changes ahead for Callie. As Granddaddy tells her, \\"The old century is dying, even as we watch. Remember this day.\\" As the book ends the 20th-century dawns, and a rare snow occurs, leaving the reader hopeful that it will bring with it new opportunities for the feisty young Calpurnia. Characters * Calpurnia Virginia Tate: \\"Callie Vee\\" is the main character of the story. A curious, intelligent eleven-year- old determined to learn about the world around her even as she deals with the restrictions placed on a girl in the turn of the century. * Granddaddy (Captain Tate): Calpurnia's paternal grandfather, Walter Tate. Through her interactions with him, Callie learns about natural history as well as her own potential and the coming changes in society. Granddaddy is quick friends with Callie just because she got up the courage to talk to him. He spends almost no time with her six brothers and doesn't know them apart. He gets Callie interested in Science which she immediately takes a liking to even though her mother doesn't approve. * Alfred Tate: Calpurnia's father, who works at a cotton gin and isn't much mention in the story. * Margaret Tate: Calpurnia's mother, a strict and traditional woman who wants nothing more than to turn her daughter into a respectable lady. Housewifery is all she wants for Calpurnia and spends much of her time teaching Callie to sew cook and other ladylike antiquities. * Harry Tate: Calpurnia's oldest brother. Of the six Tate boys, Harry is kindest to Calpurnia, often going out of his way to make her smile. * Sam Houston Tate: Calpurnia's second-oldest brother. * Lamar Tate: Calpurnia's older brother who is sometimes a little rude. He wasn't born very long before Calpurnia and he sees her as a rival. Lamar is the voice of prejudice in the book and he dislikes \\"Yankees\\"- people from northern states. He looks down on Calpurnia and he makes it clear he believes it is the job of women to stay home and do chores. He takes Viola's food for granted and he is the only brother to openly insult Calpurnia's knitting. Lamar's slothfulness and total bluntness when it comes to gender expectations greatly contributes to Calpurnia's frustration with her status as a girl. He himself is extremely lazy and spoiled and he often becomes indignant when things don't go his way. * Travis Tate: Calpurnia's younger brother. He has his kittens named after wild west outlaws. He is the most caring out of them all (a little sensitive) * Sul Ross Tate: Calpurnia's younger brother. * Jim Bowie Tate: \\"J. B.\\" is Calpurnia's younger brother and the youngest Tate child. * Lula Gates: Calpurnia's best friend. A proper, ladylike girl, Lula wins prizes for her embroidery and prides herself on her many accomplishments. She wins the prize for several other events too. Lamar, Travis, and Sam Houston have a crush on her, but Callie is not one to keep a secret. Anyway, sometimes secrets just spill out. * SanJuanna: The Tate family maid. * Alberto: The Tate family helper. Husband to SanJuanna, he is not mentioned very much. * Viola: The Tate family cook. * Miss Brown: The piano teacher for Harry and Calpurnia. Style The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate is an episodic, character driven novel. rather than facing and overcoming a particular obstacle.

It is therefore a necessary part of corporate personality that there should be rules by which acts are attributed to the company. These may be called ‚Äòthe rules of attribution‚Äô. There can be rules in the constitution or rules implied (e.g. shareholders acting unanimously are the company, Multinational Gas). Otherwise, the principles of agency apply, and the company acts through its servants and agents.

It follows two individuals, a reporter for Paris-Soir and an intelligent alien at the Berlin Zoo, after their minds have been switched by a time-travel experiment gone awry. A shorter version of the novel was published in Galaxy magazine in April 1963 as \\"A Visitor to the Zoo\\". In 1966 it was published under the title The Other Foot. Knight has called this novel his favorite among his books. Synopsis In the year 2002, the Berlin Zoo acquires a new specimen: \\"Fritz\\", a biped from \\"Brecht's planet.\\" Fritz is intelligent, and his keepers treat him with a mix of courtesy and disdain; he is kept in a display with another (presumably female) biped and the two are required to work for a living, transcribing tapes made by explorers to their planet. One day, Martin Naumchik, a human male, is visiting the zoo when his personality and that of the biped are interchanged. The switch is the unintended consequence of an experiment in time travel that takes place at another location. The remainder of the story follows the two characters as they come to terms with their new bodies and new feelings. Martin quickly becomes aware of the degradation of being a zoo animal, while Fritz is forced to cope with life in a confusing and threatening alien society. Martin tries, and fails, to convince his captors that he is imprisoned in the biped's body; the biped, in Martin's body, eventually comes into contact with Martin's colleagues and his lover, and manages to continue with Martin's life. The novel also deals wryly with the theme of sexual identity. Because Fritz is provided with inguinal glands resembling a human male's, he is presumed to be male. But it turns out that the organ has nothing to do with reproduction: Fritz is a female, and the smaller primate with whom he shares a cage is a male. To reproduce, the female aggressively bites off an egglike knob from the male's forehead containing the semen. Martin (in Fritz's body), and the reader, only learn this at the end of the novel, when he is overcome by passion and commits the act. Reception Judith Merril found the opening to the novel promising, but concluded that \\"having demonstrated intriguingly the effects of their new bodies on two intelligent and well-meaning creatures -- [Knight] just sort of stops, about where the story seemed about to start.\\"Books\\", F&SF;, May 1966, pp.44-45 P. Schuyler Miller panned the novel, describing the story as \\"predictable\\" and characterizing Knight's writing as \\"atypical and exasperating\\".\\"The Reference Library\\", Analog, October 1966, p.165 Academic Douglas Robillard praised the manner in which Knight illustrated many of his themes, declaring that \\"Knight shows a prodigality of invention in his tale, capable of sustaining a much longer novel, or even another book\\".\\"Uncertain Futures: Damon Knight's Science Fiction\\", in Voices for the Future, Volume 3, Popular Press, 1983, p.45 Sian MacArthur noted that Mind Switch \\"engages Gothic sentiment in a much more subtle fashion\\" than other Knight novels, engaging \\"the theme of existentialism\\" in exploring the title exchange.Gothic Science Fiction: 1818 to the Present, Palgrave Macmillan, 2015 \\"A Visitor to the Zoo\\" was originally published in the April 1963 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction References  External links  * 1965 American novels Novels by Damon Knight American science fiction novels Novels first published in serial form 1965 science fiction novels Works originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction Berkley Books books Novels set in Berlin Berlin Zoological Garden Fiction set in 2002 ","title":"Mind Switch"},{"id":"31448448","text":"British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd [1984] 1 All ER 504 is an English contract law case concerning agreement.

Facts Mr Errington in 1936 bought a house in Milvain Avenue, Newcastle upon Tyne, for his son and daughter in law, paying ¬£250, and the remaining ¬£500 coming from a mortgage, paid off with 15s a week by the newly weds. Mr Errington promised them they could stay in occupation as long as they paid the mortgage and that when all the instalments were paid it would be theirs. He gave her the building society book and said, ‚ÄòDon't part with this book. The house will be your property when the mortgage is paid.‚Äô He died and the son left to move in with his mother. The mother sought possession from the daughter in law. The Judge dismissed the claim for possession. Judgment The three-judge panel in the Court of Appeal unanimously held that the daughter in law did not have to move out of the house, because she was entitled to stay and pay off the mortgage as part of a binding agreement with the father, for varying reasons. Somervell LJ gave the initial (first read) judgment of the panel. Denning LJ held this was no mere tenancy at will; the father could not have revoked his promise once the couple had begun performing the act of paying off the mortgage instalments. The promise would only cease to bind him if they left their part of the promise incomplete and unperformed. The 15s a week was not rent, they were not bound to pay it, the father could only refuse to transfer them the house. The couple were licensees, but they acquired an equitable right to remain as long as they paid instalments, which would mature into a good equitable title once the mortgage was paid. The father made a unilateral contract, which could not be revoked once they began performance, but would cease to bind him if they did not perform their side. Although they had exclusive possession, they were licensees because they only have a mere personal privilege to remain, with no right to assign or sub let. But they were not bare licensees, rather than contractual licensees. He said there was no need to imply an obligation to complete the payments. The limit is where the daughter stops paying, and the father‚Äôs estate has to pick up the bill. Then she would lose her right to stay. The couple were on a licence, short of a tenancy but a contractual, or at least equitable right to remain, which would grow into good equitable title as soon as the mortgage was paid. The rule that a licence could always be revoked at will was ‚Äòaltered owing to the interposition of equity.‚Äô His judgment continued:http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1951/2.html Rodson LJ gave a short concurring judgment.

Life  Ioan Bob was born from a noble Romanian family in October or November 1739 in Orman, near Iclod () in Kolozs County, now Romania. He attended the secondary schools by the Jesuits but fallen ill he could not enter in seminary. In 1764, he entered as novice in the Basilian monastery of Blaj. After some months, because he could not bear the strict discipline, he withdraw from the monastic life working simply as lay administrator of the monastery. In 1773, he was sent by his friend Bishop Grigore Maior to study in Trnava where he graduated in theology. Returned to Romania, after a period of illness, he moved to Blaj where, on 25 December 1777, he was ordained a deacon and, on 8 April 1778, a priest. He worked for some months in the diocesan chancery. In 1778, he was appointed Dean in Daia Rom√¢nƒÉ and in 1779 to T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. In 1782, the Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, the Bishop of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü Grigore Maior, resigned. According to the praxis, the electoral synod was convened in August 1782 and Bob resulted the third voted. Nevertheless, he was designated by the Emperor Joseph II on 21 October 1783, probably because he was the only non- monk voted, and confirmed by Pope Pius VI on 15 December 1783. Accordingly, he was consecrated bishop, on 6 June 1784, by Grigore Maior and enthroned on 2 July 1784. Bob was a firm supporter of the rights of the Romanian population under the Holy Roman Empire. He actually, along with the Orthodox bishop Gherasim Adamovici, signed and brought the Supplex Libellus Valachorum before the Imperial Court of Vienna on March 30, 1792. This courageous act was rejected anyway. Bob introduced an authoritarian model of leadership in his Church which led also to some clashes. He died on 2 October 1830. He wrote a Dictionary of Romanian language published in Cluj (1822‚Äì1823), with about 11,000 Romanian words, which also gives the equivalent Latin and Hungarian. He promoted the printing of religious books, handbooks, and theological books. He also supported the edition of the Bible in Romanian known as Bible of Blaj (translated by Samuil Micu and published in 1795), the second translation of the Holy Scriptures in Romanian.

The ship was transferred to the UK under Lend- Lease on 17 November 1943, and named after Captain J. Cubitt, a Navy officer who commanded the frigate in 1661. Service history Cubitt was assigned to Nore Command, serving in the 21st Escort Group based at Harwich. She did not take part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, but was afterwards deployed escorting convoys to and from the landing beaches. Towards the end of 1944 Cubitt became a Coastal Forces Control Frigate (CFCF), controlling a flotilla of Motor Torpedo Boats operating in the Channel and North Sea to counter the threat of enemy E-Boats. In February 1945 Cubitt was refitted at Tilbury. Her 2-pounder \\"pom pom\\" bow chaser was removed, the two 20 mm Oerlikons mounted in front of the bridge were replaced with two single 40 mm Bofors, and splinter shields were fitted to her guns. On the night of 7/8 April 1945 Cubitt and were on patrol with their MTB's when Cubitt encountered a large group of E-Boats. She opened fire, and two were severely damaged and a third was hit before they could move out of range, but a patrolling aircraft then attacked and drove them towards the MTBs, resulting in a fierce close-quarter action. A Motor Gun Boat and an E-Boat collided, and Cubitt picked up casualties from another MGB that was on fire. The following night Rutherford and Cubitt were on patrol off Ostend, when an aircraft directed Rutherford towards a formation of E-Boats, and in five minutes two E-boats were sunk and several others damaged. Cubitt managed to fire a few shots as the E-boats fled under cover of a smoke screen. Cubitt visited several Dutch ports immediately after they were liberated, and after VE Day escorted ships to Oslo and Brunsb√ºttel. Cubitt was then assigned to \\"Operation Deadlight\\", towing surrendered U-boats from Loch Ryan out into the North Atlantic where they were sunk. Cubitt was returned to the U.S. Navy on 4 March 1946, struck from the Navy List on 12 April 1946, and sold for scrapping on 7 March 1947.

Facts Cleaves & Co Limited was a firm of chartering brokers. It negotiated charterparties between shipowner Nisshin Shipping Co Limited and various charterers. Although Cleaves was not a party to any of these, in each one Nisshin expressly agreed to pay a commission to Cleaves and to arbitrate their disputes. Nisshin declined to pay the commissions. Cleaves commenced arbitration against Nisshin seeking to recover the unpaid commissions. The arbitral tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction to decide the dispute because, first, under s. 1 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (‚ÄúCRTPA‚Äù), Cleaves have a right to enforce the provisions in the charterparties under which Nisshin agreed to pay Cleaves commission (the ‚Äúsubstantive term‚Äù); and, second, under s. 8 of that Act, Cleaves had a right to enforce the substantive term through commencing arbitration under the arbitration agreement in each charterparty. Nisshin applied to the High Court under s. 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge both grounds of the tribunal's decision seeking a declaration that the arbitral tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear the claims. Judgment =Whether Cleaves had a right to enforce the substantive term= The Court held that the issues under this question were: (i) whether the clauses in the charterparties providing for commissions ‚Äúpurported to confer a benefit‚Äù on Cleaves within s. (1)(b) CRTPA; and (ii) whether s. 1(b) was disapplied by s. 1(2) because ‚Äúon a proper construction of the contact it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party‚Äù. Whether the clauses purported to confer a benefit on Cleaves Each of the relevant clauses provided: Nisshin argued that these clauses meant the payment should be made to Messrs Ifchor and then subsequently divided by that firm between itself and Cleaves and, accordingly, that the benefit was not conferred by the clause directly on Cleaves. The Court disagreed, finding that its meaning was in substance exactly the same as if the clause had provided that there was to be a commission of 2 per cent of which 1 per cent was to be paid to Messrs Ifchor and 1 per cent to Cleaves. Whether on a proper construction the parties did not intend that Cleaves should be able to the enforce the substantive term  Nisshin argued that on a proper construction of the charterparties the parties had not intended that Cleaves would be able to enforce the substantive term because: (i) the arbitration clauses in all of the charterparties did not make express provision for enforcement by a broker of a claim for commission; (ii) there is no positive indication in the charterparties that the parties did intend the brokers to have enforceable rights; and (iii) the parties‚Äô mutual intention on the proper construction of each contract was to create a trust of a promise in favour of Cleaves ‚Äì a trust enforceable against Nisshin at the suit of the charterer as trustee. As to (i), the Court decided that the wording of the arbitration clauses was of little or no materiality: (a) even if the parties only intended to arbitrate only disputes between the parties, that was entirely consistent with a mutual intention that Cleaves should be obliged to enforce the substantive term through the courts; (b) if, on the proper construction of CRTPA (as the Court went on later to find in relation to the second main issue in the case) the third party is obliged to enforce the commission benefit by arbitration even where the agreement does not on its proper construction provide for any participants in an arbitration other than the parties to the main contract, then the strength of any inference derived from the absence of express provision that the third party may arbitrate could be little more than negligible. As to (ii), the Court decided that s. 1(2) only disapplies s. 1(b) if on a proper construction of the contract the parties did not intend the third party to be able to enforce the substantive term. Accordingly, s. 1(2) had no effect where it appears the parties did intend that the third party should be able to enforce the substantive term nor where the contract is neutral as to whether they did. The Court found that the clauses in issue were neutral as to the parties‚Äô intention and therefore that s. 1(2) did not disapply s. 1(b) in this case. Finally, as to (iii), the Court decided that Nisshin's argument could only succeed if it could be inferred from the existence of the underlying trustee relationship (by which the charterer was trustee for Cleaves of Nisshin's promise to pay the commission) that it was the mutual intention of Owners and Charterers that the broker beneficiary should not be entitled to avail himself of the facility of direct action by CRTPA. The Court found that inference ‚Äúentirely unsustainable‚Äù: it did not follow from the underlying trustee relationship that the parties had intended that Cleaves would not have been able to benefit from the (relatively) new statutory right under CRTPA instead of using the ‚Äúcumbrous fiction‚Äù of the earlier trust-based route. Accordingly, the Court decided that Cleaves was entitled to enforce the substantive term against Nisshin. =Whether Cleaves had a right to arbitrate the dispute= The Court's reasoning on this issue is difficult to understand and has been criticised by commentators.Hayton, J, 'Hijackers and Hostages: Arbitral Piracy after Nisshin v Cleaves' [2011] LMCLQ 565 In essence, the Court appears to have been persuaded by Cleaves‚Äô argument based on an analogy drawn in the Explanatory Notes to CRTPA (notes published by the Government to accompany an Act of Parliament and in this case similar to those published to accompany the Bill). Those Explanatory Notes suggested of s. 8 that: The Court decided that: The Court thus decided that Cleaves was bound (and thus entitled) to enforce the substantive term through the indicated process of arbitration. It found that the parties‚Äô expressions of mutual intent were ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù in this regard. The Court's decision on this issue is perhaps best treated with caution. It has been commented that the interpretation given to CRTPA by the Court appear to be wrong as a matter of interpretation and fails to afford sufficient prominence to the parties‚Äô autonomy to contract. Furthermore, it has been noted that if CRTPA is ambiguous in this respect, then the decision was taken in apparent ignorance of statements in Hansard, admissible under the rule in Pepper v Hart, which seem clearly to show that Parliament intended that it should be a matter for ordinary construction of the contract whether or not a third party should be entitled to enforce an arbitration agreement.

A former Communist bureaucrat and enterprise manager, Patsatsia led the Georgian cabinet, with Eduard Shevardnadze as Georgia's Head of State, during the years of civil strife and economic crisis. His appointment as Prime Minister was an attempt to placate the supporters of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, militarily ousted in 1992, as Patsatsia was from Zugdidi, the powerbase of Gamsakhurdia loyalists.Wheatley, Jonathan (2005), Georgia from National Awakening to Rose Revolution, pp. 77, 82, 100. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., After holding a seat in the Parliament of Georgia from 1995 to 1999, he has played no role in politics since then. Early life and career Patsatsia was born in the family of Ambako Patsatsia and Luba Patsatsia in the village of Ingiri, Zugdidi District in the Georgian SSR. Trained at the Leningrad Institute of Technology as an engineer, he became a Communist party functionary in Zugdidi, serving as the First Secretary of the local Communist Party Committee from 1955 until being sacked in 1965. In 1966 he became a Director of the Zugdidi Paper Factory, a large enterprise, which he led for nearly 25 years until 1990. In the last years of the Soviet Union, he was elected a Soviet People's Deputy from 1989 to 1990 and awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour.\\"Otar Patsatsia\\", in: The International Who's Who 2004, p. 1293. Routledge, Political career in independent Georgia In 1992, Eduard Shevardnadze ‚Äì a veteran Soviet politician who became Georgia's Head of State shortly after the violent overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia ‚Äì appointed Patsatsia as the head of Zugdidi district administration. Zugdidi was the principal powerbase of the Gamsakhurdia loyalists ‚Äì the \\"Zviadists\\" ‚Äì who continued their resistance, frequently with arms in hands, to the new regime and its undisciplined paramilitary groups. Shevardnadze's promotion of Patsatsia, a Zugdidi native with extensive ties with the local community, was an attempt to appease Gamsakhurdia's supporters. After the collapse of the government of Tengiz Sigua on August 5, 1993, Shevardnadze nominated Patsatsia as a new prime minister. He won approval in the parliament on August 20, 1993. He retained his post in the September 7, 1993 reshuffle of the cabinet. The two years of Patsatsia's tenure was marked by increasingly chaotic political environment, violent power struggles, military setback in the secessionist war in Abkhazia, a full-scale civil war with the pro-Gamsakhurdia forces, and severe economic crisis, followed by controversial economical and military agreements with Russia. He was no reformer and had a conservative view of economic development, for example, privatization.Dawisha, Karen & Parrott, Bruce (1997), Conflict, cleavage, and change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, p. 189. Cambridge University Press, Patsatsia resigned on October 5, 1995, to stand for the parliamentary election, in which he ran as a non-party candidate from Zugdidi and won a majoritarian seat for the next four years.Patsatsia Otar.

They missed the third round of the championship at Thruxton in order to fix the technical problems they had been experiencing with the new car in the opening rounds. The team returned at the following round at Oulton Park where they scored their best result of the season with fourteenth place in race two, but they were forced to miss the Croft round due to continuation of their power steering problems. The team raced again at Snetterton and then skipped the next two rounds before racing in the final two events of the year.

Paragon‚Äôs rate of interest was variable at its discretion. The Bank of England lowered its interest rate. Paragon did not ‚Äòpass on‚Äô the lower rate. Nash claimed that they were being made to pay substantially over the market rate of interest for secured loans, and were unable to find another lender because they had fallen into arrears. Mr & Mrs Nash argued that the interest rates were extortionate under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 section 138 (grossly exorbitant, grossly contravenes principles of fair trading; regard had to prevailing interest rates and risk). Judgment Dyson LJ held that the power to vary the interest rate at its discretion had to be exercised in a rational and honest way. This implied term was ‚Äònecessary in order to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties.‚Äô [36] and [42] However, in this case the bank was acting reasonably in protecting its interests. It was not grossly exorbitant. Nor was the term unfair under UCTA 1977 section 3(2)(b)(i), because part of the ‚Äòcontractual performance‚Äô was the discretion and its exercise was what could be reasonably expected.

Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent decided that the first targets of his military campaigns would be Rhodes and Belgrade, a place that his ancestor Mehmed the Conqueror (1451‚Äì1481) failed to conquer. Suleiman launched his army in mid-May 1521, and the main objective of this march was to conquer Belgrade. The Hungarian state was almost in disarray and unable to effectively counter the Ottoman army. Unlike previous campaigns, the Sultan decided this time that the main direction of attack was to go from the Sava. To do this, the Ottoman army first had to capture Srem, which was eventually done. Belgrade defenders persisted in resisting, but due to lack of manpower and war material, they had to surrender the city on 28/29 August 1521. The fall of Belgrade showed the inability of the Hungarian authorities to oppose the expansionist policies of the Ottoman Empire, which would show their supremacy in the Battle of Moh√°cs plains in 1526. After the defeat and breakdown of Hungary, the leader of the Christian struggle against the Ottoman penetration of Europe would become the Habsburg Monarchy, which would include Hungary. Belgrade would come under the rule of a Christian force only in 1688 when Maximilian Bavarian conquered it for Austria. When Selim I died, his son Suleiman became sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1520, on the other hand the Kingdom of Hungary was almost in ruins. The Hungarian nobility was divided into numerous parties, and without a strong central government it could not unite in defense of the country. King Louis II of Hungary was weakened by numerous conflicts. The lower nobility clashed with the higher nobility and court circles, and the Duke of Erdelj, John Zapotya, one of the wealthiest greats of his time, represented open opposition to the already weak regime of King Louis II.[1] The faction that supported the Duke of Erdel was in constant conflict with the court circles. The king himself was a powerless figure in the hands of his ambitious associates. He often did not have the money for his own existence. On such occasions, it was not possible to strengthen the defense system at the southern border and to undertake any military campaigns.

Built in 1906 for the New Zealand International Exhibition, it was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building. The building was damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and demolished on 9 April 2011. History Papanui Road, linking to Main North Road, was the traditional route for travellers from the north. Cobb and Co travelled north via Victoria Street and Papanui Road, and one of the first tram routes in Christchurch was built along this corridor. Carlton Hotel with February 2011 Christchurch earthquake damage The first hotel was built on the site in 1865, only 15 years after the organised settlement of Christchurch began by the Canterbury Association. Ward's Brewery commissioned architect Joseph Maddison to design a new hotel, to be opened in time for the International Exhibition that was held in Christchurch's Hagley Park from November 1906 to April 1907. Maddison also designed the buildings for the International Exhibition, which attracted nearly two million visitors at a time when New Zealand's population was only one million. The Carlton Hotel was the first place in New Zealand to serve beer on tap in 1939‚Äì1940, and it had the country's first beer garden in 1947. It opened New Zealand's first drive through bottle store in 1954. Burger King opened a fast food restaurant in September 1999 and took up much of the ground floor of the building. Carlton Hotel suffered damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, but remained open. It was heavily damaged in the subsequent earthquake on 22 February 2011, when part of the fa√ßade facing Papanui Road collapsed. Engineers found that the building was prone to failure in another strong aftershock, and it was demolished on 9 April 2011. The building's owner has replaced the building with a modern structure, but the new complex has been criticised as \\"unsympathetic\\". Heritage listing Carlton Hotel post demolition On 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number 1841. The building is recognised as an example of Maddison's work, who designed many hotel. It is located on a busy junction and regarded as a landmark. Due to several New Zealand firsts, it is an important part of the country's brewing industry. Its link to the International Exhibition is also of importance.

Facts A photograph developing shop, Photo Trade Processing Ltd, lost some snaps from a wedding. Its standard contract clause excluded liability for damages which exceeded the cost of the material itself. Judgment Clarke J held that the photo shop was liable to Woodman for the loss of the photographs, because other alternative sources of supply were not shown to be available nearby and the photo shop had not offered a service without the exclusion clause under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 sections 2(2) or 3. Other ways that the customer‚Äôs needs could be met were still relevant for this service contract through the reasonableness test under Schedule 2, even though its listing in Schedule 2 on the Act‚Äôs strict wording, are only relevant for supply of goods (sections 6 and 7). The Code of Practice agreed between the OFT and the Photographic Industry envisaged a two tiered service. And because the defendants did not provide a two-tiered service, one low risk higher fee and one high risk lower fee, they had not discharged their burden to persuade him the clause was reasonable. In the course of his judgment he referred to Peek v North Staffordshire Rly Co(1863) 10 HLCas 473, 493 where under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854 liability exclusion clauses were permitted that were ‚Äòjust and reasonable‚Äô. The clause excluded liability for loss to fragile goods unless they were declared insured according to value. Six to five, the Lords ruled that the clause was invalid because liability for mistake as well as negligence was excluded, the railway had a monopoly so customers had only the company‚Äôs terms, and only ‚Äòexorbitant‚Äô insurance was available.

It has since been replaced with the Award for Heroism. It was presented to employees of State, USAID and Marine guards assigned to diplomatic and consular facilities in recognition of acts of valor or outstanding performance under unusually difficult or dangerous circumstances, whether or not in connection with the performance of assigned duties. The award consisted of a gold medal set and a certificate signed by an assistant secretary, an official of equivalent rank or the Chief of Mission. The basic difference between the Award for Valor and the Award for Heroism is that the Valor Award was issued in 10K gold whereas the Heroism Award is issued in sterling silver. The ribbon reflects this; the designs are almost identical, but the color scheme indicates the precious metal issued with the respective awards. Criteria The following criteria were applicable to granting an Award for Valor: * Sustained superior performance while under threat of physical attack or harassment; or * An individual act of valor or exceptional performance at the risk of personal safety.

It has also been reported from northeastern India. This species lives in subtropical forests (mixed deciduous to evergreen) at elevations from above sea level. Taxonomy There are four recognized subspecies: * M. t. thibetana * M. t. esau * M. t. guiahouensis * M. t. huangshanensis Physical description The Tibetan macaque is the largest species of macaque and one of the largest monkeys found in Asia. Only the proboscis monkey and the larger species of gray langur come close to match their size among Asian monkeys. Males are the larger sex, commonly attain a weight of and length of Females, in contrast, weigh and measure long. The stump-like tail adds only , with females having a considerably shorter tail. The fur is well-suited to the species' cold environments being long, dense and brown on the back with creamy-buff to grey coloration on the underparts. Some adults are quite dark brown on the back, while others are basically a sandy yellowish-brown color. They have a prominent, pale-buff beard and long whiskers, but have a hairless face. The face is pale pinkish in males but is a more vivid, reddish-pink in females. The infants have silver-and-black fur that changes to its adult color at the age of two.Tibetan macaque videos, photos and facts ‚Äì Macaca thibetana . ARKive (2006-12-22). Retrieved on 2012-08-21. Male Tibetan Macaque.jpgMale Tibetan macaque. Female Tibetan Macaque.jpgFemale Tibetan macaque breastfeeding infant. Young Tibetan Macaque.jpgYoung Tibetan macaque. Behaviour The Tibetan macaque lives in mixed sex groups. In their complex social system, females remain for life in their natal group, but males disperse shortly after their adolescence (at about 8 years old). Macaque societies are hierarchical, with higher-ranking males getting better access to the resources, namely food and sexually-receptive females. Alpha males dominate the group, being those that are typically large, strong and newly mature. As they age, males tend to gradually lose their social standing and are frequently subject to challenges for dominance from other males. Such conflicts are frequently quite violent and males may kill each other in battle. Studies of Tibetan macaques at Mount Emei and Huangshan Mountains, China, found the average tenure for an alpha male only lasted about one year. When troop size becomes quite large (in the 40 to 50 range) and competition grows over increasingly stretched resources, some individuals (males, females and juveniles) split from the main group to form a new, smaller group, known as 'fissioning', and move on to a different home range. Usually, it is the lowest-ranking individuals that will split from the main group. Females first breed at around five years of age. The gestation period is six months with a single offspring being produced at each pregnancy. Most infants being born in January and February. Young macaques are nursed for a year and may continue to do so longer if the female does not give birth again the following year. Males of the group may also be involved in alloparenting care. This diurnal species spends most of its time on the ground, where it forages for leaves, fruit, grass and, to a lesser extent, flowers, seeds, roots and insects. When available, bamboo shoots, fruits and leaves are particularly favoured. Conservation This species is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN and is listed on Appendix II of the CITES list. Its main threats are all human- related. Principally, they are sensitive to habitat destruction, as they are tied closely to the forest. They are occasionally poisoned by herbicides and pesticides while eating and may catch diseases transmitted from humans. Illegal poaching may occur, with the flesh and the fur of the macaque being used.

The flood was, in part, due to high moisture levels in the soil from the previous year, which meant that further accumulation would threaten the flood-prone region. Flood predictors in Winnipeg were worried that a dual crest of both the Assiniboine River and the Red might crest at the city at the same time. Beginning around April 8, 50 homes were evacuated and two more were flooded after an ice jam in St. Andrews, Manitoba caused the river to flood over its banks. Three fatalities in the US were blamed on the flood by April 8. Through most of Southern Manitoba, the Red River crest level was below major floods of the past, including those of 1979 and 1950. When the river crested at the James Avenue pumping station in Winnipeg, north of the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, the measured open-water crest was 19.59 above datum. The high crest at the James Avenue pumping station was attributed largely to flooding of the Assiniboine River. Assiniboine flood The Assiniboine at Brandon, Manitoba reached the highest level ever recorded for the river. The 2011 Assiniboine River Flood was a 300-year flood. That year flood levels on the Red River were below those of 2009. Officials said that, if the flood controls had not been constructed in the 1960s and later along the Red and Assiniboine rivers near Winnipeg, the cresting water level would have amounted to the sixth-highest water levels ever recorded in the city. Higher levels were recorded in 1861, 2009, 1997, 1852, and 1826 (by order of highest level first in this list). Fatalities in US and Manitoba, Canada Three fatalities in the United States were blamed on the flood by 8 April. One man died while sandbagging in Fargo-Moorhead. The other two American men drowned in the Maple River when their boat capsized while they were hunting beavers.

Family background Robert Logan's father and grandfather were also called \\"Robert Logan of Restalrig\\". In 1547, his father, Robert Logan of Restalrig was first married to Margaret Seton, daughter of George Seton, 6th Lord Seton.HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling (London, 1878), p. 648 no. 18. His second wife was Agnes Gray, daughter of Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray. During the crisis of the Scottish reformation in 1559, this Robert Logan senior took his Leith followers to face the French troops of Henri Cleutin at Cupar Muir.Knox, John, Works: History of the Reformation, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 350-5. Later he advised against resistance at Leith by the Protestant Lords of the Congregation against the French troops of Mary of Guise, which led to a short-lived truce by the terms of the articles of Leith. After Robert Logan senior died, his widow Agnes Gray married Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home. Her son, Robert Logan of Restalrig (d. 1606) firstly married Elizabeth Makgill, daughter of David Makgill of Cranston-Riddell, then Jonet Ker and thirdly Marion Ker.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland: 1580-1593 (Edinburgh, 1888), nos. 436, 1014: Douglas, William, PSAS (1927), pp. 27-35.

A daughter was christened at Fast Castle in May 1590 attended by the Earl of Bothwell and Lord Home.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 297. =Logan properties= 19th-century engraving of Fast Castle, involved in Robert's plot to adbduct James VI of Scotland The Logan family lived at Lochend Castle near Restalrig, and others of the name had been Provost of Leith. In 1430, an ancestor, also called Sir Robert Logan (d. 1439), and his wife Dame Katherine founded the monastery of St Anthony which was near South Leith Parish Church with an outlying chapel at Arthur's Seat in Holyrood Park, which survives as a ruin.Roger, Charles, Historical Notices of St Anthony's Monastery, Leith and Reheasal of Events (Grampian Club, 1877), pp. 7, 28. Robert inherited Fast Castle and other lands near the border with England, as 'nephew' and heir of Elizabeth Martene, Lady Fastcastle, widow of Cuthbert Home who had fallen at Flodden Field. In the 1570s Robert was lord of half of the lands of Fastcastle, and Sir George Ogilvie of Dunlugus was lord of the other half. In 1597 he surrendered a number of lands and rights connected to Fast Castle (but not the Castle itself), which he had inherited from George Ogilvy of Dunlugus, to the Hume of Wedderburn family. The rights included the keeping of Berwick Castle, which had not been in Scottish hands since 1482.HMC Milne Home of Wedderburn (London, 1902), p. 64. Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, James VI of Scotland raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.HMC 5th report: Miss M. E. Stirling (London, 1878), p. 648 nos. 18, 24. Loyalties and the exiled Queen During the Scottish civil war in 1573, Robert Logan supported Mary, Queen of Scots by joining William Kirkcaldy of Grange in defending Edinburgh Castle in the Queen's name. On 29 July 1586, he wrote from Restalrig to Archibald Douglas in London, offering his service to Francis Walsingham. Logan conveyed letters secretly from England for the Master of Gray.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), nos. 312, 489. James VI had hoped that Archibald Douglas, a Scotsman resident in London, but not an accredited ambassador, might be able to intervene and save his mother from execution after the revelation of the Babington plot in 1586. The Master of Gray and Logan corresponded with Douglas on this unofficial diplomacy. The Master of Gray's letters show that he was reluctant to become involved in a project with such doubtful outcomes, but he sent Logan to Douglas in December 1586. After he returned to Fast Castle, Logan wrote back to Douglas on 25 February 1587. By now Mary had been executed and James VI was angry with Gray's actions, and Logan told Douglas not to write to Gray anymore: > \\"he wryt to me, desirenge me to wryt to your Lordship that ye shuld wryt no > moir to hem, for your letters doithe hem very muche harme, and he was no > thenge the wisar of your intelligens.

Logan and the Gowrie House affair Robert Logan was implicated in an alleged attempt to abduct James VI of Scotland by John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, at Perth on 4 August 1600, by the confession of George Sprot of Eyemouth. In 1608, after Robert Logan's death, Sprot confessed he had seen letters from Gowrie to Logan at Fast Castle and Gunnisgreen. Sprot understood from Logan's servant that if the king was successfully abducted, Logan would be rewarded with the gift of Dirleton Castle. Sprot described a letter signed \\"Restalrig\\" which he claimed was written by Robert Logan to Gowrie, which he had obtained from Logan's illiterate servant, James Bour of Auchencrow. Logan offered Gowrie and his brother the use of Fast Castle to settle their plot. He recommended that \\"the matter\\" be settled soon at the King's buck hunting. In this letter, Robert said the matter in hand was like a strange tale of a gentleman of Padua. George Sprot was hanged at the Market Cross of Edinburgh for foreknowledge of the conspiracy on 12 August 1608.Scott, Walter, ed., Secret History of the Court of James the First, vol. 2 (Ballantyne: Edinburgh, 1811), 118-135, reprinting Aulicus Coquinariae (1650). The story was doubted at the time, Sprot having first withdrawn his confession, John Spottiswoode who was present at Sprot's hanging thought his tale, \\"a meer invention of the man's own brain.\\" Spottiswoode did not think it likely that Gowrie would have plotted with Logan.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 150-152 footnote.

Its name derives from the fact that, by using a telephone line as a transmitter, it can work at an infinite distance, unlike other bugging devices that have only a finite signal range. The alternative name 'harmonica bug' refers to the fact that such devices were originally activated using the tone produced by a harmonica. Design of infinity transmitters has varied, according to developments in telephone systems. In some instances, the bug is activated after the target answers and hangs up their phone. In countries where there is a delay between connection and the first ring, the bug can be activated before the target phone rings, so that the infinity transmitter essentially 'answers' the call. In more advanced systems, the transmitter can be placed in a parallel telephone line to prevent the victim's phone line remaining engaged. As modern telephone lines no longer establish a voice path until the call is answered a variant of this now exists that uses CND, or caller ID. Usually an unusual sequence of non printing characters is used and thus will not show up on a display device. Sometimes the caller ID device itself has the bug but it can be nearly anywhere. In much the same manner a cellphone can be configured for silence on ring and auto answer and hidden, frequently placed inside something that has power available to maintain the battery. This allows the infinity transmitter to be hidden inside an automobile or other location where a land line is not an option.

Indonesia and Malaysia are two neighbouring nations that share similarities in many aspects. Both Malaysia and Indonesia have many common characteristic traits, including standard frames of reference in history, culture and religion. Although both countries are separate and independent states, there are also profoundly embedded similarities. Their national languages; Indonesian language and Malaysian language are closely related and mutually intelligible, both being standardised registers of Malay. The majority of the population of both nations were of Austronesian ancestry. Both nations are Muslim-majority countries, the founding members of ASEAN and APEC, and also members of the Non-Aligned Movement, Developing 8 Countries, United Nations, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The relationship between the two countries is generally friendly as they are tied by a common religion, language, proximity and cultural heritage that dates back centuries. At the same time however, both nations have been lurching from one diplomatic spat to another. Since independence Indonesia and Malaysia have moved in different directions in their social, economic, and political development, leading at times to severe bilateral tensions. The unequal pace of democratisation in the two countries over the last decades has made the relationship increasingly problematic. Malaysian government-controlled media has been restrained in reporting sensitive issues involving Indonesia. On the other hand, Indonesia's liberal mass media has played a key role in inflaming the tension. Indonesia has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur and consulates general in Johor Bahru, George Town, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching. Malaysia has an embassy in Jakarta and a consulates general in Medan, Pekanbaru and Pontianak.  History  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdul Halim with their wives in Istana Merdeka, Jakarta. The History of Indonesia and History of Malaysia were often intertwined. Throughout their history, the borders of ancient kingdoms and empires ‚Äì such as Srivijaya, Majapahit, Malacca, Aceh and Johor-Riau ‚Äì often comprised both modern-day countries. For centuries, the relations, migrations, and interactions between Indonesian and Malaysian people have been quite intense, and it is common for Malaysians to trace their relatives in Indonesia and vice versa. The Malays' homes are on both sides of the strait and also on coastal Borneo, while Dayak homelands are both in East Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Kalimantan. Some of the Indonesian origin ethnic groups such as Minang, Bugis, and Javanese had significant migration to Malaysia and formed significant communities in Malaysia. Negeri Sembilan, in particular, has large numbers of Minangkabau people. During the colonial era, the region was contested among European colonial powers, notably British and Dutch. From the 17th to early 19th century, various states, ports, and cities in the region were held as Dutch colonies or British possessions. The current borders between Indonesia and Malaysia were inherited from those established by the colonial powers through their treaties. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 and 1824 significantly shaped the territories of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and India. These treaties officially divided the archipelago into two: Malaya, which was ruled by the United Kingdom, and the Dutch East Indies, which was ruled by the Netherlands. The successor states of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies are Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively. The line that separated the spheres of influence between the British and the Dutch ultimately became the border between Indonesia and Malaysia. During World War II both British Malaya and Borneo together with the Dutch East Indies fell to the Japanese Empire. After the Japanese defeat, Indonesia declared its independence in 1945, followed a war of independence against Dutch until 1949. The British re-established their authority in Malaya, and their withdrawal two decades later meant the independence of the states of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. The diplomatic relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the Federation of Malaya were established promptly after Malaya's independence from Britain in 1957. President Yudhoyono and Prime Minister Najib Razak in Putrajaya. However, the relations between the two nations deteriorated under Indonesian President Sukarno in 1962 (see Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, see Indonesian withdrawal from the United Nations). The conflict resulted from Indonesian opposition to the formation of Malaysia, a merger of the Federation of Malaya with two former British colonies on Borneo: Sarawak and Sabah. The conflict has led to the termination of diplomatic relations on 17 September 1963. After the fall of Sukarno, relations between Indonesia and Malaysia were restored under President Suharto; as both parties agreed to normalise the bilateral relationship and pursued peaceful co-operation and partnership. The bilateral relations recovery process was started on 1 June 1966 when the foreign ministers of two nations signed the Bangkok Accord to end hostility and confrontation. Followed by Jakarta Accord signed on 11 August 1966 in Jakarta, marked the re-establishment of bilateral relations. In September 1967 Indonesian Liaison Office was opened in Kuala Lumpur, led to the establishment of Indonesian embassy. In 1967, both countries, together with the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, founded ASEAN to ensure the peace and stability in the region. Since the 1970s, under the Suharto and Mahathir administrations, both countries enjoy a relatively cordial and close relationship, stemmed from both proximity and serumpun (kinship) spirit. However, some diplomatic spats have occurred that at times put tensions on bilateral relations. These range from territorial disputes, treatment of migrant workers to accusations of cultural theft.  Territorial disputes  Most of the current borders were inherited from Dutch East Indies and British Malaya and Borneo colonial rule. Currently, both nations are in a territorial dispute over the oil-rich islands of Ambalat. Previously, they were over territorial disputes over the islands of Ligitan and Sipadan, which were won by Malaysia. The recent border disputes have arisen in Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea area mainly because of the disagreement on exact locations of maritime naval borders in these waters. Both parties involved in arresting and detaining their counterpart's officials and fishers accused of territorial breaching violations and illegal fishing. In August 2017, the Malaysian Insight claimed that according to an unnamed source, China would offer Malaysia advanced rocket launchers and a radar system to be based on the southern tip of the Southeast Asian country. Up to 12 units of the AR3 multiple-launch artillery rocket system (MLRS) will be offered to Malaysia in a purchase program with a loan period of 50 years. The AR3 has a maximum range of up to 280 kilometres, a distance which will place some parts of Indonesia within firing range. This was however denied by the Malaysian Armed Forces, citing they did not even receive any offers from China. The Chinese side also declined to comment on the report, saying \\"weapons exports were not part of its remit\\".  Migrant workers  Indonesian migrant workers (Indonesian: TKI abbreviation of Tenaga Kerja Indonesia) have become an important issue between both countries. From the 1980s to 1990s, Malaysia saw economic growth and development, industrialisation, and modernisation. With its large population and abundant workforce, Indonesian workers began to regard Malaysia as an attractive destination for work as a means of improving their economic situation. In 1997 both Indonesia and Malaysia were hit by a financial crisis that prompted the fall of the Indonesian Suharto regime. Large numbers of Indonesians lost their jobs, and Indonesian migrant workers began to pour into Malaysia. Indonesian migrant workers are plagued with issues such as poverty, human trafficking, abuse, and extortion. Approximately 300,000 domestic workers, most of them from Indonesia, are employed in Malaysia. Many work up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for wages of 400 to 600 ringgit (US$118‚Äì177) a month, and typically must turn over the first six to seven months of their salary to repay exorbitant recruitment fees. Some suffer physical or sexual violence from employers. In 2009, Indonesia stopped sending domestic workers to Malaysia until both countries agreed on how to protect them. Indonesia resumed sending migrant workers to Malaysia in December 2011 after both countries signed a memorandum of understanding about worker protection in April of that year.  Culture  Centre for Education and Culture of the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in Kuala Lumpur. Because of many similarities and shared cultures between Indonesia and Malaysia‚Äîalso because of significant numbers of Indonesian-origin immigrants in today's Malaysian demographic‚Äîboth countries are often involved in disputes over cultural claims of the origin. Through an intensive tourism campaign, Malaysia has featured some famous cultural icons, namely the song Rasa Sayange, batik, shadow puppet theatre and barongan (reog) dance. This tourism promotion and cultural campaigns had alarmed and upset Indonesians who always thinks that these arts and cultures belong to them. As the reaction, many Indonesians felt the need to safeguard their cultural legacies, and to the extreme developed the anti-Malaysia sentiments. In 2009, the Pendet controversy fuelled again the cultural disputes among neighbours. The advertisement promoting Discovery Channel's programme \\"Enigmatic Malaysia\\" featured Balinese Pendet dancer which it incorrectly showed to be a Malaysian dance. Disputes over the origins of a variety of dishes found in both countries is also a perpetual issue, from rendang to lumpia (popiah). The claims to an extent also overlap with neighbouring Singapore. Despite the dispute never leading to a severe confrontation between the two countries, and politicians of both sides having even acknowledged it as \\"petty\\", in Indonesia however, an activist group held a demonstration in front of the Malaysian Embassy in Jakarta to protest the origin of the dish, lumpia in February 2015. On the other hand, the shared language and culture have their own benefits on connecting the people of both countries. For example, various Indonesian music, films and sinetrons are popular in Malaysia. Numerous Indonesian bands and musicians have their fan-base in Malaysia and often performed some concerts in Malaysia. Vice versa, Malaysian singers such as Sheila Majid and Siti Nurhaliza are beloved and popular in Indonesia. Malaysian animation Upin & Ipin with deep Malay culture had also gained wide popularity and appeal among Indonesian children and families. However, this cultural exchange is not always appreciated; the overwhelming popularity of Indonesian music in Malaysia had alarmed the Malaysian music industry. In 2008, the Malaysian music industry demanded the restriction of Indonesian songs on Malaysian radio broadcasts. Additionally, the two nations are fierce rivals in international association football. Competitive matches between the Indonesian and Malaysian team are famed for their enormous turnout and intense atmosphere, whether the tie is held in Malaysia or Indonesia.  Environment  The slash and burn practice to clear the lands for palm plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan were causing haze and smoke fog that blown northwards by wind and had reached Malaysia and Singapore. The haze occurs in 1997, 2005, 2006, and reached the highest haze pollutant levels in June 2013. The haze is hazardous for health and dangerous for transportation, especially flight safety in the region. The trans-border haze problems have strained diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia, and also with Singapore. The Malaysian and Singaporean government had noted their protest and urged the Indonesian government to reduce the hot-spots. In the peak of the haze that usually occur during dry season, Malaysian and Singaporean offer assistance to put off the fires. The Indonesian government had banned the slash and burn practice. however, the method was still widely used to clear palm oil plantation lands. Another important environmental issue is trans border illegal logging. The Indonesian government has expressed the concern that many rain forests along Indonesia‚ÄîMalaysia borders in Borneo were suffering illegal logging, mostly done by Malaysian loggers. The concern was aroused because Malaysian authorities seem to be doing nothing to prevent the crime and even seems to be encouraging this practice to increase Malaysian timber yield.  Media  Malaysians expressed their concern that media in Indonesia seems to encourage and foster anti-Malaysia sentiments through distorted news coverage, exaggerations, and blowing the issues beyond the proportions. Malaysian government concerned about anti-Malaysia sentiments, protest and aggressive actions of certain extremists amid the bilateral spats over a Balinese dance and the mistreatment of Indonesian housemaids in Malaysia. Malaysia government also stated had run out of patience and sent a protest letter to Indonesia after a demonstration triggered by a maritime dispute. On the other hand, Indonesian media has accused the government-controlled media in Malaysia of presenting negative opinions and poor images on Indonesia and Indonesian people as the political agenda to prevent the Indonesian reformation and democratic movement from spilling beyond its borders. The government of Indonesia also had sent the notes of protest for Malaysian media on using the term Indon to refer for Indonesia and Indonesian people that considered as derogatory.  Education  As of December 2012, about 6,000 Malaysians are studying in Indonesia while about 14,000 Indonesians are studying in Malaysia.  Trade and economy  Malaysian companies that are investing in Indonesia are Maybank, CIMB, Petronas, Tabung Haji, Proton Holdings and Sime Darby, as stated by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in his message to Malaysians in Indonesia while he and the Raja Permaisuri Agong were on a state visit to Indonesia in December 2012. Both countries are actively pursuing subregional economic co- operation to develop trans-border economic zones and free-trade areas that could generate a regional economy, such as Sijori (Singapore-Johor-Riau) on the west and BIMP-EAGA in the east region. In December 2017, both countries alongside Thailand launched a framework to allow the use of local currencies in settlement of trade between them. In 2017, Indonesia was Malaysia's seventh-largest source of imports, while Malaysia was Indonesia's fourth- largest source of imports. The 2017 data from the World Bank indicated that Malaysia had a positive balance of trade with Indonesia of around 600 million US dollars.  Tourism  Malacca Gallery in Jakarta. Because of their proximity, travellers from both countries are an essential source of visitors that generates the travel and tourism industry. Indonesians are the second- largest visitors to Malaysia, reaching 2,548,021 visitors in 2013. On the other hand, Malaysians are also the second-largest visitors to Indonesia, reaching 1,302,237 travellers in 2011. The top visitors of both countries are Singaporean visitors. Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and Penang are popular destinations for Indonesian travellers, and vice versa Bandung, Medan and Bukittinggi are particularly famous among Malaysian tourists.

In the 380s, Theodosius I reiterated the ban of Constantine the Great on animal sacrifices, prohibited haruspicy on pain of death, pioneered the criminalization of magistrates who did not enforce anti-pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed pagan temples. Between 389 and 391 he issued the \\"Theodosian decrees,\\" which established a practical ban on paganism;Theodosian Code (Book 16, Title. 10, .11) visits to the temples were forbidden, the remaining pagan holidays were abolished, the sacred fire in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum was extinguished as the Vestal Virgins were disbanded, and auspices and witchcraft were deemed punishable offenses. Theodosius refused to restore the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, as requested by pagan Senators. In 392 he became emperor of the whole empire (the last one to be so). From this moment until the end of his reign in 395, while pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration, he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire in actions by Christians against major pagan sites. He issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any public pagan ritual, and was particularly oppressive of Manicheans. He is likely to have suppressed the Ancient Olympic Games, whose last record of celebration is 393. Initial tolerance (379‚Äì381) Theodosius I was relatively tolerant towards pagans in the early part of his reign,Theodosian Code 12.1.112. since he needed the support of the influential pagan ruling class and the percentage of non-Christians in the general population was still quite large, perhaps 50% overall. This was especially true in the West, where the Church was still largely an urban phenomenon except in North Africa. He voiced his support for the preservation of temples or pagan statues as useful public buildings. He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign. For example, he appointed the pagan Eutolmius Tatianus as the praetorian prefect of Egypt. Theodosius I's relative tolerance for other religions is also indicated by his later order (in 388) for the reconstruction of a Jewish synagogue at Callinicum in Mesopotamia. Theodosius dealt harshly with Arians, heretics and Christian apostates.Theodosian Code 16.7.1, 1.7.2, 16.7.2, 16.7.3, 16.7.4, 16.7.5. Later in his reign, he tried to stamp out the last vestiges of paganism with great severity.. However, he did not succeed in this. Even though deprived of State and municipal support, bereft of funds and property the followers of the old religions continued to survive visibly, though under pressure and weakening, into the early 6th century. Persecution =First attempts to inhibit paganism (381‚Äì388)= His first attempt to inhibit paganism was in 381 when he reiterated Constantine's ban on sacrifice. In 384 he prohibited haruspicy on pain of death, and unlike earlier anti-pagan prohibitions, he made non-enforcement of the law by magistrates a crime. Both Theodosius and Valentinian II formally recognized Maximus in the year 384. For a time, the pagans enjoyed religious liberty once again and many distinguished pagans rose to important offices in the state. The fact that the temples continued to be cared for and that pagan festivals continued to be celebrated is indicated by a law of 386, which declared that care for the temples and festivals were the exclusive prerogative of the pagans.Theodosian Code (Book 12, Title. 1, .112) This law also confirms the right of the priests to perform the traditional pagan rites of the temples. In the year 387, Theodosius declared war on Maximus after Maximus had driven Valentinian II out of Italy. Maximus was defeated and executed and the anti-pagan regulations of Gratian were apparently reinstated by Valentinian II. In 388 he sent a prefect to Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor with the aim of breaking up pagan associations and the destruction of their temples. The Serapeum at Alexandria was destroyed during this campaign.Socr., V, 16 =Theodosian decrees (389‚Äì391)= In a series of decrees called the \\"Theodosian decrees\\" he progressively declared that those pagan feasts that had not yet been rendered Christian ones were now to be workdays (in 389). In 391, he reiterated the ban of blood sacrifice and decreed \\"no one is to go to the sanctuaries, walk through the temples, or raise his eyes to statues created by the labor of man\\". (decree \\"Nemo se hostiis polluat\\", Codex Theodosianus xvi.10.10). Also in the year 391, Valentinian II which was emperor in the West under the aegis of Theodosius, under the advice of Ambrose issued a law that not only prohibited sacrifices but also forbade anyone from visiting the temples.Theodosian Code 16.10.10 This again caused turbulence in the West. Valentinian II quickly followed this law with a second one, which declared that pagan temples were to be closed, a law that was viewed as practically outlawing paganism.Theodosian Code 16.10.11 The emperor Theodosius, who had been reigning in the East, had been relatively tolerant towards pagans in the early part of his reign. Theodosius dealt harshly with Arians, heretics and Christian apostates. Laws were directed against Christians who sought to convert back to the old religions and against private divination.Theodosian Code 16.10.7, 16.10.9, 9.16.11, 9.38.7, 9.38.8. He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign. For example, he appointed the pagan Tatianus as the praetorian prefect of Egypt. His tolerance for other religions is indicated by his 388 order for the reconstruction of a Jewish synagogue at Callinicum in Mesopotamia, which had been destroyed by a bishop and his Christian flock. After the death of Maximus, Valentinian II, under the aegis of Theodosius, once again assumed the office of emperor in the West. Valentinian II, advised by Ambrose, and in spite of pleas from the pagans, refused to restore the Altar of Victory to the Senate House, or their income to the priests and Vestal Virgins.. Valentinian was murdered, possibly by agents of Arbogast whom he had tried to dismiss, and Eugenius, a professor of rhetoric, was proclaimed emperor.. The ancestral religious rites were once again performed openly and the Altar of Victory was restored.. Saint Ambrose and Emperor Theodosius, Anthony van Dyck. The temples that were thus closed could be declared \\"abandoned\\", as Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria immediately noted in applying for permission to demolish a site and cover it with a Christian church, an act that must have received general sanction, for mithraea forming crypts of churches, and temples forming the foundations of 5th century churches appear throughout the former Roman Empire. By decree in 391, Theodosius ended the subsidies that had still trickled to some remnants of Greco-Roman civic paganism too. In 394 the eternal fire in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum was extinguished, and the Vestal Virgins were disbanded. Taking the auspices and practicing witchcraft were to be punished. When pagan members of the Senate in Rome appealed to him to restore the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, he refused. The apparent change of policy that resulted in the \\"Theodosian decrees\\" has often been credited to the increased influence of Ambrose, bishop of Milan. In 390 Ambrose had excommunicated Theodosius, thereafter he had greater influence with a penitent Theodosius. Only after what is commonly known as the \\"massacre\\" of Thessalonica (in 390) was Ambrose able to gain influence with Theodosius. Ambrose accomplished this by excommunicating Theodosius and thereby forcing him to obey him. Ambrose had a council of the Church condemn this act. Theodosius submitted himself to Ambrose and agreed to do penance. Theodosius' penance apparently included his promise to adopt a new role as the champion of the Christian faith. The excommunication was due to Theodosius orders which resulted in the massacre of 7,000 inhabitants of Thessalonica,. in response to the assassination of his military governor stationed in the city, and that Theodosius performed several months of public penance. Some modern historians question the consequences of the laws against pagans.R. Malcolm Errington, \\"Christian Accounts of the Religious Legislation of Theodosius I\\" (1997) 79:2 Klio 398. The specifics of the decrees were superficially limited in scope, specific measures in response to various petitions from Christians throughout his administration. The punishment for venerating man-made pagan images was the forfeiture of an individual's house. An individual's punishment for sacrificing in temples or shrines was a fine of twenty-five pounds of gold. In the year 391 in Alexandria in the wake of the great anti-pagan riots \\"busts of Serapis which stood in the walls, vestibules, doorways and windows of every house were all torn out and annihilated..., and in their place the sign of the Lord's cross was painted in the doorways, vestibules, windows and walls, and on pillars.\\". =War on paganism by Theodosius (392‚Äì395)= Rome was more pagan than Christian up until the 390s; Gaul, Spain and northern Italy, in all but the urban areas, were pagan, save Milan which remained half pagan. In the year 392, Theodosius become Emperor of also the western part of the Roman Empire, the last emperor to rule over both. In the same year he officially began to proscribe the practice of paganism. This was when he authorized the destruction of many temples throughout the empire.Grindle, Gilbert (1892) The Destruction of paganism in the Roman Empire, pp. 29‚Äì30: 'For example, Theodosius ordered Cynegius (Zosimus 4.37), the praetorian prefect of the East, to permanently close down the temples and forbade the worship of the deities throughout Egypt and the East. Most of the destruction was perpetrated by Christian monks and bishops...' Actions against major pagan sites Theodosius participated in actions by Christians against major pagan sites: the destruction of the gigantic Serapeum by soldiers in 391, according to the Christian sources authorized by Theodosius (extirpium malum) needs to be seen against a complicated background of less spectacular violence in the city: Eusebius mentions street-fighting in Alexandria between Christians and non- Christians as early as 249, and non-Christians had participated in the struggles for and against Athanasius in 341 and 356. \\"In 363 they killed Bishop George for repeated acts of pointed outrage, insult, and pillage of the most sacred treasures of the city.\\" In 391 riots broke out between supporters of Theodosius's Imperial Prefect and the supporters of the independent Patriarch of Alexandria as to who really governed in Alexandria; the rioters opposing the Patriarch took refuge in the Serapeum and used it as a fortress; when order was restored the prefect ordered it demolished so future rioters could not use it for the same purpose. In 386, Libanius appealed without success to emperor Theodosius to prevent the destruction of a temple in Edessa, and pleaded for toleration and the preservation of the temples against the ongoing attacks of Christian monks, who he claimed: :\\"hasten to attack the temples with sticks and stones and bars of iron, and in some cases, disdaining these, with hands and feet. Then utter desolation follows, with the stripping of roofs, demolition of walls, the tearing down of statues and the overthrow of altars, and the priests must either keep quiet or die. After demolishing one, they scurry to another, and to a third, and trophy is piled on trophy, in contravention of the law. Such outrages occur even in the cities, but they are most common in the countryside. Many are the foes who perpetrate the separate attacks, but after their countelss crimes this scattered rabble congregates and they are in disgrace unless they have committed the foulest outrage...Temples, Sire, are the soul of the countryside: they mark the beginning of its settlement, and have been passed down through many generations to the men of today. In them the farming communities rest their hopes for husbands, wives, children, for their oxen and the soil they sow and plant. An estate that has suffered so has lost the inspiration of the peasantry together with their hopes, for they believe that their labour will be in vain once they are robbed of the gods who direct their labours to their due end. And if the land no longer enjoys the same care, neither can the yield match what it was before, and, if this be the case, the peasant is the poorer, and the revenue jeopardized.\\"Pro Templis (Oration XXX.8-10) Suppression of pagan rituals, religio illicita Theodosius issued a comprehensive law that prohibited the performance of any type of pagan sacrifice or worship..Theodosian Code 16.10.12 Theodosius prohibited imperial palace officers and magistrates from honoring their Lares with fire, their Genius with wine, or their Penates with incense. Theodosius also prohibited the practice of all forms of divination, even those forms of divination that were not considered harmful to the welfare of the Emperor, with this wide-ranging law. The laws were particularly hard against the Manicheans who were deprived of the right to make wills or to benefit from them. Manicheans could be sought out by informers, brought to court and in some cases executed.. Paganism was now proscribed, a \\"religio illicita\\". Suppression from 393 till 395 In 393, Theodosius was ready to begin his war against Eugenius and Arbogastes. The battle that ensued became, in essence, a battle for the survival of paganism. The defeat of Eugenius by Theodosius in 394 led to the final separation of paganism from the state. Theodosius visited Rome to attempt to convert the pagan members of the Senate. Being unsuccessful in this, he withdrew all state funds that had been set aside for the public performance of pagan rites. From this point forward, state funds would never again be made available for the public performance of pagan rites nor for the maintenance of the pagan temples. Despite this setback on their religion, the pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration.Symmachus Relatio 3. Many pagans simply pretended to convert as an obvious instrument of advancement. Theodosius was not the man to sympathise with the balancing policy of the Edict of Milan. He set himself steadfastly to the work of establishing Nicene Christianity as the privileged religion of the state, of repressing dissident Christians (heretics) and of enacting explicit legal measures to abolish paganism in all its phases. Examples of the destruction of pagan temples in the late fourth century, as recorded in surviving texts, are: * Martin of Tours' attacks on holy sites in Gaul,. * the destruction of temples in Syria by Marcellus, * the destruction of temples and images in, and surrounding, Carthage, * the ruination of the temple at Delphi, * the desecration of the mystery cult in Eleusis, * the Patriarch Theophilus who seized and destroyed pagan temples in Alexandria,. * the levelling of all the temples in Gaza * and the wider destruction of holy sites that spread rapidly throughout Egypt. This is supplemented in abundance by archaeological evidence in the northern provinces (for which written sources hardly survive) exposing broken and burnt out buildings and hastily buried objects of piety. The leader of the Egyptian monks who participated in the sack of temples replied to the victims who demanded back their sacred icons: \\"I peacefully removed your gods... there is no such thing as robbery for those who truly possess Christ.\\" After the last Ancient Olympic Games in 393, it is believed that either Theodosius I, or his grandson Theodosius II in AD 435, suppressed them. In the official records of the Roman Empire, the reckoning of dates by Olympiads soon came to an end. Subsequently, Theodosius portrayed himself on his coins holding the labarum. According to a Christian historian \\"Paganism was now dead\\", though pagans survived and would continue to do so for another three centuries, mainly outwith the towns - \\"rustics chiefly ‚Äî pagani.\\" Edward Gibbon wrote: \\"The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws was attracted within the pale of the Catholic Church: and so rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of paganism that only twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator.\\" Despite the pleas of many pagans for tolerance, Honorius and Arcadius continued the work of their father by enacting more anti-paganism policies.

Vardoulis promoted the visionary plan for toll roads in 1980, which have now been nearly completed. He recently proposed a concept for an 11-mile transportation tunnel under the Cleveland National Forest that would connect the 133 Toll Road in Orange County to the I-15 Freeway in Riverside County. The roadways would actually include three tunnels which could also carry rail traffic, a water transmission line, high- voltage transmission cables and other uses. Transportation agencies in Orange and Riverside Counties have done preliminary review of the concept and have put it on hold due to the potentially high cost at this point.

Traditionally, and in B. K. S. Iyengar's Light on Yoga, Malasana, or Garland Pose, is used for a different squatting pose with the feet together and the back rounded with multiple hand placement variations. When the hands are bound around the back this pose is also called Kanchyasana (\\"golden belt pose\\"). In the West, the name Malasana is also used for the \\"regular squat pose\\", also called upavesasana, in which the hand palms are folded together in the so- called namaskar mudra in front of the chest, and the feet are set wider apart. In the Sritattvanidhi, the name Malasana is given to bhujapidasana, the \\"shoulder press\\", in which the palms are placed on the ground, the body balancing on the hands, and the legs resting on the shoulders.  Etymology  The name Malasana is from the Sanskrit ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ mƒÅlƒÅ, a garland, necklace, or rosary; and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana, seat or posture. According to Iyengar, the name derives from the arms \\"hanging from the neck like a garland.\\"  Description and variants  The name malasana is used for four different asanas: = Upavesasana = Upavesasana The name malasana is sometimes used in the West for the \\"regular squat pose,\\" Upave≈õƒÅsana, in which the palms of the hands are folded together in A√±jali MudrƒÅ (prayer posture) in front of the chest, and the feet are set apart. Yoga Journal states that Malasana stretches the ankles, groins and back, and tones the belly, but cautions about using the asana when there are lower back or knee injuries. A variant of this pose, Prapadasana, has the heels together and the feet on tiptoe. = Malasana I/Kanchyasana = In the first variant, also called Kanchyasana (\\"golden belt pose\\"), the feet are together with the arms wrapped around the back, while the chin touches the floor. = Malasana II = In the second variant, the hands wrap around the heels, and touches the floor with the chin. = Bhujapidasana = Bhujapidasana The Sritattvanidhi, a 19th-century book on a number of subjects including asanas, gives a different picture for Malasana in his plate 44.

The B.E.4 and B.E.7 were virtually identical aircraft that differed only in the engine fitted. Design and development In December 1911, the Royal Aircraft Factory started work of a new biplane of similar layout to its B.E.1 and B.E.2, but powered by a rotary engine to allow comparison with the water-cooled and air-cooled V8 engine powered B.E.1 and B.E.2.Bruce 1982, p. 370. Detailed design of the new aircraft was the responsibility of John Kenworthy, who drew up plans for a two-bay biplane with wings similar to those of the B.E.2, but more heavily staggered. Lateral control was by means of wing warping, while the fuselage, which was wider than that of the B.E.1 and 2 to accommodate the rotary engine, was mounted between but clear of the upper and lower wings.Hare 1990, p. 164. Two aircraft were built in early 1912, numbered B.E.3 and B.E.4, but as at the time the Royal Aircraft Factory was forbidden from building aircraft, the two aircraft were officially rebuilds of a Paulhan biplane and a Bristol Boxkite respectively, but the only parts reused were the engines.Bruce 1982, pp. 370‚Äì371. First to fly was the B.E.3, powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome Omega engine, on 3 May 1912 with Geoffrey de Havilland at the controls. Testing was sufficiently successful for de Havilland to take several passengers up in the B.E.3 later that day, and the aircraft was delivered to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on 13 May 1912.Hare 1990, p. 165. The B.E.4, also initially powered by a 50 hp Gnome, flew on 24 June that year, and was handed over to the RFC on 8 August. It was re-engined with a 70 hp Gnome in September 1912.Hare 1990, pp. 167‚Äì168. At least two, and possibly three more similar aircraft powered by 50 hp Gnomes were built in late 1912‚Äìearly 1913 by private contractors.Bruce 1982, p. 373. Kenworthy modified the design to allow fitting of a more powerful (140 hp (104 kW)) two-row Gnome engine, which was built as the B.E.7, flying for the first time on 28 February 1913.Hare 1990, p. 171. The final development of the rotary engined B.E. types was the B.E.8/8a types of 1914/15. Operational history The B.E.3 and B.E.4, allocated the serial numbers 203 and 204 became part of the inventory of No. 3 Squadron RFC, with the B.E.3, nicknamed \\"Goldfish\\", being used for various trials, including air- to-ground signalling with both radio and lights.Bruce 1982, pp. 371‚Äì372. Two more aircraft (serial numbers 416 and 417 were delivered to the Central Flying School in December 1912, while serial number 303, which may have been similar, was delivered to No. 4 Squadron in January 1913, although wrecked in a crash in February that year.Bruce 1982, p. 373. The B.E.7 was also taken on charge by the Central Flying School, serving until November 1913, at which time its engine bearers were found to be damaged by the heat of its exhaust fumes. 204 crashed on Salisbury Plain on 11 March 1914 when its rudder failed, possibly due to metal fatigue, killing its crew of two. To avoid similar failures, the remaining aircraft were fitted with modified tails based on that fitted to the H.R.E.2, this allowing the Central Flying School aircraft to remain in use until the summer of 1914.Hare 1990, pp. 168‚Äì169.Bruce 1982, p. 374.

The book parodies what Beckford considered sensationalist writing, as well as political issues of the time.Beckford, William. Azemia, back cover. Valancourt Books, Missouri. 2010  Plot  = Volume I = *Chapter 1- We learn that Azemia is the 45th daughter of Hamet- beig, who is the leader of a harem and does not know his daughter very well. She is very close with her grandmother, Birkabeba, though. We also find out that Azemia's betrothed, Oglow, has sent for her to join him in Marseilles. She leaves immediately and is accompanied by Muzzled-Abib. On the third day of her journey, Azemia's ship is attacked and Captain Wappingshot holds her and Muzzled-Abib prisoner. *Chapter 2- Captain Wappingshot leaves Muzzled-Abib on Barbary Coast. *Chapter 3- Charles Arnold, a ship hand, discovers Azemia and instantly falls in love with her and writes a poem. They arrive in England. *Chapter 4- Charles attempts to convey his love to Azemia but she does not understand English so he uses his eyes and she understands. She loves him too because he is the only friendly face she has seen thus far. Mrs. Periwinkle and her daughter Miss Sally agree to take Azemia under their care. *Chapter 5- The narrator (under the pretense that the narrator is a woman) digresses and muses how women can be good writers if the criteria is that they have to understand themselves if men are not even very good at that. The narrator then goes on to promise the reader not to write about slavery so as not to offend the slaves and also to show the proper respect for nobles. *Chapter 6- Mrs. Periwinkle attempts to introduce Azemia to the Duke that employs her. However, the Duke takes sick with the gout and Azemia is forced to stay with Lady Belinda, one of the Duke's close friends. *Chapter 7- Wildcodger proposes to hang painting of food to make the hungry feel full and houses so the homeless will feel as though they have shelter. *Chapter 8- Reverend Solomon Sheepend is introduced and Miss Ironside sets out to teach Azemia how to speak English. *Chapter 9-A feud between Reverend Solomon who writes poetry in blank verse and Iphanissa who writes Italian sonnets is discussed. *Chapter 10- Reverend Solomon has become very fond of Azemia and wishes to marry her. However, he learns that he must convert her to Christianity if this is to be possible. He writes a 3,996 line poem to show his love, it goes relatively unnoticed. Also, Miss Ironside becomes upset with Azemia for allegedly seducing her nephew, Reverend Solomon. Mrs. Blandford takes Azemia because she reminds Mrs. Blandford of her deceased daughter. Mrs. Blandford finishes teaching Azemia English.  Story of Another Blue Beard  Mr. Grimshaw is the Esquire of a manor who is very cruel to his subordinates and especially wife. His current wife attempts to escape from his manor by the help of the ghost of deceased wife but her plan is thwarted and she is held captive. Mr. Grimshaw throws Mrs. Grimshaw in the dungeon for over a year sometimes going days with only bread and water. On a second attempt at escape, Mrs. Grimshaw meets an old family friend, Mr. Auberry, who had come to check on her well-being. Mr. Auberry learns of her misfortunes but cannot help her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Grimshaw learns that the ghost is Gertrude Grimshaw and that Mr. Grimshaw had killed her and her brother so they now walk the castle at midnight (the time of their deaths). Finally, Mrs. Grimshaw escapes with the help of the ghosts and Mr. Auberry who she then marries. = Volume II = *Chapter 1- The main story line is resumed and the reader finds that Revered Solomon is in deep mourning because he loves Azemia and she is not in his possession. *Chapter 2-Azemia is in the midst of a get together with Mr. Gallstone, Sir Baptist Bamboozle, Mrs. Albuzzi, and Dr. Prose. Mrs. Albuzzi mentions a servant of Azemia's but Mrs. Albuzzi neglects to elaborate and it is never brought up again. *Chapter 3-Due to the fact that Azemia is foreign, Mrs. Blandford's social standing is elevated amongst her cultivated friends. Mrs. Blandford hosts a dinner party. *Chapter 4-Azemia comments on the hypocrisy of the British women by saying that, with very few exceptions, they do ‚Äúnothing but find fault in each other.‚Äù *Chapter 5-Charles Arnold along with his servant, Bat, is travelling back to see Azemia after a year at sea. *Chapter 6-Azemia enters a dark, black mausoleum.

Azemia is followed by a man who she finds very annoying. The man is revealed to be Mr. Perkly, a childhood friend of Charles Arnold. *Chapter 9-Mrs. Blandford, Azemia, and Mr. Perkly are riding back home in Mr. Perkly's carriages. They are stopped when the driver of Azemia and Mrs. Blandford's cart is missing a lynchpin. They notice a small cabin and attempt to take rest there but discover that the inhabitants are stricken by extreme poverty and are dying of malnutrition. Mrs. Blandford is horrified by their predicament and hires a nurse and an apothecary to come to their aide. Mrs. Blandford and Mr. Perkly also have a heated discussion about moral and economic issues dealing with the poor, Mrs. Blandford finds Mr. Perkly's views to be cold and moronic. *Chapter 10- Mrs. Blandford leaves Azemia alone because she is called upon by an ailing friend in London. Mr. Perkly visits the house while she is away but is sent off by Azemia. Mrs. Blandford sends for Azemia to come to London but Azemia's coach takes her through a dark forest and eventually back to the Duke's manor and Miss Sally. It is then apparent that the Duke instructed Mr. Perkly to befriend Azemia and Mrs. Blandford so as to seize Azemia when the opportunity arose. *Chapter 11-After a few weeks with Azemia under his care, the Duke falls madly in love with her. The Duke takes leave of his manor on business and leaves Azemia mostly unattended. She uses this opportunity to walk about the grounds late at night. While on one of her walks, Azemia is captured by three ruffians who are torturing rabbits. *Chapter 12-Azemia is being led to a deserted cabin when they cross a road and a gun fight ensues between the lead ruffian and an oncoming traveler.

Authorship  Beckford attempted to solidify the identity of Azemia‚Äôs false author, Jacquette Agenta Mariana Jenks, by including a rather flowery letter of dedication ‚ÄúTo the Right Honourable Lady Harriet Marlow‚Äù, which presents the novel as an ‚Äúinferior production‚Äù being given to Lady Marlow by an admiring fan.Beckford, William.

Azemia, p. 7-8.

Azemia, p. 7. Valancourt Books, Missouri. 2010  Critical reviews  Azemia received mixed reviews, but a general trend among reviewers was to rave about the poetic prowess while expressing disdain for the prose itself. For example, The Critical Review states plainly, ‚Äúthe satirical poetry in this work is preferable to the prose‚Äù, while other publications such as British Review glorify the poetry as ‚Äúwell, and even happily executed.‚Äù British Critic, London, 10 (1797:Oct.) p.43 Many reviews seemed to recognize the capability of the author, and claimed regret that his talents were used in such an inferior fashion, as in the Lady's Monthly Museum profile of Beckford. Their article supports his aim ‚Äúto hold up to ridicule the flimsy narrative of those affected scribblers whose volumes loaded the shelves of our circulating libraries‚Äù.Lady's Monthly Museum, or, Polite repository of amusement and instruction, 19 (1824:Feb.) p.71 They too, however, express regret as his having wasted his time and talent on such an endeavor. In fact, Beckford himself acknowledges its position in Azemia's ‚ÄúAddress‚Äù Beckford, William. Azemia, p. 7. Valancourt Books, Missouri. 2010 Despite disappointment in the work as a whole, the Monthly Review went so far as to claim the work as ‚Äúunder the direction of GENIUS‚Äù and that its quality, though perhaps not superior, to be still ‚Äúacceptable to many readers‚Äù.Monthly Review, 24 (1797:Nov.) p.338 The same review hails \\"Azemia\\" as \\"‚Äúan entertaining compound of good taste and good writing,- just satire and whimsical fancy\\".

With an apparent magnitude of 7.09, the system is not visible to the naked eye but may be viewed with a pair of binoculars. Based on parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft, the system is some 810 light years (250 parsecs) away from Earth. HD 181068 is in the Kepler spacecraft's field of view, and its unique properties were first observed by the satellite's photometer. It consists of a red giant, designated HD 181068 A, along with two main-sequence stars, designated HD 181068 Ba and HD 181068 Bb, respectively. Normal eclipsing binaries have two components that pass in front of each other while eclipsing. However, all three components of HD 181068 orbit each other in such a way that they eclipse each other, forming a rare triply eclipsing system. The primary, HD 181068 A, has a spectral type of G8III, meaning it is a red giant that has used up its core hydrogen and has expanded to a radius of . The primary star is also unusual in that it does not exhibit internal seismic oscillations as have been detected in other red giants, although tidal forces from the closer pair may possibly be causing other variability in the light curve of the system. HD 181068 Ba and Bb have spectral types of G8V and K1V respectively, indicating their location on the main sequence, slightly later than the Sun. They are in a close orbit and complete an orbit once every 0.906 days (about 21.7 hours), while they orbit HD 181068 A every 45.5 days.

History Destroyed railway station during World War I The first known documental record of the village dates back to 1530. Horodziej was a privately owned village located in the Nowogr√≥dek County of the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth–í—è–ª—ñ–∫—ñ –≥—ñ—Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—á–Ω—ã –∞—Ç–ª–∞—Å –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ –¢.2, Minsk, 2013, p. 100. until the Second Partition of Poland (1793) when it was annexed by Tsarist Russia. Initially, the village often changed owners, before it became the property of the powerful Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family in 1575. A Roman Catholic church was built in the 17th century. A pre-war Polish house in Horodziej The village was briefly occupied by the Germans in 1918 and after Poland regained independence (1918) it came under Polish administration in 1919 and was finally reintegrated with Polish territory after the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì1921). Administratively Horodziej was part of the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. After the destruction of World War I, a new Catholic church and a new railway station were built. Before World War II, the precise number of Jews living in Horodziej is not known, but it was probably somewhere between 700 and 1,000, the third of the total population. After the invasion of Poland the village was under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941, German occupation from 1941 to 1944 and again Soviet occupation from 1944 to 1945, when in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement it was taken from Poland and annexed to the Soviet Union. In 1941, an enclosed ghetto of a few houses was established. On July 16, 1942, the ghetto was liquidated. Some Jews were transported in trucks, but most were marched on foot, to a small hill near the Christian cemetery, where a pit had been dug. On the way to the killing site, the guards shot several Jews who were unable to keep up. Approximately 1,000 Jews were shot that day by an Einsatzgruppen. Earlier, in June 1942, local Polish parish priest J√≥zef Gogoli≈Ñski was arrested and imprisoned in nearby Nie≈õwie≈º. He was later murdered along with 3 other priests as part of the continuation of the anti- Polish Intelligenzaktion. In 1946 the Roman Catholic St. Joseph church was closed down by the Soviets. It was reopened and renovated in the 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  Sights  A 19th-century chapel The historic sights include a chapel built in 1874, a pre-war Polish Roman Catholic Church of St. Joseph, a 19th-century Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration and old houses. There is also a Battle of Grunwald memorial stone and a memorial complex dedicated to the local Jews murdered during the Holocaust.  Transport  A railway station is located in the settlement.  Sports  FC Gorodeya football club is based in the settlement.

Theis Jacob Thorkildsen Lundegaard (8 October 1774 - 26 February 1856) was a Norwegian farmer, shipowner and politician. He represented Lister amt (now Vest-Agder) at the Norwegian Constituent Assembly in 1814. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from 1815 to 1816, from 1821 to 1822, from 1827 to 1833, and in 1845. Background Teis Lundegaard was the son of a peasant farmer in the parish of Austad in Vest-Agder who died when Teis was three years old. He grew up in conditions of poverty. He eventually started trading and soon became the skipper and owner of several coastal freighters. Having become prosperous, he invested in the land and settled in Austad as a well-to-do farmer, becoming a leading man in the community. He was a remarkable man, known for his mental ability as well as his physical strength. Political career Teis Lundegaard played a prominent part in a crucial period of Norwegian history. In the confusion of international affairs at the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Norwegians rejected the peace treaty of Kiel in 1814, by which Norway was ceded to Sweden after having been in union with Denmark since 1380. They claimed their independence and set out to form their own constitution. Teis Lundegaard was elected representative for Lister Amt (now Vest-Agder) to the Constitutional Assembly which met at Eidsvoll. As a signatory of the constitutional document of the 17th of May, 1814, his name is linked to the Norwegian Constitutional Day celebration.Teis Lundegaard og slekta hans Between 1814-1845 Teis Lundegaard was re-elected several times to the National Assembly. With his great self-assurance and common sense, he became one of the leading spokesmen for the farmers in the parliament at a time when this social group lacked in political experience and self- confidence. In one parliamentary session alone, he sat on as many as 18 committees. Many stories are told about his wit and humor, as well as his fearlessness and stubbornness, which made him a feared and respected political opponent. He frequently quoted the Bible, which he was said to know by heart. He was also known for using coarse words, especially in confrontation with government officials and the clergy, who at that time were the most influential political groups. On the other hand stories are also told about his concern for and help to people in distress.\\" One story concerns a meeting at Eidsvoll (a country venue) in 1814, at which the Norwegian constitution was being drafted. The city politicians dominated the proceedings, and apparently annoyed Teis. On a trip out to the out-house toilets, which were reached by planks placed on the muddy earth, he met a city politician on the boards. Instead of giving way, he lifted the city man by the chest, and either swung him round, past him on the plank (or possibly 'dumped' him in the mud), with a comment to the effect of: \\"this is how we deal with city folk here\\".

Woods, The Sun-God Tablet of Nab√ª-apla-iddina Revisited, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 56, pp. 23 - 103, 2004 Description It was encased in a clay cast or \\"squeeze\\" that created impressions when placed over the face of the stone and protected it. This indicates that the tablet was an item of reverence, possibly stored due to newer traditions. The tablet has serrated edges like a saw. The bas-relief on the top of the obverse (pictured) shows Shamash, the Sun God, beneath symbols of the Sun, Moon and star. The God is depicted in a seated position, wearing a horned headdress, holding the rod-and-ring symbol in his right hand. There is another large sun disk in front of him on an altar, suspended from above by two figures. Of the three other figures on the left, the central one is dressed in the same fashion as Shamash and is assumed to be the Babylonian king Nabu-apla-iddina receiving the symbols of deity. The bas relief can be superimposed with two orders of golden rectangles, though ancient knowledge of the golden ratio before Pythagoras is considered unlikely. Inscription The scene contains three inscriptions.British Museum Collection The first, at the head of the tablet reads: Above the sun god a second inscription describes the position of the depicted moon, sun, and star as being over against the heavenly ocean, on which the scene sits: The final inscription in the scene reads: The cuneiform text beneath the stele is divided into fifteen passages, blending prose, poetic and rhetorical elements in the fashion typical of Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. It tells how Sippar and the Ebabbar temple of Shamash had fallen into disrepair with the loss of the statue of the God. This cult image is temporarily replaced with the solar disk; it is further described how a new figure of Shamash was found in an eastern part of the Euphrates, from which Nabu-apla-iddina has constructed a new statue of lapis lazuli and gold to restore the cult. Similar iconographic and prosaic parallels have been evidenced from Mesopotamian and later Jewish sources where the king who restores the cult is seen like a deity passing on divine symbols. The remainder of the text records the gifts of the royal grant, similar to a kudurru and discusses the practices of the temple, priestly rules, dress codes and regulations.

Founded in 1978 by a small group of engineers at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, VEGA presently works with various space agencies, satellite operators and manufacturers around the world. It works with the European Space Agency (ESA) and ESOC in Germany, European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, ESA Centre for Earth Observation (ESRIN) in Rome, Italy, and European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Madrid, Spain. Since 1978, VEGA has worked on almost every ESA mission and many other European and international programmes, including Mars Express, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) for the International Space Station (ISS), the Eumetsat Polar System, and the Ground Segment Development for ADEN. On 1 January 2011, VEGA Space Ltd became a part of Telespazio, the Rome-based space systems services joint venture between the French defense electronics specialist Thales Group and the Italian aerospace group Leonardo, formerly known as Finmeccanica. Telespazio VEGA is an active member of UKspace, the trade association for Britain's space industry, and is heavily involved with the International Space Innovation Centre based in Harwell. History During 1978, VEGA was established by a small group of engineers at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. The company had been setup to fulfil the first operations engineering frame contract, which had been competitively bid for and awarded, to provide satellite operations support for several European Space Agency (ESA) missions. During VEGA's initial years of operation, this contract comprised the bulk of its activity. During the 1980s, VEGA expanded via several additional programmes, including the award of its first contract with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) during 1986, along with a separate deal to handle ground operations for British space telecommunications company Immarsat. The company established its first dedicated office in St Albans, Hertfordshire. During 1991, VEGA launched on-site operations at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in the Netherlands. During 1992, VEGA became a public limited company following an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. In the following year, it started providing support for the ESA's Earth Observation Directorate. During 1994, VEGA was awarded its first contract for a simulation-based training system for the British Aerospace Sea Harrier; it also established a presence at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC). During 1996, VEGA acquires the automation and control engineering business Selmers. The firm's UK offices were located to Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, in the following year. During 2004, VEGA acquired the German space ground systems specialist Anite Systems GmbH. Three years later, the company reorganised itself into several subsidiaries, VEGA France and VEGA Spain. By this point, according to VEGA's own financial statements, the firm self-classified as a specialist professional services company in the principal markets of Aerospace, Defence and Government. During 2008, VEGA was itself acquired by the Italian aerospace group Finmeccanica (since rebranded as Leonardo); accordingly, it was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Initially, the company became a subsidiary of Selex ES with the Finmeccanica Group, but continued to operate under the VEGA brand. However, it was restructured over the following three years, including the creation of VEGA Space Ltd during 2010, and the transfer of VEGA's ownership to Telespazio, a space operations joint venture between Finmeccanica and French defense electronics specialist Thales Group on 1 January 2011. For decades, VEGA has continued to provide support on the original ESA operations engineering contract, which has been re-tendered every five years. Other programme performed by the company include the provision of various elements, such as the synthetic-aperture radar, for the COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) Earth-observation satellite space-based radar programme, which is funded by the Italian Ministry of Research and Ministry of Defence and conducted by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), intended for both military and civilian use. The company has also supported the Rosetta space probe that performed the first successful landing on a comet. By the 2010s, activities performed by Telespazio VEGA UK included satellite navigation systems, satellite communications (fixed and mobile), ground-based satellite mission control systems, Earth observation, consultancy services for numerous international space programmes, along with general space engineering and operational activities. During 2018, Luigi Pasquali, Telespazio CEO, declared that the company's long term goal is to capture 10 per secure of the global space market by 2030.

His stories are best known for such themes as murder, rape, and cannibalism. Biography He was born on March 10, 1878, in Rzhyshchiv, Ukraine. In 1896, he traveled to Warsaw, struggled to work for two years, then returned to Ukraine. He experienced a pogrom, fell in love and attempted suicide, and was later conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. These experiences would influence much of his rather dark, fictional themes. Shapiro returned to Warsaw in 1903, and I. L. Peretz helped him publish his first literary works: Di Fligl (\\"The Wings\\"); and, the next year, a longer story called Itsikl Mamzer (\\"Little Isaac the Bastard\\"), published in a journal edited by Avrom Reyzen. To Peretz he would dedicate one of his works, Smoke, a tale of the Old World (Peretz would serve as an early benefactor of another famous Yiddish writer, Der Nister). Shapiro left for America in 1905. He stayed for a year in London, where he befriended the Hebrew writer Yosef Haim Brenner. After arriving in New York in 1906, and working for The Forward, he began publishing his gruesome pogrom tales: \\"The Kiss\\" (1907); \\"Pour Out Thy Wrath\\" (1908); \\"The Cross\\" (1909); \\"In The Dead Town\\" (1910). Shapiro's work marks a break from that of the three classic Yiddish writers in its foregrounding of violence and psychological realism, rather than satirical commentary. Shapiro subsequently returned to Warsaw for a year, then returned permanently to the United States in 1911. By 1919, Shapiro had written what are considered his two greatest pogrom stories: \\"White Challah\\" and \\"The Jewish Government.\\"\\"Lamed Shapiro\\" (2001), in Norton Anthology, p. 154-155. The two stories \\"remain some of the most aesthetically nuanced and psychologically complex treatments of the pogrom theme in modern Jewish literature.\\"Hoffman (2002), p. 987. Shapiro and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1921. His wife, Freydl, died there in 1927, and he then returned to New York. Back in New York yet again, Shapiro worked at several literary periodicals, was active in the Communist party, and was employed by the Federal Writers' Project in 1937. Shapiro returned to LA in 1939, where he lived at 544 Heliotrope Drive in East Hollywood. Death Shapiro died in Los Angeles in 1948 while living in a friend's garage.Cohen He died an alcoholic and poor. He was buried at the Mount Zion Cemetery in East Los Angeles next to his wife and his tombstone was inscribed with the words: \\"Lamed Levi Shapiro, Author of the Yiddishe Melukhe\\".

(2010) Rescue effort after the 2014 Soma mine disaster in Manisa, Turkey, where over 500 miners lost their lives. Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an energy accident, sometimes causing considerable damage. Energy fatalities can occur, and with many systems deaths will happen often, even when the systems are working as intended. Historically, coal mining has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one. Underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Open cut mining hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,\\"Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.\\" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010. with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.\\"Coal Mining Steeped in History\\". ABC News. January 5, 2006. According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, 279 major energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.Benjamin K. Sovacool. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907‚Äì2007, Energy Policy 36 (2008), pp. 1802‚Äì1820. However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of air pollution. The most lethal of which, particulate matter, which is primarily generated from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually. Fatalities Hypothetical number of global deaths which would have resulted from energy production if the world's energy production was met through a single source, in 2014. The Farmington coal mine disaster kills 78. West Virginia, US, 1968. According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, hydroelectric facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the Shimantan Dam (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished. While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the NNPC petroleum pipeline in 1998 and the resulting explosion. The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the predicted latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 steam explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the radio-isotope pollution released. In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved safety culture and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities. Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the World Wildlife Fund. Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from Coalworker's pneumoconiosis (known as \\"black lung\\") a disease of the lungs caused by long- continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China. Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century, with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone. In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s. Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year. (See more Coal mining disasters in the United States) In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the Environmental impact of the coal industry, including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the Clean Air Act, an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US coal fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and directly emitted particulate matter that result when coal is burnt. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths. In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually. Economic costs According to Benjamin Sovacool, nuclear power plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent. Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the Exxon Valdez oil spill (Alaska), The Prestige oil spill (Spain), and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident (Pennsylvania). However analysis presented in the international Journal, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment found that coal, oil, Liquid petroleum gas and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.

Modern-day U.S. regulatory agencies frequently implement regulations on conventional pollution if one life or more is predicted saved per $6 million to $8 million of economic costs incurred.New York Times. \\"EPA Plans to Revisit a Touchy Topic ‚Äì the Value of Saved Lives\\" retrieved 2012-1-11 Selected energy accidents *April 26, 1942: A coal-dust explosion at Benxihu Colliery in Japanese occupied China killed 1,549 making it the worst disaster in the history of coal mining superseding the 1,099 death toll of the Courri√®res mine disaster in 1906 and the second worst recorded energy accident, in terms of lives lost on a single day, after Banqiao dam in 1975.

The flood immediately killed over 100,000 people, and another 150,000 died of subsequent epidemic diseases and famine, bringing the total death toll to around 250,000‚Äîmaking it the worst technical disaster ever. In addition, about 5,960,000 buildings collapsed, and 11 million residents were made homeless. * March 16, 1978: The Amoco Cadiz, a VLCC owned by the company Amoco (now merged with BP) sank near the Northwest coasts of France, resulting in the spilling of 68,684,000 US Gallons of crude oil (1,635,000 barrels). This is the largest oil spill of its kind (spill from an oil tanker) in history. * January 8, 1979: Betelgeuse incident, a French constructed oil tanker which entered Bantry Bay, Ireland, exploded and killed 50 people, the disaster also caused extensive harbor damage. * March 28, 1979: Three Mile Island accident.

The ensuing steam explosion, fire and radio-isotope releases killed approximately 31 to 50 first responders, with most of those exposed to radiation only, dying with acute radiation syndrome within weeks to months after the accident. Future, total death toll predictions, state that there may be a total of between 4,000 and 25,000 cancer deaths in the years to decades ahead due to radiation induced cancers, with the large discrepancy in the predictions created by various authoritative agencies employing different risk models. The 30 kilometer Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, covering portions of Belarus and Ukraine surrounding Prypiat, remains contaminated and mostly uninhabited. Prypiat itself was totally evacuated and remains as a partial ghost town, open only for tourists and tours. * May 5, 1988: Norco, Louisiana, Shell Oil refinery explosion after hydrocarbon gas escaped from a corroded pipe in a catalytic cracker and was ignited.

The Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker bound for Long Beach, California, hits Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef dumping an estimated minimum 10.8 million US gallons (40.9 million litres, or 250,000 barrels) of crude oil into the sea. It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters ever to occur in history. 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds died as well as at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and billions of salmon and herring eggs were destroyed. Overall reductions in population have been seen in various ocean animals, including stunted growth in pink salmon populations. Sea otters and ducks also showed higher death rate in following years, partially because they ingested prey from contaminated soil and from ingestion of oil residues on hair due to grooming. The effects of the spill continue to be felt 20 years later. * June 4, 1989: The Ufa train disaster was a railway accident that occurred on 4 June 1989, in Iglinsky District, Bashkir ASSR, Soviet Union, when an explosion killed 575 people and injured 800 more.

The film released nationwide on 13 May 2016. The film narrates a tale of intellectual terrorism‚Äîthe inter-meddling of academia with corruption and maoism.  Plot  Vikram Pandit (Arunoday Singh) is a happy-go-lucky management student from a business school in India. He becomes an overnight sensation after a successful social media campaign against the radical fundamentalism of moral policing in India. Little did Vikram know that he was about to become a part of a plot that would risk his life and the nation. He gets entangled between two facets of India‚ÄîSocialism and Capitalism, both of which are deeply rooted in isolated corners of the country. Somewhere deep within the jungles, flagrant conspirators were gearing up to maim the Country. They had established links with the patrician society. Vikram's internet campaign pulls him into a very deep web of conspiracy. The film revolves around Vikram's survival in the sinister designs of establishment.  Cast  *Arunoday Singh as Vikram Pandit *Mahi Gill as Charu Siddhu *Anupam Kher as Professor Ranjan Batki *Pallavi Joshi as Sheetal Batki, wife of Ranjan Batki. *Vivek Vaswani *Anchal Dwivedi *Gopal K Singh as Naxal chief *Indal Singh as Nanhe Singh-political leader  Production  = Development = Nisha Susan of Pink Chaddi Campaign fame recalled someone from Indian School of Business, claiming to work at a film-incubator having emailed her a few years back, about a prospective film centered on her campaign. The plot went (roughly): > A young idealistic student is in a bar, where a bunch of right wing goons > assault girls. The student vanquishes the goons and follows up with a > Facebook campaign against misogyny, which commands considerable fame. He is > subsequently approached by the Naxals who convert and ask him to mold the > urban youth in Maoist ideology; by the virtue of his gained fame and > charisma. The part about Naxals was a creative addition, and Susan had replied that while he was free to make a movie about the themes, she found it surprising that a campaign which was run by numerous women in reality was to be run by a single man in the film. He replied that a woman-run campaign was apparently not realistic. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Vivek said that while he was delivering a lecture at Indian School of Business about Naxal influence in academia, the students suggested to sketch out a 10-minute short film. That idea gradually morphed into the thoughts of producing a full-fledged feature film. Agnihotri has asserted of the film to be modeled on his own life though one of his co-producers has denied it. Vivek and the students went on a drive to collect funds before meeting Suresh Chukkapalli who agreed to produce it. Vivek felt that convincing producers to support a non-star content-driven film was difficult. = Casting = = Filming = The title was chosen as a metaphor alluding to the commotion that engulfs the students of various universities. Around eighty per cent of the film was shot at Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad and the total budget was about five crore INR. =Urban Naxals: The Making of Buddha in a Traffic Jam= Urban Naxals: The Making of Buddha in a Traffic Jam is a book written by Bollywood film director, scriptwriter and producer Vivek Agnihotri, about the making of his film Buddha in a Traffic Jam. In the forward of the book Prof. Makarand R. Paranjape (of JNU) writes 'We all fail in our lives. But few of us actually recover to tell the story. Vivek is one of them'. It is this story of struggle and perseverance in all odds - where one stand head on with established institutions of academics, media, film distributor, film producers, civil society who create and present broader narrative to nation as suit there interest.  Soundtrack  Pallavi Joshi made her singing debut courtesy the song--Chand Roz.  Tour and release  = Certification = The Central Board of Film Certification passed the film without any cuts. Agnihotri claimed that certain objectionable contents including the likes of extreme language and extreme sex scenes were allowed to stay as the board members were sympathetic to the message of the film. = University tour and controversies = Reportedly, whilst many distributors initially promised to distribute the film, many later backed out on grounds of the controversial topic. Barjatya productions came to the aid but later withdraw their offer. He then chose to tour across different colleges and universities across the nation and screen the film; due to an alleged lack of marketing capital. The film premiered at IIT Bombay on 6 April 2016. These screening of the films with the help of political unions, who have had a reputation for instigating violence, have been criticized. and the screenings have been protested against.  Jadavpur University  A screening of the film, which was supposed to be accompanied by Vivek and Anupam, was scheduled to be held at the Triguna Sen Auditorium, Jadavpur University by a group ‚ÄúThink India‚Äù, backed by a right wing student union-- Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). The screening was cancelled after the alumni association withdrew their permission, citing the model code of conduct, which was in force due to the concurrent state elections. Agnihotri was greeted with black flags and he alleged that he had been gheraoed and manhandled whilst his car was damaged. The screening was thereafter rescheduled to be held in an open-air format but did not take any permission from the concerned authorities. It was accordingly asked to be stopped by the registrar but Vivek chose to proceed. Anticipating trouble in case of enabling a forced closure, the authorities did not intervene further. This led to a subsequent fracas wherein the students claim that several outsiders from a right wing student union-- Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) turned the event into a political rally, sloganeering along right-wing agendas and assaulting those who dissented against the \\"divisive content\\" of the film. Four of the outsiders (three of whom belonged to ABVP and the other was a professor of Bangabasi College) were alleged to have sexually molested women students and were kept within the university estate office by the students. They were rescued after the vice-chancellor, registrar and other senior officials intervened, pending which an FIR was lodged by the university authority against them. Vivek and other ABVP leaders summarily rejected the allegations of molestation; which were subsequently further criticized. Vivek also blamed the students as naxalites enrolled in an institute where everything happened except education. The next day, JU students held a march across the city chanting slogans of ‚ÄòAzadi' from RSS and BJP, the parent organizations of ABVP and against \\"saffronisation\\" of the nation. ABVP filed a counter FIR and asserted that they will send a detailed report to the home ministry about the \\"pro-naxalite anti-national\\" activities that took place in the campus which were supposedly advocated by pro-left students. They also sought for physical assault on the university students. The film was finally released on 13 May 2016 by Rajshri Productions in a limited number of theatres. The Indian Express failed to note any 'buzz' in the market.  Reception  = Critical = Sarit Ray of Hindustan Times rated the film 1/5 and commented it to be a thoroughly unconvincing propaganda film that resembled an amateur and laughable attempt at film making. Suprateek Chaterjee of HuffPost deemed it to be a \\"frequently ridiculous propaganda piece\\" for the right wing. Raja Sen of Rediff.Com noted it to be a hollow and senseless product of incompetent film-making; that failed the standards of even being an effective propaganda film. Mohar Basu of Times of India rated it 2 out of 5 stars, criticizing the flimsy plot and Vivek's limited knowledge of the relevant issues. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in criticized the film as a zeitgeist film of the Modi era, that severely lacked artistic merit and had a ridiculous plot. Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror rated it 1.5 out of 5, noting that the film's plot deteriorated with ensuing time and at the end, induced nothing more than a little headache whilst sinking Vivek's last ditch effort to redeem himself. Surabhi Redkar of Koimoi.com rated it 1.5 out of 5 and remarked it to be a propaganda film with a flimsy plot, that stood far from objectivity and which sought to sell a particular mindset. Rachit Gupta of Filmfare criticized the film as suffering from lackluster plot, half-heartedly written scripts, mediocre screenplay, inconsistent performances and poor direction that did go absolutely nowhere. Aniruddha Guha at MensXP.com rated the film 1.5 out of 5 and noted it to be a mixture of haphazard storytelling and poor screenplay that stuck to an uni-dimensional narrative, throughout: Leftists are the bad guys. Rajyasree Sen of Newslaundry.com noted that the sole reasons for showing the film in universities could be as a reminder for the students to not fund or be involved in cinema so shoddy, in whose description the words 'convoluted' and 'childish' proved to be an understatement. Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle though praised the film as an extraordinary effort of shedding light on the buried political issues of the nation and praised multiple aspects of the film making. = Box office = The film did not perform well at the box office.  Book  He later wrote a book titled \\"Urban Naxals: The Making of Buddha in a Traffic Jam\\" about his experiences whilst making the film. The book led to his framing of the term-- Urban Naxals.

Overview The Newburgh Free Library is currently located in a four-story building overlooking the Hudson River at 124 Grand Street in Newburgh, NY. The library's main goals are to ‚Äúprovide substantial print resources and traditional services and to secure the technology to make the library a globally relevant information center.\\" Some of the library's programs include the Homework Help Center, Parent-Child Workshops, a Heritage Festival for Hispanics, the award-winning Business Resources and Information Exchange (BRIX), computer training courses in the library's e-Learning Center, and a local history and genealogy research room. History left In 1852, the newly established City of Newburgh school system consolidated the city's libraries‚Äîthe Newburgh Academy Library, the Glebe School Library, the Newburgh Lyceum Society Library, the Mechanics Library Association, and the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Library‚Äîinto one free, public library called the Newburgh Free Library. This would be New York State's fourth public library and it would operate under the Board of Education. The Newburgh Free Library opened to the public on Nov. 6, 1852 in a schoolroom at the Newburgh Academy. It contained 2,001 volumes. Originally the library was only open on Saturdays from 2‚Äì3p.m., but eventually, the library increased its hours to include Tuesdays from 7‚Äì9 p.m. for men, Thursdays from 1‚Äì5p.m. for ladies, and Saturdays 8 a.m. to noon for children. In 1860, the city decided to build a separate building for the growing library, which now stocked 4,000 volumes. This building adjoined the high school on the corner of Grand and Campbell streets. Twelve years later, after the high school had merged with the Academy, the building was torn down and replaced by the Grand Street Elementary School. The Newburgh Free Library then occupied a room in a wing of the new elementary school. In 1878, the library and its expanded collection of 10,421 volumes moved into the newly built high Victorian-style building at 100 Grand Street designed by J.A. Wood.Heritage Sites #23 City of Newburgh The library now had a card catalog system; although, librarians retrieved books for patrons from closed-off stacks. It also extended its hours; it was now open from 10 a.m. to 9p.m., every day except Sunday and holidays. In 1909, the library's collection expanded to 36,075 volumes, 10,000 of which were lent by the United States government, as the library was, and still is, a part of the Federal Depository Library Program. To accommodate the library's expanding collection, the Board of Education decided to enlarge the building by buying the property at 98 Grand Street for $8,500. In 1921, the library adopted the Dewey Decimal Classification system, allowing for open shelving and patron browsing. In 1976, the Newburgh Free Library moved once again. With a growing population and collection, the Board of Education had a new library building constructed just north of the 1876 library building, at 124 Grand Street. In 2010, the Newburgh Free Library formed the Newburgh Library Collaborative with the libraries at Orange County Community College and the Curtin Library at Mount Saint Mary College, making resources from these libraries available to the patrons.

The Action off Lofoten was a naval battle fought between the German Kriegsmarine and the British Royal Navy off the southern coast of the Lofoten Islands, Norway during World War II. A German squadron under Vizeadmiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens consisting of the battleships and met and engaged a British squadron under Admiral Sir William Whitworth consisting of the battlecruiser and nine destroyers. After a short engagement, Gneisenau suffered moderate damage and the Germans withdrew. Background The German invasion of Norway, Operation Weser√ºbung, began on 9 April 1940. In order to prevent any disruption of the invasion by the British, the Kriegsmarine had previously dispatched a force under Vice Admiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens to protect the troop convoy landing at Narvik. The German squadron consisted of the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the heavy cruiser , and ten destroyers. With intelligence suggesting that the Germans were massing ships, the British sent out a squadron under Admiral Sir William Whitworth to deny German access to neutral Norwegian waters by laying mines in Operation Wilfred and prevent any German naval movements into the Atlantic Ocean.O'Hare 2004, p. 17. Shortly after departing German waters on 7 April, L√ºtjens' force was attacked by British bombers which did no damage to the squadron. On 8 April, Admiral Hipper and the German destroyers were dispatched to Narvik while the German capital ships headed north for a diversionary manoeuvere into the North Atlantic. As Admiral Hipper left, she met and engaged the British destroyer which had become separated from Admiral Whitworth's main force.Miller 1995, p. 59. Though Vizeadmiral L√ºtjens‚Äîand the two German battleships‚Äîwas nearby, their assistance was deemed unnecessary, and Admiral Hipper sank Glowworm, though taking some damage in return.Miller 1995, p. 60. Whitworth's main force then caught sight of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at 03:30 on 9 April and moved to engage the battleships.Miller 1995, p. 62. Whitworth's force consisted of the battlecruiser Renown and the nine remaining destroyers. , , , and were H-class destroyers while was an E-class destroyer and , , and were of the . was of the G class.O'Hara 2004, p. 22. Renown had been completely reconstructed between 1936 and 1939, with lighter machinery, increased armour and upgraded armament. She mounted a main battery of six 42-calibre 15-inch guns with improved shells and greater range and a dual-purpose secondary battery consisting of twenty 4.5-inch (QF 4.5 inch L/45) guns arranged in ten turrets. The four I and E-class destroyers had been rigged for mine laying and most of their normal armament had been removed; they only had two guns each. Greyhound and the H-class destroyers were more capable ships, each armed with eight torpedo tubes and four 4.7-inch guns. Of the H-class destroyers, Hardy was built as a destroyer leader and thus had an additional 4.7-inch gun.O'Hare 2004, p. 22. The German force consisted of the two Scharnhorst-class battleships, each with a main battery of nine 28.3 cm guns and a secondary battery of twelve 15 cm guns. In a close range engagement, the British force was superior, but at a distance the guns on Whitworth's destroyers were outranged and the German firepower was greater. The German force also held a speed advantage over Renown, having a top speed of to the battlecruiser‚Ä≤s , but was slower than the destroyers, which could steam at .O'Hare 2004, p. 22. Thus, L√ºtjens clearly held an advantage over Renown, though the German force was significantly vulnerable to attack from Whitworth‚Ä≤s destroyers.Lunde 2009, p. 112. Battle At 03:50, Gneisenau sighted Renown on its radar (but failed to identify her) and the German ships cleared for action. Due to poor weather conditions, neither side was able to engage the other until 04:05, as heavy seas and poor visibility prevented the two squadrons from closing within range.O'Hara 2004, p. 22. Renown began the action by attacking Gneisenau with her 15-inch guns. The German warships returned fire at 04:11 with Gneisenau scoring two hits on Renown with her 11-inch shells. Both shells failed to explode, with the first hitting the British battlecruiser's foremast and the second passing through the ship near the steering gear room. About the same time, Renown struck Gneisenau with two shells, with a third a little later.Haarr, pp. 310-311. These hits damaged the German battleship's director tower, forward range finders, and aft turret putting it out of action, a port anti-aircraft gun was also hit. Renown then moved her fire to Scharnhorst, which had moved to hide Gneisenau with smoke. Both German ships suffered damage from the heavy seas as they sought to avoid Renowns fire and both suffered serious electrical problems in their turrets as a result, resulting in poor output from their guns.Haarr, pp. 312-313. Renown also suffered some damage to her starboard bulge from the rough seas and firing of her guns, limiting speed. These early salvos were sporadic and lasted until 05:00, when the engagement was broken off for 20 minutes due to waves breaking over Renowns forward turrets as the German ships headed directly into the storm to escape.Garzke 1985, p. 135.Edwards 1995, p. 101 By this time Renowns destroyer escort had fallen back due to the severe weather and Scharnhorst started to suffer radar problems at about 04.20. At 05:20, the action reignited, with ineffectual fire coming from both sides. With both ships damaged by their speed through the storm, Gneisenau missing a turret and Scharnhorsts radar out of action, as well as fearing a torpedo attack on the damaged Gneisenau, the Germans increased their speed and disengaged at 06:15. The Germans mistook Whitworth's smaller vessels for much more powerful capital ships and as a result thought they were heavily outgunned.Miller 1995, p. 63. Damaged and determined to steer clear of what he thought was a superior force, L√ºtjens managed to shake off the British squadron and end the action by sailing west into the Arctic Ocean.Garzke 1985, p. 137. With her damaged bulge and the issues of firing forwards into a storm Renown was forced to break off the search, instead moving to cut off the ships should they turn round. Renown fired 230 15-inch and 1065 4.5-inch rounds during the action, while Scharnhorst fired 182 11-inch rounds and Gneisenau only managed to fire 54 11-inch rounds.Haarr, pp. 312-313. Aftermath Despite the Royal Navy winning a minor tactical victory over the Kriegsmarine, the Germans considered the engagement a strategic success due to the fact that Whitworth's force was delayed long enough to keep it from interfering with the landings at Narvik. After the action had ended, Whitworth's force continued to search for the German capital ships. With the British squadron occupied, the German destroyer-transports managed to make their way through to Narvik after destroying two Norwegian coastal defence ships in their path.Miller 1995, p. 63. After their engagement with Renown, the German battleships linked up with Admiral Hipper on the 11th near Trondheim. From there, they returned to Germany, reaching Wilhelmshaven on 12 April where the battle and weather damage to Scharnhorst and Gneisenau was repaired.Garzke 1985, p. 137 and 157.Haarr, p. 316.

Membership Membership of the society is open to anyone with an interest in history and archaeology, and provides access to monthly lectures as well as to the journal. A discounted student membership is also offered, running September to August to match the academic year. As of 2019, the Society has over 700 members. A number of notable figures involved with the archaeology and history of northern England have held memberships of the Society, such as John Collingwood Bruce, John Clayton and Ian Richmond. =List of presidents= * 1813 - Sir John Swinburne * 1861-78 - Henry Thomas Liddell * 1879-98 - Henry George Liddell * 1931-32 - Frederick Walter Dendy * 1933-34 - Robert Carr Bosanquet * 1935-36 - Charles Henry Hunter Blair * 1937 - Robert Cecil Hedley * 1940-41 - Lt-Col George Redesdale Brooker Spain * 1948-50 - Canon Thomas Romans * 1951-53 - Sir Ian Richmond * 1954-56 - William Percy Hedley * 1957-59 - Eric Birley * 1966-67 - John David Cowen * 1973 - John Philipson * 1976-77 - George Jobey * 1990-92 - Constance Frazer * 1993-95 - Brian Dobson * 1996-98 - Barbara Harbottle * 2004 - Beryl Charlton * 2005-07 - Grace McCombie * 2008-10 - David Breeze * 2011-13 - Lindsay Allason-Jones * 2014-15 - Derek Cutts * 2016-18 - Richard Pears * 2019 - Nick Hodgson Traditional music In 1855, the Society set up an Ancient Melodies Committee, with the object of collecting and preserving the characteristic songs and pipe music of the county. Its members were William Kell, John Clerevaulx Fenwick, and Robert White, together with John Collingwood Bruce a Secretary of the Society, appointed ex officio. In 1857, the Committee delivered a preliminary report to the Duke of Northumberland, with the pipers William Green and James Reid both providing musical illustrations. However, they were reluctant to publish at this stage, considering that the question of distinguishing Northumbrian tunes from Scottish or southern English ones deserved more work. In the same year Thomas Doubleday wrote an open letter to the Duke,Ancient Northumbrian Music criticising the slow progress of the Committee's work. He also made some observations on the characteristics of the unkeyed Northumbrian smallpipes, with its distinctive closed fingering, which gives the instrument a brilliant staccato sound; he also lamented the tendency of some players to attempt inappropriate music, such as waltzes, on the newer keyed instrument. The Committee's work seems to have stalled after the deaths of White and Kell, and Fenwick's move to London, but the Society published the Northumbrian Minstrelsy in 1882, edited by Rev. John Collingwood Bruce and John Stokoe. This played a significant role in supporting the traditional instrumental music and song of the north-east of England.Northumbrian Minstrelsy, reprint, with foreword by A.L. Lloyd, Hatboro, Pennsylvania, 1965. https://archive.org/stream/ACollectionOfTheBalladsMelodiesAndSmall- pipeTunesOfNorthumbria/NorthumbrianBallads_djvu.txt However, many of the smallpipe tunes they published were drastically simplified, in particular dropping the variations found in the collection of John Peacock, which they had used as a source. They also used very few of the tunes in the William Vickers manuscript, which was in their possession. Though primarily a fiddler's tunebook, it does contain many local pipe tunes. They also ignored the playing of contemporary traditional pipers such as Old Tom Clough and Thomas Todd. Despite these shortcomings, the book was very significant in the revival of wider interest in the smallpipes and its music.

The band consists of John Barber (lead guitar, vocals), Alex Major (drum kit), Jonathan Granoff (bass guitar), and Dan Keller (rhythm guitar, keyboards, vocals). Barber and Granoff are both graduates of the Berklee School of Music and Major is a graduate of Boston University.  History  The band was formed in East Greenwich, Rhode Island by John Barber, Alex Major, and Ryan Gildea while attending East Greenwich High School. Though the band has evolved throughout the years, Barber and Major began collaborating musically at the age of ten. Granoff joined the group in 2003 and the group played rock clubs around Providence, Rhode Island (including The Living Room, The Met Cafe, and The Century Lounge) and Boston (including All Asia Cafe and The Middle East). In 2003, the band released an EP entitled Seven Exits. In April, 2006 the band released their debut, self- titled album while living in Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly after the release of Ellis Ashbrook, Natalie Lowe joined the group, contributing keyboards and providing vocals. The group played their first show with Lowe at The Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge, MA. The group's live shows received praise from Boston's rock community. A.J. Wachtel of The Noise describes the group's shows as \\"a big sound for such a relatively small group. The tunes are driven by the unpredictability of where the music is heading. The bottom line is they get the feet moving and then get the head thinking.‚Äù Assemblage, Ellis Ashbrook's second album, was released in October 2008. Although he contributed heavily to the album, Gildea left the group prior to Assemblage's release. Gildea is currently a member of the Boston-based band Left Hand Does. The release of Assemblage saw Ellis Ashbrook gain a loyal following in New York and cemented their place on Brooklyn's rock scene. David Day of Weekly Dig praises the group as \\"the complete package, they also had a hand in engineering and mixing their second CD, Assemblage. It's a hell-fueled, spiraling rock record.\\" Since the release of Assemblage, the group has maintained a regular touring schedule and continues to have a strong presence in the New York, Boston, and Providence rock scenes. Time Out New York suggests that \\"local outfit Ellis Ashbrook offers intriguing sounding alt-rock that draws on prog, grunge, and funk-metal in equal measures.\\" In March 2011, Ellis Ashbrook released a live DVD from their July 3, 2010 show at The Highline Ballroom in New York City.

Hennigan was the case that defined the school busing controversy in Boston, Massachusetts during the 1970s. On March 14, 1972, the Boston chapter of the NAACP filed a class action lawsuit against the Boston School Committee on behalf of 14 black parents and 44 children.Jane M. Hornburger, \\"Deep are the Roots: Busing in Boston,\\" Journal of Negro Education 45, no. 3 (Summber 1976):237. Tallulah Morgan headed the list of plaintiffs and James Hennigan then chair of the School Committee, was listed as the main defendant. The plaintiffs' legal team decided to pursue the case as a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The School Committee was charged with violating the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as the 1964 Civil Rights Act.Emmett H. Buell, School Desegregation and Defended Neighborhoods, p. 94. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants, the School Committee, the Board of Education, and the Education Commissioner, \\"ha[d] intentionally brought about and maintained racial segregation in the Boston Public Schools.\\"Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) In short, while Boston was not experiencing \\"de jure\\" segregation (segregation as a result of the law), it was experiencing \\"de facto\\" segregation (segregation as a result of action). Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. was randomly assigned to the case.Ronald P. Formisano, Boston Against Busing: Race, CLass, and Ethnicity in the 1960s and 1970s (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1991):66. He did not make a decision until June 21, 1974. At that point he ruled that the city defendants had contributed to the \\"establishment of a dual school system,\\" one for each race.George R. Metcalf, From Little Rock to Boston: The History of School Desegregation (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983), 200. Garrity's solution to the problem of segregation in Boston would become an explosive issue in the city. The main tactics for reducing segregation were redistricting and busing.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) Background Following World War II a major civil rights movement swept the United States. The 1950s and 1960s were marked by sit-ins, protests, marches and boycotts. By the 1960s this movement was brought to national attention as television created almost ubiquitous media coverage. The impact of the civil rights movement on Boston was magnified as the city's population of African Americans increased from approximately 42,659 in 1950 to approximately 104,429 in 1970.United Community Services of Metropolitan Boston, 1950, Social Facts by Census Tracts 1970; accessed April 9, 2011. In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States decided a case which would advance the civil rights movement and become a major precedent for the case in Boston. In Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, the Supreme Court found that public school segregation \\"denie[d] to Negro children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"Brown v. Board of Education (I), 347 U.S. 483 (1954); accessed April 9, 2011. The judges relied on sociological evidence which showed that separate educational facilities were detrimental to the development of black children.Brown v. Board of Education When the decision was implemented in Little Rock, Arkansas, the white backlash shocked the nation and the world.Louis P. Masur, The Soiling of Old Glory: The Story of a Photograph that Shocked America (New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2008): 28. While the Brown case put an end to \\"de jure\\" segregation, \\"de facto\\" segregation would become the focus of activists and legislators in Boston. In 1961, the Education Committee of the NAACP, led by Ruth Batson, began a series of meetings with Boston's School Committee in order to make the members admit that de facto segregation existed in Boston's schools. Batson's argument rested on facts: thirteen schools in Boston were at least ninety percent black and the budgets provided for these schools were $125 per pupil less than the average budget for a white school in Boston.Masur, The Soiling of Old Glory: The Story of a Photograph that Shocked America, pp. 29-30. The School Committee refused to concede this point. As a result, the NAACP fought back with the traditional methods of the civil rights movement: boycotts and protests. Almost as soon as this movement began a counter-revolution rose up against the desegregation of Boston's Schools. Even as the School Committee denied any segregation in Boston they supported policies that increased racial imbalance in public schools. Rather than send white students to majority black schools, the Committee constructed portable classrooms at already overcrowded white schools. At South Boston High, an all-white school, enrollment was over the limit by 676 students during the 1971-72 school year. Girls High, 92% black, was underenrolled by 532 places.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass, June 21, 1974) Boston's system of feeder schools was probably the most efficient method of segregation utilized by the Committee. Under this system graduates from middle schools (ending with grade 8) went to high schools with grades 9-12. Graduates from junior high schools (ending with grade 9) went to high schools with grades 10-12. Junior highs tended to be in white neighborhoods while middle schools tended to be in black neighborhoods.Taylor, Desegregation in Boston and Buffalo, p. 47. The School Committee incriminated itself by converting two of the largest black junior highs in the city into middle schools for no practical reason.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) After a decade of protests and arguments and evasions by the Boston School Committee the issue finally came to a head with the 1972 court case. Legal precedents One of the reasons Judge Garrity took so long to deliver his decision in this case was because he wanted to make sure that what he decided was backed up by legal precedent. An important legal precedent for the Boston case was the U.S. Supreme Court case, Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver. In this case black and Hispanic parents from Denver, Colorado filed suit against all Denver schools due to racial segregation. The 1973 decision on this case, written by Justice William J. Brennan, was key in defining de facto segregation. Brennan found that although there were no official laws supporting segregation in Denver, \\"the Board, through its actions over a period of years, intentionally created and maintained the segregated character of the core city schools.\\"Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver Colorado. 413 U.S. 189 (June 21, 1973); accessed January 3, 2018. The issue of \\"intent\\" would become a key factor in the Boston case. Another important precedent was the Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education case. In 1969, the Charlotte- Mecklenburg district in North Carolina was segregated by law. It was no surprise that a district court case regarding this issue found in favor of the black plaintiffs, but the important part of this case is the remedy ordered by Federal District Judge James McMillan. McMillan ordered extensive busing and regrouping of schools. In an appeal the Judge's orders were found to \\"exceed...his authority.\\"Buell, School Desegregation and Defended Neighborhoods, p. 13. However, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Chief Justice Warren Burger argued that the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment gave federal judges a wide berth of authority in implementing desegregation.Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education. 402 U.S. 1 (April 20, 1971). https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0402_0001_ZS.html (accessed 09 April 2011). Burger supported the call for busing. This precedent would give Garrity power of implementation in Boston. Decision and implementation Judge Garrity forbade the School Committee from violating the Racial Imbalance Act in any way, beginning construction of any new school or portable class room or transferring white or black teachers in order to increase racial imbalance.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) Garrity's plan for implementation of his orders was extreme thanks to the authority granted by the Swann case. Garrity explained that \\"neutral conduct [was] no longer constitutionally sufficient\\"; the School Committee would have to actively work to reverse the segregation of Boston schools.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) Until the Committee had come up with its own plan, Garrity decided to enforce a State Board of Education plan, formulated following the passage of the Racial Imbalance Act. =The Plan= The plan was scheduled to take effect on the first day of school in September 1974. It would reduce the number of majority black schools from sixty-eight to forty-four as well as reduce the number of black students attending imbalanced schools from approximately 30,000 to 10,000. The Board's plan was based on two basic methods: redistricting and busing. The plan would also replace the feeder system of junior and middle schools with a single middle school program.Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D.C. Mass., June 21, 1974) =Reaction= In a city heavily stratified into ethnic enclaves, the exchange of school children between communities was dangerous. Ms. Gloria Joyner, a black mother of two high school students, rode the school bus from Roxbury to South Boston at the start of the 1974 school year. She described the escort required to keep the buses and children safe from white mobs: \\"our four buses were escorted by three police cruisers, 10 motorcycles, and a state helicopter overhead looking for rooftop snipers.\\" Buses were met with hurled stones and racial slurs.\\"The Black and White of...Busing\\", Evening Independent, November 8, 1974. On November 20, South Boston High School erupted in fights between students. The chaos delayed the start of the school day. The catalyst had been a white male student letting a door slam in the face of a black female student. One teacher, Ione Malloy, explained the atmosphere of the school at this point, \\"This school is DEATH. The mood of the school is black.\\"Ione Malloy, Southie Won't Go: A Teacher's Diary of the Desegregation of South Boston High School (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1986), pp. 36-37 Fights were frequent. The climax of violence in South Boston came on December 11, when a white student, Michael Faith, was stabbed. News of the stabbing spread through the community and by one o'clock 1,500 people surrounded the school waiting for the black students to leave. Bricks and bottles were hurled at police officers. Finally, three decoy buses came out and the mob went after them. The black students left via the back of the building and escaped.WGBH, Evening Compass Broadcast, Video, December 12, 1974; accessed April 9, 2011. =Master Plan= When the Boston School Committee repeatedly failed to submit an acceptable plan for desegregation, Garrity created a committee to formulate a ‚ÄúMaster‚Äôs Plan.‚Äù This plan was submitted in May 1975 and would become Phase II. The plan created a citywide magnet school district open to all students regardless of residence. It also included the partnering of public schools to twenty community colleges and universities to improve the quality of education in the former. The plan would call for the busing of 24,000 students. In addition to all this the plan also shifted focus to elementary and middle school aged students.Metcalf, From Little Rock to Boston, p. 209. While the School Committee still claimed not to accept any plan for forced busing, this plan was met with less instances of violence than the first phase. In May 1977, Garrity released Phase III, meant to shift control of implementation back to the Boston school system. Despite the School Committee's enduring resistance to busing, the constituents of Boston came to the slow realization that the Committee members themselves were the \\"architects of inferior schools.\\"Metcalf, From Little Rock to Boston, p. 212. In the November 1977 school board elections, three vocal anti-busing School Committee members were defeated, while John D. O'Bryant became the first black man to be elected to the Committee in the 20th century.Michael Knight, \\"Boston Black Wins in School Vote; 3 Opponents of Busing Defeated,\\" New York Times, November 10, 1977. In 1982, Judge Garrity officially turned over monitoring of desegregation to the State Board of Education.Boston Public Schools, \\"Desegregation Era Records Collection\\"; accessed January 3, 2018. Results For more than a decade Boston's school system was degraded by violence, hatred, and a breakdown of education. The results of this struggle for equality were not lasting. As of late 1989 Boston's School Committee continued to circumvent racial balance regulations. At a meeting in December of that year the Committee discussed racial statistics. One member made a telling inquiry about the Committee's policy: \\"We are excluding the Latin Schools because the numbers of students are predominantly white, is that it?\\" Another member provided the official response, to wit, that Latin schools were not incorporated because their admissions were different.Boston School Committee, December 19, 1989, \\"Meeting of the School Committee of the City of Boston\\" Boston City Archives, Desegregation Era Collection, Box 2. In the 2003-04 school year the majority of black and Latino students in Boston attended schools that were, on average, approximately 10 percent white. In 2003, of all the Boston schools found to be struggling and in need of \\"corrective action\\", 90 percent were non-white. It was found that, since 1999, white students had attended schools that had become progressively whiter every year.\\"Should Lynn schools use Boston's model?\\", Boston Globe, December 18, 2004.

History XV Corps Four Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors were deployed in 1916 in the Battle of the Somme and one in 1917 in an offensive near Diksmuide, Belgium. As part of the British preparations for the Battle of the Somme, 183rd Tunnelling Company from February 1916 onwards dug dozens of Russian saps for the attack in the front sector allocated to XV Corps. Small charges could be blown from the end of these tunnels and they could then be used to reinforce the captured positions. Four saps were equipped with Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors, ready to cover the German front line with liquid fire. In order to protect them from enemy fire, the flame throwers were hauled into the saps just hours before the battle. Two tunnels which housed such weapons ‚Äì located at Kiel Trench south-west of Mametz, and between Carnoy and Kasino Point ‚Äì were damaged by German shellfire before the attack. The two remaining were put to use from saps immediately left of the mine crater field at Carnoy. Their use may have helped the British in those sectors of the front as British losses there were comparatively low. According to one report fifty German soldiers immediately surrendered after use of the Livens Flame Projector. The weapon was used in Belgium in 1917, but was found too cumbersome to use, requiring bringing to the front line and assembly by 300 men, dangerously loading it with inflammable fuel, and then being able to fire only three bursts before emptying. It was also vulnerable to being damaged or buried by shellfire. Its use was abandoned. Specifications Flame jet shot from a Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector A Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector was long, weighed , and took a carrying party of 300 men to bring it to the front line and to assemble it underground in a shallow tunnel (sap) dug under no man's land for that purpose. The weapon consisted of several tanks containing the fuel, a diameter pipe and a nozzle on the surface. The nozzle, along with the rest of the machine, was hidden underground until needed, stored in a chamber at the end of the sap. A Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector was usually operated by a crew of eight. For the attack, the nozzle would be pushed upwards through the earth by a pneumatic cylinder. Compressed gas would then drive a piston forward in the main body of the device, forcing fuel out of the underground tanks into the surface nozzle, to be ignited and directed at the target. The maximum range of the weapon was . It could be fired for only three ten-second bursts. Archaeology Historians Peter Barton and Jeremy Banning with archaeologists Tony Pollard and Iain Banks from the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at the University of Glasgow were successful in May 2010 in finding at Mametz the remains of one of the Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors. This project was undertaken for Special episode 42 of the archaeological television programme Time Team first broadcast on 14 April 2011. A full size, working model of the weapon was constructed with support from the Royal Engineers to prove its efficacy. Popular culture The Livens flame projector was the inspiration for the cinematographic representation for the fire-breathing of the Smaug principal antagonist character, a \\"fire breathing drake [dragon]\\" from the north, in J.

She's the elder sister of television personality Guido S√ºller and ex soccer player Marcelo S√ºller, they both also well known in Argentina. Her first appearance on Argentine TV was on 30 March 1986, in Silvio Sold√°n's show Grandes Valores del Tango. She fell in love with the TV host and married him a few months later, having a baby, Christian Silvio, in 1991. In 1987, she had her first cosmetic surgery, a breast implant, which would help her in her future showgirl career. When she and Sold√°n split up in 1992, she started her high-profile career, working as a showgirl in many theater shows with Argentine comedians such as Jorge Corona, Beto C√©sar, Jos√© Luis Gioia, Carlos S√°nchez and Trist√°n, among others, throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s (decade). She had a very successful showgirl career, though she defines herself as a \\"show-woman\\". In 1997 she recorded a music album called Sullerman√≠a. In 2007, she took part in Bailando por un sue√±o (literally \\"Dancing for a dream\\") a TV show very similar to Dancing with the Stars, being the first eliminated. Her life has been largely exposed in the media and the tabloids, so that the public could see her involved in a lot of scandals, including her ex-husband, ex mother-in-law, her parents, her brothers, her sister Norma and national celebrities such as Moria Cas√°n o Jorge Rial. She has stated several times that she is a personal admirer of American star Marilyn Monroe (she named her daughter after Monroe) and Susana Gim√©nez. On April 8, 2011, S√ºller was compared to British celebrity Katie Price in The Sun.

Medronho trees grow wild on the poor soils in rural regions of Portugal such as Lous√£ and the inner Algarve. There is no commercial plantation of the trees and the fruits are mainly collected by local farmers, by hand and processed privately. Therefore, good Aguardente de Medronhos is not easily found in supermarkets but instead bought mostly directly from these farmers. Very few farmers have a license for distillation, but are tolerated by the authorities to keep this traditional Portuguese specialty alive. A commercial derivative, sweetened with honey and flavoured with herbs, is sold under the brand name Brandymel. Aguardente de Medronhos is also known as 'firewater' to non-Portuguese speakers. It is a rough translation from √°gua ardente, which is Portuguese for burning water. The spirit obtains this name from the hot sensation as the consumed beverage travels down the throat and is felt through the sinuses. The alcohol content of the beverage can vary; however, many bottles of Aguardente de Medronhos contain around 48% alcohol by volume. The beverage is consumed in shot-glass sized portions.
