The Wilks Brooks house is the oldest example of Greek Revival architecture in the Shelby County, Tennessee area. It is an L-shaped dwelling with two stories and has a central hallway, known as a dog-trot, with rooms to the left and right. Wood on the property, elm, poplar and cedar, was used to construct the home. Bricks and nails used were made on the property. The inside of the walls are made from plaster fortified with horsehair. The home became the residence for Wilks Brooks' family in 1836. It served as the center of a large plantation and was located on the Cherokee Trace, once the trail used by American Indians as a major trading route. Cotton grown on the plantation was taken to Memphis to be sold, first by mule-drawn wagons, and later shipped by the railroad after the completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in 1853. The home was occupied by members of Brooks' family until 1898. During the American Civil War, the home served as a hospital for Confederate soldiers, and later the Union troops of the 7th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry used the home as headquarters and camped on the grounds. They used miles of fencing for firewood and killed hogs and cattle to feed the troops. In 1898, Agnes Nelson Brooks died, and the home was no longer occupied by family members. It sat empty for years until in 1973, descendants of Wilks Brooks moved the home to another location on the property and began reconstruction. Reconstruction was completed in 2002 and the home has been occupied by tenants since then. It is currently under private ownership.

The emigrants traveled by wagon in search of fertile land in Oregon's Willamette Valley. Lewis and Clark Expedition In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson issued the following instructions to Meriwether Lewis: \\"The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, & such principal stream of it, as, by its course & communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado and/or other river may offer the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce.\\"Federal Writers Project, The Oregon trail: the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean (1839) p. 215 Although Lewis and William Clark found a path to the Pacific Ocean, it was not until 1859 that a direct and practicable route, the Mullan Road, connected the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Oregon Trail reenactment at Scotts Bluff The first land route across what is now the United States was partially mapped by the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1804 and 1806. Lewis and Clark initially believed they had found a practical overland route to the west coast; however, the two passes they found going through the Rocky Mountains, Lemhi Pass and Lolo Pass, turned out to be much too difficult for wagons to pass through without considerable road work. On the return trip in 1806 they traveled from the Columbia River to the Snake River and the Clearwater River over Lolo pass again. They then traveled overland up the Blackfoot River and crossed the Continental Divide at Lewis and Clark Pass and on to the head of the Missouri River. This was ultimately a shorter and faster route than the one they followed west. This route had the disadvantages of being much too rough for wagons and controlled by the Blackfoot Indians. Even though Lewis and Clark had only traveled a narrow portion of the upper Missouri River drainage and part of the Columbia River drainage, these were considered the two major rivers draining most of the Rocky Mountains, and the expedition confirmed that there was no \\"easy\\" route through the northern Rocky Mountains as Jefferson had hoped. Nonetheless, this famous expedition had mapped both the eastern and western river valleys (Platte and Snake Rivers) that bookend the route of the Oregon Trail (and other emigrant trails) across the continental dividethey just had not located the South Pass or some of the interconnecting valleys later used in the high country. They did show the way for the mountain men, who within a decade would find a better way across, even if it was not to be an easy way. Pacific Fur Company John Jacob Astor, fur trader, entrepreneur, and one of the wealthiest men in the U.S. created a subsidiary of the American Fur Company, called the Pacific Fur Company in 1810. He funded and outfitted a naval and overland expedition, with the land party led by Wilson Price Hunt to find a possible overland supply route and trapping territory for fur trading posts. Fearing attack by the Blackfoot Indians, the overland expedition veered south of Lewis and Clark's route into what is now Wyoming and in the process passed across Union Pass and into Jackson Hole, Wyoming. From there they went over the Teton Range via Teton Pass and then down to the Snake River in Idaho. They abandoned their horses at the Snake River, made dugout canoes, and attempted to use the river for transport. After a few days' travel they soon discovered that steep canyons, waterfalls and impassable rapids made travel by river impossible. Too far from their horses to retrieve them, they had to cache most of their goods and walk the rest of the way to the Columbia River where they made new boats and traveled to the newly established Fort Astoria. The expedition demonstrated that much of the route along the Snake River plain and across to the Columbia was passable by pack train or with minimal improvements, even wagons. This knowledge would be incorporated into the concatenated trail segments as the Oregon Trail took its early shape. In early 1811, the supply ship Tonquin left supplies and men to establish Fort Astoria (Oregon) at the mouth of the Columbia River and Fort Okanogan (Washington) at the confluence of the Okanogan and Columbia Rivers. The Tonquin then went up the coast to Puget Sound for a trading expedition. There it was attacked and overwhelmed by Indians before being blown up, killing all the crew and many Indians. Pacific Fur Company partner Robert Stuart led a small group of men back east to report to Astor. The group planned to retrace the path followed by the overland expedition back up to the east following the Columbia and Snake rivers. Fear of Indian attack near Union Pass in Wyoming forced the group further south where they luckily discovered South Pass, a wide and easy pass over the Continental Divide. The party continued east via the Sweetwater River, North Platte River (where they spent the winter of 1812‚Äì1813) and Platte River to the Missouri River, finally arriving in St. Louis in the spring of 1813. The route they had used appeared to potentially be a practical wagon route, requiring minimal improvements, and Stuart's journals provided a meticulous account of most of the route. Because of the War of 1812 and the lack of U.S. fur trading posts in the Oregon Country, most of the route was unused for more than 10 years. The North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company In August 1811, three months after Fort Astor was established, David Thompson and his team of British North West Company explorers came floating down the Columbia to Fort Astoria. He had just completed an epic journey through much of British Columbia and most of the Columbia River drainage system. He was mapping the country for possible fur trading posts. Along the way he camped at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers and posted a notice claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort on the site (Fort Nez Perces was later established there). Astor, pressured by potential confiscation by the British navy of their forts and supplies in the War of 1812, sold to the North West Company in 1812 their forts, supplies and furs on the Columbia and Snake River. The North West Company started establishing more forts and trading posts of their own. By 1821, when armed hostilities broke out with their Hudson's Bay Company rivals, the North West Company was pressured by the British government to merge with the Hudson's Bay Company. The Hudson's Bay Company had nearly a complete monopoly on trading (and most governing issues) in the Columbia District, or Oregon Country as it was referred to by the Americans, and also in Rupert's Land (western Canada). That year the British parliament passed a statute applying the laws of Upper Canada to the district and giving the Hudson's Bay Company power to enforce those laws. From 1812 to 1840 the British through the Hudson's Bay Company had nearly complete control of the Pacific Northwest and the western half of the Oregon Trail. In theory, the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812 restored the U.S. back to its possessions in Oregon territory. \\"Joint occupation\\" of the region was formally established by the Anglo-American Convention of 1818. The British through the Hudson's Bay Company tried to discourage any U.S. trappers, traders and settlers from doing any significant trapping, trading or settling in the Pacific Northwest. American fur trappers, traders, missionaries, and later settlers all worked to break this monopoly. They were eventually successful. The York Factory Express, establishing another route to the Oregon territory, evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the North West Company between Fort Astoria and Fort William, Ontario on Lake Superior. By 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company started using two brigades, each setting out from opposite ends of the express route--one from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River and the other from York Factory on Hudson Bay--in spring and passing each other in the middle of the continent. This established a 'quick' (about 100 days for ) one way to resupply their forts and fur trading centers as well as collecting the furs the posts had bought and transmitting messages between Fort Vancouver and York Factory on Hudson Bay.HBC's York Factory Express trade route, 1820s to 1840s. Modern political boundaries shown. The Hudson's Bay Company built a new much larger Fort Vancouver in 1824 slightly upstream of Fort Astoria on the Washington side of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada ‚Äì U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees. When emigration over the Oregon Trail began in earnest in about 1836, for many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies, aid and help before starting their homestead. Fort Vancouver was the main re-supply point for nearly all Oregon trail travelers until U.S. towns could be established. Fort Colville was established in 1825 on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls as a good site to collect furs and control the upper Columbia River fur trade. Fort Nisqually was built near the present town of DuPont, Washington and was the first Hudson's Bay Company fort on Puget Sound. Fort Victoria was erected in 1843 and became the headquarters of operations in British Columbia, eventually growing into modern-day Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia. By 1840 the Hudson's Bay Company had three forts: Fort Hall (purchased from Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1837), Fort Boise and Fort Nez Perce on the western end of the Oregon Trail route as well as Fort Vancouver near its terminus in the Willamette Valley. With minor exceptions they all gave substantial and often desperately needed aid to the early Oregon Trail pioneers. When the fur trade slowed in 1840 because of fashion changes in men's hats, the value of the Pacific Northwest to the British was seriously diminished. Canada had very few potential settlers who were willing to move over 2,500 miles to the Pacific Northwest, although several hundred ex- trappers, British and American, and their families did start settling in Oregon, Washington and California. They used most of the York Express route through northern Canada. In 1841 James Sinclair, on orders from Sir George Simpson, guided nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony (located at the junction of the Assiniboine River and Red River near the present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada)Resettlement maps into the Oregon territory.Red River Settlers in Oregon Accessed 22 February 2009 This attempt at settlement failed when most of the families joined the settlers in the Willamette Valley, with their promise of free land and HBC-free government. The Oregon Country/Columbia District stretched from 42'N to 54 40'N. The most heavily disputed portion is highlighted. In 1846 the Oregon Treaty ending the Oregon boundary dispute was signed with Britain. The British lost the land north of the Columbia River they had so long controlled. The new Canada‚ÄìUnited States border was established much further north at the 49th parallel. The treaty granted the Hudson's Bay Company navigation rights on the Columbia River for supplying their fur posts, clear titles to their trading post properties allowing them to be sold later if they wanted, and left the British with good anchorages at Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. It gave the United States what it mostly wanted, a 'reasonable' boundary and a good anchorage on the West Coast in Puget Sound. While there were almost no United States settlers in the future state of Washington in 1846, the United States had already demonstrated it could induce thousands of settlers to go to the Oregon Territory, and it would be only a short time before they would vastly outnumber the few hundred Hudson's Bay Company employees and retirees living in Washington. By overland travel, American missionaries and early settlers (initially mostly ex- trappers) started showing up in Oregon around 1824. Although officially the Hudson's Bay Company discouraged settlement because it interfered with their lucrative fur trade, their Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, Dr. John McLoughlin, gave substantial help including employment until they could get established. By 1843, when 700‚Äì1,000 settlers arrived, the American settlers greatly outnumbered the nominally British settlers in Oregon. McLoughlin, despite working for the British-based Hudson's Bay Company, gave help in the form of loans, medical care, shelter, clothing, food, supplies and seed to United States emigrants. These new emigrants often arrived in Oregon tired, worn out, nearly penniless, with insufficient food or supplies just as winter was coming on. McLoughlin would later be hailed as the Father of Oregon. Great American Desert Trail ruts near Guernsey, Wyoming A bison bull on a Nebraska wildlife refuge. Reports from expeditions in 1806 by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike and in 1819 by Major Stephen Long described the Great Plains as \\"unfit for human habitation\\" and as \\"The Great American Desert\\". These descriptions were mainly based on the relative lack of timber and surface water. The images of sandy wastelands conjured up by terms like \\"desert\\" were tempered by the many reports of vast herds of millions of Plains Bison that somehow managed to live in this \\"desert\\".It was not until later that the Ogallala Aquifer was discovered and used for irrigation, dry farming techniques developed and railtracks laid. In the 1840s, the Great Plains appeared to be unattractive for settlement and were illegal for homesteading until well after 1846‚Äîinitially it was set aside by the U.S. government for Indian settlements. The next available land for general settlement, Oregon, appeared to be free for the taking and had fertile lands, disease free climate (yellow fever and malaria were prevalent in much of the Missouri and Mississippi River drainage then), extensive uncut, unclaimed forests, big rivers, potential seaports, and only a few nominally British settlers. Fur traders, trappers and explorers Fur trappers, often working for fur traders, followed nearly all possible streams looking for beaver in the years (1812‚Äì1840) the fur trade was active. IDAHO FUR TRADE Fur traders included Manuel Lisa, Robert Stuart, William Henry Ashley, Jedediah Smith, William Sublette, Andrew Henry, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Peter Skene Ogden, David Thompson, James Douglas, Donald Mackenzie, Alexander Ross, James Sinclair and other mountain men. Besides discovering and naming many of the rivers and mountains in the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest they often kept diaries of their travels and were available as guides and consultants when the trail started to become open for general travel. The fur trade business wound down to a very low level just as the Oregon trail traffic seriously began around 1840. In fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813‚Äîeleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Jedediah Smith was killed by Indians about 1831. The exploration of the West by Jedediah Smith Up to 3,000 Mountain men were trappers and explorers, employed by various British and United States fur companies or working as free trappers, who roamed the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 to the early 1840s. They usually traveled in small groups for mutual support and protection. trapping took place in the fall when the fur became prime. Mountain men primarily trapped beaver and sold the skins. A good beaver skin could bring up to $4.00 at a time when a man's wage was often $1.00/day. Some were more interested in exploring the West. In 1825, the first significant American Rendezvous occurred on the Henry's Fork of the Green River. The trading supplies were brought in by a large party using pack trains originating on the Missouri River. These pack trains were then used to haul out the fur bales. They normally used the north side of the Platte River‚Äîthe same route used 20 years later by the Mormon Trail. For the next 15 years the American rendezvous was an annual event moving to different locations, usually somewhere on the Green River in the future state of Wyoming. Each rendezvous, occurring during the slack summer period, allowed the fur traders to trade for and collect the furs from the trappers and their Indian allies without having the expense of building or maintaining a fort or wintering over in the cold Rockies. In only a few weeks at a rendezvous a year's worth of trading and celebrating would take place as the traders took their furs and remaining supplies back east for the winter and the trappers faced another fall and winter with new supplies.

In 1830, William Sublette brought the first wagons carrying his trading goods up the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater River (Wyoming) before crossing over South Pass to a fur trade rendezvous on the Green River near the future town of Big Piney, Wyoming. He had a crew that dug out the gullies and river crossings and cleared the brush where needed. This established that the eastern part of most of the Oregon Trail was passable by wagons. In the late 1830s the Hudson's Bay Company instituted a policy intended to destroy or weaken the American fur trade companies. The Hudson's Bay Company's annual collection and re-supply Snake River Expedition was transformed to a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to undersell the American traders‚Äîlosing money but undercutting the American fur traders. By 1840 the fashion in Europe and Britain shifted away from the formerly very popular beaver felt hats and prices for furs rapidly declined and the trapping almost ceased. Map of the Green River watershed Fur traders tried to use the Platte River, the main route of the eastern Oregon Trail, for transport but soon gave up in frustration as its many channels and islands combined with its muddy waters were too shallow, crooked and unpredictable to use for water transport. The Platte proved to be unnavigable. The Platte River and North Platte River Valley, however, became an easy roadway for wagons, with its nearly flat plain sloping easily up and heading almost due west. There were several U.S. government sponsored explorers who explored part of the Oregon Trail and wrote extensively about their explorations. Captain Benjamin Bonneville on his expedition of 1832 to 1834 explored much of the Oregon trail and brought wagons up the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater route across South Pass to the Green River in Wyoming. He explored most of Idaho and the Oregon Trail to the Columbia. The account of his explorations in the west was published by Washington Irving in 1838.The Adventures of Captain Bonneville s:The Adventures of Captain Bonneville accessed 5 January 2009 John C. Fr√©mont of the U. S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers and his guide Kit Carson led three expeditions from 1842 to 1846 over parts of California and Oregon. His explorations were written up by him and his wife Jessie Benton Fr√©mont and were widely published.

Missionaries In 1834, The Dalles Methodist Mission was founded by Reverend Jason Lee just east of Mount Hood on the Columbia River. In 1836, Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman traveled west to establish the Whitman Mission near modern-day Walla Walla, Washington.The Oregon History Project: Protestant Ladder. Oregon Historical Society. Retrieved on February 19, 2008. The party included the wives of the two men, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding, who became the first European-American women to cross the Rocky Mountains. En route, the party accompanied American fur traders going to the 1836 rendezvous on the Green River in Wyoming and then joined Hudson's Bay Company fur traders traveling west to Fort Nez Perce (also called Fort Walla Walla). The group was the first to travel in wagons all the way to Fort Hall, Idaho, where the wagons were abandoned at the urging of their guides. They used pack animals for the rest of the trip to Fort Walla Walla and then floated by boat to Fort Vancouver to get supplies before returning to start their missions. Other missionaries, mostly husband and wife teams using wagon and pack trains, established missions in the Willamette Valley, as well as various locations in the future states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Oregon Country In 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley drafted the Organic Laws of Oregon organizing land claims within the Oregon Country. Married couples were granted at no cost (except for the requirement to work and improve the land) up to , and unmarried settlers could claim . As the group was a provisional government with no authority, these claims were not valid under United States or British law, but they were eventually honored by the United States in the Donation Land Act of 1850. The Donation Land Act provided for married settlers to be granted and unmarried settlers . Following the expiration of the act in 1854 the land was no longer free but cost $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare) with a limit of ‚Äîthe same as most other unimproved government land. Early emigrants On May 1, 1839, a group of eighteen men from Peoria, Illinois, set out with the intention of colonizing the Oregon country on behalf of the United States of America and drive out the Hudson's Bay Company operating there. The men of the Peoria Party were among the first pioneers to traverse most of the Oregon Trail. The men were initially led by Thomas J. Farnham and called themselves the Oregon Dragoons. They carried a large flag emblazoned with their motto \\"Oregon Or The Grave\\". Although the group split up near Bent's Fort on the South Platte and Farnham was deposed as leader, nine of their members eventually did reach Oregon.Oregon Emigrants 1839 In September 1840, Robert Newell, Joseph L. Meek, and their families reached Fort Walla Walla with three wagons that they had driven from Fort Hall. Their wagons were the first to reach the Columbia River over land, and they opened the final leg of Oregon Trail to wagon traffic. In 1841 the Bartleson-Bidwell Party was the first emigrant group credited with using the Oregon Trail to emigrate west. The group set out for California, but about half the party left the original group at Soda Springs, Idaho, and proceeded to the Willamette Valley in Oregon, leaving their wagons at Fort Hall. On May 16, 1842, the second organized wagon train set out from Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers.Members of the party later disagreed over the size of the party, one stating 160 adults and children were in the party, while another counted 105. The party was led by Elijah White. The group broke up after passing Fort Hall with most of the single men hurrying ahead and the families following later. Great Migration of 1843 In what was dubbed \\"The Great Migration of 1843\\" or the \\"Wagon Train of 1843\\",The Wagon Train of 1843: The Great Migration. Oregon Pioneers. Retrieved December 22, 2007.Events in The West: 1840‚Äì1850. PBS. Retrieved December 22, 2007. an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon. They were led initially by John Gantt, a former U.S. Army Captain and fur trader who was contracted to guide the train to Fort Hall for $1 per person. The winter before, Marcus Whitman had made a brutal mid-winter trip from Oregon to St. Louis to appeal a decision by his Mission backers to abandon several of the Oregon missions. He joined the wagon train at the Platte River for the return trip. When the pioneers were told at Fort Hall by agents from the Hudson's Bay Company that they should abandon their wagons there and use pack animals the rest of the way, Whitman disagreed and volunteered to lead the wagons to Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons. The biggest obstacle they faced was in the Blue Mountains of Oregon where they had to cut and clear a trail through heavy timber. The wagons were stopped at The Dalles, Oregon by the lack of a road around Mount Hood. The wagons had to be disassembled and floated down the treacherous Columbia River and the animals herded over the rough Lolo trail to get by Mt. Hood. Nearly all of the settlers in the 1843 wagon trains arrived in the Willamette Valley by early October. A passable wagon trail now existed from the Missouri River to The Dalles. In 1846, the Barlow Road was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but completely passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley--about 2,000 miles. Mormon emigration Following persecution and mob action in Missouri, Illinois, and other states, and the martyrdom of their prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, Mormon leader Brigham Young was chosen by the leaders of the Latter Day Saints (LDS) church to lead the LDS settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their Winter Quarters encampments near Omaha, Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in Iowa including Council Bluffs, Iowa.Mormons in Iowa towns map referenced 5 January 2009 About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from Mississippi, Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of immigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, Nebraska, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in Nebraska to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with no one left behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants did ‚Äî typically taking about 100 days to cover the trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about per day.) In Wyoming the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to Fort Bridger, where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the crude path established by the ill-fated Donner Party of 1846 into Utah and the Salt Lake Valley. Between 1847 and 1860 over 43,000 Mormon settlers and tens of thousands of travelers on the California Trail and Oregon Trail followed Young to Utah. After 1848, the travelers headed to California or Oregon resupplied at the Salt Lake Valley, and then went back over the Salt Lake Cutoff, rejoining the trail near the future Idaho-Utah border at the City of Rocks in Idaho. Starting in 1855, many of the poorer Mormon travelers made the trek with hand built handcarts and fewer wagons. Guided by experienced guides, handcarts--pulled and pushed by two to four people--were as fast as oxen- pulled wagons and allowed them to bring of possessions plus some food, bedding, and tents to Utah. Accompanying wagons carried more food and supplies. Upon arrival in Utah, the handcart pioneers were given or found jobs and accommodations by individual Mormon families for the winter until they could become established. About 3,000 out of over 60,000 Mormon pioneers came across with handcarts. Along the Mormon Trail, the Mormon pioneers established a number of ferries and made trail improvements to help later travelers and earn much needed money. One of the better known ferries was the Mormon Ferry across the North Platte near the future site of Fort Caspar in Wyoming which operated between 1848 and 1852 and the Green River ferry near Fort Bridger which operated from 1847 to 1856. The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll of from $3.00 to $8.00. California Gold Rush In January 1848, James Marshall discovered a small nugget of gold in the American River, sparking the California Gold Rush. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the male population in Oregon went to California in 1848 to cash in on the early gold discoveries. To get there, they helped build the Lassen Branch of the Applegate-Lassen Trail by cutting a wagon road through extensive forests. Many returned with significant gold which helped jump-start the Oregon economy. Over the next decade, gold seekers from the Midwestern United States and East Coast of the United States started rushing overland and dramatically increased traffic on the Oregon and California Trails. The \\"forty-niners\\" often chose speed over safety and opted to use shortcuts such as the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff in Wyoming which reduced travel time by almost seven days but spanned nearly of desert without water, grass, or fuel for fires. 1849 was the first year of large scale cholera epidemics in the United States, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California‚Äîmost buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska. The 1850 census showed this rush was overwhelmingly male: the ratio of women to men in California over 16 years was about 1:18. After 1849 the rush continued for several years as the California miners continued to find about $50,000,000 worth of gold per year at $21 per ounce.Greeley, Horace. An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco in the Summer of 1859. XXXIV. Later emigration and uses of the trail Overall it is estimated that over 400,000 pioneers used the Oregon Trail and its three primary offshoots, the California, Bozeman, and Mormon Trails. The trail was still in use during the Civil War, but traffic declined after 1855 when the Panama Railroad across the Isthmus of Panama was completed. Paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships, often heavily subsidized to carry the mail, provided rapid transport to and from the east coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to and from Panama to ports in California and Oregon. Over the years many ferries were established to help get across the many rivers on the path of the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, Kansas River, Little Blue River, Elkhorn River, Loup River, Platte River, South Platte River, North Platte River, Laramie River, Green River, Bear River, two crossings of the Snake River, John Day River, Deschutes River, Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30.00 per wagon but increased the speed of the transit from about 160‚Äì170 days in 1843 to 120‚Äì140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent death by drowning at river crossings.Unruh:op. cit. pp 410 In April 1859, an expedition of U. S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers led by Captain James H. Simpson left Camp Floyd (Utah) to establish an army supply route across the Great Basin to the eastern slope of the Sierras. Upon return in early August, Simpson reported that he had surveyed the Central Overland Route from Camp Floyd (Utah) to Genoa, Nevada. This route went through central Nevada (roughly where U.S. Route 50 goes today) and was about 280 miles shorter than the 'standard' Humboldt River California trail route. The Central Route in Nevada The Army improved the trail for use by wagons and stagecoaches in 1859 and 1860. Starting in 1860, the American Civil War closed the heavily subsidized Butterfield Overland Mail stage Southern Route through the deserts of the American Southwest. In 1860‚Äì1861 the Pony Express, employing riders traveling on horseback day and night with relay stations about every ten miles to supply fresh horses, was established from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The Pony Express built many of their eastern stations along the Oregon/California/Mormon/Bozeman trails and many of their western stations along the very sparsely settled Central Route across Utah and Nevada.Pony Express Trail map Accessed 28 January 2009 The Pony Express delivered mail summer and winter in roughly ten days from the midwest to California. In 1861 John Butterfield, who since 1858 had been using the Butterfield Overland Mail, also switched to the Central Route to avoid traveling through hostile territories during the American Civil War. George Chorpenning immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line along with their stations from the \\"Northern Route\\" along the Humboldt River. In 1861 the Transcontinental Telegraph also laid its lines alongside the Central Overland Route. Several stage lines were set up carrying mail and passengers that traversed much of the route of the original Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger and from there over the Central Overland Route to California. By traveling day and night with many stations and changes of teams (and extensive mail subsidies) these stages could get passengers and mail from the midwest to California in about 25‚Äì28 days. These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Oregon Trail and Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the First Transcontinental Telegraph stations and telegraph line which followed much the same route in 1861 from Carson City, Nevada to Salt Lake City, Utah. The Pony Express folded in 1861 as they failed to receive an expected mail contract from the U.S. government and the telegraph filled the need for rapid east-west communication. This combination wagon/stagecoach/pony express/telegraph line route is labeled the Pony Express National Historic Trail on the National Trail Map. From Salt Lake City the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon/California/Oregon trails to Omaha, Nebraska. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 all the telegraph lines usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and telegraph lines were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. Telegraph lines to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned. As the years passed the Oregon Trail became a heavily used corridor from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots of the trail continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 the population in the states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences. Even before the famous Texas cattle drives after the Civil War, the trail was being used to drive herds of thousands of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years. In 1852 there were even records of a 1,500 turkey drive from Illinois to California.Barry, Louise. The Beginnings of the West. 1972. pp 1084‚Äì85 The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the midwest and at the end of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the midwest for about 1/3 to 1/10 what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the trail large herds of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets. Trail decline The first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, providing faster, safer, and usually cheaper travel east and west (the journey took seven days and cost as little as $65).Railroad ticket 1870 accessed 21 January 2009 Some emigrants continued to use the trail well into the 1890s, and modern highways and railroads eventually paralleled large portions of the trail, including U.S. Highway 26, Interstate 84 in Oregon and Idaho and Interstate 80 in Nebraska. Contemporary interest in the overland trek has prompted the states and federal government to preserve landmarks on the trail including wagon ruts, buildings, and \\"registers\\" where emigrants carved their names. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a number of re-enactments of the trek with participants wearing period garments and traveling by wagon.

The incidence of ocular trauma due to blast forces has increased dramatically with the introduction of new explosives technology into modern warfare. The availability of these volatile materials, coupled with the tactics of contemporary terrorism, has caused a rise in the number of homemade bombs capable of extreme physical harm. Military classification of improvised explosive devices The United States Department of Defense classifies IEDs as explosive machines that are constructed exclusively (i.e., without mass production) and result in the direct physical harm of surrounding individuals. The use of these bombs by insurgents has been the number one cause of death and injury among Coalition soldiers since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in April 2003.Ramasamy A, Harrisson SE, Clasper JC, Stewart MP., Injuries from roadside improvised explosive devices. J Trauma 2008; 65(4):910-4. Detonation of the IED occurs remotely or as victim-induced mechanical disturbance.Weichel ED, Coyler MH. Combat ocular trauma and systemic injury. Curr Opin Ophthalmol 2008; 19(6):519-25.Wolf SJ, Bebarta MV, Bonnet CJ. Blast injuries. Lancet 2009; 374(9687):405-15. Further classification of IEDs falls under the mechanism of delivery ‚Äì vehicle-based, boat-borne, animal-borne, suicide bomber ‚Äì and the resultant effect upon detonation: * Explosive: Bombs of this nature incorporate chemicals and substances that result in the formation of a large blast; may incorporate pyrotechnics. Often employs shrapnel to inflict harm by mechanical trauma. * Incendiary: utilize highly exothermic chemical processes to initiate the rapid spread of fire and pyrotechnic damage * Chemical: Bombs in this class include noxious chemical materials that may cause a patho-physiological response in individuals exposed to the blast area during and post-explosion. * Biological: Much like the chemical-type, with the exception that biological bombs use vector-borne pathogens or other biohazardous materials to initiate a patho- physiological response in exposed individuals.United States Department of Defense., Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms. 2008, amended 2011. 171. Explosion physics The discharge of a bomb is characterized by the near-instantaneous sublimation of solids or rapid vaporization of liquids into the gas phase. The amount of explosive materials used, the concentration and identity of secondary materials incorporated into bomb design, and the location and height of bomb placement all determine the magnitude of the explosion. The gas formed displaces the surrounding medium ‚Äì usually air ‚Äì and causes a dramatic increase in pressure that forms a characteristic blast wave, often referred to as the leading shock wave. Physically, this wave is characterized as a non- linear, discontinuous wave front that features infinite amplitude and accompanying acoustic pressure wave that may generate a pressure as high as 100MPa in a time as short as one microsecond. This peak pressure, or blast overpressure point, generates a positive pressure during blast wave propagation and results in the dispersal of positive pressure across the blast radius. This positive pressure phase is immediately followed by a period of negative pressure relative to pre-blast conditions; this phase may also account for injuries sustained during a blast.Leonardi ADC, Bir CA, Ritzel DV, VandeVord PJ. Intracranial pressure increases during exposure to a shock wave. J Neurotrauma. 2011. 2011. 28(1):85-94.Nakagawa A, Manley GT, Gean AD.

Accepted for publication; available online at http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/neu.2010.1442 =Impact of explosion upon individuals in the blast radius= The prevalence of mines in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom has made them the most frequent mechanism of injury behind the traumatic ‚Äúsignature‚Äù in modern warfare, blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). Whereas body armor has lowered the incidence of death due to collapse of gas-filled organs (the most frequent cause of blast-related deaths prior to Operation Desert Storm) healthcare providers must now develop methods for treating bTBI. Despite their frequency on the warfront, the home-produced nature of these mines makes classifying patient presentations difficult for military healthcare providers. The majority of lethal bTBIs reveal axonal shearing as the mechanism of fatality, with the greatest amount of nerve fiber and vascular shearing occurring in the frontal and temporal lobes. Biophysicists have implicated acoustic impedance, or the ratio of acoustic pressure to particle velocity, as a factor contributing to blast damage in vivo. Wave transitions between tissues with significantly different acoustic impedances, particularly between the external environment and bone, causes focal mechanical damage as a result of wave energy dissipation. Current research has implicated the importance of a histological component in blast trauma; patients exposed to blast waves often present with elongation and/or splitting of cells due to the shear stress of a shockwave. This cellular damage often follows the direction of wave propagation. Patient distance from the epicenter, materials employed in the bomb design, and confinement of the bomb all determine the degree of trauma incurred by patients exposed to bombings. Additionally, skull size and geometry, the degree of tissue penetration by the wave, and a possible ‚Äúlens effect‚Äù due to wave reflection upon incidence with the concave calvarium and/or dissipation in the gas-filled sinuses may further complicate wave transmission. Additionally, researchers have implicated both the auditory canals and the orbitals as potential routes for wave propagation into the central nervous systemNakagawa A, Manley GT, Gean AD.

Blast-related ocular trauma  Ocular trauma is the fourth most common injury sustained in military combat today. In a pool of 387 randomly selected soldiers injured by blast trauma in Operation Iraqi Freedom, 329 (89%) sustained ocular trauma. Emergency treatment of resulting injuries falls under the realm of emergency care and effective patient triage, often incorporating protocols for blunt and penetrating trauma. As a result, physicians have devised a concise algorithm for the treatment of patients with ocular injuries secondary to blast trauma. =Mechanism of injury= Ocular trauma may result from primary blast exposure. Spallation forces arise as the blast wave displaces a dense medium across a less dense interface, and inertial forces may cause displacement of optical structures. Primary blast ocular trauma therefore comprises non- penetrating mechanical injuries such as hyphemas, ruptured globes, conjunctival hemorrhage, serous retinitis, and orbital fracture.Harlan JB, Pieramici DJ. Evaluation of patients with ocular trauma. Ophthalmol Clin North Am. 2002; 15(2):153-61. However, ocular trauma most commonly falls under the realm of secondary blast injuries, in which debris displaced by the blast overpressure and resultant blast wave causes physical trauma to the eye and/or orbital. Therefore, secondary blast ocular trauma is distinguished by penetrating- or blunt-force injury to any of structural component of the eye or orbital; open globe injuries, adnexal lacerations of the lacrimal system, eyelids, and eyebrows comprise the majority of injuries in this group. Skull flexure Within the last two decades, researchers have reconsidered the role of the skull in bTBI. While it was originally considered that the skull remained static upon contact with the primary wave front, clinically significant skull flexure has been documented in vivo with rats exposed to blast waves and with model human heads exposed to blast conditions. In contact with a blast wave, the skull becomes elastic due to its deformable foundation ‚Äì the external environment, the cerebrospinal fluid of the dura, and the brain itself. During a blast, the brain collides with the dynamic skull and rebounds in accordance with localized cranial pressure spikes. This trauma may account for the localized axonal injuries that characterize bTBI. Chavko et al. (2010) explored cranial position as a function of bTBI severity, finding that rats directly facing the blast wave front featured the highest intracranial amplitude and pressure duration periods (in comparison with rats perpendicular to the wave front and those facing away from the blast wave) Alessandra Dal Cengio Leonardi‚Äôs group at Wayne State University expanded upon the skull flexure hypothesis in rat models, further correlating increased age and body mass to increases in intracranial pressure for rats in front-facing bTBI. Chavko‚Äôs group remarked further on the role of Kevlar armor in fluid pressure damage to neurovasculature, finding that subcortical hemorrhage seen in bTBI patients has been linked to local pressurization rather than vascular hydrodynamics.Long JB, Bentley TL, Wessner KA, Cerone C, Sweeny S, Bauman RA. Blast overpressure in rats: Recreating a battlefield injury in the laboratory. J Neurotrauma. 2009. 26:827-40. Assessment and treatment in the military setting The majority of blast-related ocular injuries occur in soldiers who present with other life-threatening injuries that require immediate intervention. Current Combat Support Hospital (CSH) protocol requires the surgical stabilization of any life-threatening injuries, as well as hemodynamic stability, prior to initial eye evaluation and surgical repair. Therefore, initiation of emergency ophthalmic care often occurs hours after injury. Initial examination by a military ophthalmologist begins with gross examination of each eye and orbital. 73-82% of all ocular injuries resulting from mine explosions are due to fragmentation of shrapnel upon detonation, so gross anatomical inspection by penlight may not rule out open globe injury. Harlan JB, Pieramici DJ. Evaluation of patients with ocular trauma. Ophthalmol Clin North Am. 2002; 15(2):153-61./ref> Computerized tomography (CT) may detect foreign matter and aid the clinician in determining the presence of an open-globe injury. =Closed globe injuries= Current military standard employs the Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology System (BETTS) and Ocular Trauma Classification Group to define and treat blast injuries. Trauma is further split into two distinct groups: closed globe injury and open globe trauma. Treatment of closed globe trauma begins with the division of the eye into zones, each with unique anatomical structures and injury patterns: * Zone I: the conjunctiva and corneal surface; the most common injuries seen in this zone are foreign debris retention by the conjunctiva or corneal epithelium/stroma, as well as corneal abrasions. The Seidel test may be used to evaluate the status of the anterior chamber, thereby determining the presence of corneal perforation and pathological anterior chamber leakage. * Zone II: region designated by the anterior chamber, lens, and pars plicata; the most common injuries sustained in this region are hyphemas and traumatic cataracts. Application of the Seidel Test in Zone I will rule out seepage of the anterior chamber through a corneal perforation, while introduction of topical agents may reduce detected increases in intraocular pressure. Depending on the severity of other bodily injuries, the military ophthalmologist may conduct an anterior chamber washout to clear hyphemas. However, reconstruction of the anterior chamber and cataract surgery is often reserved for treatment in tertiary clinical centers. * Zone III: this zone contains the vitreous cavity, retina, and optic nerve; injuries commonly observed in this region are vitreous hemorrhage, traumatic macular holes, retinal detachment, and optic nerve injury. Injury to the optic nerve requires neuro-ophthalmic examination, and may require neurosurgical intervention in the military hospital setting depending on the severity of the injury. =Open Globe Injuries= The presence of an open globe injuries may be determined by clinical examination and CT. However, full globe exploration with 360-degree removal of the conjunctiva (periotomy), separation of the rectus muscles, and subsequent examination of the sclera remains the most effective way to determine whether or not the globe has been injured. During exploratory surgery, foreign debris may be removed with microsurgical tools by inspection under the operating room microscope. Globe lacerations are typically repaired as far posteriorly as possible to prevent any further deficits in visual acuity. Lacerations posterior to the exposed area are not sutured; attempts to seal these injuries often results in the extrusion of intraocular components. Healing of these injuries occurs naturally by scarring of dorsal orbital fat to the sclera. If a clinically significant increase in intraocular pressure is detected with orbital compartment syndrome, the ophthalmologist may perform an emergency canthotomy on the lateral canthus. Canalicular injuries, as well as lid lacerations, are also commonly repaired in the military hospital setting. Suturing the laceration after the removal of foreign bodies depends on the location of global fissure: 10-0 nylon with cyanoacrylate glue is commonly used on the cornea, and processed human pericardium may be employed if it is surgically available. Globe closure of the limbus and sclera requires 9-0 and 8-0 nylon, respectively. If damage to the globe is irreparable, the ophthalmologist may conduct a primary enucleation, evisceration (ophthalmology), or exenteration in the combat hospital. 14% of globe injuries sustained during Operation Iraqi Freedom have required enucleation. Implantation of an oculoplastic silicone sphere or similar device commonly follows these procedures. Post-Operative Care Post-operative care for patients with blast-related ocular trauma occurs in tertiary care facilities. Patients with closed globe injuries require observation and follow-up examination with an optometrist, including slit lamp microscope and dilated fundus inspection. Those who have been treated for open-globe repairs often experience a delay of post-operative treatment that ranges from 10‚Äì14 days after injury. This period is due to the treatment of other life-threatening injuries, as well as the necessity for accurate estimation of visual acuity outside of inflammation due to injury and surgical intervention. In patients with facial burns, exposure keratopathy, or chronic epiphora, an ophthalmologist may suggest eyelid reconstruction surgery. Depending on the severity of physical trauma sustained, surgical realignment of the extraocular muscles may relieve strabismus. Realignment of the extraocular muscles is also indicated in chronic diplopia that occurs within 20-degrees of the visual field. All patients that have sustained a traumatic brain injury in the absence of ocular trauma are still recommended to obtain examination by an optometrist. Outside of the treatment facility, these patients must monitor any signs of late-onset ocular pathologies secondary to the bTBI, including decreased visual/reading ability and speed, photophobia, blurred vision, reduced accommodation abilities, and headaches. =Visual Outcomes= Visual outcomes for patients with ocular trauma due to blast injuries vary, and prognoses depend upon the type of injury sustained. The majority of poor visual outcomes arise from perforating injuries: only 21% of patients with perforating injuries with pre-operative light perception had a final best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than 20/200. Collectively, patients who experienced choroidal hemorrhage, perforated or penetrated globes, retinal detachment, traumatic optic neuropathy, and subretinal macular hemorrhage carried the highest incidence rates of BCVAs worse than 20/200. Reports from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) indicate that 42% of soldiers with globe injuries of any kind had a BCVA greater than or equal to 20/40 six months after injury, and soldiers with intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs) retained 20/40 or better vision in 52% of studied cases. Globe perforation, oculoplastic intervention, and neuro-ophthalmic injuries contribute significantly to reported poor visual outcomes. 21% of tertiary centers treating patients exposed to blast trauma reported traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) in their patients, although avulsion of the optic nerve and TON were reported in only 3% of combat injuries. In the event that a victim of globe penetrating trauma cannot perceive any light within two weeks of surgical intervention, the ophthalmologist may choose to enucleate as a preventative measure against sympathetic ophthalmia. However, this procedure is extremely rare, and current reports indicate that only one soldier in OIF has undergone enucleation in a tertiary care facility to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia. Prevention =Eye armor= Prevention of ocular trauma is most effective when soldiers wear polycarbonate eye armor correctly in the battlefield. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Military have made Ballistic Laser Protective Spectacles (BLPS), Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), and Sun/Wind/Dust Goggles (SWDG) available to combatants and associated personnel. These forms of eye protection are available in non-prescription and prescription lenses, and their use has been made mandatory at all times when soldiers are in areas of potential conflict. Despite their proven record of protection against secondary blast trauma, soldier compliance remains low: 85% of soldiers afflicted ocular trauma in the first year of OEF were not wearing their protective lenses at the time of detonation. While 41% of soldiers could not recall whether or not they were wearing eye protection at the time of detonation, 17% of casualties were wearing eye protection while 26% of casualties were not. Among this group, the poorest visual prognoses were documented in individuals who did not wear eye protection.Thomas R, McManus JG, Johnson A, Mayer P, Wade C, Holcomb JB. Ocular injury reduction from ocular protection use in current combat operations. J Trauma. 2009. 66(4):S99-S103. The lack of compliance has been attributed to complaints about comfort, stylishness, and ‚Äúmisting‚Äù of the lenses when in the field. BLPS and SPECS offer the same line of protection against secondary trauma as the SWD goggles, and these lenses may overcome the complaints many soldiers have with their military-issue goggles. =Eye Armor and the Primary Blast Wave Trauma= Despite the success of goggles and lenses against ballistic and secondary trauma, BLPS, SPECS, and SWDG forms of eye armor do not protect against primary-blast injuries. The space between the lenses and the eyes promotes sonic wave diffraction, and current efforts to eradicate ocular trauma due to the primary blast wave have been unsuccessful due to this lens- eye air interface. =Helmet Design and Blast-Related Traumatic Brain Injury= Additionally, current researchers have correlated helmet design to an amplification of waves that may cause bTBI. Moss et al. (2009) used model human heads outfitted with helmets approved for use in OEF and OIF and subjected them to blast waves at 194G for 2.1 milliseconds. These helmets, the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) feature a mesh netting that offers comfort between the wearer‚Äôs head and the helmet‚Äôs Kevlar shell. While effective against ballistic trauma, Moss‚Äôs group reported that skull flexure is amplified by the air interface between the helmet and the skull. This space may amplify the effects of bTBI, and the group suggested that a foam connection between the helmet and the wearer‚Äôs head may diminish the effects of the peak pressure wave during an explosion. =BrainPort Vision Device= A tremendous amount of the research surrounding war-related ocular trauma has come from the Academic Department of Military Surgery and Trauma (ADMST) In conjunction with Wicab Industries, the ADMST has developed the BrainPort Vision Device, a sensory substitute for soldiers blinded in service. The device uses the tongue, coupled with a camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses, to provide the user with an electrotactile depiction of the environment. After calibration and practice, the user may interpret objects, shapes, and patterns in their immediate surroundings.

Rainer Printing Company 1908. ASIN: B000861WA8 The historic Oregon Trail connected various towns along the Missouri River to Oregon's Willamette Valley. It was used during the 19th century by Great Plains pioneers who were seeking fertile land in the West and North. As the trail developed it became marked by numerous cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary. While the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was Independence, Missouri, or Kansas City (Missouri), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across Kansas, and some towns became starting points, including Weston, Missouri, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Atchison, Kansas, St. Joseph, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska. The Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was Oregon City, at the time the proposed capital of the Oregon Territory. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity. At dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later. Numerous other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of California; and the Bozeman Trail to Montana. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail there were numerous variations, with other trails eventually established on both sides of the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may be between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast. Remnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the entire trail is a designated National Historic Trail (listed as the Oregon National Historic Trail). Missouri Initially, the main \\"jumping off point\\" was the common head of the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail‚ÄîIndependence, Missouri/Kansas City, Kansas. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day Topeka, Kansas, they ferried across the Kansas River to start the trek across Kansas and points west. Another busy \\"jumping off point\\" was St. Joseph, Missouri‚Äîestablished in 1843. In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to St. Louis, Missouri, and other ports on the combined Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi River systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the Union Pacific Railroad was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin,Old Franklin Missouri accessed 13 January 2010 Arrow Rock, and Fort Osage. Iowa In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson purchased from France the Louisiana Purchase for fifteen million dollars (equivalent to about $230 million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of Iowa and Missouri, located west of the Mississippi River and east of the Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805-1806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk (Sac) Indians and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa Territory. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President Martin Van Buren on July 4, 1838, signed laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the Platte and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the Fur trapper rendezvous traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the Mormons, expelled from Nauvoo, Illinois, traversed Iowa (on part of the Mormon Trail) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of Nebraska at their Winter Quarters near the future city of Omaha, Nebraska. (See: Missouri River settlements (1846‚Äì1854)) The Mormons established about 50 temporary towns, including the town of Kanesville (renamed Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1852) on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the mouth of the Platte. For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction, Kanesville and other towns become major \\"jumping off places\\" and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River, and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large Pottawattamie County, Iowa District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.) By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha, Nebraska (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and \\"jumping off places\\" for travelers on the Mormon, California, Oregon and other trails west. Kansas Map of principal rivers in Kansas Starting initially in Independence or Kansas City in Missouri, the initial trail followed the Santa Fe Trail into Kansas south of the Wakarusa River. After crossing Mount Oread at Lawrence, the trail crossed the Kansas River by ferry or boats near Topeka, and crossed the Wakarusa and Vermillion rivers by ferries. After the Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to Nebraska paralleling the Little Blue River until reaching the south side of the Platte River. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing. Nebraska Chimney Rock, Nebraska Those emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in Missouri or Iowa used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in Nebraska. Several towns in Nebraska were used as \\"jumping off places\\" with Omaha eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. Fort Kearny (est. 1848) is about from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the Platte River west. The army-maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort. Map showing the Platte River watershed, including the North Platte and South Platte tributaries The Platte River and the North Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was \\"too thin to plow and too thick to drink\\". While unusable for transport, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and buffalo chips for fuel.Mattes, Merrill J. The Great Platte River Road. Bison Books, 1987. The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about wide and deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte River with its muddy and treacherous crossings using one of about three ferries (in dry years it could sometimes be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River valley to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. After crossing over the South Platte the travelers encountered Ash Hollow with its steep descent down Windlass Hill. In the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of bison migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried jerky for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Indians fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte river. Travelers gathered and ignited dried buffalo chips to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River valley into present-day Wyoming heading to Fort Laramie. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of Casper, Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.Pictures of Oregon Trail in Nebraska Accessed 22 February 2009 Notable landmarks in Nebraska include Courthouse and Jail Rocks, Chimney Rock, Scotts Bluff, and Ash Hollow State Historical Park.Nebraska's branch of Oregon-California trail Association Accessed 22 February 2009 Today much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along Interstate 80 from Wyoming to Grand Island, Nebraska. From there U.S. Highway 30 which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.NPS road guide Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming accessed 8 February 2010 =Cholera on the Platte River= Because of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years (1849‚Äì1855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. There are many cases cited where a person would be alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall. Fort Laramie marked the end of most cholera outbreaks. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal‚Äîup to 30% of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.\\"Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails\\". Overland Journal, Volume 6, Number 1, 1988; Peter D. Olch; Pp. 25‚Äì31; The cause of cholera, ingesting the Vibrio cholerae bacterium from contaminated water,Causes of Cholera and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Literally hundreds of travelers on the combined California, Oregon, and Mormon Trails succumbed to cholera in the 1849-1855 time period. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Colorado A branch of the Oregon Trail crossed the very northeast corner of Colorado if they followed the South Platte River to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present-day Julesburg, Colorado before entering Wyoming. Later settlers to much of what became the state of Colorado followed the Platte and South Platte rivers into their settlements there. Wyoming After crossing the South Platte River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. Fort Laramie, at the junction of the Laramie River and the North Platte River, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.Chronological List of Fort Laramie History It was the last army outposts till travelers reached the coast. Independence RockAfter crossing the South Platte the trail continues up the North Platte River, crossing many small swift flowing creeks. As the North Platte veers to the south the trail crosses the North Platte to the Sweetwater River valley which heads almost due west. Independence Rock is located on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the Continental Divide at South Pass, Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing Big Sandy Creek (about wide and deep) before hitting the Green River. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The swift and treacherous Green River, which eventually empties into the Colorado River, was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green the main trail continues on in an approximate southwest direction until it encounters the Blacks Fork of the Green River and Fort Bridger, Wyoming. From Fort Bridger the Mormon Trail continued southwest following the upgraded Hastings Cutoff through the Wasatch Mountains. From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the Bear River Valley.http://www.blm.gov/heritage/adventures/research/StatePages/PDFs/Wyoming/wyoming_5.pdf The trail turned north following the Bear River past the terminus of the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff at Smiths Fork and on to the Thomas Fork Valley at the present Wyoming-Idaho border. Over time, two major heavily used cutoffs were established in Wyoming. The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff was established in 1844 and cut about off the main route. It leaves the main trail about west of South Pass and heads almost due west crossing Big Sandy Creek and then about of waterless, very dusty desert before reaching the Green River near the present town of La Barge. Ferries here transferred them across the Green River. From there the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff trail had to cross a mountain range to connect with the main trail near Cokeville, Wyoming in the Bear River valley.Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff Map The Lander Road, formally the Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake Wagon Road, was established and built by U.S. government contractors in 1858-59. It was about shorter than the main trail through Fort Bridger with good grass, water, firewood and fishing but it was a much steeper and rougher route, crossing three mountain ranges. In 1859, 13,000 of the 19,000Unruh: page 119‚Äì120 emigrants traveling to California and Oregon utilized the Lander Road. The traffic in later years is undocumented. The Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the Thompson Pass in the Wyoming Range. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another pass on the Salt River Range of mountains and then descending into Star Valley Wyoming. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about south of the town of Smoot, Wyoming. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming-Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the Salt River (which drains into the Snake River) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River valley (Star Valley) about north the road turned almost due west near the present town of Auburn, Wyoming, and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest till it crossed the Caribou Mountains and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake.Grays Lake accessed 8 February 2010 The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternately, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of Soda Springs, Idaho.Lander Road Cutoff Map\\"Emigrant Trails of Southern Idaho\\"; Bureau of Land Management & Idaho State Historical Society;1993; pp 117‚Äì125 ASIN: B000KE2KTU Numerous landmarks are located along the trail in Wyoming including Independence Rock, Ayres Natural Bridge and Register Cliff. Utah In 1847, Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by Lansford Hastings to the Donner Party in 1846 through the Wasatch Mountains into Utah.Salt Lake Cutoff accessdate=17 September 2009 After getting into Utah they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities‚Äîincluding Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1848, the Salt Lake Cutoff was established by Sam Hensley, and returning members of the Mormon Battalion providing a path north of the Great Salt Lake from Salt Lake City back to the California and Oregon Trails. This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the City of Rocks near the Utah-Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon bound travelers. Located about half way on both the California and Oregon Trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one \\"detoured\\" to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the Weber, Bear and Malad rivers which were used mostly by Oregon or California bound travelers. Idaho The main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the Bear River valley which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by an impassable (then) cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.Big Hill Idaho (OCTA Idaho) accessed 5 February 2009 (Much later, U.S. Highway 30, using modern explosives and equipment, was built through this cut). In 1852 Eliza Ann McAuley found and with help developed the McAuley Cutoff which bypassed much of the difficult climb and descent of Big Hill. About on they passed present day Montpelier, Idaho which is now the site of The National Oregon-California Trail Center.The National Oregon-California Trail Center Accessed 25 February 2009 The trail follows the Bear River northwest to present day Soda Springs, Idaho. The soda springs here were a favorite attraction of the pioneers who marveled at the hot carbonated water and chugging \\"steamboat\\" springs. Many stopped and did their laundry in the hot water as there was usually plenty of good grass and fresh water available.Soda Springs quotes Idaho State Historical Society Accessed 25 February 2009 Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for The Great Salt Lake and the main trail turns northwest to follow the Portneuf River valley to Fort Hall Idaho. Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the Snake River. It was established in 1832 by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth and company and later sold in 1837 to the British Hudson's Bay Company. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about , taking nine to twelve days. At Soda Springs was one branch of Lander Road (established and built with government contractors in 1858) which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day Auburn, Wyoming and entering Idaho. From there it proceeded northwest into Idaho up Stump Creek canyon for about . One branch turned almost 90 degrees and proceeded southwest to Soda Springs. Another branch headed almost due west past Gray‚Äôs Lake to rejoin the main trail about west of Fort Hall. On the main trail about west of Soda Springs Hudspeth's Cutoff (established 1849 and used mostly by California trail users) took off from the main trail heading almost due west, bypassing Fort Hall. It rejoined the California Trail at Cassia Creek near the City of Rocks.Hudspeth cutoff map (OCTA-Idaho) Accessed 5 February 2009 Hudspeth's Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it helped spread out the traffic during peak periods, making more grass available.For an Oregon-California trail map up to the junction in Idaho see Oregon National Historic Trail Map NPS . Accessed 28 January 2009. West of Fort Hall the main trail traveled about on the south side of the Snake River southwest past American Falls, Massacre Rocks, Register Rock and Coldwater Hill near present-day Pocatello, Idaho. Near the junction of the Raft River and the Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about southwest past present day Almo, Idaho. This trail then passed through the City of Rocks and over Granite Pass where it went southwest along Goose Creek, Little Goose Creek, and Rock Spring Creek. It went about through Thousand Springs Valley, West Brush Creek, and Willow Creek, before arriving at the Humboldt River in northeastern Nevada near present-day Wells.Northern Nevada and Utah, Southern Idaho Trail Map Accessed 9 February 2009 The California Trail proceeded west down the Humboldt before reaching and crossing the Sierra Nevadas. There are only a few places where the Snake River has not buried itself deep in a canyon. There are few spots where the river slowed down enough to make a crossing possible. Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale‚Äôs Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail. Some lost their wagons and teams over the falls. The trails on the north side joined the trail from Three Island Crossing about west of Glenns Ferry on the north side of the Snake River.Oregon Trail North Side Alternate Accessed 25 February 2009 (For map of North Side Alternate see: Accessed 25 February 2009) Goodale's Cutoff, established in 1862 on the north side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Indians and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the Lost River part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of Arco, Idaho and wound through the northern part of Craters of the Moon National Monument. From there it went southwest to Camas Prairie and ended at Old Fort Boise on the Boise River. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough, lava restricted roads and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, which caused the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along U.S. Highway 20, U.S. Highway 26 and U.S. Highway 93 between Craters of the Moon National Monument and Carey, Idaho.Goodale‚Äôs Cutoff NPS Accessed 22 February 2009 View across top of Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho (Timothy H. O'Sullivan, 1874) From the present site of Pocatello the trail proceeded almost due west on the south side of the Snake River for about . On this route they passed Cauldron Linn rapids, Shoshone Falls, two falls near the present city of Twin Falls, Idaho, and Upper Salmon Falls on the Snake River. At Salmon Falls there were often a hundred or more Indians fishing who would trade for their salmon‚Äîa welcome treat. The trail continued west to Three Island Crossing (near present-day Glenns Ferry, Idaho).Three Island Crossing photos Accessed 22 February 2009Three Island Crossing quotes Accessed 22 February 2009 Here most emigrants used the divisions of the river caused by three islands to cross the difficult and swift Snake River by ferry or by driving or sometimes floating their wagons and swimming their teams across. The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or ensnarl the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.Three Mile Island Crossing Park Accessed 22 February 2009 The north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about 130 miles long. The usually lush Boise River valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Indian boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river‚Äîthey knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. Today's Idaho Interstate 84 roughly follows the Oregon Trail till it leaves the Snake River near Burley, Idaho. From there Interstate 86 to Pocatello roughly approximates the trail. Highway 30 roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from there to Montpelier, Idaho. Starting in about 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day Ontario, Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water. Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River.National Trail Map accessed 22 February 2009 Today's Idaho State Route 78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail. In 1869 the Central Pacific established Kelton, Utah as a railhead and the terminus of the western mail was moved from Salt Lake City. The Kelton Road became important as a communication and transportation road to the Boise Basin. Oregon Once across the Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise the weary travelers traveled across what would become the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the Malheur River and then past Farewell Bend on the Snake River, up the Burnt River canyon and northwest to the La Grande valley before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the Whitman Mission near Fort Nez Perce in Washington until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day Pendleton, Oregon, crossing the Umatilla River, John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles. Arriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the Cascade Mountains and Mount Hood, some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the Columbia River. Once they transited the Cascade's Columbia River Gorge with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the portage around the Cascade Rapids before coming out near the Willamette River where Oregon City, Oregon was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough Lolo Pass. Several Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved through the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5.00 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River. In Central Oregon there was the Santiam Wagon Road (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The Applegate Trail (established 1846) cutting off the California Trail from the Humboldt River in Nevada crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. Originally U.S. Route 99 (later renamed to Oregon Route 99) and Interstate 5 through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.

The orchestra was co- founded by Ernest Ansermet, Louis Fourestier and Alfred Cortot and gave its first concert on 19 October 1928 at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es.Nichols R. The Harlequin Years: music in Paris 1917-1929. Thames & Hudson, London, 2002. The financial support for the orchestra came from wealthy sponsors such as Gustave Lyon, director of Pleyel, two banker M√©nard brothers, and the Princess de Polignac. Members of the management board were Robert Lyon (general administrator), Charles Kiesgen (administrative secretary), Andr√© Schaeffner (artistic secretary) along with Henri Monnet and Jean Gehret. Financial difficulties forced the orchestra to become an association in mid 1931.Mousnier, J-P. Pierre Monteux. L‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris and Montr√©al, 1999. The aim of the new orchestra was to present less-known works of major composers as well as contemporary music and the central concert repertoire, playing to a high standard.Canarina, J. Pierre Monteux, Ma√Ætre. Amadeus Press, Pompton Plains & Cambridge, 2003, p105. The standard of the orchestra was considered to be high, partly due to the number of rehearsals before each concert.Coppola P. Dix-sept ans de musique √† Paris 1922-1939. Librairie F Rouge & Cie, Lausanne, 1944, p142. Of the eighty musicians chosen (out of 600 auditioned) the majority were under 25. From 1929 Pierre Monteux was invited by Cortot to become closely involved with the orchestra as artistic director and principal conductor. Monteux made his debut with them on 12 April that year, conducting a major spring festival; at the end of the first season the orchestra had given 63 concerts. The season also saw the first recording by the orchestra (although referred to as ‚ÄòGrand Orchestra Symphonique‚Äô): the premiere recording in May of The Rite of Spring, conducted by Monteux, at the refurbished Salle Pleyel. New works premiered by the orchestra included Rugby in 1928, Capriccio for piano and orchestra in 1929 both under Ansermet, Poulenc‚Äôs Concert Champ√™tre (with Wanda Landowska), Prokofiev‚Äôs 3rd symphony under Monteux; as well as Paris premieres of Jan√°ƒçek's Sinfonietta and fragments from Berg‚Äôs Wozzeck. The orchestra toured to Belgium and Holland in 1930, then in late 1931 to fifteen cities, including Hamburg, Cologne, Berlin, Dresden and Vienna; in 1932 to Brussels and in 1933 to Geneva.

Governor Cachup√≠n's courage and compassion during the War of San Diego Pond won him great respect among the Comanches, Utes, and Apaches. Because of this, he was able to maintain peaceful relations with nomadic tribes in the province. He created practical solutions for keeping the peace between the Amerindians and the Spanish. He also protected the right to the possession of lands by the people of New Mexico, including the Amerindians, fining and imprisoning those who occupied the lands of others under the theory that these lands were property of their inhabitants. =First Term= V√©lez Cachup√≠n was appointed governor of New Mexico in early 1749 and assumed the office in May of that year. After settling in New Mexico as governor, he noticed the frequent attacks the Comanches launched against the province's Spanish settlements. These attacks were not only dangerous because they resulted in kidnappings and the killing of settlers and their descendants in the province, they also impeded economic growth. The Indian population was higher than that of white people. To remedy this situation, V√©lez Cachupin decided to improve the quality of life of the indigenous people, hoping that they would respect him. In addition, he hoped that peaceful trade with the nomadic tribes would help the economy of New Mexico. As a result, in July 1750, a group of approximately 130 Comanches came to New Mexico and settled there temporarily in tents. Forty of them settled in Taos to trade hides and slaves with white traders. Although the governor agreed to the trade, he threatened to declare the war if, after trading with them, the Comanches attacked Pecos and Galisteo. This mistrust was normal because the Spanish of the province considered the Comanches of the southwestern United States to be their main enemy. The Comanches' chiefs agreed to this, but another group of Comanche armed with bows, spears, and guns, attacked Pecos in November. After hearing this news, V√©lez Cachupin led an army against the Comanches and began a search for them which lasted six days. He found a group of 145 Comanches, who unexpectedly attacked him, starting the Battle of San Diego Pond. At dusk, the Comanches retreated to the center of the lake, despite its extremely cold temperature. The governor ordered his army to murder any Comanche they saw. However, hearing the screams of women and children, he called off the attack and, with the help of an interpreter, offered to spare the lives of any Comanches who surrendered. At first, the Comanches were determined to fight until, at midnight, a wounded boy aged sixteen, left the pond and holding a cross made of reeds, asked V√©lez Cachupin for mercy. Only when his companions saw that he was well treated by V√©lez Cachupin did most of the Comanches decide to follow his example. After this incident, only the chief and seven other men wanted to keep fighting. The fight lasted until three o'clock, but the Comanches were defeated. At dawn, Velez Cachupin saw that his army had 49 prisoners and 150 horses and mules. The rest of the Comanches were killed. He released all but four men giving them snuff and ten arrows for hunting. V√©lez Cachupin forced them to refrain from attacking Spanish settlements, warning them that if they did, he would find and destroy their villages. His courage in battle and his compassion for Native Americans earned him a reputation among the Comanches. They called him the \\"astounding Captain\\". This also boosted the peace between the Spanish and Criollos and the Utes and Apaches (who became its principal allies). In 1754, the governor issued a price list for commonly traded goods and set regulations governing the buying and selling at trade fairs in order to reduce misunderstandings between the Comanches and settlers. The governor spent a great deal of time studying the best way to interact with the Comanches, Utes and Apaches. In fact, in a letter to his successor, he provided a more detailed explanation of how the new governor should relate to the Indians to help keep the peace. New Mexico Archives. Office of the State Historian: Cachup√≠n, Tom√°s V√©lez. Posted by Suzanne Stamatov between 2004‚Äì2010 Consulted 4 April 2011, to 23: 36 pm. Also in 1754, because of the threat posed by the Navajo and the Plains Amerindians to the Spanish population in New Mexico, (which he knew through an inspection in the province), he established a program that promoted the communities that had been abandoned. These areas were established in strategic places, and resettled creating: Abiquiu, Las Trampas, Ojo Caliente and Truchas. He redacted information about conditions in New Mexico in his inspection of 1754.Ebrightm, Malcolm (2014). Page 196.  Confrontation with the friars  Although V√©lez Cachup√≠n negotiated peace with warring nomadic Indians, he was unable to maintain peaceful relations with the Franciscan friars. During his first term enmity developed between himself and Franciscan Friar Andres Varo. The two men sent numerous letters to the viceroy complaining of each other‚Äôs behavior. V√©lez Cachup√≠n supported the Franciscans‚Äô attempts to Christianize the native population, but was opposed to certain practices and specific priests. The Franciscans attempts to remove V√©lez Cachup√≠n from office failed. The Franciscans opposed his reappointment. =Second term= After completing his first term in 1754, V√©lez Cachupin returned to Spain. He requested a new term as governor of New Mexico, and King Charles III granted his wish on 14 March 1761. He was appointed for another six years. However, when he returned to New Mexico, he again faced many of the problems he had solved during his previous term, as his successor had not followed his advice on to how to interact peacefully with the native peoples. When he began his second term as governor, V√©lez Capuchin freed six Comanche female prisoners as a gesture of good will to the Comanches. Because of this, nine warriors and six female Comanches traveled to Taos to negotiate with the Spanish governor and verify that he had returned to the province. The governor banned the sale and purchase of Comanche gen√≠zaros because he knew the importance of trading captives when negotiating peace with the Comanches. He also ordered Comanche captives be held near Santa Fe, in case they were needed for prisoner exchange with the Comanches. Another era of lasting peace with the Amerindian nomads began. In addition to his military duties, the governor also attended to the economic and judicial affairs of the people of the province including the Spanish, Creoles, and mestizos as well as the indigenous community. The governor was the highest ranking civil and criminal judge of New Mexico and he was also the judge of some serious municipal cases. In November 1750, French traders, Paul and Pierre Mallet, visited New Mexico from New France. They had previously visited New Mexico in 1739 and, on this second visit, the Governor gave them a cool reception. This was because the French had started a trade war with New Mexico and were trying to occupy most of northern Spanish Texas, making France one of its main rivals. The governor seized the French traders' possessions and auctioned them to raise funds to pay four guards who escorted them to Mexico City. In 1762, after learning that an Ute had been found in possession of a silver ingot, V√©lez Capuchin ordered Spanish explorer Juan Maria Antonio de Rivera Joaqu√≠n La√≠n, Gregorio Sandoval and Pedro Mora, to Colorado to locate where the ingot had come from.SFGateThe Hispanic Role in America: A chronology .

In 1764, V√©lez Cachupin gave land to the Amerindians and later convinced the Suma Amerindians to settle in San Lorenzo, on land near to that he had given the Amerindians in 1764, promising to protect them. He also banned inhabitants from El Paso (which was by this time a city) from entering Amerindian land for any reason including grazing sheep, or gathering firewood. In addition, any person who cut trees on the Sumas lands would be punished with a fine of 40 pesos or imprisonment for two years. Additionally, he would confiscated their carts and oxen. These fines were to be used to purchase agricultural tools for the Sumas. In 1766, he banned the inhabitants of Atrisco from occupying land in San Fernando, because they were to be used only by the native inhabitants. Whoever broke the ban would have to pay a fine of 30 pesos for each infraction. He also protected the lands of the Genizaros of Belen and of Santa Clara, and San Ildefonso Pueblo.Ebrightm, Malcolm (2014). Pages 219 - 230. In November 1765, a viceregal ban was issued implementing a tobacco monopoly that forbid growing tobacco in New Mexico. However, the governor tried to prevent enforcement of the law, because it could disrupt the local economy and adversely affect the good relations with the province's nomadic tribes who got their snuff from New Mexican farmers. In January 1766, the governor outlined in a report to the viceroy the negative effects that would result from the ban. However, in the end, he was obliged to enforce the law in the spring. His predictions proved true. He was replaced by Francisco Antonio Mar√≠n del Valle as governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico province in 1767. =Court cases= While he was in his second term as governor of New Mexico, Cachupin pronounced a sentence on some Genizaro Amerindians of Abiqui√∫ who were accused of practicing witchcraft. The governor was interested in the case because he had established the Genizaro land in Abiquiu. The case resulted in over 100 pages of testimony. V√©lez Cachupin sentenced some of the defendants to work for Spanish families. In addition, he sent a troops to Abiquiu to destroy relics including a stone with hieroglyphics.

It tells the story of an imaginary episode in the life of the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (Jean-Pierre Aumont), in 1865, when he was a young naval officer on shore leave in Morocco. It also features Yvonne De Carlo as a Spanish dancer named Cara de Talavera, Eve Arden as her mother, and Brian Donlevy as the ship's captain. Charles Kullman (credited as Charles Kullmann), a tenor with the Metropolitan Opera, plays the ship's doctor, Klin, who sings two of Rimsky-Korsakov's melodies.  Plot  Rimsky-Korsakov, a midshipman in the Imperial Russian Navy, secretly yearns to be a composer, but naval regulations prevent him from doing so. He uses a stopover in Tangiers to work on his next composition, Scheherazade (which is actually a symphonic suite but in the film is a ballet), with the tacit support of his captain. There he meets Cara de Talavera and her mother, and romantic events and complications ensue. He has to leave to return home to Russia, where his ballet is staged, but Cara unexpectedly turns up as one of the dancers, and they are reunited.Answers.comAmazon.com Cast * Jean-Pierre Aumont ‚Äì Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov * Yvonne De Carlo ‚Äì Cara de Talavera * Eve Arden ‚Äì Madame de Talavera * Brian Donlevy ‚Äì Captain Vladimir Grigorovich * Charles Kullman ‚Äì Dr Klin (as Charles Kullmann) * Elena Verdugo ‚Äì Fioretta * Phillip Reed ‚Äì Prince Mischetsky * John Qualen ‚Äì Lorenzo * George Dolenz ‚Äì Pierre, the head waiter * Terry Kilburn ‚Äì Midshipman Lorin * William Ching ‚Äì Midshipman * Molio Sheron ‚Äì Basso * Robert Kendall ‚Äì Hassan (uncredited) * Chester Conklin ‚Äì sailor (uncredited) Production The entry of the United States into World War II meant they were allies of the Soviet Union, and films with Russian themes became fashionable in Hollywood. In April 1942 it was announced that producers S.P. Eagle and Boris Morros, who had just made Tales of Manhattan (1942) for 20th Century Fox, had acquired the film rights to the music of Rimsky-Korsakoff through the Russian government. Walter Reisch would write the story which would cover three days the composer spent on leave in 1860 while touring the world on a Russian naval ship, where he wrote \\"The Scheherazade Suite\\". It was going to be called Russian Marines. Morros and Eagle did not wind up producing the film and rights to the music and script reverted to Reisch. Reisch says Joe Pasternak wanted to buy the property for MGM but Reisch says they would not let him direct. Harry Cohn was interested in the project for Columbia Pictures but Reisch's agent, Charles Feldman, set up the film at Universal. Yvonne De Carlo in the trailer for the film Yvonne de Carlo says that Reisch was offered Maria Montez and de Carlo for the lead. Reisch says that all but one of his colleagues ‚Äì including Billy Wilder ‚Äì recommended Yvonne De Carlo for the lead, except Sam Spiegel (Eagle) who told him, \\"Don't make a picture with this girl, because, while she may be a star, she's not your type. She's much too‚Äîlet's say plebeian‚Äîin her bearing.\\" De Carlo's casting was announced in August 1945. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa signed to do the music. Jean Pierre Aumont was borrowed from MGM to play the male lead; de Carlo says that Reisch was not happy with this casting because he had a French accent while the rest of the cast had American accents, but the studio over-ruled him. Filming began 15 January 1946. During filming the title was changed to Shahrazad. According to Robert Kendall, the actor who played the boy-servant Hassan in this movie, Eve Arden regretted taking on the role of Madame de Talavera, complaining that she was actually too young for the part. And Jean- Pierre Aumont's wife, former Universal Studios film-queen Maria Montez, was often present on the set during her husband's passionate scenes with Yvonne De Carlo.Kendall, Robert \\"More Than Skin Deep: Yvonne De Carlo (1922‚Äì2007)\\", Classic Images. (May 8, 2007)  Soundtrack and choreography  The film contains much colourful music and dancing. The choreography was by Tilly Losch. Rimsky-Korsakov's music was orchestrated by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa and (uncredited) Eugene Zador. Themes by Rimsky-Korsakov that are used include: \\"Song of India\\" from Sadko (sung by Charles Kullman); Flight of the Bumblebee from The Tale of Tsar Saltan; \\"Hymn to the Sun\\" from The Golden Cockerel; Capriccio Espagnol, and Scheherazade.Soundtrack Release The filmmakers expected censorship problems with Yvonne De Carlo's costumes so submitted them all beforehand for approval. However the censor found issue with Eve Arden's costumes, requiring some of her scenes to be re-shot. The film also took a while to be released because of delays at the Technicolor lab. =Reception= The film was a success at the box office earning $2.1 million in rentals in North America. According to Reisch, Universal \\"had an enormous success with\\" the film \\"because I succeeded in making the picture very inexpensively.\\" However it also got terrible reviews and Reisch felt it cost him the chance of directing again. He later said: > If you make a picture called Song of Scheherazade, with \\"Song of India\\" in > it, and the \\"Caprice Espagnole\\" and \\"The Flight of the Bumble Bee\\", all by > Rimsky-Korsakov, and if Yvonne De Carlo is the inspiration for all of this, > you are leaving yourself wide open for criticism.

The original convent was all but destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. After the extinction of the religious orders in Portugal in 1834, the property was taken over by a signeurial family which continued to provide church services. History Founded in 1550 by Pedro Fernandes, scribe of the household of Catherine of Habsburg, Queen of Portugal, the Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was built in an isolated parcel east- southeast of Lagoa. Yet, in reality two dates are associated with this religious complex, the other being 18 June 1550, when Queen Catherine of Portugal, through friar Bento Bueno (or Bento Bom) indicated her interest in the construction of a convent for the Carmelite Orders of the Algarve. For many years it was the home of the several male Carmelites of the Ancient Observance, of the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (). When the monasteries and religious institutions were closed and/or extinguished by alternating liberal politicians, the Carmelites abandoned this site, which then passed into private hands. After the 1722 and 1755 earthquakes (1 November 1755), the convent was heavily damaged; from records written by Moreira de Mendon√ßa,\\"the Convent of Carmel, which was constructed a few years earlier, was unmade entirely...\\".Joachim Mendon√ßa (1758) On 8 October 1825, the site was abandoned completely by the monks, leading to its ruins as early as 1834, passing into the hands of private property-owners. It was these new owners, the antecedents of the Cabrita family, who reconstructed much of the church and grounds. Private masses came to be celebrated in the chapel of the convent, along with the celebration of an annual festival (with procession) in honour of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the patroness of the Carmelite Order. In 1867, based on ordinances issued on 26 November 1863 and 24 August 1864 concerning the possessions of extinguished religious orders throughout the Kingdom, the Ministry of Finances () transferred the responsibility for books and documents of the convent from the General-Directorate of National Properties () to the National Archive of Torre do Tombo in Lisbon.

However, private banks had been providing investment banking functions since the beginning of the 19th century and many of these evolved into investment banks in the post-bellum era.Harold Glenn Moulton. The financial organization of society (1921) pp 212f online edition However, the evolution of firms into investment banks did not follow a single trajectory. For example, some currency brokers such as Prime, Ward & King and John E. Thayer and Brother moved from foreign exchange operations to become private banks, taking on some investment bank functions. Other investment banks evolved from mercantile firms such as Thomas Biddle and Co. and Alexander Brothers. In 1933 the new deal separated investment from commercial banking through the Glass-Steagall Act. That law was no longer in effect in the late 1990s, opening the way for the power of investment banking to accelerate. Its growth was a response to new demands for investment services, technological changes, deregulation, and globalization. Investment banks were at the heart of the shadow banking system. Investment banking played a major role in the outbreak of the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì9. In the aftermath, leading American investment banks were converted into bank holding companies, and brought under new regulations. Civil War During the Civil War, banking houses were syndicated to meet the federal government's need for money to fund its war efforts. Jay Cooke launched the first mass securities selling operation in U.S. history employing thousands of salesmen to float what ultimately amounted to $830 million worth of government bonds to a wide group of investors.Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, Jay Cooke: financier of the Civil War (1907) Volume 1 - Page 299 online edition Cooke then reached out to the general public, acting as an agent of the Treasury Department, personally led a war bond drive that netted approximately $1.5 billion for Treasury. The second largest offering house was Livermore, Clews founded by Henry Clews. Post-Civil War era The market for financial services evolved dramatically in the post-Civil War era. One of the most significant changes was the emergence of \\"active investment banking\\" in which investment bankers influenced the management of client companies through sitting on the finance committees and even directly on the board of directors of those companies. =Surging demand for capital= Lance Davis has demonstrated that the process of capital formation in the 19th century was markedly different between the British capital market and the American capital market. British industrialists were readily able to satisfy their need for capital by tapping a vast source of international capital through British banks such as Westminster's, Lloyds and Barclays. In contrast, the dramatic growth of the United States created capital requirements that far outstripped the limited capital resources of American banks. Investment banking in the United States emerged to serve the expansion of railroads, mining companies, and heavy industry. Unlike commercial banks, investment banks were not authorized to issue notes or accept deposits. Instead, they served as brokers or intermediaries, bringing together investors with capital and the firms that needed that capital. Late 19th century From the Panic of 1873 until the first decade of the 20th Century, the private investment banking industry was dominated by two distinct groups: the German-Jewish immigrant bankers and the so-called \\"Yankee houses\\". Despite this ostensible ethnic difference, the two groups shared a similar economic structure. With one exception, the Yankee houses had ties with expatriate Americans who had become merchant bankers in London. Similarly, almost all of the German-Jewish houses had ties with German-Jewish merchant bankers in London. The one exception was Kuhn, Loeb which was tied to European sources of capital through the German investment banking community. =Jewish investment banks= Jewish banking houses were instrumental to the process of capital formation in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. Modern banking in Europe and the United States was influenced by Jewish financiers, such as the Rothschild and Warburg families, and Jews were major contributors to the establishment of important investment banks on Wall Street. In the middle of the 19th century, a number of German Jews founded investment banking firms which later became mainstays of the industry. Most prominent Jewish banks in the United States were investment banks, rather than commercial banks. Jonathan Knee postulates that Jews were forced to focus on the development of investment banks because they were excluded from the commercial banking sector. In many cases, the efforts of Jewish immigrants to start banks was enabled due to the substantial support of their Jewish banking connections in Europe. Several major banks were started following the mid-19th century by Jews, including Goldman Sachs (founded by Samuel Sachs and Marcus Goldman), Kuhn Loeb (Solomon Loeb and Jacob H. Schiff), Lehman Brothers (Henry Lehman), Salomon Brothers, and Bache & Co.(founded by Jules Bache). The firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. played a prominent role in the area of railway finance. In the late 1860s, The Seligman family transitioned from merchandising to banking, setting up operations in New York, St. Louis, and Philadelphia as well as Frankfurt, Germany, London and Paris that gave European investors an opportunity to buy American government and railroad bonds. The firm's conservative policies allowed it to ride out the panic of 1873.Edwin J. Perkins, \\"In the eye of the storm: Isaac Seligman and the panic of 1873.\\" Business History 56.7 (2014): 1129-1142. In the 1880s the firm provided financing for French efforts to build a canal in Panama as well as the subsequent American endeavor. In the 1890s J.& W. Seligman & Co. Inc. underwrote the securities of newly formed trusts, participated in stock and bond issues in the railroad and steel and wire industries, and invested in Russia and Peru, and in American in shipbuilding, bridges, bicycles, mining, and other enterprises. In 1910 William C. Durant of the fledgling General Motors Corporation gave control of his company to the Seligmans and Lee, Higginson & Co. in return for underwriting $15 million worth of corporate notes.Birmingham,Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York pp. 231-8, 350Perry, p 148Jay P. Pederson, ed.

The Last Partnerships. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 50Wechsberg, Joseph. The Merchant Bankers. Pocket Books, 1966, page 235 In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906.

Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. Goodrich Co. and Endicott Johnson Corporation. In the 1890s, a time of severe depression, Populist politicians decried the influence of a Jewish conspiracy to control the world's gold supply at the expense of honest farmers. . The fiery orator Mary E. Lease denounced President Grover Cleveland \\"the agent of Jewish bankers and British gold.\\" The Populist movement almost totally collapsed after 1896, and the bitter rhetoric largely disappeared as prosperity returned. After 1920 many banks which had their roots in the German-Jewish immigrant community began to lose their Jewish character. They no longer filled the ranks of management nor sought their capital needs from within the community. By the 1930s, Jewish presence in the private investment banking had diminished sharply. Jacob Schiff Jacob Schiff was perhaps the most influential Jewish banker in the United States at the end of the 19th century. He was president of Kuhn Loeb and financed railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and he took part in the reorganization of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1896‚Äì99, and at various times aided the Westinghouse Electric Company, and the Western Union Telegraph Company.Cohen =The \\"Yankee houses\\"= The history of the \\"Yankee houses\\" can be traced to the decision of Junius Spencer Morgan to become a partner at George Peabody & Company in London. When Peabody retired in 1864, Morgan became the senior partner and the firm was renamed \\"J.S. Morgan & Company\\". Junius' son, John Pierpont Morgan entered the business and ultimately became a partner at what was to become Drexel, Morgan & Co., the most important investment bank in American history. By 1900, J.P. Morgan was the most important investment banker in the United States and \\"the dominant figure in all the Drexel banks.\\" The Morgan interests were involved in many of the largest investment actions of the 1890s-1910s. The Morgan partners used their large social networks to create an ethos of expertise. They worked together to develop access to information and resources outside the firm. They fostered a culture of exclusivity that signaled the firm's very high standing and its ties relative to their competitors or other elite bankers.Susie J. Pak, \\"Reputation and Social Ties: J. P. Morgan & Co. and Private Investment Banking.\\" Business History Review (2013) 87$4 pp 703-728 Early 20th century During the period from 1890‚Äì1925, the investment banking industry was highly concentrated and dominated by an oligopoly that consisted of JP Morgan & Co.; Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; Brown Bros. & Co.; and Kidder, Peabody & Co. There was no legal requirement to separate the operations of commercial and investment banks; as a result deposits from the commercial banking side of the business constituted an in-house supply of capital that could be used to fund the underwriting business of the investment banking side. =The Panic of 1907 and the Pujo Committee= The Panic of 1907 caught Wall Street unaware, with the growing crisis that threatened to bring down important banks. Brunner and Carr argue it was a \\"perfect storm\\" that combined information asymmetry, excess complexity of the financial system, a lack of financial shock absorbers, confused leadership, and a lack of capital relative to demand following a period of economic growth.Robert F. Bruner and Sean D. Carr, \\"The Panic of 1907\\" Financial History (2007), Issue 89, pp 20-35 During a period of two weeks in October and November 1907, John Pierpont Morgan acted as a \\"one- man Federal Reserve Bank,\\" along with James Stillman, president of the National City Bank. They brought together the major players, agreed on a rescue plan, and obtained presidential approval for it, put it in place, And ended the panic. The crisis convinced the political leadership, and the financial leadership, that drastic reforms were necessary. The long-term result was the Federal Reserve System, established in 1913.Robert F. Bruner and Sean Carr, \\"The Panic of 1907, (Darden Case No. UVA-G-0619, U of Virginia - Darden School of Business, (2009) online In 1913 the Pujo Committee, investigated the relationships in investment banking. Under the leadership of Attorney Samuel Untermyer, the committee decided that a small cabal of financiers had gained consolidated control of numerous industries through the abuse of the public trust in the United States. The chair of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Representative Ars√®ne Pujo, (D‚ÄìLa. 7th) headed a special committee to investigate a \\"money trust\\". The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade, and found that the officers of J.P. Morgan & Co. also sat on the boards of directors of 112 corporations with a market capitalization of $22.5 billion (the total capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange was then estimated at $26.5 billion). The Pujo Report singled out individual bankers including Paul Warburg, Jacob H. Schiff, Felix M. Warburg, Frank E. Peabody, William Rockefeller and Benjamin Strong, Jr.. The report identified over $22 billion in resources and capitalization controlled through 341 directorships held in 112 corporations by members of the empire headed by J.P. Morgan.Report of the Committee Appointed Pursuant to House Resolutions 429 and 504 to Investigate the Concentration of Control of Money and Credit.

The incoming Roosevelt administration and the incoming Congress took immediate steps to pass legislation to respond to the Great Depression. A major component of Roosevelt's New Deal was reform of the nation's banking system. =Glass-Steagall Act of 1933= The Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act of 1933 was passed in reaction to the collapse of a large portion of the American commercial banking system in early 1933. One of its provisions introduced the separation of bank types according to their business (commercial and investment banking). In order to comply with the new regulation, most large banks split into separate entities. For example, JP Morgan split into three entities: JP Morgan continued to operate as a commercial bank, Morgan Stanley was formed to operate as an investment bank, and Morgan Grenfell operated as a British merchant bank. =Securities Act of 1933= Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933 in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and during the ensuing Great Depression. Legislated pursuant to the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution, it requires that any offer or sale of securities using the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be registered pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. The 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities. Prior to the Act, regulation of securities was chiefly governed by state laws, commonly referred to as blue sky laws. When Congress enacted the 1933 Act, it left in place a patchwork of existing state securities laws to supplement federal laws in part because there were questions as to the constitutionality of federal legislation. =Securities Exchange Act of 1934= The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a law governing the secondary trading of securities (stocks, bonds, and debentures) in the United States of America. It was a sweeping piece of legislation. The Act and related statutes form the basis of regulation of the financial markets and their participants in the United States. The 1934 Act also established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),James D. Cox, Robert W. Hillman, and Donald C. Langevoort. Securities Regulation: Cases and Materials (6th ed.). Aspen Publishers. 2009. pg. 11. the agency primarily responsible for enforcement of United States federal securities law. =Chandler Act of 1938= One effect of the Bankruptcy Act of 1938 was to drive investment banks out of corporate reorganizations. Era of the dealmakers After the reforms of the New Deal era, the major Wall Street investment banks focused on dealmaking, serving as advisers to corporation on mergers and acquisitions as well as public offerings of securities. However, as of 1984, initial public underwriting offerings did not necessarily focus on institutional investors, and Eric Dobkin of Goldman Sachs is known for shifting the focus from regional stockbrokers selling shares to individual investors.Meet the Father of the Modern IPO. Bloombergg Businessweek. For example, Dobkin participated in the 1986 privatization of British Gas, where his methods were unconventional.Ellis CD. (2008). The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs, p354-5. Emergence of boutique investment banking firms A boutique investment banking firm is a small financial company that only provides specialized services for specific market segments. They may specialize by industry, asset size of the client, type of banking transaction or other factors, which allows them to address a niche market segment better than larger firms can. Boutique firms have been gaining market share since the mid-1990s by being able to outperform larger banks and with the global financial crisis of 2008, they have continued to play an important role in the investment market. The most well-known boutique investment banks include Centerview Partners, Liontree Advisors and PJT Partners. Transition from dealmaking to trading In the 1980s, the emphasis on dealmaking shifted to a new focus on trading, Firms such as Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Drexel Burnham Lambert became prominent as investment banks earned an increasing amount of their profits from trading for their own account. Advances in computing technology enabled banks to use sophisticated mathematical-models to develop and execute trading strategies. The high frequency and large volume of trades enabled them to generate a profit by taking advantages of small changes in market conditions. Junk bonds and the leveraged buyout In the 1980s, Michael Milken, head of the high-yield bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert, popularized the use of high yield debt (also known as junk bonds) in corporate finance, especially in mergers and acquisitions. This new source of capital sparked an explosion in leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers. Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act Provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibit a bank holding company from owning other financial companies were repealed on November 12, 1999, by the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act. This repeal is widely credited with precipitating the 2008 financial crisis.Fact Check: Did Glass-Steagall Cause The 2008 Financial Crisis?, NPR Vertical integration In recent years, there has been a move towards vertical integration of debt securitization. Previously, investment banks had assisted lenders in raising more lending funds and having the ability to offer longer term fixed interest rates by converting lenders' outstanding loans into bonds. For example, a mortgage lender would make a house loan, and then use the investment bank to sell bonds to fund the debt, the money from the sale of the bonds can be used to make new loans, while the lender accepts loan payments and passes the payments on to the bondholders. This process is called securitization. However, lenders have begun to securitize loans themselves, especially in the areas of mortgage loans. Because of this, and because of the fear that this will continue, many investment banks have focused on becoming lenders themselves,Stanley Real Estate Lending making loans with the goal of securitizing them. In fact, in the areas of commercial mortgages, many investment banks lend at loss leader interest rates in order to make money securitizing the loans, causing them to be a very popular financing option for commercial property investors and developers. Securitized house loans may have exacerbated the subprime mortgage crisis beginning in 2007, by making risky loans less apparent to investors.  2008 Financial Crisis  The importance of investment banking grew during the late 20th century, because of the growing demand for investment services, technological changes, deregulation, and globalization. Investment banks were at the heart of the shadow banking system. They invented many of the financial products used, often disguising its operation. Investment banking played a major role in the outbreak of the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì9. In the aftermath, leading American investment banks were converted into bank holding companies, and brought under new regulations.Dariusz W√≥jcik, \\"The end of investment bank capitalism? An economic geography of financial jobs and power.\\" Economic Geography 88#4 (2012): 345-368. One result is the recent rapid growth of alternative financial institutions, especially long-time-horizon institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and other beneficiary institutions not located in New York or London.Adam D. Dixon and Ashby H.B. Monk, \\"Frontier finance.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 104#4 (2014): 852-868. online The 2007 credit crisis proved that the business model of the investment bank no longer worked without the regulation imposed on it by Glass-Steagall. Once Robert Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs became part of the Clinton administration and deregulated banks, the previous conservatism of underwriting established companies and seeking long-term gains was replaced by lower standards and short-term profit.Matt Taibbi,\\"The Great American Bubble Machine\\" Rolling Stone magazine (April 5, 2010). Retrieved March 7, 2011 Formerly, the guidelines said that in order to take a company public, it had to be in business for a minimum of five years and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. After deregulation, those standards were gone, but small investors did not grasp the full impact of the change. Investment banks Bear Stearns, founded in 1923 and Lehman Brothers, over 100 years old, collapsed; Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America, which remained in trouble, as did Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The ensuing financial crisis of 2008 saw Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \\"abandon their status as investment banks\\" by converting themselves into \\"traditional bank holding companies\\", thereby making themselves eligible to receive billions of dollars each in emergency taxpayer-funded assistance.

Introduction  260x260px Tremendous genetic variability exists in the local varieties (landraces) of crops and their closely related wild plants (crop wild relatives). The NPGS assists plant breeders and other research scientists by acquiring, conserving, evaluating, documenting, and distributing germplasm (seeds and other propagative material) of these plants, as well as of improved cultivars and breeding lines. This diverse germplasm provides the genetic raw material needed by plant breeders to develop new varieties of crops that have desirable qualities and can withstand constantly changing biological and environmental stresses.Byrne, P. F., G. M. Volk, C. Gardner, M.A. Gore, P.W. Simon, and S. Smith. 2018. Sustaining the future of plant breeding: the critical role of the USDA-ARS National Plant Germplasm System. Crop Science 58: 1-18. Conservation and use of this genetic diversity are critical to meeting the current and future challenges to global food security.  History  For millennia before Europeans colonized the Americas, native peoples domesticated indigenous plants including corn, squash and beans and spread them to new agricultural environments. European colonists adopted some crops from Native Americans and introduced others. Demand for expansion and diversification of agriculture in the U.S. eventually led the federal government to adopt a role in the introduction of and exploration for plant material, which had previously been spearheaded by individuals and agricultural societies.Klose, N. 1950. America's Crop Heritage: The History of Foreign Plant Introduction by the Federal Government. Ames: Iowa State College Press.

In 1819, The Secretary of the Treasury issued a circular requesting that consuls stationed in other countries obtain seed of useful plants and send them to the U.S.. Between 1836 and 1862 the U.S. Patent Office, first under the State Department and then under the Department of the Interior, administered a plant exploration and introduction program funded through yearly appropriations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was established in 1862 when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Department of Agriculture Organic Act into law. One of the Department‚Äôs seven main responsibilities was the collection, testing and distribution of seeds and plants. The Department was headed by a Commissioner until 1889 when it was elevated to Cabinet rank and the first Secretary of Agriculture was appointed. 260x260px In 1898, a formal program of plant introduction was initiated with the establishment of the Section of Seed and Plant Introduction in USDA under the direction of noted plant explorer David Fairchild. According to the Annual Report of the Secretary of Agriculture for 1900,USDA. 1900. Annual Reports of the Department of Agriculture for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1900. Government Printing Office, Washington DC. Available at https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3043015&view;=1up&seq;=7 the Section‚Äôs job was \\" to bring into this country for experimental purposes any foreign seeds and plants which might give promise of increasing the value and variety of our agricultural resources.\\" Material was acquired from several sources, including participants in U.S. naval expeditions, diplomatic officials stationed in foreign countries, other governments and private individuals. The Section also began an intensive program of plant exploration by employing agricultural explorers, who spent most of their time traveling to other countries to collect plant samples.Fairchild, David. 1939. The World was My Garden: Travels of a Plant Explorer. Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, New York. Along with Fairchild, early notable USDA plant explorers included Frank N. Meyer, Niels E. Hansen, and Palemon Howard (P.H.) Dorsett. Many of the introductions brought to the U.S. by the USDA plant explorers led to establishing new or improved crops in the country. Special agent O.F. Cook in the Section initiated the system of assigning sequential Plant Introduction (PI) numbers to samples acquired by the Section and issuing the printed USDA Plant Inventories that documented them.Skrdla, W.H. 1975. The United States plant introduction system. HortSci. 10: 570-574. These PI numbers continue to be assigned to material that enters into long-term curation by the NPGS. The Section was also in charge of distributing the introduced plant material for evaluation and potential incorporation into U.S. agricultural production. Initially, the introduced material went to State Agricultural Experiment Stations or other reliable cooperators for testing. The need for facilities to test lesser known crops and later to quarantine plants to prevent introduction of plant pests led to the establishment of Federal Plant Introduction Gardens.Hyland, H. 1984. History of plant introduction in the United States. Pp. 5‚Äì14 in Plant Genetic Resources: A Conservation Imperative, C. W. Yeatman, D. Kafton, and G. Wilkes, eds. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press. The first such garden was established in Miami, Florida in 1898, followed by notable gardens at Chico, California in 1904, Savannah, Georgia in 1919, and Glen Dale, Maryland in 1919Hodge, W.H. H.F. Loomis, L.E. Jolley, and J.L. Creech. 1956. Federal Plant Introduction Gardens. The National Horticultural Magazine 35 (2): 86-106.. Although these gardens propagated, tested and distributed promising plant materials, they were not intended for long-term maintenance. Early in its history, the Section also began fulfilling foreign and domestic requests for plant materials curated in the U.S. that were needed for research.Hodge, W. H., and C. O. Erlanson. 1955. Plant introduction as a federal service. Advances in Agronomy 7: 189‚Äì211. This distribution mission remains a primary objective of the NPGS today, with about 250,000 samples being supplied annually to global plant breeders and other research scientists. Over the decades, germplasm exchange between countries has formed the basis for bilateral and multilateral collaborations involving training and research that benefit all parties.Shands, Henry L. 1995. The U.S. National Plant Germplasm System. Can. J. Plant Sci. 75: 9 ‚Äì 15. The other elements of the NPGS were established gradually over many decades.The U.S. National Arboretum began operation in Washington, D.C. in 1927. The National Small Grains Collection was officially organized in 1948 in Beltsville, Maryland (later moved to Aberdeen, Idaho). Creation of other components of the system were enabled by the Research and Marketing Act of 1946.Burgess, Sam (ed.). 1971. The National Program for Conservation of Crop Germ Plasm (A Progress Report on Federal/State Cooperation). University Printing Department, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia. The Act provided the legal basis for federal-state cooperation in managing crop and livestock genetic resources and conducting research. As a result, a partnership between USDA and the State Agricultural Experiment Station (SAES) system was formed to establish Plant Introduction Stations at Ames, Iowa in 1948; Geneva, New York in 1948; Griffin, Georgia in 1949; and Pullman, Washington in 1952. The Inter-regional Potato Introduction Station (now the U.S. Potato Genebank) was established in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin in 1949. The National Seed Storage Laboratory, now the National Laboratory for Genetic Resources Preservation (NLGRP), in Fort Collins, Colorado was completed in 1958 to provide backup conservation and long-term storage of seeds and, more recently, clonal plant material. The NLGRP serves as a key component of the U.S. National Genetic Resources Program by housing the animal germplasm collection, and providing a backup site for plant and microbial collections. This ARS location also conducts research on the long-term crypreservation of agriculturally important genetic resources, and coordinates U.S. contributions to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The present NPGS emerged in 1974 as a national program for germplasm after a restructuring of ARS.National Research Council. 1991. Managing Global Genetic Resources: The U.S. National Plant Germplasm System. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, USA. The cotton and soybean germplasm collections were consolidated into genebanks in College Station, Texas and Peoria, Illinois, respectively, in the 1970s, and nine additional genebank sites curating primarily clonally-propagated crops began operation in the mid-1980sPostman, J., K.

HortSci. 41(5): 1188-1194..More recent additions to the NPGS are the National Arid Land Plant Genetic Resources Unit in Parlier, California (1996) and the Ornamental Plant Germplasm Center in Columbus, Ohio (2001). The original Plant Introduction Gardens were deemed unnecessary and decommissioned after the genebank sites were established. Paper records and inventories from USDA genebanks were consolidated into a centralized information management system, the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN), beginning in the 1980s, which was made publicly accessible through the internet beginning in 1994. The overall legal framework for the NPGS was established as part of the U.S. National Genetic Resources Program, authorized by the U.S. Congress through the 1990 Farm Bill. The USDA-ARS National Germplasm Resources Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland is a successor to the original USDA Section of Seed and Plant Introduction and manages the current Plant Exploration and Exchange Program, as well as the GRIN information management system.  Currently  The NPGS currently is composed of genebanks and support units at 20 locations around the U.S. Each genebank is responsible for a collection of a unique set of crops. Several other collections that are not formally part of the NPGS also make material available for distribution through GRIN. The number of living, active accessions in the NPGS typically increases by several thousand annually and is currently nearing 600,000. The NPGS includes more than 15,000 species of plants, both sexually and asexually propagated, and represents one of the world‚Äôs largest and most diverse living collections of plants curated by a single organization.Bretting, P.K. 2007.

Distributions are made to plant breeders and other researchers around the world. Crop Germplasm Committees composed of experts on genetic resources of specific crops provide input to the NPGS on acquisition and genebank curation issues.Jones, Q., and S. Gillette. 1982.

History Midway Gardens was opened on the site of the former Sans Souci amusement park on the southwest corner of Cottage Grove Avenue and East 60th Street. Edward C.

At this point, Midway Gardens was purchased by the Edelweiss (Schoenhofen) Brewery Company and renamed \\"Edelweiss Gardens\\". Wright, who generally exerted strong creative control over his completed projects, was disgusted by the aesthetic changes the new owner made to the Gardens. He wrote that Edelweiss had added \\"obnoxious features\\" and that the whole effect of \\"the proud Midway Gardens\\" \\"was cheapened to suit a hearty bourgeois taste\\".Wright, Frank Lloyd (1943) (2005 ed.) An Autobiography, p. 191. Pomegranate Communications, Inc. Edelweiss Gardens continued through the war years (closing briefly in 1918) and stayed open as a dry establishment during Prohibition. In 1921, the building was sold once more, to the E. C. Dietrich Midway Automobile Tire and Supply Company, and renamed \\"The Midway Dancing Gardens\\".http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Artifact%20Pages/PhRtS180.htm Finally, in October 1929, Midway Gardens was closed permanently and demolished. A testament to Wright's design, the building was so solidly constructed that tearing it down sent the wrecking company into bankruptcy.Gill, Many Masks: A Life of Frank Lloyd Wright, p. 228. Features and entertainment Midway Gardens was an indoor/outdoor entertainment center intended to act as a beer hall and concert/dance hall which featured bands including the Midway Gardens Orchestra. The large area (equivalent to a city block) offered entertainment to a wide variety of people in a German-style meeting place. The Gardens included restaurants, saloons, newspaper and cigar stands, and arcades. When Prohibition was passed, the Gardens lost part of their entertainment value. When it opened, Midway Gardens was an upscale entertainment venue that was also affordable to the common person. Max Bendix and the National Symphony Orchestra frequented the concert section because they were the \\"house band\\". The ballet dancer Anna Pavlova performed numerous times as well. Frank Lloyd Wright brought in popular acts to sing, dance, and play music, which created a bourgeois environment. After it became Edelweiss Gardens, however, the high class atmosphere switched to one of vaudeville, ragtime, and cabaret.  Design  The modernist architecture of the Gardens was based on strict geometrical forms. A large, open‚Äìair central area, filled with tables and chairs, was ringed by a series of three‚Äìstory buildings with indoor spaces for dancing and other activities, as well as cantilevered balconies with overhanging roofs. There were terraced gardens, pools, and a music pavilion and stage. The building itself was made of yellow brick and patterned concrete block. It featured highly intricate ornament and many geometric sculptures, which Frank Lloyd Wright named \\"sprites\\" and were co-designed with Alfonso Ianelli. Some of these sculptures escaped demolition and can be found elsewhere. In keeping with Wright's style, the building also featured rows of art glass and hidden entries. The interior was likewise intricately ornamented and filled with Wright-designed furniture and accoutrements, right down to the napkin rings.  References  * Storrer, William Allin.

It was one of the first shows fully to exploit the potential of the BBC's archive, showing during its run hundreds of television clips from the 1940s to the 1980s, always based around a specific theme. Among the many shows represented were The Morecambe and Wise Show, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Sky at Night, Whicker's World, Nationwide, Doctor Who, Steptoe and Son, Blue Peter, and the original 1950s Watch With Mother series. A number of clips were also shown from the television newsreels of the late 1940s. Weekly features included a regular \\"Comedy Classic\\", always fitting with each episode's theme, and \\"All Your Own Work\\", which featured films made in the past by members of the public (often those included in earlier BBC series such as Caught in Time and Everybody's Doing It). Each edition also featured a studio guest, who would pick their favourites from the archives and whose own appearances would usually also be shown; Richard Stilgoe, for example, chose a clip from Jack Rosenthal's play The Evacuees, fitting in with the episode's \\"Childhood\\" theme, and a clip from his own series And Now the Good News was shown. From 4 December 1988 the series was replaced by Boxpops, another archive-based series but much faster- paced and pop-orientated with no studio presenter.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 14, 2011. In the episode, Andy and April hold a dinner party, which turns out to be a surprise wedding, much to Leslie's concern. Meanwhile, Ben mulls whether to remain in Pawnee or return to his old job in Indianapolis, and Ann feels extremely uncomfortable while attending a singles mixer. The episode was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim. The wedding between Andy and April was a culmination of a romantic subplot between the two characters that began in the second season episode \\"Hunting Trip\\". The Parks and Recreation staff tried to keep the wedding secret to surprise viewers, but NBC accidentally ran a commercial advertising the wedding two months earlier, after the episode \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two.\\" Series co-creator Michael Schur initially said the promo was meant to refer to Ron and his ex-wife Tammy, but later admitted it was an error. \\"April and Andy's Fancy Party\\" featured several guest performances by actors who appeared in previous episodes, including Ben Schwartz as Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee as Derek and Ben, Minni Jo Mazzola as Natalie Ludgate, and Mark Rivers, Andrew Burlinson and Alan Yang as Andy's bandmates. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 5.16 million household viewers, a slight increase over the previous original episode, \\"Camping\\". It received generally positive reviews. Plot During a cold open scene, Ron (Nick Offerman) horrifies the entire parks department by apparently pulling an aching tooth out of his own mouth with a pair of pliers. He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's bandmate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take. At the party, Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to surprise everyone by getting married that night. Leslie spends most of the party trying to dissuade them, since they have been dating less than a month and have no place to live. However, Ron believes it is not Leslie's place to interfere with their decision. Tom (Aziz Ansari) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man, but his excitement lessens when Andy also asks Ron, Chris, and several others to be his \\"best men\\". Tom tries to throw an impromptu bachelor party and give a speech to make himself the \\"best\\" best man, but fails each time. Although Leslie plans to object during the ceremony, she cannot bring herself to do it and comes to accept the marriage. Andy and April officially become husband and wife. Afterward, Ron explains to Leslie that she did not object because deep down she knew that Andy and April would get married no matter what, and that there is no correct way to do things when it comes to matters of the heart, using his own two former marriages as an example. During the reception, April privately tells Leslie how much she appreciates her, flattering Leslie. Andy makes a speech to the guests, where he calls Tom his \\"best\\" best man, much to Tom's delight. He tells the crowd that life is short and he and April simply did what made them happy. Taking Andy's advice, Leslie asks Ben to stay in Pawnee, and he surprises her by revealing that he has already accepted Chris' job offer. In a subplot, Ann (Rashida Jones) goes to a singles mixer where she is extremely uncomfortable. She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up having a good time at the mixer and gets several phone numbers. Production \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim. It is referred to simply as \\"Fancy Party\\" in some publications. During a break between the development of the first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co- creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the \\"standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on\\". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: \\"We just thought about who they were - two impulsive goofballs who don‚Äôt approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner - and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?\\" The cast and crew of Parks and Recreation made a conscious effort not to discuss the Andy and April wedding during media interviews with the hopes of keeping it a surprise. However, after the original broadcast of the third season episode \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\", NBC ran a commercial advertising \\"April and Andy's wedding registry\\" on the official Parks and Recreation website. At this point in the series, April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled. Shortly after the episode aired, HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy's wedding registry. However, after \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" aired, Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode, but ran with \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\" due to an error by NBC employees: > \\"In an effort to undo the spoiler, we publicly stated, in a number of > interviews, that NBC had just accidentally gotten the character names wrong, > and that there was no upcoming Andy-April wedding. We sincerely hope that > fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to > maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could. Now if you'll excuse us, > we have to go shoot the season finale surprise Jerry-Donna wedding scene.\\" \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" featured several guest performances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes. Ben Schwartz reprised his role as Tom's playboy-like friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein. April's flower men were Ben and Derek, played by Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee. Derek is April's bisexual ex-boyfriend and Ben was the boy he dated while simultaneously dating April; the two had appeared in several second season episodes. Minni Jo Mazzola reprised her recurring role as April's sister Natalie Ludgate. Andy's band Mouse Rat, which has appeared in previous episodes starting with the first season finale \\"Rock Show\\", also appeared in \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\". Mark Rivers played the drums, Andrew Burlinson played guitar and Parks and Recreation screenwriter Alan Yang played bass guitar. Eric Isenhower made his first appearance on the show as Orin, a creepy Goth friend of April. The character was mentioned offhandedly in the episode \\"Time Capsule\\" and Dippold loved the idea of him, so she worked Orin into the script. The day the episode first aired, the term \\"Ron Swanson\\", and the misspelled \\"Rob Swanson\\", were so commonly discussed on the social-networking website Twitter that they were listed among the site's trending topics, which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment. Shortly after the episode's original broadcast, NBC started a fake wedding website about the wedding called \\"Andy and April's Awesome Sauce Wedding\\", which included photos and a guestbook website visitors can sign. Cultural references Andy gets married wearing the jersey of Reggie Wayne, wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts. April had previously given him the jersey as a gift in the second-season episode \\"Christmas Scandal\\". The Simon and Garfunkel song \\"April Come She Will\\" plays while April walks down the aisle. Chris performs a break dance to the House of Pain hip hop song \\"Jump Around\\". While trying to understand why the wedding is happening so quickly, Leslie asks whether April is dying, like the lead character from the 2002 romance film A Walk to Remember. While trying to decide on a joke for his best man speech, Tom asks Jean-Ralphio which Vince Vaughn movie he should choose; Jean-Ralphio confidently answers Fred Claus, a 2007 Christmas comedy film. Ben was asked to bring the 2009 science fiction film Avatar to the wedding, along with 50 pairs of 3-D glasses and a 3-D-capable television. At one point, Tom makes fun of Ben's nerdiness by making a reference to The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, but Ben explains he did not enjoy the film adaptation by director Peter Jackson. When someone refers to actress Julia Roberts, Ron only recognizes her as \\"that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza\\". After seeing Ann flirt awkwardly, Donna asks her \\"Did you grow up in the woods? Are you Nell?\\", referring to Jodie Foster's character from the film Nell. In one scene, Andy used the phrase \\"Xbox pancake\\", a reference to a video game console, while describing the idea of combining two great things. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" was seen by an estimated 5.16 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 3.1 rating/5 share among all viewers and a 2.5 rating/7 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It constituted a slight ratings increase over the previous original episode \\"Camping\\". Parks and Recreation was defeated in its 9:30 p.m. timeslot by the Fox crime drama Bones, which was seen by an average of 11.1 million households. However, Parks defeated repeats of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which drew 4.18 million household viewers, and the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation which, although it had more viewers at 8.23 million households, had a lower rating than Parks, drawing 1.5 rating/4 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" also outperformed an original episode of the CW Network drama Nikita, which drew 2.14 million households. =Reviews= \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it \\"one of the funniest, sweetest, just plain best episodes of this season of this great comedy\\", and that it embodied \\"intoxicating mix of laughs and sweetness that \\"Parks and Rec\\" consistently nails\\". Sepinwall particularly praised the scene when April declared her love for Leslie, and enjoyed the comedic pairing of Ann and Donna. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode showed Parks and Recreation in \\"top form\\", and he praised the episode for avoiding television cliches about weddings. In most shows, he wrote, April and Andy would have been persuaded to stop the wedding at the last moment, or Andy would have panicked after realizing the enormity of what he had done. Matt Fowler of IGN called the episode \\"charming, effortless, and hilarious\\" and wrote \\"the strength of this episode was that it actually convinced us all that April and Andy getting married, after just a month of dating, was a great idea\\". TV Guide writer Matt Roush called \\"Andy and April's Fancy Wedding\\" the highlight of the night among NBC's Thursday comedy shows, and said he particularly loved the scene with Ron Swanson pulling out his tooth, and another later scene where Ron criticized Chris for bringing a vegetarian loaf to the party instead of cake. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas said the fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in commercials to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of \\"humor and heart\\", of which he said: \\"No show on the air, and few shows I can think of ever, does it better.\\" Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he was surprised by the wedding twist, particularly by the fact that the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a \\"TV-style complication\\". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second-season episode \\"Hunting Trip\\". Meslow said the episode \\"couldn't have been better\\" and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, \\"Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end.\\" Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the characters are and how well they are presented by the writers. Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out, and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins' character has continued to develop through the season. Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the \\"most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history\\", and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not seem to fit as a part of the show anymore. Some reviews were less positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event. Joel Keller of TV Squad said, \\"In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list.\\" Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier. He also criticized the Ann Perkins character: \\"I've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy-washy before, and it's not pleasant to watch.\\" References External links * \\"Andy and April's Fancy Party\\" at the official Parks and Recreation site 2011 American television episodes Parks and Recreation (season 3) episodes Television episodes about weddings Television episodes written by Katie Dippold ","title":"Andy and April's Fancy Party"},{"id":"31519614","text":"Masamura Pachinko Museum The Masamura Pachinko Museum („Éë„ÉÅ„É≥„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éº„Ç∏„Ç¢„É†Ê≠£ÊùëË≥áÊñôÈ§®) is a small Japanese pachinko museum currently located at 210 Nakasunach≈ç in Tempaku-ku, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture (ÊÑõÁü•ÁúåÂêçÂè§Â±ãÂ∏ÇÂ§©ÁôΩÂå∫‰∏≠Á†ÇÁî∫210Áï™Âú∞).  History  Masamura Gauge All 15 Pachinko is a popular gambling game in Japan, that traces its roots back to the early 20th century. The Masamura trading company from Nagoya constructed a museum in tribute to the company's founder Masamura Takeuchi on the third floor of the old Masamura Building in Nishi-ku. He is often acknowledged to be the creator of modern pachinko, by turning this children's game into an adult hobby. In the years after World War II, when supplies were short, he was able to build together some of the first pachinko machines made out of old tea chests and greenhouse glass. The legendary Masamura Gauge All 15 is remembered as the precursor to modern day Pachinko machines. The museum documents the history in detail. It shows a different theory of the history of Pachinko though. Although the usual theory of the origins of pachinko states that the game is an adaptation of the American \\"Corinthian Game\\", which was a kind of very old pinball game. The museum however argues that the early machines might come from the vertical \\"wall machines\\" that were found in the late 19th century European penny arcades.Risky biz: Pachinko is pervasive and profitable. And with Japan's politicians now pushing for casinos, it just might be a prototype.

The software schedules resources in a data center applying user- configurable policies to help improve resource sharing and throughput by maximizing resource utilization. The product can be deployed to run on- premises, using IaaS cloud computing or in a hybrid cloud environment.  History  The roots of Grid Engine as a commercial product date back to 1993 (under the names CODINE and later, in a variation of the product, GRD). A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in Sun Grid Engine. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc. In 2000, Sun Microsystems acquired Gridware. Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as open-source in 2001. In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun and subsequently renamed SGE to Oracle Grid Engine. Oracle Grid Engine (6.2u6) moved to a closed-source model providing binaries with the distribution but no source code. As a result, the project's open-source repository no longer reflected changes made by Oracle and users were prevented from contributing code changes. In response to this, the Grid Engine community started the Open Grid Scheduler and the Son of Grid Engine projects to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of Grid Engine.Open Grid SchedulerSon of Grid Engine On January 18, 2011, Univa announced that it had hired the principal engineers from the Sun Grid Engine team. Univa Grid Engine development is led by CTO Fritz Ferstl, who founded the Grid Engine project and ran the business within Sun/Oracle for the past 10 years. On October 22, 2013 Univa announced that it had acquired Oracle Grid Engine assets and intellectual property making it the sole commercial provider of Grid Engine software. Between 2011 and 2013 Univa added new capabilities to Univa Grid Engine including Univa Unisight, and Univa License Orchestrator. Univa Unisight provided new reporting and analytics capabilities related to Univa Grid Engine workloads and infrastructure. Univa License Orchestrator extended Univa Grid Engine scheduling policies to support allocation and optimization of commercial software licenses, an important capability in electronic design automation (EDA) and other industries. On June 24, 2018 Univa announced massive scalability operating a single cluster with over 1 million cores on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Releases  Univa Grid Engine 8.0 was Univa‚Äôs first commercial release of Grid Engine, offered on April 12, 2011. It was forked from SGE 6.2u5, the last open source release . It added improved third party application integration, license and policy management, enhanced support for software and hardware platforms, and cloud management tools. Univa Grid Engine 8.0.1 was released on October 4, 2011. It adds improved support for multi-core hardware, integration with NVIDIA GPUs, new job submission verifier extensions, and additional bug fixes. Univa Grid Engine 8.1.0 was announced on May 2, 2011 and improvements and bug fixes were made in a series of 8.1.x releases through 8.1.3 announced on Nov 15, 2012. The 8.1.x releases delivered important new functionality such as Job Classes, PostgreSQL Spooling, Resource Maps, and improvements to Share Tree Policies. The releases also introduced a new Fair Urgency Policy, deterministic Wildcard PE Selection, improved Diagnostics, pre-configured MPI integrations, an improved Apache Hadoop Integration as well as many bug fixes and performance improvements. Univa Grid Engine 8.1.6 was announced on Oct 14, 2013. This update included improvements to the Univa Grid Engine scheduler aimed at larger clusters and Qmaster stability and scalability improvements. Univa Grid Engine 8.2.0 was released on Sept 02, 2014. Univa Grid Engine version 8.2.0 was the first release to provide native support for Microsoft¬Æ Windows¬Æ environments. Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 was released on June 22, 2015. The new Preemption feature in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 allowed users to set priorities on different work so that, if a higher priority application needed to use resources allocated to a lower priority application, the lower priority application would be effectively be ‚Äúpaused‚Äù‚Äînot lost‚Äîand work would automatically resume once the higher priority application completed. Among a handful of other new features added to Grid Engine 8.3.0 to improve overall reliability and efficiency was a new Run Time Modification of Resources feature. The Run Time Modification of Resources feature enabled cluster administrators to make configuration changes ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù improving cluster availability and improving overall efficiency. Univa Grid Engine 8.3.1 was released on August 28, 2015. This release contained additional fixes and enhancements identified since the release of 8.3.0. Univa Grid Engine 8.4.0 was released on May 31, 2016. This release supports Docker containers containers and automatically dispatched and ran jobs within a user specified Docker Image. Univa Grid Engine 8.5.0 was released on March 7, 2017. This release of Univa Grid Engine provided on average ~2x faster scheduling than open source Grid Engine 6.2u5. Univa Grid Engine 8.5.0 also delivered significant improvements to Docker support including mobility of GPU apps within a cluster. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.0 was released on July 17, 2018. This release added support for NVIDIA Docker 2.0 providing more flexibility when running Docker containers in a Univa Grid Engine environment. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.1 was released on August 8, 2018, providing improved control over GPU devices, and new affinity features, allowing jobs to gravitate towards, or away from, certain compute nodes. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.2 was released on August 16, 2018. This release improved Univa Grid Engine performance and scalability in several key areas including network communications, job submission, memory allocation, and scheduler optimizations. This update also improved Univa Grid Engine job dispatch information. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.3 was released on September 27, 2018. This update introduced bulk configuration changes for Univa Grid Engine hosts. Bulk configuration changes perform operations on many hosts simultaneously, making it easier to manage large Univa Grid Engine clusters. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.4 was released on November 23, 2018, providing new core binding strategies making it easier to specify how jobs are placed on nodes and cores while also providing more flexibility. A new affinity-based job placement policy was included in this update. Jobs submitted using affinity can be packed close together (‚Äúpositive affinity‚Äù) or spread across the cluster (‚Äúnegative affinity‚Äù) based on resources requested. New Univa Grid Engine Resource Maps syntax provides more granular control over application access to host devices such as NVIDIA GPUs. This allows jobs to request GPUs and ensure that GPUs are exclusively assigned to the specific job. Univa Grid Engine was also enhanced to directly communicate with NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) in this release to collect GPU metrics for scheduling and accounting. Univa Grid Engine 8.6.5 was released on May 6, 2019. Key new features were: * Support for IBM Power 9 on Linux * Improvements to Docker support on Univa Grid Engine * Very large cluster hostname management where the IP address for each host is contained in the hostname * Integration with Linux Out of Memory (OOM) Notification API ensuring that Univa Grid Engine is automatically notified of jobs that are terminated by the Linux kernel * Improved responsiveness in heavily loaded cluster for Grid Engine administrator commands * Performance improvements to Univa Grid Engine automatic job rescheduling * Thread deadlock detection for Univa Grid Engine Qmaster * Updated support for NVIDIA DCGM versions up to 1.6.3 * Ability to specify GPU/CPU affinity as hard or soft requests Univa Grid Engine 8.6.7 was released on August 5, 2019offering Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL8) support and NVIDIA GPU DCGM job usage features.

California, 376 U.S. 483 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court decision involving the Fourth Amendment. It was a criminal case appealed from the California Courts of Appeal after the California Supreme Court denied review. The case extended the situations under which search warrants are required as they reversed a robbery conviction made on the basis of evidence obtained in violation of the holding. The petitioner, Joey Stoner, had been arrested following a 1960 supermarket robbery in the Los Angeles area. Eyewitness accounts and evidence left at the scene led the police to a hotel elsewhere in the region where Stoner was staying. Two days later, detectives went to the hotel and, with the desk clerk's permission, searched the room and found further evidence linking him to the robbery. Stoner was arrested two days later in Nevada, and extradited. The evidence from the hotel room was used to convict him of the robbery at trial. Stoner unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the evidence at trial and on appeal, since police had lacked a warrant and relied on the clerk's permission. The appeals court held that the search was incident to arrest and thus permissible. Writing for the Court, Justice Potter Stewart reaffirmed two previous holdings: The first, Agnello v. United States (1925) held such warrantless searches are constitutional only to the extent that they take place at the same time, and in the same place, as the arrest. Two other cases established that the hotel clerk's consent did not permit police to search the room without a warrant. \\"[A] guest in a hotel room is entitled to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures\\" Stewart wrote. \\"That protection would disappear if it were left to depend upon the unfettered discretion of an employee of the hotel.\\" It did not matter that hotel staff might be permitted to enter the room as that was merely for the limited purpose of cleaning and maintenance. The only other opinion was Justice John Marshall Harlan II, who concurred in the holding but dissented from the disposition reversing the conviction. He would have left it to California's courts to decide whether the admission of the hotel-room evidence was harmless error, as the Court had done in similar circumstances in Fahy v. Connecticut. The reaffirmation of the earlier rulings was necessitated by the Mapp v. Ohio decision a few years earlier, which extended the exclusionary rule under which unlawfully obtained evidence is inadmissible at trial, to the states as well as the federal government. It came at a time when the Warren Court was beginning to rethink and provide exceptions to the traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine that only those with a possessory or proprietary interest in what was searched had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search. Several years later, in Katz v. United States, the Court abandoned that doctrine entirely in favor of the reasonable expectation of privacy test now in use. Underlying prosecution On the night of October 25, 1960, two men robbed the Budget Town Food Market in Monrovia, California. One suspect was described by eyewitnesses as carrying a gun, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a gray jacket. A checkbook, possibly belonging to one of the robbers, was found in a nearby parking lot. It was traced to a Joey Stoner, and two stubs indicated checks drawn to a hotel in nearby Pomona.People v. Stoner, 205 Cal.App.2d 108, 109 (Cal.Ct.App., 1962) The Monrovia officers who investigated contacted the Pomona police. They learned that Stoner had a criminal record, and obtained a photograph of him. The eyewitnesses identified him as the man they saw. Two nights after the robbery, the officers went to the hotel in Pomona.Stoner, At the hotel, they asked for Stoner. The desk clerk confirmed he was a guest but added that he was presently out. They asked if they could enter the room since they were investigating an armed robbery. The clerk let them in to Stoner's room, where they found the jacket, glasses and gun from the night of the robbery. Stoner was arrested in Las Vegas two days later along with his partner in the robbery. He waived extradition to California, where he was indicted, tried and convicted. Since he had two prior convictions he was found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to a long prison term. On appeal to the Second District, he argued that the search of his hotel room was unconstitutional since the police did not have a search warrant. In the two days between the robbery and the search, Stoner claimed, there was enough time for the police to get one. The court responded that most of that time was spent establishing his identity and whereabouts as a suspect. He also argued that the search of his hotel room could not have incident to his arrest due to the time between it and his arrest, and the fact that the latter took place in another state. The officers were also aware he was not present, he added, so they could not have been intending to arrest him when they entered his hotel room. The court cited many holdings in California case law to the extent that it did not matter whether the arrest took place before or after the search.Stoner, 205 Cal.App.2d at 111‚Äì13. Stoner further claimed his confession had effectively been coerced. He claimed that he had not been arraigned until two days after his arrest, was moved from one jail to another during that period and not allowed to speak with his wife. The court found that the record reflected that much of that two-day period was involved in transporting him back to the Los Angeles area from Las Vegas, and allowing him to speak with his parole officer per his request, who had advised him to cooperate with the police. Nor had he been prevented from calling his wife, just discouraged from doing so.Stoner, 205 Cal.App.2d at 113‚Äì14. Decision The Court heard oral arguments in February 1964. It appointed an attorney, William Dempsey, to argue for Stoner.. Arlo Smith, future San Francisco district attorney then an assistant attorney general in Stanley Mosk's office, argued for the state. The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed an amicus curiae brief on Stoner's behalf. A month later the decision was handed down.Stoner v. California, , Stewart, J. The justices had unanimously voted to reverse the appeals court, and thus the conviction. \\"[I]t is clear that the search of the petitioner's hotel room in Pomona, California, on October 27 was not incident to his arrest in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 29,\\" wrote Justice Potter Stewart. \\"The search was completely unrelated to the arrest, both as to time and as to place.\\" Under the Court's holding in Agnello v. United States four decades earlier,Agnello v. United States, . a search incident to arrest had to be \\"only if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest, and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest\\" to be constitutional.Stoner, 376 U.S. at 487. Stewart noted that even the state had declined to argue that the search was incident to the arrest, since the cases cited by the appellate court could not be taken to authorize a search so distant from the arrest. Instead, it had claimed the hotel clerk's consent was sufficient for the search. But even that, he said, was not enough.Stoner, 376 U.S. at 487‚Äì88. Four years earlier, he recalled, in Jones v. United States, the Court had held that \\"anyone legitimately on the premises\\" had standing to challenge the search of the property.Jones v. United States, . \\"Our decisions make clear that the rights protected by the Fourth Amendment are not to be eroded by strained applications of the law of agency or by unrealistic doctrines of 'apparent authority,'\\" Stewart wrote. \\"[I]t was the petitioner's constitutional right which was at stake here, and not the night clerk's nor the hotel's. It was a right, therefore, which only the petitioner could waive by word or deed, either directly or through an agent.\\" The Court had previously held it unlawful for a hotel manager or an assistant to permit a search.Stoner, 376 U.S. at 489.In Lustig v. United States, , and United States v. Jeffers, , respectively. Stewart allowed that it was true that hotel guest could not completely isolate themselves from intrusion. It was implicit in a hotel stay that management, cleaning staff and maintenance could enter the room without a guest's permission in order to fulfill their job duties. But that privilege was limited to that purpose, and \\"the conduct of the night clerk and the police in the police in the present case was of an entirely different order.\\" He did not see the case as being substantially different from Chapman v. United States,Chapman v. United States, . another recent Fourth Amendment case in which the Court had held that landlords' permission did not allow police to search rented premises. Similarly, McDonald v. United StatesMcDonald v. United States, . had extended constitutional protection to tenants in boardinghouses. Going back to Johnson v. United States,Johnson v. United States, . a 1948 case that had suppressed drug evidence obtained by police who were let in to a hotel room by the occupant after knocking on the door, the Court had held that \\"a guest in a hotel room is entitled to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures,\\" Stewart wrote. \\"That protection would disappear if it were left to depend upon the unfettered discretion of an employee of the hotel.\\".Stoner, 376 U.S. at 490. Justice John Marshall Harlan II concurred in the holding but dissented from the disposition. He felt the Court should have merely vacated and let the California courts decide whether admission of the hotel room materials constituted harmless error.I.e., that enough other lawfully obtained incriminating evidence (the check stubs and the eyewitness identifications) existed that a reasonable jury would have likely convicted Stoner based on that evidence alone. In Fahy v. Connecticut, another case from the previous term where the Court had suppressed illegally obtained evidence and reversed a conviction, the state courts had at least already made that finding, Harlan observed.Stoner, 376 U.S. at 490‚Äì91, Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.

It was nominated for its well-preserved Carpenter Gothic architecture and shared importance to a community established by American-born settlers but later dominated by German immigrants. Description The original wing has been called a \\"sophisticated example of a Carpenter Gothic church with spire.\\" The building's lancet windows and door are typical of Carpenter Gothic architecture, while its center entry bell tower is atypical. History The first settlers arrived in the vicinity of Stockton around 1855. Mostly White Anglo-Saxon Protestants from the East Coast of the United States, they formed an Episcopal parish in 1858 and built the Trinity Episcopal Church the following year. By the end of the 1860s, however, an influx of German immigrants had altered the ethnic composition of Stockton. The church struggled to accommodate a bilingual congregation, and discontinued regular services in 1872. Stockton's new German majority formed a Lutheran congregation in 1891 and obtained the church building the following year. In 1924 the church was moved a short distance southeast onto a new foundation that had been constructed there with a full basement. At the same time a chancel with stained glass was added. A renovation greatly altered the church's interior in 1956, but did not compromise the historical integrity of the exterior. In 1971 a new wing using a style sympathetic to the original was added to the west.

History Axel Holm: The Freemasons' Hall, 1928 The Danish Order of Freemasons had moved between various addresses and at the beginning of the 20th century was based in Klerkegade in Copenhagen. When the municipal authorities in Copenhagen sold off a strip of land along Blegdamsvej, previously part of the park F√¶lledparken, the Danish Order of Freemasons acquired a piece of land. In 1920, a competition was held among its architect members for the design of a new headquarters. Martin Nyrop, architect of Copenhagen City Hall and himself a Freemason, sat on the panel of judges. The winning entry was submitted by Holger Rasmussen, a relatively unknown Danish architect who had mainly designed modest buildings for Danish State Railways. The Freemasons' Hall was of a different stature entirely. The Freemasons' Hall was built from 1923 to 1927. The cornerstone was laid on 3 June 1924 by Christian X of Denmark, who was himself a Freemason. Architecture Built to a rather austere Neoclassical design, the Freemasons' Hall is a large grey block. The front toward Blegdamsvej is dominated by an over-dimensioned entrance section flanked by two monumental columns, which are 16 metres tall and weigh 72 tons each. The building is typical of its time. Reacting to an excess of detail in Historicism, Neoclassicism had made a comeback in Danish architecture in about 1915 and lasted until the mid-1930s. Another example of the style is Hack Kampmann's Copenhagen Police Headquarters from 1924. The Freemasons' Hall has 13,515 square metres of floor space and approximately 335 rooms. It is 19.5 metres tall and has six main floors, two of which are below ground.

During the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes, which primarily targeted people of the Uzbek nationality, Askarov worked to document the violence. He was subsequently arrested and prosecuted on charges of creating mass disturbances, incitement of ethnic hatred, and complicity in murder. Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities‚Äîincluding alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police‚ÄîAskarov was given a life sentence, which he was serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health was reported to be rapidly deteriorating as a result of his confinement. Numerous groups advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience. In 2015, the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov. The Kyrgyz government protested this decision and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on cooperation between the U.S. and Kyrgyzstan. On 12 July 2016, the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the life sentence against Askarov and sent his case to the Chui Oblast Court for review. He was resentenced for life on 24 January 2017. Following amendments to Kyrgyzstan's Criminal Code in 2017, which came into force in 2019, Askarov's lawyers applied for a review of his sentence. However, on 30 July 2019, the Chui regional court upheld the life sentence of Askarov. He died in prison in July 2020. Personal life Askarov was born on 17 May 1951, in the village Bazar-Korgon, Kyrgyzstan. He attended an arts college in Tashkent. After getting his degree Askarov worked as a painter and decorator for 15 years. In the early 1990s, he began writing about human rights issues in a local newspaper. He was married to Hadicha Askarova and they had three sons. Human rights work Askarov worked as a human rights activist since the mid-1990s. In 2002, he founded the group Vozduh (\\"Air\\") to monitor the conditions of Kyrgyz prisons. Working primarily in the area of Bazar-Korgon, Askarov directed this group until the time of his arrest and was able to initiate new investigations of several cases of police brutality and torture. Several police officers were dismissed from their posts as a result of Askarov's investigations. Askarov has stated that in 2006, a prosecutor's investigator sued Askarov following an article he wrote publicizing torture allegations; the six-month court case ended with a verdict in Askarov's favor. As a result, Askarov claimed, \\"Enemies in the law enforcement community were constantly looking for an opportunity to shut me down.\\" Arrest and trial In July 2010, Kyrgyzstan saw an outbreak of ethnic violence in which as many as 400 people, both Kyrgyz and Uzbek, were killed, and hundreds of thousands of Uzbeks displaced. Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings. He was arrested on 15 June 2010 in Bazar-Korgon. Kyrgyzstan's human rights ombudsman, Tursunbek Akun, protested the arrest shortly after. Askarov was tried along with other human rights activists before a court in the Nooken District of the Jalal-Abad Province. An observer from Human Rights Watch stated that both the defendants and the witnesses evidenced fresh bruises and appeared to have been tortured. The observer also stated that members of the trial's audience openly threatened and assaulted Askarov, other defendants, and their lawyers inside the courtroom, and that local law enforcement refused to intervene. Askarov's lawyer, Nurbek Toktagunov, stated that he was also approached by the relatives of a police officer and threatened with violence if he continued to defend Askarov, leading Amnesty International to issue an appeal for the safety of both Toktagunov and Askarov. Askarov himself testified that he had been beaten and tortured while in police custody, and his lawyer reported that Askarov had further bruises on his back. On 4 November 2010, however, the prosecutor's office held a press conference to deny any beatings had taken place. Imprisonment and health On 10 November 2010, Askarov's sentence was upheld by an appellate court. Two days later, Amnesty International reported that Askarov's health was failing rapidly; he was soon moved from his prison hospital to a hospital in Bishkek. Members of his family expressed concern that he was receiving inadequate care from prison authorities. On 8 February 2011, the Kyrgyzstani Supreme Court agreed to hear new evidence in Askarov's case; however, his hearing was suspended. On 11 April 2011, his appeal hearing was postponed for the second time. On 20 December 2011, the Kyrgyzstani Supreme Court upheld Askarov's sentence. Askarov's lawyer then said he would protest the Supreme Court's decision in the UN Human Rights Council, however Askarov himself was against this, fearing not being able to survive until the day of decision. Askarov insisted on the review of his case in the Kyrgyz legislature. On 24 January 2017, a Kyrgyz court found Askarov guilty and sentenced him to life in prison. Following amendments to Kyrgyzstan's Criminal Code in 2017, which came into force in 2019, Askarov's lawyers applied for a review of his sentence. However, on 30 July 2019, the Chui regional court upheld the life sentence of Askarov. International attention Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Front Line, International Partnership for Human Rights (IPHR), and the International Federation for Human Rights have all denounced the charges against Askarov. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for him and fellow detainee Ulugbek Abdusalomov to be released, and for the officers who arrested them to be investigated for \\"abuse of office\\". His cause has also been championed by American actor Martin Sheen. The US Embassy in Bishkek also put pressure on the Kyrgyz government to hold \\"impartial hearings\\" on Askarov's appeal. Reporters Without Borders has called for his immediate release. On 8 March 2011, People In Need awarded him the Homo Homini Award \\"in recognition of a dedication to the promotion of human rights, democracy and non-violent solutions to political conflicts.\\" In an acceptance speech written from prison, Askarov responded, \\"I cried like a baby. There are no words to express my heartfelt joy. After much suffering, torture and humiliation, I realized once again the high social value of fighting for human rights and justice!\\" In May 2011, an exhibition of Askarov's paintings opened in Bishkek, organized by his wife and various Kyrgyz human rights organizations. The paintings focus on \\"the inhabitants of the Fergana valley and scenes from their everyday lives.\\"2020 International Press Freedom Awards In 2012, Askarov won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. The award recognizes journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. Death Askarov's body was transported from Kyrgyzstan to Uzbekistan for burial. Askarov died on 25 July 2020, one day after being hospitalized with pneumonia. He was 69, and suffered from a heart condition and other chronic illnesses in the time leading up to his death. He was buried in Tashkent Region, Uzbekistan, on July 31. Prior to his death Askarov had requested to be buried in Uzbekistan. Moreover, his relatives feared that in Kyrgyzstan his grave would be a target for vandalism by Kyrgyz nationalists.

While the coin typically had a nominal value of one pound sterling, or twenty shillings, the sovereign was primarily an official piece of bullion and had no mark of value on its face. Nonetheless, it was the country's first coin to be valued at one pound. The name derives from the large size and majestic portrait of the monarch (the \\"sovereign\\"), with the obverse of the first sovereigns showing the king's full face, sitting on a throne, while the reverse shows the Royal Arms of England and a Tudor double rose. The first sovereigns were of 23-carat (95.83%) gold and weighed 240 grains, or half a troy ounce. King Henry VIII lessened the gold content to 22 carats, or 91.67%. Although this was part of what is called The Great Debasement, 22 carats became the gold coin standard in both the British Isles and later the United States, known as crown gold. It had a diameter of , and weighed 15.55 grams (0.500 oz t), twice the weight of the existing gold coin, the ryal. The new coin was struck in response to a large influx of gold into Europe from West Africa in the 1480s, and Henry at first called it the double ryal, but soon changed the name to sovereign. Too great in value to have any practical use in circulation, the original sovereign likely served as a presentation piece to be given to dignitaries. A double sovereign in the form of a piedfort was occasionally created for such purposes too.Royal Mint Piedforts The inscription reads A DNO' FACTU' EST ISTUD ET EST MIRAB' IN OCULIS NRS  abbreviation for A DOMINO FACTUM EST ISTUD ET EST MIRABILE IN OCULIS NOSTRIS (Latin for \\"This is the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our eyes\\", from Psalm 118). Replacement King James I, when he came to the English throne in 1603, issued a sovereign in the year of his accession, but the following year, soon after he proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, he issued a proclamation for a new twenty-shilling piece called the unite, symbolising that James had merged the Scottish and English crowns. The unite, and then the other short-lived laurel and broad, therefore took the sovereign's place in the 17th century, before the guinea became established. However, the guinea changed value to 21 shillings in 1717. It was not until 1817 that the 20 shilling (one pound sterling) coin was re-introduced ‚Äî again named the sovereign, now a British coin, which continues to be issued to the present day.

Due to its proximity to ECIL, Secunderabad and Eastern IT/SEZ of Hyderabad Pocharam, it is emerging as a major residential location in Hyderabad. Till 2013 this area was dotted with green paddy fields everywhere. This has changed a lot due to the demand for residential apartments and commercial establishments all across Rampally main road. The demand for residential houses has increased because of various reasons like the proximity to Outer Ring Road, declaration of Nagaram municipality and due to abundant options for public transport. Geography Nagaram is situated about above sea level. There are 2 lakes in the vicinity of the area. Transport The Area is well connected by TSRTC to the rest of the city, having bus depot at Kushaiguda. Nearest Railway station is Cherlapally at about 5 km and Moula Ali at about 10 km, The other nearest major railway terminus is Secunderabad at about 17.1 km. There is a proposal to upgrade Cherlapally Railway Station,[3] as a Major Terminus to decongest traffic in Secunderabad Railway Station. Nearest exit and entry junction for Nehru Outer Ring Road is at Keesara Junction. The ECIL to Keesaragutta road passes through Nagaram. There is also a connecting route to the Karimnagar highway that passes through Nagaram and takes diversion from Cheriyal to Shamirpet which is mostly used nowadays in order to avoid traffic in the Karimnagar highway at Alwal ‚Äì Bolarum corridor of Secunderabad Cantonment. One can also reach the Warangal highway by taking a diversion towards Rampally X roads through Ghatkesar. This is one of the reasons the area is witnessing major development in terms of commercial establishments all across the main road. Economy The presence of various retail outlets have led to hike in commercial rents in the recent past. D Mart, Reliance Digital, Usodaya super market, More super market, Vishal Mega mart and Showrooms of Royal Enfield Royaloak, and various other service centers have come up are located in within Nagaram's vicinity.

(now owned by Deutsche Bank) as well as the youngest ever director at the British investment bank Morgan, Grenfell & Co. The bank was founded by the American George Peabody in 1838 as the UK branch of his US bank which subsequently became known as J.P. Morgan & Co.Burk, Kathleen In 1904, Edward Grenfell was made a partner in the firm and in 1909 it underwent a change of name to incorporate Grenfell, therefore becoming Morgan, Grenfell & Co. Harris spent eight years altogether at Morgan Grenfell. Harris departed Morgan, Grenfell & Co. for an American investment bank, accepting a position as managing director and Head of International Corporate Finance at the American firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. After the bank was forced into bankruptcy in 1990, Harris moved to the private equity sector. Between 1990 and 1994, Harris served as Chief Executive of Apax Partners Corporate Finance Ltd (previously Patricof & Co. and MMG).

Red Knights In 2010, a cabal of Britain's leading businessmen calling themselves the Red Knights met at the offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, the law firm, to attempt to remove Malcolm Glazer, Manchester United's owner. The group then met with Harris to broker the takeover. Harris, a lifelong Manchester United fan, became a member of the Red Knights who sought to buy the club from the Glazer family, the controversial American owners of the football club. The leading figures of the Red Knights were: Jim O'Neill, a former HSBC investment bank chief executive and chief economist at Goldman Sachs; Paul Marshall, a partner at the hedge fund Marshall Wace; Richard Hytner of advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi; lawyer Mark Rawlinson, a partner in Freshfields' corporate practice, who advised United during the Glazer takeover negotiations; and Harris himself. Harris claimed the group wanted \\"to do something for the good of Manchester United and the good of football.\\" In the past, he has been involved in the takeovers of West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa and he has been extremely critical of the debt that the Glazer family brought to Manchester United.

Roads and canals were an initial and integral sector of domestic improvements for transportation. Previously from 1795 to 1815, federal government support for internal improvements was under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures. Considered closely related to increasing the value of domestic commerce and funded by protective tariffs on it, the general subject of internal improvements was one of the most contentious issues in the young republic, despite the near-universal acceptance of the need for such development. As technical advances were made and competing modes of transportation developed, the government's consensus and perspectives of them also changed. The committee was renamed the Committee on Railways and Canals between 1869 and 1927, but over this period the committee's authorized jurisdiction contracted significantly. In 1880, responsibility for many railroad related matters and the improvement of navigation of rivers were moved back to the renamed Committee on Commerce. In 1883 however, the new Committee on Rivers and Harbors was given jurisdiction over subjects including canals, which were related to the improvements of rivers and harbors, as well as the responsibility of reporting the river and harbor bills. The Committee on Railways and Canals was dissolved in 1927 with its remaining issues and jurisdiction being added to those of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which was later renamed the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 1981.

ITIS.T. herbacea. Center for Plant Conservation.T. herbacea. The Nature Conservancy.T. herbacea. Flora of North America. is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names eastern fournerved daisy, lakeside daisy, fournerved starflower, and Manitoulin gold. It is native to and endemic to the Great Lakes region in North America, where it is present in Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map It is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation by several forces, including limestone quarrying, recreational activity, fire suppression, and construction. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States and of Canada.  Description  right Tetraneuris herbacea is a perennial herb growing from a branching caudex with one or more erect stems measuring 6 to about 35 centimeters (2.4-14.0 inches) tall. The leaves are located around the base of the plant and have rubbery, glandular blades. The inflorescence is a single flower head borne on a hairy peduncle. The head contains 50-250 yellow disc florets surrounded by 7-27 (occasionally 0) yellow ray florets each ray measuring 1 or 2 centimeters (0.4-0.8) in length. The fruit is an achene tipped with a pappus of scales.  Ecology  right Tetraneuris herbacea is known from just a few natural and introduced populations. In Ontario there are about 20 populations all located at the shores of Lake Huron on the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. In Ohio, the plant only occurs naturally in Ottawa County,USFWS. Lakeside Daisy Five-year Review. February, 2010. where it can be found at the Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve, a protected area named in its honor. There is an introduced population on Kelleys Island, Ohio, as well. In Illinois, naturally occurring lakeside daisies were last seen in 1981, and today the daisies occurring there are introduced populations in nature preserves. In Michigan there is one population in Mackinac County on the Upper Peninsula, which may or may not be naturally occurring. Tetraneuris herbacea occurs on alvars, a type of limestone pavement with little plant cover. These rocky outcrops have thin, alkaline soils and are quite dry in the dry seasons, making them inhospitable for many other plant species, so the lakeside daisy grows in unshaded full sun. In Michigan the habitat is based on tufa and marl, different types of limestone substrate. Tetraneuris herbacea is threatened by the loss of its habitat. The limestone plain where it grows naturally in Ohio, the largest population within the bounds of the United States, is privately owned by a quarrying company that mines the rock. The spoils of the quarry are dumped directly on top of clumps of the flower. Recreational activity such as the use of off-road vehicles damages the habitat. In some areas supporting the plant, lack of a natural fire regime allows ecological succession to occur in the nearly barren habitat, so that woody vegetation grows and blocks sunlight. The plant is limited to a rare type of habitat and its populations are small. Because each plant requires pollen from an unrelated individual in order to reproduce, small, widely spaced populations make reproduction difficult.  Recovery efforts  Lakeside Daisies on Kelleys Island The USFWS 2016 final ruling as a part of its Five year Review of recovery efforts for the Lakeside Daisy identified threats to survival as habitat destruction, succession of competitive overgrowth by woody species, over-acting for gardens, inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and self-incompatibility.US Fish and Wildlife Service. 2016. Lakeside Daisy 5 Year Review: Summary and Evaluation- Ohio Field Office. 26. Since the Lakeside Daisy requires a strictly dry, limestone-based habitat, climate change is likely to have a significant impact on existing natural populations. As quarry operations continue in these habitats, the areas best suited for Lakeside Daisy growth will likely fill with water and develop into small lakes.US Fish and Wildlife Service. 2016. Lakeside Daisy 5 Year Review: Summary and Evaluation- Ohio Field Office. 25. These changes to the natural habitat, if unchecked, will eradicate some of the plant's most populated centers. Historically, alvar habitat cannot be unnaturally created, and even attempts to restore altered land have not led to successful, diverse ecosystems.Catling, P.M. 2013. Can we create alvars or fully restore those damaged? Canadian Field ‚ÄìNaturalist 127(1): 97-101. In an effort to help nearby land be more suitable for the plant to expand, wooded areas specifically near the Ohio populations may require management and clearing. On a positive note, once a proper site is populated, competition with other species is limited since few other plants can thrive in the alvar ecosystems. Nonetheless, in recent years Lakeside Daisies have faced competition from native prairie plants, which often create a dense organic layer of soil. This presents a problem for the daisy by reducing sunlight and adding soil suitable for more competitive plants.Armstrong-Ullberg, J. 2014. Lakeside Daisy Census, Lockport and Romeoville, Illinois 2009-2014. Unpublished Report. Through observation as part of the Recovery Plan, bumble bees, small carpenter bees, and halictid bees have been recorded as pollinators for the daisy. A few other species of insects, including the Pearl Crescent butterfly have been found to pollinate Lakeside Daisy flowers. The role of these insects has been shown to be impactful, specifically with the smaller populations of the plant, in combatting the natural struggle with self-incompatibility. A 2007 study found that although the small populations of the Lakeside Daisy suffer from a lack of mates, they are more frequently visited by pollinating insects. Thus, despite population size. the Lakeside Daisy is rarely found to be pollen limited.

They include: * All mallet percussion instruments,and keyboard percussion instruments such as the xylophone and tubular bells. * Collections of pitched instruments such as hand bells, tuned cowbells and crotales. * Most other melodic percussion instruments. Despite the name, keyboard percussion instruments do not have keyboards as such. Keyboard instruments such as the celesta and keyboard glockenspiel are not included in the percussion section owing to the very different skills required to play them, but instead are grouped in the keyboard section with instruments that require similar skills. Auxiliary percussion All unpitched percussion instruments are grouped into the auxiliary percussion subsection, which includes an enormous variety of instruments, including drums, cymbals, bells, shakers, whistles and even found objects. Players are expected to be accomplished on the snare drum, bass drum, clash cymbals and other hand percussion, and to be able to adapt these skills to playing other instruments and even objects, for example the typewriter. Timpani The timpanist is a specialist who does not usually perform on the other percussion instruments during a concert. A high level of skill unique to this instrument is expected. While players of the keyboard and auxiliary percussion subsections often play many instruments from both subsections during a performance or piece, the timpanist is normally dedicated to that instrument.

In the image in the infobox at right, the red loop is not interlinked with either the blue or the yellow loops, and if the red loop is removed, then the blue and yellow loops can also be disentangled from each other without cutting either one.

It is stylistically descended from early military marches, and related to military cadences, as both are a means of providing a beat while marching. Usually, each instrument will have a part that mimics a specific drum or drums on a drum set to create a sound similar to a drum beat. According to Hiro Songsblog a drum cadence is \\"'a drumline piece played in a parading marching band between or in place of full-band pieces'. Cadences are also: 'a chant that is sung by military personnel while parading or marching'.\\"\\"Drum cadences and drumline sheet music\\", Hiro Songsblog. Cadences employ the four basic drum strokes and often directly include drum rudiments. They have a wide range of difficulty, from simple accent patterns to complex rhythms including hybrid rudiments, and are played by virtually every modern drum line. Cadences are important from a performance standpoint, as a good drum cadence can make the band stand out from the rest in competition. Field shows are often preceded by the band marching to the beat of the cadence. Marching percussion generally consists of at least snare drums, tenor drums, cymbals, and bass drums, and may include timpani.

Based on original designs by the Canadian designer D.C. Simpson in 1946, variants of the one-piece plastic chair went into production with Allibert Group and Grosfillex Group in the 1970s. They were inspired by the Chair Universal 4867 design by Joe Colombo in 1965, but no patents were filed for a monobloc chair design. Since then, millions have been manufactured in countries including Russia, Taiwan, Australia, Mexico, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, Morocco, Turkey, Israel, India and China. The Monobloc chair is named because it is injection moulded from thermoplastic as one piece rather than being assembled from multiple pieces. Many variations and styles exist but all are designed to allow the chair to be made quickly and cheaply through injection molding. A common thermoplastic used is thermoplastic polypropylene, with the granules being heated to about 220 degrees Celsius, and the melt injected into a mold. The gate of the mould is usually located in the seat, ensuring smooth flow to all parts of the tool. Close to a billion Monoblocs have been sold in Europe alone, with one Italian manufacturer producing over ten million a year. Many design variants of the basic idea exist. The chairs cost approximately $3.50 to produce, making them affordable across the world. The stackable design aids setting up large gatherings and storage of the chairs afterwards. Monobloc plastic chairs are prevalent in outdoor usage as design features like slits on seat and backrest let rain water and wind pass through and wide base makes it hard to tip over. Social theorist Ethan Zuckerman describes the chair as having achieved a cultural global ubiquity. Monobloc plastic chairs were briefly banned from public spaces in the city of Basel, Switzerland from 2008 to 2017 to preserve the beauty of cityscape.

He is best known for his many years of work with Perry Como on radio, records, and television and as the musical conductor for The Hollywood Palace. Early years Born Mitchell Agress in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he attended Columbia University, majoring in physical education, but began performing professionally at the Brooklyn Academy of Music while still a Columbia student. After graduation, Ayres became a violinist with the Roxy Theater Orchestra; he later moved on to the same position with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Because he wanted to return to New York, Ayres left classical music for popular, accepting a job with Jimmy Carr's Orchestra. Ayres later worked with Abe Lyman and Jack Little, known as Little Jack Little. Fashions in Music Promotional postcard for Fashions in Music. In 1937, after working in Little's band for a few years, Ayres and some of the other musicians decided to break away and start their own band. The musicians were extremely business-minded when planning their venture. The band was treated like a company, where each member had an equal number of stock shares in the new band. The orchestra leader was decided by election, and it was Ayres who was voted the head of the orchestra. Calling themselves \\"Fashions in Music\\" and selecting the song \\"You Go to My Head\\" as their theme, the members worked on arrangements and developing their own style while waiting for their first engagement. It took some time, but the orchestra got its first job at Brooklyn's Hotel St. George. The original contract with the hotel called for the band to play there for four weeks; their stay turned out to be seven months long. Fashions in Music was then signed to their first recording contract for \\"Row, Row, Row\\", which sold 50,000 copies soon after its release. Radio stations began playing the record, and the orchestra was in demand for appearances throughout the country. In 1939, Bluebird Records offered the band an initial one-year contract; the arrangement lasted until 1942. All the while, the orchestra continued to function as a company, with the musician shareholders discussing business matters and voting on them. By 1940, the orchestra had its own show on CBS Radio. (PDF) Ayres and the band appeared in three 1940s films: Swingtime Johnny, Moonlight and Cactus, and Lady, Let's Dance. Ayres and his orchestra reached the national top 5 with their version of \\"Make Believe Island\\" (1940), vocal by Mary Ann Mercer. Studio work and Como During World War II, Ayres began conducting for vocal groups such as The Andrews Sisters. He also began working for Columbia Records as a musical director, working with Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, and others signed to the record label, including Doris Day and Dinah Shore. Mitchell Ayres' first association with Perry Como came in 1944 when he was asked to conduct for a demo recording of a radio program with Como as its host. The program became The Chesterfield Supper Club. Ayres and Como shared an enthusiasm for golf and often played together. In 1948, Como offered Ayres the job as the conductor of his \\"Supper Club\\" broadcasts while the two were playing golf. Ayres and his orchestra also began recording with Como for RCA Victor; Como's pronunciation and phrasing on the recordings of \\"Kol Nidrei\\" and \\"Eli, Eli\\" were learned from a member of Ayres' orchestra, who was the son of a rabbi. When The Chesterfield Supper Club moved to television in late 1948, Ayres and his orchestra were part of the cast. Ayres and his orchestra remained with Como on his CBS television show, moving to NBC for both The Perry Como Show and Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall. While both Ayres and Como were working at CBS, Ayres and his orchestra also worked on the TV's Top Tunes program, which was a summer replacement for Como's television show. They were regulars on Como's programs until 1964. In 1963, after almost 20 years of a regularly scheduled radio or television show, Perry Como was not certain if he would continue making regular television appearances. His uncertainty caused Ayres to accept an offer to become the conductor for a new television show, The Hollywood Palace, which premiered in January 1964. He was nominated for an Emmy award for his musical work on the show in 1966 and again in 1968. At the time of his death, Ayres was working for the television program. Death Ayres was struck and killed by a car while crossing a Winchester street on September 5, 1969. He was in the Las Vegas area working as the musical conductor for Connie Francis' show at the newly opened Landmark Hotel. He was survived by his wife, Georgianna, a son, Lawrence, and a daughter, Judith. One week after her husband's death, Georgianna Ayres died of a heart attack. \\"Ayres, Georgianna, September 12, 1969, in Los Angeles, wife of the late Mitchell Ayres\\" (pay per view) Ayres and his wife are buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale.

The Parade of the Tin Soldiers was originally composed for solo piano. Jessel later published it for orchestra in 1905, as Opus 123. Today it is also a popular tune for marching bands, concert bands, and small orchestras, and for extremely diverse alternate instrumentations as well. performed by recorder ensemble, by the Nanyang Elementary School Recorder Orchestra in Taiwan (2009). Since the early 1920s, the piece has been very popular in the U.S., and has also been frequently performed and recorded worldwide.

Turn-of-the-Century Cabaret. Columbia University Press, 1987. p. 267. Balieff's wooden-soldier choreography referenced a legend regarding Tsar Paul I: that he left his parade grounds without issuing a \\"halt\\" order to the marching soldiers, so they marched to Siberia before being remembered and ordered back. In December 1920 Nikita Balieff's La Chauve-Souris (The Bat) revue reached Paris, to great acclaim, and in 1922 it was brought to Broadway. Balieff's entertainingly choreographed wooden-soldiers showpiece, with Jessel's popular tune, was a sensation, and a by-demand mainstay of his extremely long-running U.S. production.1922 audiences demanded two encores of the piece, in the Chauve-Souris's second run.

In 1923, Lee DeForest filmed The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, performed by Balieff's company, in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on- film process. The film premiered on April 15, 1923 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, and is now in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress. In 1922, the instrumental version of The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers was a hit single performed by Carl Fenton's Orchestra. Hit versions were also recorded by the Vincent Lopez Orchestra in 1922 and by Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra in 1923. A Betty Boop cartoon, Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, was created with the music in 1933. Also in 1933, The Rockettes began annually performing their own choreographed version of the piece, based on Balieff's original, in their Radio City Christmas Spectacular.

It opened with 60 first form students and Mr. Ren√© Constanza as the principal. It moved to the present location on San Lorenzo Road in 2004. In 2018-19 it had an enrollment of 385 students, with Mr. Luis Pook as principal and Mrs. Luisa Gillett vice-principal. Academics Students in first and second form (9th and 10th grade in the United States) all have the same curriculum but there are alternate programs in third and fourth forms. The focus of most of the subjects at third and fourth form is preparation for CSEC exams, as is the case in most Belizean high schools. Education at BMHS is also focused on Catholic faith and values. The calendar includes activities connected to the Church's liturgical year, including an emphasis on mission education ‚Äì preparing students for today's world but also with a faith in life beyond this world. The school's patron saint is San Juan Diego, canonized by John Paul II in 2002. Student life A special characteristic of the school is its involvement of parents through service hours and also in disciplinary matters.

It was located behind the large reception hall that was added onto the old Reich Chancellery, in Berlin, Germany, in 1936. The bunker was officially called the \\"Reich Chancellery Air-Raid Shelter\\" until 1943, when the complex was expanded with the addition of the F√ºhrerbunker, located one level below. On 16 January 1945, Hitler moved into the F√ºhrerbunker. He was joined by his senior staff, including Martin Bormann. Later, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels moved into the F√ºhrerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. The Goebbels family lived in the Vorbunker until their deaths on 1 May 1945.  Construction  In 1933, Adolf Hitler decided to expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he considered too small for his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that could also be used as a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker, which later became known as the Vorbunker. The Vorbunkers roof was thick, twice as thick as that of the bunker underneath the nearby Air Ministry building. The thick walls of the Vorbunker supported the weight of the reception hall overhead. It had three entry points, to the north, west, and south. Construction was completed in 1936. It had 12 rooms branching out from a single corridor. The F√ºhrerbunker was built by the Hochtief company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin. It was finished by 1944 and was connected to the Vorbunker by a stairway set at right angles (not a spiral staircase). The two bunkers could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door. A permanent guard detail was posted by the steel door. The F√ºhrerbunker was located about beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery, north of the new Reich Chancellery building at Vo√üstra√üe 6. The F√ºhrerbunker was located 2.5 meters lower than the Vorbunker and to the west-southwest of it. The accommodations for Hitler were moved to the F√ºhrerbunker, and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings.  Events  3D-Model of F√ºhrerbunker (left) and Vorbunker (right) Map showing the locations of the F√ºhrerbunker and Vorbunker in Berlin, 1945 The first air- raid drills for the Berlin central government district, which included the Reich Chancellery, occurred in the autumn of 1937. The protocol for the drills stated, in part: > To carry out the air raid drills, a precise regulation is required for the > three office buildings, Wilhelmstra√üe 77, Wilhelmstra√üe 78 and Vo√üstra√üe 1 > ... The officials and residents of Wilhelmstra√üe 78 and Vo√üstra√üe 1 can go > to the substitute shelters in Wilhelmstra√üe 78 and Vo√üstra√üe 1. The > inhabitants of the Reich Chancellor House, Wilhelmstra√üe 77, will use the > shelter under the ballroom. The only residents of Wilhelmstra√üe 77 were Hitler and his bodyguards, adjutants, orderlies and servants. It is unknown if the Vorbunker was used before January 1945. Hitler transferred his headquarters to the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945, where he (along with his influential private secretary, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann and others) remained until the end of April. Thereafter, the Vorbunker was used by various military officers and housed men from Hitler's personal bodyguard. In April 1945, as the Battle in Berlin raged on, Joseph Goebbels showed his strong support for Hitler by moving his family into the Vorbunker. He occupied a room in the F√ºhrerbunker which had recently been vacated by Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell. Two rooms in the Vorbunker were used for food supply. Constanze Manziarly, Hitler's personal cook/dietitian, made meals in the kitchen, which was equipped with a refrigerator and a wine store. On the evening of 1 May 1945, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide. Afterwards, Goebbels and his wife went up the stairs to ground level and through the F√ºhrerbunker's emergency exit to the bombed- out garden behind the Reich Chancellery. There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de gr√¢ce immediately afterwards by Goebbels' SS adjutant, G√ºnther Schw√§germann. Schw√§germann testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the \\"shots\\" sound. Schw√§germann then walked up the remaining stairs and outside. There he saw the lifeless bodies of the couple. Following Joseph Goebbels' prior order, Schw√§germann told an SS soldier to make sure Goebbels' was dead. The soldier fired into Goebbels' body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried. At 01:00 on 2 May, the Soviets picked up a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps requesting a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, surrendered with his staff at 06:00. Down in the F√ºhrerbunker, Chief of the Army General Staff General Hans Krebs and Hitler's Chief Adjutant Generalleutnant Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker; the clear mark of cyanide appeared on their faces.  Post-war events  The ruins of both Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as part of an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker complex largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947 the Soviets tried to blow up the bunkers, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959 the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker complex. In 1974, of water was pumped from inside the bunkers, and the East Germany Stasi conducted a survey of the interior of the Vorbunker and took external measurements of the F√ºhrerbunker. Since it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until after reunification. During the construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988‚Äì89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker was covered with a muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found on the floor of the kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the F√ºhrerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the F√ºhrerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the F√ºhrerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park. Site of the Bunker complex in 2007 On 8 June 2006, during the lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an information board was installed to mark the location of the bunker complex. The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, can be found at the corner of In den Ministerg√§rten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Stra√üe, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus Misch, one of the last people living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.

It is an impressive two-story antebellum mansion that was constructed between 1847 and 1853. Well known as the former residence of Reuben Davis, a prominent attorney, statesman, and author, the property has important historical connections for both the town of Aberdeen and Mississippi. History =Design and construction= The Reuben Davis House is an imposing example of the Greek Revival style that was popular in the prosperous South during the mid-19th Century. The original structure was built in 1847 by D.F. Alexander and then remodeled and expanded by William Cunningham in 1853. The house expresses major stylistic references to Asher Benjamin's The Practical House Carpenter (1830) and Practice of Architecture (1833). =Location= The city of Aberdeen was incorporated in 1837. According to an article featured in the Aberdeen Examiner, the city is described as containing more antebellum homes than any other Mississippi town of a comparable size. In the mid 19th-century, the community grew from the development of a cotton port on the Tombigbee River. The town was made the county seat in 1849 and had a population of approximately 5,000 by the 1850 census. However, the prosperity and economic growth declined after 1850 when the Mobile and Ohio Railway Company constructed a line eight miles west of the town. =Reuben Davis= Reuben Davis (January 18, 1813 ‚Äì October 14, 1890) was a prominent figure in 19th century Mississippi. He served as a prosecuting attorney for Mississippi's sixth judicial district from 1835 to 1839, and a judge of the high court of appeals in 1842. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he was a colonel in the Second Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers. In 1855 he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives and in 1857 to the U.S. House of Representatives for the Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth Congress. In 1861 he withdrew from this position to become the Monroe County candidate for the state secession convention. That same year he became a Mississippi representative to the Confederate Congress in Richmond, Virginia. During the Civil War he was a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. Following the Civil War, Davis returned to Aberdeen to resume his law practice. He purchased Sunset Hill in 1869. It was at this residence that Davis raised his family (with his second wife) and wrote the historical reference Recollections of Mississippi and Mississippians. He remained at Sunset Hill until his death in 1890 and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery. His wife died 22 years later, in 1912. Prior to her death, she had requested that her body be laid in state on top of the grand piano in her parlor and surrounded with roses; a wish which was honored. =Modern times= Over the next 36 years, the property changed owners multiple times. One of the owners, from 1937 to 1943, was a grandniece of Reuben Davis, Mrs. Edmonia Nichols. During the 1940s the house was utilized as an apartment complex and its condition deteriorated. In 1948 the property and the one acre on which it now stands was sold to Drs. Chester and Catherine Brummett. In 1961 Sunset Hill was sold to Mr. & Mrs. W. Emerson Jones. The Jones' made substantial improvements and renovations during their ownership of the property. The U.S. Department of the Interior added Sunset Hill (listed as the Reuben Davis House) to The National Register of Historic Places in November 1978. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History officially designated Sunset Hill as a Mississippi Landmark in February 1987. The house was sold in 1992, and again in 1997 to its current owners. Additional renovations have taken place over the last 15 years, including restoration of the Reuben Davis office. Architecture The architecture of Sunset Hill is described with great detail in the National Register Form: Tourism Given its rich history and cultural significance, Sunset Hill attracts a number of visitors each year. The home was featured in the 2013 Aberdeen Pilgrimage and Christmas Holiday Home Tour.

The group of artists that now paint the artistic murals in Benghazi, goes by his name and continues to work from a ramshackle office in a makeshift media centre next to the city court. He received a message to stop the artists' group claim. It claims the death threat was delivered by Gaddafi's security agents before they were chased out of the eastern part of city. Media tributes The New Yorker magazine commented on his death, \\"The network of international cartoonists is tight, and when a fellow artist dies unjustly, word travels fast. It saddens and enrages cartoonists, and their response is to draw.\\"https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/04/kais-al- hilali-libya-artist-cartoonists.html Kais's death was reported by journalists in many of the world's leading television stations and newspapers. However, it was the reaction and response from his fellow cartoonists in the same organisations that paid the ultimate tribute to Kais. At the time of his death his anti Gaddafi murals were only known to the residents of Benghazi. To mark the brutal nature of this death leading cartoonists from newspapers around the globe published cartoons in tribute to him and in protest at his murder, many portraying Colonel Gaddafi as being responsible for his death. His death was marked across the world by with an outpouring of art from saddened and enraged political cartoonists many drawing their personal take on al-Hilali's death including Jeff Danziger New York Times Syndicate cartoonist in New York City, Stavro Jabra -Lebanon, Cristian Sampaio -Portugal, Butti Manfuelli -Corsica, Avi Katz - Israel, Riber Hansso -Sweden, Saul Cabanillas - Spain, and Michael Kithla and Giorgio Foraltina. CNN,and Republica TV-Radio news networks carried reports on his life and death with CNN referring to his wall murals as 'works of art'. His death and the social impact of his art was reported by Rod Nordlandin the New York Times. The Australian Newspaper commented 'The young rebel artist lived to fight with his brushes and paints, eschewing Libya's weapons and bloodshed in favour of the satirical anti-Gaddafi graffiti and caricatures that he daubed across Benghazi's walls.THE young rebel artist lived to fight with his brushes and paints, eschewing Libya's weapons and bloodshed in favour of the satirical anti-Gaddafi graffiti and caricatures that he daubed across Benghazi's walls.

Richter and Walter A. Hamilton in 1927. The three had founded Aero Corporation of California in 1926 in Los Angeles and Standard was made a subsidiary of Aero in 1927. History Standard Air Lines was a transport agent for U.S. Air Mail and also flew passengers to destinations throughout the Southwest United States, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, Douglas, Arizona and El Paso. On November 28, 1927, Standard Air Lines began operations as Arizona's first inter and intrastate scheduled air carrier. In 1929, it started a rail link at El Paso, Texas, to carry passengers farther east by train. This was the first regular transcontinental rail and air passenger to and from California. Standard Air Lines began business as a three-times a week passenger and express service between Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tucson. The initial fleet consisted of two Fokker airplanes (NC7713 and NC8011) and seven OX5-powered Eaglerock airplanes. Standard carried 61 passengers during its first month of operations in December 1927. Initially, aircraft left Los Angeles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (PT), arrived in Phoenix at 3:30 PM Mountain Time (MT), and at Tucson at 5:00 PM MT. For the return trip, aircraft left Tucson at 8:00 AM MT on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, arriving at Phoenix at 9:25 AM MT and Los Angeles at 1:30 PM PT. Passenger fares were, for Los Angeles to Phoenix $47.50; Los Angeles to Tucson $60.00; Phoenix to Tucson $12.50. Express rates per pound were, for Los Angeles to Phoenix $1.30; Los Angeles to Tucson $1.60; Phoenix to Tucson $.50. Late in its life, Standard Air Lines extended its range to other cities. Its western terminus was Los Angeles, and it ultimately served Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, AZ, with El Paso, TX as its eastern terminus. On August 4, 1929, eight months before its ultimate sale, Standard Air Lines became the western link in an air-rail transcontinental schedule. Passengers traveled from New York to St. Louis by rail, connected with a Southwest Air Fast Express Ford Trimotor to Sweetwater, TX, then took an overnight train, \\"The Texan,\\" to El Paso. In El Paso, passengers connected with Standard Air Lines for Los Angeles. Under ideal conditions, the coast-to-coast voyage took 43 hours and 40 minutes, a savings of about 16 hours over the all-train routing. Advertisements The airline was described in advertising brochures as \\"The Fair Weather Route,\\" with the pleasant desert terrain beneath used as a marketing point. Advertised flight duration from Los Angeles to El Paso was 8 hours and 45 minutes. Acquisitions Standard Air Lines remained in business for about 30 months. Frye, as well as being the founder of the company, was also an active pilot of the line. Because of the Great Depression, Frye and his associates sold the airline to Western Air Express in March 1930. Concomitant with the sale, Frye joined Western Air Express on the Board of Directors and as Chief of Operations. Later in 1930, Western Air Express merged with Transcontinental Air Transport in 1930 to form T&WA; (TWA). Frye became president of T&WA; in 1934 and Richter became Vice President.

The school colour is green and its motto is \\"Virtus, Veritas, Victoria,\\" which means \\"Excellence, Truth, Success\\".  History  In Kincardine, as in most pioneer communities, one of the matters of primary consideration was the question of education. The children were at first educated at home, and then in 1851 a public school was opened. The rented frame building was on the river flats near the lake. The teacher, Mrs. Jane Nairn, had 66 students. The original school, Kincardine District High school, was erected in 1876 at the cost of $8,900. When the school opened 80 students attended at the cost of $8.00 a year for in town students and $10.00 a year for rural students. With a new addition in 1901 the school was to be used until 1954. Later the school was moved to a small frame building on the east side of Queen Street opposite Harbor Street. Shortly afterwards it was moved to the opposite side of the street. The next location was in a log building which was later the Gentle's property. Then it moved to Russel Street just west of the Anglican Church. Kincardine High School in 1876 In 1951 Kincardine High School became Kincardine District High School when a bus system was implementing to bring students in from neighbouring communities. In 1953 construction started on a new one-storey building to include home economics, industrial arts, a cafeteria and a much better gymnasium facility. The new building opened in 1954 with an enrollment of 244 students and a staff of 10. This new school was 2421.9 m¬≤. Only five years after the opening of the opening of the new school in 1954, two classrooms were added at the north end of the building. By September 1973 seven portable classrooms and a portable library resource area were added to the school. An addition in 1973‚Äì74 doubled the size. After the renovation in 1974 the school was given the new name of Kincardine & District Secondary School. In 1980 the athletics teams received a new symbol and name. The Kincardine Redmen of the past would now be called the Kincardine Knights. In 1983 the closing of Ripley Secondary School boosted KDSS's numbers up to 799, which was a new high for the school. In 1989 KDSS added another addition to the building. The school hasn't had any new additions since 1989. The current school is 7473.4 m¬≤ on a site of 5.22ha¬≤. In 2019 KDSS added the grade 7 and 8 wing.

Early life  Anna Paterson Stout was born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1858 to Scottish Presbyterian parents, Jessie Alexander Pollock and her husband, John Logan, a clerk to the superintendent of the Otago province. Her parents were active in campaigning for social reforms, notably in the temperance and freethought movements, which had a life-long influence upon Stout. From the age of 12 Stout was educated at the Girls' Provincial School, studying under Margaret Gordon Burn. Upon finishing her formal education, Stout lived with her parents in Dunedin, until her marriage in December 1876. At the age of 18 she married Robert Stout, a 32-year-old barrister and member of the New Zealand House of Representatives. Robert, a fellow Scot, was well known to the family and had been a frequent visitor, discussing freethought and the problems of the world with the Logans. She accompanied Robert to Wellington for the 1877 Parliamentary session. He became Attorney-General in March 1878. Robert's political career and legal practice did not progress smoothly, and the Stouts spent several years moving between Dunedin and Wellington. Between 1878 and 1894 Stout gave birth to six children, four sons and two daughters. One of their children, Sir Thomas Duncan MacGregor Stout, followed in his father's footsteps as a promoter of education. He was the first chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington and received a knighthood for his services to medicine and education. With Robert's knighthood in May 1886, she became Anna, Lady Stout.  Political activism  Stout was an activist, feminist and social reformer. Central to her social and political philosophy was the view that women should have equal rights with men and be free to develop their intellectual abilities to its fullest potential. She was a strong proponent of expanding women's higher education, with concern for the education of Maori women in particular. Throughout her life she worked to educate women politically and campaigned to give them equal pay and equal legal rights with men. Stout and her husband shared many social and political views, often working together through a broad network of social reformers and politicians. In Dunedin they were close colleagues of Harriet Russell Morison, and through the temperance movement with Sir William Fox, and also Julius Vogel. Robert was the lawyer for local MP William Larnach. Stout's role as the wife of the Premier, and later Chief Justice, made her a public figure, which afforded her access to the leading personalities of her day such as Richard Seddon, George Grey, John Ballance, William Pember Reeves, Margaret Sievwright, Lord and Lady Ranfurly, Lord and Lady Liverpool, even Dr. Truby King and Dr. Duncan Macgregor. Stout was a founding member of the New Zealand branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in 1885, however it was not until the 1890s that she played a more prominent public role. In April 1892, Stout was elected president of the Women's Franchise League in Dunedin and was a founding member of the National Council of Women of New Zealand, which was established at a Christchurch convention in 1896. She became a vice president with Kate Sheppard as president. The society aimed at educating women politically, promoting their independence and equality, and improving the living conditions of women who worked for wages. The following year she had a public dispute with the council over the venue of the annual convention and did not attend, although scheduled to present a paper on the responsibilities of parents. With this defection Stout weakened her links to the main body of politically active women. Stout supported the social purity movement, popular among women reformers in England and America as well as New Zealand. The movement sought to abolish prostitution and other sexual activities that were considered immoral according to Christian morality. Stout also helped to found the Wellington branch of the New Zealand Society for the Protection of Women and Children in 1897. Upon settling in Wellington in 1895, Stout played a prominent role in Wellingtonian social circles, with her social gatherings often reported in the newspapers. She used her position and connections to influence political behaviour on behalf of women. = England = In 1909 Stout and her husband Robert took their children to England. While Robert returned to New Zealand in 1910, Stout remained in England, where her children were studying. While in England between 1909 and 1912 she became involved in the British suffrage movement, establishing close ties with the Pankhursts and other feminist leaders. In England, Stout was freed from the constraints of her New Zealand role, while still enjoying its status. She aligned herself with the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the militant wing of British suffragism founded by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst in 1903. As a New Zealander and 'possessor of the vote', the WSPU used Stout to their advantage. Stout worked to assure anti-suffragists that voting rights for women in New Zealand had not led to the collapse of society. One of her key responsibilities was writing replies to The Times' anti-suffrage correspondents. Anna's articles appeared in Votes for Women and the Englishwoman and were republished as leaflets and pamphlets by several suffrage associations. Stout participated in public demonstrations, marching through the streets behind WSPU banners. In 1910 Stout led a New Zealand contingent in a mass demonstration in London's Hyde Park, where she took to a platform to speak. = Later years = On her return to Wellington, at the age of 54, Stout settled into the role of a prominent club woman, taking part in various clubs and societies. She participated in the English-Speaking Union, the Wellington Pioneer Club, the Wellington Lyceum Club, the Wellington Women's Club, and, during the First World war, the Women's National Reserve of New Zealand. In 1917 she was involved in the revival of the National Council of Women and after the war became a member of the League of Nations Union of New Zealand. In her later years Stout occasionally engaged in public debates over the role of women. In 1917 she opposed proposals to emphasize domestic training in the education of girls. Then in 1918, she led a protest campaign against a police raid on a Wellington house and the subsequent trial of five women for allegedly running a brothel. She contended that putting the women on trial while the men involved went free constituted a double standard. In 1922, during a wave of concern over the incidence of venereal disease and fearing the reintroduction of compulsory medical examination of women suspected of prostitution, Stout published a pamphlet opposing medical authorities who were demanding compulsory notification of the venereal diseases.  Death  Ill throughout the 1920s, Stout become less and less active. Robert died on 19 July 1930, and she died less than a year later, on 10 May 1931 at Hanmer Springs, aged 72. Her ashes are buried at Karori cemetery.

Background Janet Smith was born in Perth, Scotland on 25 June 1902 to railway fireman Arthur Mitchell Tooner Smith and Joanna Benzies. The family moved to London when she was eleven. In January 1923, she obtained a position taking care of the newborn daughter of Frederick and Doreen Baker. Frederick Baker ran an import-export business. When the family moved, first to Paris in April, then in October back to Vancouver, she accompanied them. The Bakers were among the social elite of the city. They lived on the fashionable West Side, then moved in May 1924 into the house of Frederick Baker's brother, Richard Plunkett Baker, at 3851 Osler in the exclusive Shaughnessy Heights neighborhood. The Chinese houseboy, married (arrived in Canada in 1913 leaving family in Hong Kong) 25- or 27-year-old Wong Foon Sing, became infatuated with Smith, giving her presents such as a silk nightdress. Although her friends would later testify that she feared him, her diary would reveal that she enjoyed attracting men. Death and lack of an investigation On 26 July 1924, Point Grey Police Constable James Green was called to the house. Wong claimed he heard what sounded like a car backfire; in the basement he found Smith's body. There was a bullet wound through her temple and a .45 caliber revolver near her right hand. Green picked up the weapon, making it impossible to obtain fingerprints from it. Despite there being no bullet, blood or brain tissue on the walls, no powder burns on her face, and the fact that the back of her head had been smashed in, Green concluded that she had committed suicide. After an inquest, the Vancouver coroner called it a \\"self-inflicted but accidental death.\\" Undertakers were summoned, and instructed by both the coroner and the police to embalm the body, likely eradicating any clues that it might have yielded, for instance whether Smith had been sexually assaulted. It was the first time the undertaker had embalmed the victim of a violent death without a postmortem. He found unexplained burns on Smith's right side. Smith was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in the 1919 section bordered by 41st Ave and Prince Edward Street. p. 2 Reopening of the case Smith's friends contacted the recently formed United Council of Scottish Societies, which pressured the provincial government and Attorney General Alexander Malcolm Manson to reopen the case. The Vancouver Star, a scandal sheet published by Victor Odlum, was quick to pounce on the affair. An additional inducement for Odlum was that an enemy of his, General A. D. McRae, was the father of Frederick Baker's sister-in-law. The body was exhumed on 28 August and a second inquest held. This time the jury concluded that Smith had been murdered. Manson appointed a special prosecutor, Malcolm Bruce Jackson. Suspicion immediately fell on Wong, the only other person in the house (other than the Bakers' baby, Rosemary) when the crime was supposedly committed. The Star published several articles in late July and early August in which it had portrayed Wong as the likely killer. Proposed legislation Odlum was an \\"exclusionist\\"; he believed that Asians could not assimilate with whites and had run on an anti-Asian platform in the 1921 federal election. On 8 August, he published an editorial called \\"Should Chinese Work with White Girls? He called for legislation to \\"preserve white girls of impressionable youth from the unnecessary wiles and villainies of low caste yellow men.\\" Popular Member of the Legislative Assembly Mary Ellen Smith introduced the \\"Janet Smith Bill\\" in November. It would have prohibited the employing of Orientals and white women in the same household. The Vancouver Province pointed out that it violated the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911 (which prohibited discriminatory legislation against Japanese) and that the British Columbia legislature did not have the authority to pass it. It failed after a second reading. Kidnapping Interest gradually died down, until on 20 March 1925, Wong was kidnapped by a group of men dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. They proceeded to torture their captive for six weeks, trying to elicit a confession, but Wong refused to cooperate. On 1 May, he was released. A scandal later developed when it was discovered that the kidnappers included \\"two Point Grey police commissioners, the chief of police, a detective sergeant and three prominent officials of the city‚Äôs Scottish societies.\\" The group had also enlisted the translation services of Wong Foon Sien, whose participation elicited outrage amongst both Chinese Canadians and Anglophones in the community because he was also working for a detective agency investigating the case. One man pleaded guilty to kidnapping. A detective and his son were also convicted, but the jury gave a \\"strong recommendation of mercy\\". The Point Grey policemen were acquitted, and the government controversially barred prosecution of the others. As it turned out, Manson knew where Wong was being held, but did nothing about it, hoping that the torture would solve the case. Instead, Manson's career was severely damaged by the revelation of his inaction. Trial Meanwhile, Wong was put on trial for murder. In October, the case was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence. Wong went back to work for the Bakers. In 1926, he left the country for Hong Kong or China. Other suspects Other theories gained popularity. According to one rumor, Smith had been raped and murdered at a wild party at the Baker house by wealthy playboys, who then bribed the authorities to cover it up. Writer Ed Starkins proposed Frederick Baker as the killer, portraying him as a drug smuggler. Bibliography *Starkins, Ed (1984). Who Killed Janet Smith? Gage Distribution Co.

His ancestor was Pierre de Morlaix, bailiff at Malvern Chase (the large forest which was the favorite hunting ground of Edward I of England). His ancestor Edmund Perkins emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, some time before 1677. His father, James Handasyd Perkins, was a noted Unitarian minister in Cincinnati. Charles was the oldest of five boys. He drowned (it may have been suicide) when Perkins was a child. Charles Perkins was educated in the Cincinnati public schools, graduating from high school at the age of 16. He also received a portion of his education from Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts. When he was 16 years old, he moved to Burlington, Iowa, where he won a job as a clerk in a fruit store.Donovan, p. 272. When he was 19 he took a job as a clerk for the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B&MR;). He was promoted to paymaster a year later, and then at age 20 was made Assistant Treasurer of the railroad in 1860.Emerson et al., p. 121.At least one source says he was not made Assistant Treasurer until the age of 22, in 1862. See: \\"Charles E. Perkins, Dead,\\" New York Times, November 9, 1907. His rapid rise in the company's ranks was not surprising: His uncle was John Murray Forbes, the railroad's president.O'Malley and Treib, p. 84. He was named Acting Superintendent and then Superintendent of the line in 1865. At that time, the railroad extended a mere , from Burlington to Ottumwa, Iowa. He helped incorporate the Burlington and Missouri River's Nebraska division, and was named its director as well as director of the line's Iowa division. Perkins was appointed vice president of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad in 1872. He was also named president of the B&MR;'s Nebraska division (a position he held until 1875). On January 1, 1873, the railroad merged with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CB&Q;), but he continued to hold the position of president of the Nebraska division. This proved a difficult economic time for the railroad. The Panic of 1873 set off the Long Depression, a prolonged period of deflation and little economic growth which did not end until after the Panic of 1893.Glasner, p. 148. During the first several years of the Long Depression, the CB&Q; neither acquired nor built any new track, although the parent railroad did absorb its Iowa division.Klein, 1986, p. 186. =Railroad vice presidency= Perkins was named to the board of directors of the CB&Q; in 1875. In March 1876 he was named the company's vice president,Klein, 2006, p. 391. but continued to hold the vice presidency and superintendency of the company's business operations west of the Missouri River. At this time, the CB&Q; was part of the \\"Iowa Pool,\\" a group of three railroads (the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (\\"the Rock\\"); Omaha and Northwestern Railroad (O&N;); and the CB&Q;) with major freight facilities in Omaha, Nebraska. At any given time, a single railroad might not have enough freight cars in Omaha to accommodate shippers. So they pooled their resources, and agreed to split the income from freight charges. The Iowa Pool was locked in a struggle with the Union Pacific Railroad. Profits depended on how much freight was handled, and which side could charge more.Klein, 1986, p. 185. The Iowa Pool, which had more trains and track, could offer shippers a faster way across the Midwest (and charged higher prices accordingly). The CB&Q; was the dominant system in the Pool. CB&Q; president James Frederick Joy clashed with Perkins over the CB&Q;'s operations. Perkins wanted \\"his\\" railroad, the B&MR;'s Nebraska division, to carry traffic offered by the Union Pacific. But Joy would not allow it, wishing to force the Union Pacific to move freight via the Iowa Pool. Moreover, Joy owned a controlling interest in other small railroads which could also route traffic away from the Iowa Pool, and these lines were demanding that Joy stop inhibiting them. Forbes ousted Joy in 1875 and appointed Robert Harris as the CB&Q;'s new president‚Äîa move which led to Perkins' elevation to the road's vice presidency. Although the CB&Q; eventually purchased another minor railroad to enhance its position vis-√°-vis the other small Nebraska railroads, Perkins came to believe that Jay Gould (majority stockholder in the Union Pacific) was using the lure of B&MR; traffic to cause dissension within the Iowa Pool.Klein, 1986, p. 187. In 1876, Perkins began lobbying Congress for legislation which would require railroads to charge shippers only for the actual miles traveled (a rule that would prevent the Union Pacific from charging higher rates, and thus drive it out of business). In 1876, Gould proposed that the Iowa Pool and Union Pacific jointly and perpetually lease the B&MR; (depriving Perkins of his control over the road). Perkins and Forbes rejected the proposal, but Harris met with Gould and was so favorably impressed with the idea that he called for a meeting that would include Gould, Forbes, and Perkins.Klein, 1986, p. 188. Meanwhile, Gould purchased enough stock on the Rock and O&N; roads that he won a seat on their board of directors. Harris won over a majority of the CB&Q;'s board of directors, and Perkins did all he could to sabotage further negotiations. By June 1877, negotiations for the \\"Quintuple Contract\\" collapsed. While Perkins was vice president of the B&MR;, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 occurred. Realizing public opinion was against the railroad and that support for the strike was widespread among workers, he shut down the railroad's operations on July 24 and demanded that the system's property be protected by \\"constitutional authorities\\".Bergman, p. 92-93. Within two days, public opinion turned against the strikers, and the strike began to collapse when conductors returned to work that day. The fallout of the dispute with the Union Pacific led to a number of changes in the CB&Q.; The CB&Q; and B&MR; became more closely allied, at the expense of the Iowa Pool.Klein, 1986, p. 189. The Burlington was absorbed into the CB&Q; in 1880.Ingham, p. 399. Perkins and Forbes then worked together to take over the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad and the Burlington and Southwestern Railway the same year. The Union Pacific was unable to reach an agreement with the Rock and O&N; for more favorable freight charges. Instead, the Union Pacific reached an informal agreement with the CB&Q; by which the Union Pacific would build a new rail line north of the Platte River, allowing it to control freight in the northern part of the state. The B&MR; would control freight in the southern half. Perkins demanded that the board choose between himself and Harris. In May 1878, Forbes ousted Harris and installed himself as president of the railroad. =Railroad presidency= The Nebraska division merged with the CB&Q; in 1881. That year, John Murray Forbes stepped down as president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, and Perkins succeeded him. Because the railroad's biggest financial backers were located in Boston, Massachusetts, he moved to that city. Perkins was considered an \\"intelligent, forceful\\" railroad executive. He pushed for dual routes through market territories to keep his competitors out, created a highly regarded management team, and required that his railroad meet the highest engineering standards.Klein, 1997, p. 178. During Perkins' tenure as president of the railroad, he bought up numerous other rail systems in order to expand his line's reach. These included the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, Omaha and Republican Valley Railway, Grand Island and Wyoming Central Railroad, Big Horn Southern Railroad, and Chicago, Burlington and Northern Railroad. In 1886, he expanded the line's reach to St. Paul, Minnesota.Solomon, p. 51. In 1879, James Jerome Hill and others formed the Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (StPM&M;).Albro, p. 190. Perkins began seeking a way to add a line from Chicago to Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1882.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 53. In 1883, Perkins took a secret trip over the StPM&M; and reported to the CB&Q;'s board of directors that it appeared to be a well-engineered line which ran through excellent markets. Henry Davis Minot followed up with another investigation in 1884. In addition to seeking a lease of the StPM&M; lines, Perkins also sought to build a line to St. Paul. The Minnesota legislature awarded the Chicago, Burlington and Northern Railroad (CB&N;) a charter to build this line around the same time as Minot's study. But negotiations between the CB&Q;'s Boston investors and Hill dragged on. Hill was anxious for an agreement because the Milwaukee Road had already extended as far west as Fargo, North Dakota, and the Chicago and North Western Railroad was pushing west as well. The parties reached agreement on August 3, 1885, agreeing to buy large portions of stock in each other's company and placing Minot on the StPM&M;'s board of directors. Although publicly Hill denied existence of an alliance, Perkins authorized the CB&N; to buy stock in StPM&m;'s depot subsidiary, leased StPM&M; track between St. Paul and Minneapolis, and won the right to use the StPM&M;'s Minneapolis depot.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 53-54. The deal between the CB&N; and StPM&M; did not prove as profitable as expected, however, and Perkins was forced to absorb the former into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 54. In 1889, Perkins led the system in constructing tracks across Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming so that it could link up with the Northern Pacific Railway near Billings, Montana.Ingham, p. 400. =Great strike of 1888= As president of the system, he led the CB&Q; through the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888. Perkins was notably opposed to labor unions. In May 1886, he fired all known members of the Knights of Labor working for roads under his control.Salvatore, p. 74. Now, Perkins also sought to eliminate unionization of workers on the CB&Q.; He believed that unionized workers \\"owe allegiance to somebody else, and not to the railroad company that employs them.\\" When the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen demanded that the railroad honor its work rules and implement a uniform pay scale that did not discriminate against newly hired workers, Perkins refused.Dubofsky, p. 20.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 100.Salvatore, p. 73-74. The union struck on February 27, 1888, and 97 percent of the locomotive engineers and brakemen walked out (even though the union represented only 65 percent of the workers).Dubofsky and van Tine, p. 100-101.Salvatore, p. 75. Perkins hired strikebreakers to replace the workers who had walked off the job. On March 5, the union asked unionized workers on other railroads to boycott the CB&Q; by refusing to load freight onto its trains.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 101. Perkins went to federal court on March 8,Salvatore, p. 76. seeking an injunction that would require the other railroads to load freight onto the CB&Q.; The federal court issued the injunction on March 13, and almost every aspect of labor relations on every railroad engaged in interstate commerce came under court control. The injunction proved so effective that Perkins told his wife \\"the general impression this morning ... is that the total collapse [of the strike] is not far off.\\"Dubofsky, p. 20 (ellipsis and insertion in original). The strike was essentially over by the end of March 1888, but it lingered in some areas for another 10 months.Salvatore, p. 77. The two unions ended their strike unilaterally in January 1889. For Eugene V. Debs, a local leader in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the strike proved life-changing. Debs radically altered his thinking about labor-management relations,Salvatore, p. 73. rejecting the idea of a social compact between management and labor.Dubofsky and Van Time, p. 101-102. He now saw labor and management locked in a power struggle rather than cooperating toward a common goal. =Business practices= Perkins was not an advocate of vertical integration. Under CB&Q; President Harris, the company had refused to build or purchase railroad track manufacturing plants (as many other large roads did).Ussleman, p. 93. Nor did Harris attempt to build on his relationships with rail manufacturers to get them to ship rails via his system. Instead, Harris focused on agricultural developments along the CB&Q;'s route.Ussleman, p. 94. But by 1883, members of the board of directors were pushing Perkins to start fostering industrial development along its tracks as a means of boosting freight. Perkins initially resisted, but over time adopted a policy of encouraging heavy industry to build along his system's rail lines so that they could become captive shippers. =Retirement and death= Charles Perkins resigned as president of the system in 1901 after New York City investors took control of the line. That year, James Jerome Hill, president of and the largest stockholder in the Great Northern Railway, won the financial support of J. P. Morgan for an attempt to take over the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Hill's strategy was for his railroad and Morgan's Northern Pacific Railway to jointly buy Perkins' railroad. However, Edward Henry Harriman, president of the Union Pacific Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad, also wanted to buy the CB&Q.; Harriman demanded a one-third interest in the CB&Q;, but Hill refused him.Solomon, p. 51. Harriman then began to buy up Northern Pacific's stock, forcing Hill and Morgan to try to retain their majority stockholder status in the road by purchasing more stock as well. Northern Pacific's stock price skyrocketed, and the artificially high stock threatened to cause a crash on the New York Stock Exchange. Hill and Morgan were ultimately successful in obtaining more Northern Pacific stock than Harriman, and won control not only of the Northern Pacific but also the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. (Alarmed by Harriman's actions, Hill created a holding company‚Äîthe Northern Securities Company‚Äîto control all three of his railroads. In 1904, in Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, the Supreme Court of the United States held that Northern Securities violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Hill was forced to disband his holding company and manage each railroad independently. The Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy would not formally merge until 1969.) Perkins suffered from Bright's disease. He became confined to his home shortly before his death, and died at his home in Westwood, Massachusetts, on November 8, 1907. The day his funeral was held, the entire CB&Q; railroad came to a halt as a memorial to him. Perkins was married to Edith Forbes of Milton, Massachusetts, on September 22, 1864.Derby and White, p. 425-426. The couple had seven children: Sons Robert, Charles and Samuel, and daughters Alice, Edith,Edith edited a collection of her parents' letters which was privately published in 1949. Cunningham, E. P., \\"Family Letters 1861-1869: Charles Elliott Perkins and Edith Forbes Perkins\\" (1949). Margaret, and Mary.Derby and White, p. 426. Although he died and was buried in Boston, Massachusetts, there is a large memorial in Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington.Hudson, Bergman, and Horton, p. 404. The large marble obelisk-style stone is the largest in the cemetery, and sits near a bluff overlooking the main line of the original CB&Q; railroad. =Other business interests= Perkins was a director of other railroads as well, including the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad and the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad (both of which later merged with the Burlington line). He was also a member of the board of directors of the American Bell Telephone Company, whose headquarters were in Boston. Legacy Plaque in the Garden of the Gods commemorating the donation of the land Perkins is one of the most quoted railroad executives by historians of American railroads.Klein, 1997, p. 177-178. Perkins owned a large estate in Burlington, named \\"Apple Trees.\\" The building that houses the Burlington Community School District Board, and superintendent's offices was a mansion that was built by Perkins, and given to his son, Charles as a wedding present. The Burlington Community School District obtained the home in 1926 when they bought land from Perkins' widow for use to build a new Middle School, though the middle school no longer stands, and the land it once stood on was given back to the city as part of Perkins Park, the old mansion still stands in its original location, and most of the fixtures in the house are original to the home when it was built, other additions came from the school district over the years. Although the old mansion suffered some soot damage, and a couple of broken windows a result of the fire that gutted the school building that was built in front of it, it was later repainted, and the windows replaced to look identical to the originals. The Burlington Community School District once had an elementary school building, named for Perkins. Although the school itself is no longer active within the district, the building still remains at the corner of Summer Street, and Dodge Street, and is currently a private home, and business. In 1879, Perkins purchased in the Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The purchase was originally intended for a summer home, but Perkins decided to leave the land in its natural state while acquiring additional land, all of which was informally open to the public for a number of years. In 1909, Perkins' children, knowing their father's feeling for the Garden of the Gods, conveyed his four-hundred eighty acres to the City of Colorado Springs to be operated permanently as a park, open to the public.

Property Investment Calculators are typically driven by mathematical finance models and converted into source code. Key concepts that drive property investment calculators include returns, cash flow, affordability of financing, investment strategy, equity and risk management.  Calculations  Here are some of the calculations that one may expect to see from a property investment calculator along with definitions. # Cash on Cash Return - Your cash flow in year 1 divided by your cash invested in the property. # Equity Build Up Rate - Your increase in equity in year 1 from mortgage principal payments divided by your cash invested in the property. # Capitalization Rate - Your Net Operating Income(NOI) divided by your property's asset value. # Gross Rent Multiplier - The ratio between a rental property's gross scheduled income and its market value. # Net Cash Flows - The amount of cash you expect to receive after expenses. # Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows - The sum of your net future cash flows discounted back to the present value using the time value of money to understand what future cash flows are worth today. # Gross Rental Income The total rental income one expects to receive. # Operating Expenses - All expenses associated with operating the property. These can include homeowner's insurance, property taxes, and maintenance expenses to name a few. # Net Operating Income(NOI) - Net operating income is also known as net income and is your income received after subtracting all operating expenses. This will exclude income taxes and interest. # Depreciation  The expense associated with the depreciation of your property. For more information on depreciation, see IRS Publication 946. # Tax Savings From Depreciation - The amount of taxes saved from using depreciation as an expense against income. # Debt to Asset Ratio - The ratio of debt remaining on the property to the value of the property or asset. # Internal Rate of Return - Technically speaking, it is the discount rate at which the Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows equals $0. In laymen terms, it is the rate of return you will receive on your investment in a given year adjusting for the time value of money.  Types of Property Investment Calculators  # House Flipping Calculator # Rental Property Calculator # Investment Property Calculator History In response to 2007 subprime mortgage crisis and preceding US Property Bubble, a number of residential property investment analysis tools and applications have been launched to the public by both government, commercial organisations and as part of open source projects. These analytical tools have been developed to help real estate investors to understand the risk and returns of residential property investing. These tools have included mortgage calculator, residential property depreciation calculators and property investment calculators. A number of web technology companies have also developed comprehensive all-in- one packages that provide financing, risk and return analysis, investment strategy and portfolio management capabilities.

It won the Bram Stoker Award, the Locus Poll Award for Best Horror Novel, and the August Derleth Award for Best Novel. It is based on a novella of the same title, published in 1983 in the magazine Omni. The first half of the novella makes up chapter 1 of the novel, while the second half forms chapter 3.Page at Internet Speculative Fiction Database The novel portrays a tiny fraction of humanity that has immense psychic powers, which they refer to as \\"The Ability\\". These powers can be used to completely control people from a distance to commit any physical action, including murder. This Ability has been used throughout history to have a direct or indirect influence, via the perceived charisma of world leaders or the actions of more covert individuals, on everything from individual senseless murders to the Holocaust. Across multiple timelines, the novel mostly follows two groups of amoral people in 1980, some with aspirations of world domination, as their clashing involves a group of investigators. These non-psychic investigators follow a series of bizarre murders to the conclusion that a cabal of powerful psychics must be stopped. Characters * Dr Saul Laski, a psychiatrist who survived the holocaust in World War II, spent time in Israel, and who currently works at Columbia University. * Sheriff Bobby Joe Gentry, initially investigating murders in Charleston, South Carolina. * Natalie Preston, a photographer whose father was killed and is determined to get answers and revenge. * Tony Harod, a powerful Hollywood producer with minor use of 'The Ability' which he can only use on females. He often helps The Island Club with hopes of becoming a member. =The Trio= * Melanie Fuller, a powerful user of 'The Ability' at least as far back as the early 1910s in Vienna, Austria. * Nina Drayton, a childhood friend of Melanie Fuller and an equally powerful user. * Willi Borden, also known as Wilhelm Von Borchert, a Nazi Oberst, an Officer in the SS, later reinventing his identity as a Hollywood producer and powerful user of 'The Ability'. =The Island Club= * C. Arnold Barent, a billionaire industrialist with a penchant for extreme security measures. He owns a network of private islands, ships, and planes. His use of 'The Ability' is unequaled by anyone he has ever met. * Charles Colben, a director of the FBI with use of \\"The Ability\\". * Nieman Trask, a user of \\"The Ability\\", an aide to a Senior Senator from Maine. * Joseph Kepler, a user of \\"The Ability\\", a member of the FBI. * Reverend Jimmy Wayne Sutter, an incredibly influential and successful televangelist who uses \\"The Ability\\" mainly to get obscenely rich. The characters Saul and Natalie, learning about the actions of The Trio and The Island Club, observe that these people with immense psychic powers could be considered a type of vampire, as they feed off the energy of those they indirectly kill to gain youth and energy. Plot summary The story begins in 1942, with a man named Saul Laski who fears for his life while at the Che≈Çmno extermination camp built by Germans during World War II in Poland. He is determined to resist being taken away in the night but something supernatural compels him to obey the orders of the Schutzstaffel. It continues in 1980 with a meeting of Melanie, Nina, and Willi in Charleston, South Carolina. They discuss a game that involves using an innate power they have, which they call an Ability, to take remote control of people simply through thought and cause them to do anything. When these people are controlled to murder, it imparts those with the Ability to look and feel younger and more alive. As each member of the group presents their recent exploits, such as the murder of John Lennon, a tension and unease between them is revealed as a kind of truce. When Willi's plane explodes the next day, Melanie suspects Nina and then a fight ensues, with both characters using innocent bystanders as soldiers and victims in a bizarre series of brutal murders involving children, old men, and security guards until Nina is shot in the head and dies. =An investigation= There is a police and FBI investigation into a bizarre series of seemingly unconnected murders that span down a street on a single night as Sheriff Gentry and FBI Agent Haines interview a visiting psychologist named Saul Laski. Saul is famous for his theories about seemingly strange and impossible violence, but is as stumped as the sheriff. Later, Saul is compelled to break into the house where the murders started to investigate, and meets Natalie; who has come for the same reason; to find out why her father, a photographer used and murdered in the battle, has died so bizarrely. After realizing they are both looking for answers, Saul reveals to Natalie that he has a past with supernatural violence, having been used by someone with the Ability in Che≈Çmno long ago, ever since looking to find the SS Officer, an Oberst, who controlled him in a perverse series of ways, including as a living pawn in a life-size game of chess with a Nazi General where each piece removed from the board was executed. As the chess game ended, Saul continued to be used to hunt down the Nazi General, who apparently had a weaker Ability than the Oberst. Saul is controlled to kill the General. Regaining his willpower for a moment in an explosion, he flees into the forest and survives the rest of the holocaust amongst Partisan Polish and later Partisan Jewish forces before finding solace in Zionist Israel. This story is shared with sheriff Gentry later. =The Island Club= Sheriff Gentry, now the only one investigating the murders as the FBI has shown no interest, realizes he is being followed. Eventually he confronts his follower, who instead of speaking immediately attacks Gentry and is killed in the ensuing struggle. There is no record of the person existing in US Government files, which leads Gentry to begin to believe Saul's incredible story. It is revealed that the reason the FBI was quick to stop investigating is that it is in part controlled by elements of the 'Island Club,' a Cabal of influential people with The Ability in the USA, such as Charles Colben of the FBI and Special Agent Haines, as well as billionaire C. Arnold Barent, Senatorial aide Nieman Trask, an influential Televangelist, and others. They discuss that Ayatollah Khomeini has a weak ability and thought he was the only one, and thus saw himself as godlike. They also discuss that they are manipulating the current US election by way of the Iran Hostage Crisis to ensure Ronald Reagan's election. Willi kills a member of the club through long-distance use of a controlled surrogate to get their attention, asking to be a part of the games. Meanwhile, Melanie flees, accessing hidden identities and bank accounts throughout the US, and prepares to hide using identities and money she has waiting in France. At the Atlanta Airport, she is terrified by a courtesy phone call when she hears Nina's voice, convincing her that somehow Nina has cheated death, perhaps with a stronger Ability than previously known. Melanie uses people in a blind panic and ends up in Germantown, Philadelphia. She meets and conditions a new pawn, a hitchhiking thug called Vincent, into a mute killer. Saul, after years of working with various groups to track down the Oberst, believes he has found him‚Äîa man named Willi Borden. Saul hires Private detectives to track Willi, but they either disappear in Los Angeles or die. Saul reaches out to family members working in the Mossad for help in the same search for Willi Borden. This leads to his nephew Aaron, as well as Aaron's wife and children, being killed by agents of the Island Club. =Events in Philadelphia= Melanie begins setting up a new series of controlled helpers and a new life in Philadelphia. Verbally harassed by gang members, she begins sending Vincent to brutally butcher and impale the heads of gang members as a warning, which sparks further violence in the community but also draws the attention of both Saul's group and the Island Club. Tony Harod, a vile Hollywood producer who only uses his Ability to subjugate and rape women, has been offered a membership in the Island Club if he agrees to help hunt down Willi and Melanie. He arrives in Philadelphia as all other characters arrive for a variety of reasons, the Island Club using the CIA and FBI to cordon off Germantown, Philadelphia from any outside intervention, including police and firefighters. As Natalie and Gentry investigate, the Island Club uses a bus full of people to attack them‚Äîand they flee to the safety of the gang since no authorities arrive to help. A huge firefight erupts as Natalie and Gentry marshall the gang forces against the \\"voodoo woman\\" who killed their comrades against those she controls, while the FBI adds to the violence in an attempt to flush out either Willi or Melanie, as well as kill Gentry and Natalie for knowing too much. Gentry and Natalie get to the house and almost to Melanie, but Vincent attacks, killing Gentry, as Natalie kills Vincent. Melanie has been driven more insane by the thought of Nina being alive, and sees the violence erupting around her through her lens of racism as a bad northern neighborhood gone worse. Melanie escapes, controlling one old woman in a car. She is followed by Charles Colben of the Island Club in a helicopter with a rifle. The controlled old woman is shot. Melanie manages to destroy the helicopter and Colben through use of the old woman who appears dead but can be pushed beyond human limits by her Ability, and escapes to a park where she meets and takes over a family. Saul and Natalie escape wounded but alive, heal, and get help from the Mossad revealing some but not all information about the Island Club. They manage to get supplies for a complicated trap for Tony Harod. They kidnap him in Los Angeles and take him to a secret interrogation room operated by the Mossad in an abandoned barn east of San Juan Capistrano, California off the Ortega Highway. There Tony Harod is interrogated under drugs to find out as much as possible about the Island Club and the Ability in general‚Äîgetting info from EEG readouts as Tony tries in vain to control Natalie to escape. The EEG reveals information about a theta rhythm signature that occurs when people with the Ability attempt to control others. Harod believes this interrogation about the Island Club is the work of Willi, using Saul and Natalie, and he is released, being told to follow Willi's instructions, upon penalty of death, through his supposed pawns (Saul and Natalie). Saul realizes as they are packing up that he is being pursued by FBI Agent Haines, and sets the barn on fire and flees with Natalie. They eventually kill Haines just outside Lake Elsinore, CA and escape, lost in a stolen car along fire service roads until ending up in Fallbrook, California. =Island Club Games= The Island Club \\"games\\" begin on a private island of C. Arnold Barent. Willi has apparently been working with the televangelist to vote to take the Island Club \\"games\\" global. This means they will not simply control a few people on the private island to see who is the most powerful, but control leaders of nations with nuclear results. Willi has shown his power earlier by using one of two people stationed in the control room at an Air Force missile silo in Meriden, Wyoming to demonstrate his ability to instigate United States-USSR nuclear war. Saul and Natalie plan to infiltrate the island. Saul will pose as one of the runaways used as human pawns in the island games, being brought there by Tony Harod as instructed after his interrogation. Natalie, back in Charleston, has found Melanie and convinced Melanie that Natalie is an agent of Nina warning her of Willi's power (his death on the plane was faked) and the Island Club's growing power. The story's action climaxes at the private island. Saul becomes a willing pawn in the \\"game,\\" having trained himself with self-hypnosis for months to memorize as many details as possible of the lives of death camp victims and survivors of the holocaust so that when Willi attempts to control him, the memories of others will confuse Willi in a way that will gain Saul a few seconds to attack and kill the old man. Willi takes over the \\"use and hunt\\" aspect of the \\"game\\" and suggests taking the game global‚Äîwhich he and the televangelist support, and Barent and Kepler don't. Harod, being technically a full voting member of the club, abstains; caring less about old ambitions and more about surviving. The night quickly becomes a contest between those with superior Ability: Willi and Barent. They agree to play a living chess game for the fate of the \\"games\\" to come. If Willi wins, the game becomes global in lethality. If Barent wins, its barbarism is contained to the island. Saul gets his chance and kills Willi, who won the chess game. As Barent leaves, he is killed by Melanie's use of surrogates, coerced by Natalie back in Charleston. The book ends with Natalie going that same night on a suicide mission to finally kill Melanie and her collection of family, nurse, and doctor pawns. She barely succeeds, but it is revealed she only killed someone Melanie made to look like a body double through surgery and obfuscation. The book ends with Melanie comfortable and unchallenged in her abilities in France, keeping tabs on control of officers of a nuclear submarine. Historical references The timelines of the story in 1940s Poland and Israel, and as well as The United States in the 1980s are framed within and often reference actual events being directly or indirectly manipulated by characters with 'The Ability': * Che≈Çmno extermination camp, Sobibor extermination camp, and the events at Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4 p.m. * Simon Wiesenthal's Nazi hunters, the Soviet People's Standing Tribunal on Fascist War Crimes and Allied war crimes tribunals such as the Nuremberg Trials * The murder of John Lennon * The Iranian Hostage Crisis * The election of President Ronald Reagan * The Reagan Assassination Attempt * The actions of the Mossad, and the PLO in the 1980s and Kibbutz building in Israel * The estate of Willi and establishment of a National Park at Bayerisch Eisenstein * Grumblethorpe, The Fuller House, and other historic houses on the National Register of Historic Places Themes and references The character of Dr Saul Laski often mentions theories he has published about both personal and national violence, also making comparisons and references to Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Dr Laski mentions a \\"climate of violence,\\" He mentions that a complex web of factors can contribute to a violent situation, such as studies that color can affect physical and emotional states and that He references the work of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development, adding that there is an additional level: =National defense and morality= The characters of Dr Saul Laski and Wilhelm Von Borchert (also known as Willi Borden) often compare each other's backgrounds during confrontations. Saul condemns the Third Reich's violent actions as inhuman. Willi counters that the modern state of Israel perpetrates similar acts of racial violence against Arabs not unlike the early days of Nazi Germany, mentioning that both the United States military and the Mossad commit deplorable acts of violence in the name of national self-defense, and that the Wehrmacht literally means \\"to defend with force.\\" Saul argues that there is a difference in level of degrees of violence and what can be justified, which allows the author to illustrate and juxtapose the murky ethical implications of the actions of groups such as the CIA, the Mossad, and the SS; and invites the reader to compare them to contemplate which is morally acceptable. =Prejudice= The amoral villains of the novel, both 'The Trio' and 'The Island Club,' are often portrayed as harboring some level of racism and sexism, and often in extreme cases such as ex-SS officer Willi and Melanie Fuller's background in pre-war Austria and the segregationist south of the United States. The language used by Melanie Fuller throughout the novel contains mainly anachronistic racially charged words and hate speech to disconnect the modern reader from her first person narratives. While all the older members of both groups harbor sexist views, Tony Harod's character is portrayed as especially sexist. He is openly violent towards women, using his ability mostly to rape and control women on adolescent whims. The entire concept of forced mind control is often portrayed in the novel as a psychic form of rape, as the victims are aware of what their bodies are being made to do. Harod survives the climax, where his behaviour negates any previous hint of personal growth, but he is later killed by one of the women he has abused. The characters who successfully vanquish these racist and sexist foes in the climax of the novel are the very groups the villains consider less than human. Natalie is an African American woman, and Saul is a Jewish survivor of the holocaust. The only characters who are homosexual in the novel are Willi and Sutter, the televangelist, who are both villains in the novel. In the case of Sutter, his homosexuality could be seen as simply another aspect of his personal life that clashes with the fundamentalist Christian ideals he crassly manipulates for profit. It is unknown if the author meant for comparisons to be drawn between this character and figures such as Jerry Falwell, Billy James Hargis, and other Evangelicals involved in scandal.

Designed by Tom Brien and Alex Nichiporchik, it is the successor to Brien's browser game, released on January 6, 2011. No Time to Explain has been released on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OS X. A remastered version of the game, No Time to Explain Remastered, was released for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A Wii U version was planned, but never released.  Plot  The game follows an unnamed male protagonist as he chases his future self, who has been captured, through time for an unknown reason. Central to the game is a powerful laser gun received from the Future Protagonist that can be used as both a weapon and a means of propulsion. A running gag is that, just as a character is about to explain what's going on, they are interrupted, keeping the protagonist - and the player - in the dark. The plot contains elements of time travel, the time paradox effect, and alternate time-lines. As the game continues, the characters and worlds get increasingly more absurd, including a world made entirely of desserts and a blank world that must be painted with \\"ink\\" (via the gun) to traverse. The player will also control several alternate versions of the protagonists, such as the football helmet wearing \\"Most Popular Guy in the World,\\" who uses his shotgun to propel himself over large distances. Eventually, the culprit behind the attacks is discovered: the protagonist's evil twin, who was released by accident while the protagonist was chasing his abducted selves. Once all the levels are completed, a round table of protagonists convenes to come up with a plan. The group misunderstands a brainstorm from the original protagonist and graft him and The Most Popular Guy in the World together into a composite being, giving the player the ability to use both types of guns. The plan somehow works, but moments before defeat, the evil twin goes back to the beginning of the game with Composite Guy in pursuit. The original protagonist is killed after the twin steals the laser gun, the twin is then pushed into the attacking monster he released, and after a few awkward moments of silence, the composite protagonist finally announces, \\"Video Games!\\" Then, the credits roll.  Gameplay  The game is a 2D side-scroller, with most of the levels involving various means of propulsion. The main method is a laser gun worn as a jetpack that shoots a laser beam with a time limit. Many variations on this, such as a shotgun that launches the player at a great distance, or a slingshot effect that flings the player from wall to wall, are used at different levels.  Development  No Time to Explain was a browser game created by Tom Brien and released on Newgrounds on January 6, 2011. It has currently garnered over 405,000 views at Newgrounds. After the success of No Time to Explain, Brien teamed up with Alex Nichiporchik to start work on a full version of the game. Development on No Time to Explain began in February 2011. The game was initially announced for PC and Mac, and was released for Windows, Mac and Linux in August 2011, and on Steam in January 2013. The game differs from the original Flash game in that instead of being drawn, the levels are built out of blocks. On April 11, 2011, tinyBuild announced that they opened a Kickstarter account to collect funds to help support the project. In less than 24 hours, the $7,000 goal was met. The Kickstarter page has helped raised over $26,000 for the project with a notable contribution of $2,000 from Minecraft creator Markus Persson.

The steamer was carrying a crew of twenty-five men and a full cargo, including cattle and three tons (2.722 t) of blasting powder destined for the Tantalus coal mine, downriver. The Columbian was long, wide, and capable of carrying one hundred and seventy-five passengers plus freight. The engine room was long, housing two high-pressure engines. Built in 1898 by John Todd for the Canadian Development Company (CDC), it was the first CDC steamer to arrive at Dawson City that year, carrying two prefabricated steel steamers for the North-West Mounted Police. The Columbian was bought by the British Yukon Navigation Company along with sixteen other CDC steamers in 1901. In 1905, it had been converted to burn coal from the Tantalus Butte Coal Mine. The accident On the day of the accident, the Columbian was carrying only one passenger: Ernest Wynstanley, a stowaway who had sneaked aboard, pretending to be the caretaker of the cattle on board. He was to have been thrown off when the ship docked at Tantalus. In addition to the cattle, the Columbian was also carrying one hundred and fifty tons (136.08 t) of vegetables and meat, along with three tons (2.722 t) of blasting powder. The 1906 season crew included J. O. Williams, captain; H. C. Baughman, mate; A. Borrowman, steward; Lionel Cadogan Cowper, purser; Carl Christianson (shipping on as \\"J. Smith\\"), deckhand and coal trimmer; A. D. Lewis, chief engineer; Frank J. Mavis, second engineer; Edward Morgan, fireman; Phil Murray, deckboy; C. D. Phillips, deckboy; C. Smith, purser; Joe Welsh, mate; and John Woods, deckhand. The explosion happened after Murray passed his illicitly-held loaded rifle to Morgan, so that the fireman could take pot shots at a flock of ducks on the water. Morgan tripped and accidentally discharged the gun into the load of blasting powder stored on deck. Following the ensuing explosion and fire, the captain grounded the ship on shore; those not killed or injured by the blast jumped ashore to safety. > The explosion blew out the sides of the vessel, scattered men and cargo in > the water, and in less than five minutes had involved the whole inside of > the ship in a mass of seething flame. :‚ÄîDawson Daily News, 26 September, > 1906 Six men were killed: Morgan and Welsh were killed instantly, Christianson, Murray, and Woods died before help arrived, and Cowper died several days later of his injuries. The entire cargo was also lost. Welsh's body turned up on the river two months later, but no trace of Morgan was ever found. Rescue The crew had no provisions and no way to easily go for help. The closest telegraph office was away at Tantalus. A party of three set out on foot; they were overtaken by Captain Williams and Engineer Mavis in a canoe they had borrowed from a woodcutter. Arriving at Tantalus after midnight, they woke up the telegraph operator who sent out a message about the disaster with no response‚Äîall the other operators were asleep. The first to receive the message, at 9:00 a.m. on 26 September, was at Whitehorse. The first ship to arrive at the scene of the explosion was the sternwheeler Victorian, arriving at 7:00 p.m. Captain Williams had returned that morning; Christianson and Woods had died during the night. Murray died shortly after being carried aboard the Victorian. Another sternwheeler, the Dawson, had been dispatched from Whitehorse with a doctor and nurses aboard. The Dawson had not received the news until 1:00 p.m. on 26 September; at 1:00 a.m. on 27 September, the Dawson took the crew of the Columbian on board and returned to Whitehorse, where Cowper soon died. Aftermath A coroner's jury was called to investigate the cause of the Columbian disaster and returned the following verdict: > That these three men came to their deaths as the result of burns received in > an explosion of powder on the forward part of the deck of the Steamer > Columbian, and further this jury attaches no blame to any of the surviving > officers or crew. :‚ÄîThe Weekly Star, 26 October, 1909[sic] The bodies of Welsh and Morgan had not been recovered at the time of the jury's deliberations; the cause of their disappearance and deaths was not considered by the inquest. The body of Welsh was found in November on a bar in the Yukon River between Tantalus and Five Fingers, about below the site of the disaster. A lynx had been spotted gnawing on something on the bar; Welsh was identified by the buttons remaining on his vest which was still on his body. After the explosion the boiler and engines were stripped from the wreck and transported to Dawson City; the boiler was installed on the sternwheeler Casca in 1907. The hull, deemed a menace to navigation, was floated downstream and abandoned in \\"Columbia\\" slough. A monument was erected in the Whitehorse cemetery bearing the names of the men who died.

Biography Ada Wells c. 1910 Ada Pike was born near Henley-on-Thames, South Oxfordshire, England. Her parents emigrated to New Zealand with their four girls and one boy in 1873, arriving on the Merope in Lyttelton on 31 October of that year. She attended Avonside School from 1874, and Christchurch West High School in 1876, where she then worked as a pupil- teacher from 1877 to 1881. Wells attended Canterbury College. In 1884, aged 20, she married Harry Wells, the cathedral organist and choirmaster. Twelve years Ada's senior, with a violent temper and fondness for alcohol, he was a poor financial manager. Ada's marital experience ‚Äì where she was, at times, the family breadwinner ‚Äì strengthened her belief that women should have economic independence. Wells was a teacher at St. Albans School which was situated in a poor working class part of Christchurch. With her husband's help, Ada put on concerts in aid of the school prize fund. In 1892, Ada, pregnant, sought two months' leave of absence. The North Canterbury Education Board was inclined to grant this. However, Ada was opposed by the headmaster, James Speight, who wrote a long letter on 'the delinquencies of Mrs. Wells'. Rather than being granted leave of absence, Ada was dismissed. In the 1880s, working within the Women's Christian Temperance Union, Ada was active in the women's suffrage movement. While Kate Sheppard was the public face of the campaign, Ada was the backroom organiser. In 1893 New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections.'New Zealand women and the vote', URL: http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage , (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 17 July 2014.New Zealand Electoral Act In 1892, Ada established the Canterbury Women's Institute, an organization similar to the Women's Franchise Leagues in other parts of the country; for many years, she was president. In 1896 when the National Council of Women of New Zealand was formed, she became its first secretary. From 1899 to 1906, Ada was an elected member of the Ashburton and North Canterbury United Charitable Aid Board. She was associated with the Prison Gate Mission for the rehabilitation of ex- prisoners. A founding member of the National Council of Women in 1896, she was the first secretary. She had three daughters and a son. Harry Wells died in 1918. Ada died in Christchurch on 22 March 1933 and was buried at the Waimairi Cemetery.\\"Ada Wells\\", NZ History Online The Ministry for Culture and Heritage now offers an Ada Wells Memorial Prize for Undergraduate Students.

At the 1897 conference of the National Council of Women, Wells promoted an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet. She authored magazine articles supportive of naturopathy and vegetarianism. Wells was an anti-vaccinationist and opposed vivisection. She also campaigned for the corollary to women's suffrage, women's right to stand for Parliament. This was granted in 1919, though no woman was elected until 1933. A member of the Labour Party, Ada was, between 1917‚Äì19, the first woman member of the Christchurch City Council.

King was an engineering student at Kansas State University. In 1948 he founded his first company manufacturing components for Arthur A. Collins of Collins Radio. After selling his first venture in 1959, King founded King Radio in a rural area outside Kansas City. The company was moved shortly after its formation to a plant in Olathe, Kansas. It was later purchased by Allied Corporation and merged with Bendix Corporation in 1985 to form Bendix/King. Today it is part of Honeywell International Inc.  Products  A King KY197 Comm radio in a Yankee panel King Radio was a manufacturer of general aviation avionics and aviation gauges and indicators. It was a major avionics supplier of Cessna, Piper, and Beechcraft. The success of King Radio began with the highly popular KY 90 VHF communications radio, known for its clarity and low cost. Over the years King Radio produced many hits such as the KDF 800 Automatic Direction Finder and the KX 155 Navigation/Communication radio. Many of these products can still be found on aircraft flying today. In 1970 King Radio released the KX 175 the first low cost all solid state VHF navigation and communications unit with TSO design approval, which was the first affordable general aviation digitally synthesized radio, which together with its derivatives, the KX170B and KX 175B, became what is known as the most reliable radio of its times, for use in general aviation.  Acquisition  In 1983, King Radio was acquired by the Allied Corporation, which also purchased Bendix Aviation that same year. The combined company was called Bendix/King. Allied Corporation merged with the Signal Companies in 1985 to form AlliedSignal. That company later merged with Honeywell, and retained the use of the Honeywell name. The BendixKing brand has remained popular with aviation enthusiasts, and both AlliedSignal and Honeywell have used the brand on their general aviation products to this day.

They are currently signed to the Jagjaguwar record label. The band consists of Josh Kolenik (lead vocals/guitar), Ryan Heyner (guitar/keyboards), Juan Pieczanski (bass/guitar), and Jeff Curtin (drums). After releasing the critically acclaimed Small Black EP, the band signed to Jagjaguwar to release their debut full length, New Chain (2010). Their second full length, Limits of Desire was released in May 2013, with the single \\"No Stranger\\" a mainstay on satellite radio. The band has toured consistently since 2010, participating in numerous festivals such as Primavera Sound Festival, Fun Fun Fun Fest, Capitol Hill Block Party, and the SXSW Music Festival. History Josh Kolenik and Ryan Heyner formed the band while experimenting with lo-fi and loop-based recording techniques. The initial EP was recorded in Kolenik's uncle's attic with vintage keyboards and samplers, during the winter of 2008-2009 as Uncle Matt made surfboards underneath them.[i] Guitarist Juan Pieczanski and drummer Jeff Curtin, both from Washington D.C., met while attending Columbia University. The earliest collaborations of the entire group began years prior to the band‚Äôs formation during after-hours recording sessions in a post-production film studio located in the Brill Building. After the band‚Äôs initial release, they supported Washed Out on tour in 2010, also performing with him on stage during that tour. Musical style Their sound is commonly described as belonging to the chillwave genre though the band's members don't label themselves as such.[1] The band began with an emphasis on lo-fi sounds and distorted textures in their initial release, but has since adopted a more varied approach, expanding to include a mix of hi and lo-fi sounds, synthetic and acoustic instruments. The underlying elements of synth-heavy production and melodic, lyrical vocal style have been a fixture of the band‚Äôs sound throughout their entire catalogue. All the band‚Äôs releases to date have been self-produced. Other Contributions/Collaborations The band has provided remixes for Health, Washed Out, and Frankie Rose. In 2010 they released the Moon Killer mixtape, a loose collection of sample-based tracks featuring contributions from Heems & Star Slinger. Guitarist Ryan Heyner was formerly a member of the hardcore band Silent Majority. Jeff Curtin provided the drums for Wild Nothing‚Äôs second studio release, Nocturne (2012), and is credited as a sound engineer/producer for his work with Vampire Weekend and Those Darlins.

It is the successor of the Survey Department of Palestine, established by the British Mandate authorities in 1920.  History  The Survey Department of Palestine in 1930 The British Mandate established the country's first survey department in 1920, known as the Survey Department of Palestine. In 1930, a building was erected to house the department at the southern end of a 30-acre plot near the German Templar cemetery in Tel Aviv. During World War II, it was used by the British Army. Today, the main office of the Survey of Israel is located in Tel Aviv with branches in Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva, Haifa and Nazareth.  Survey of Israel responsibilities  the Survey of Israel building today Measurement point number 1974 made by the Survey of Israel, located in Ein Shemer old courtyard The Survey of Israel is the government agency for Mapping, Geodesy, Cadastre and Geoinformatics. The Survey is responsible for the national infrastructure in these areas as well as for a number of official functions. In the field of geodesy, the Survey operates as the National Geodetic Institute, adopting the reference ellipsoid, developing and maintaining the geodetic control network, defining the national datum, both horizontal and vertical and establishing an appropriate projection with accompanying mapping equations and transformations, for applications in mapping, cadastre and geoinformatics. In the realm of cadastre the Survey leads activities leading to land registration (Land Surveys Department). The registration of rights to land is based on Torrens principles, which in effect provides a state guarantee of the rights registered. The Survey is responsible for defining boundaries of blocks and parcels in terms of coordinates and plans. All these procedures are anchored by Survey Ordinances. 95% of the country's area has undergone the settlement process. All this area is subdivided into approximately 15,000 blocks and 800,000 parcels. The Survey deals every year with the continuation of settlement and also with new subdivision (re-parcellation) which express mutation in rights to land or its use, or both. The Survey of Israel is the National Mapping Agency, responsible for defining mapping products required, with a special attention to construction infrastructures, security and emergency services, environmental protection, tourism and research and development. These tasks require the establishment of standards, coordinate networks including specifications for map projections, accuracy standards, practice of toponymy and symbology. The standard map series at the present is the 1:50,000, from which the 1:100,000 series is derived. The present editions of these series were produced by analogical methods and revised by digital methods. In addition, a number of 1:25,000 maps have been produced, all based on the National GIS digital data files, managed by the Survey. It would be appropriate to say that all map series are in the stage of transition to a digital cartographic process. Additional products worth mentioning are town plans and the Atlas of Israel being produced with the cooperation of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The topic of geoinformatics has been entrusted to the Survey by government decisions of 1990 and 1993, meaning that the Survey is responsible for the National GIS databank, including a uniform set of codes to ensure compatibility and an interministerial forum which is a platform for discussion and formulation of policy. The National GIS includes a topographic data bank, derived from aerial photographs at the scale 1:40,000 and periodically revised. The data bank consists of 10 data layers with appropriate codes. There is also a cadastral data bank, based on cadastral maps and plans. It is used to supply information and to manage cadastral operations, but it has no legal standing equal to the original documents. In addition, there is a bank of addresses, in larger population centers, managed in cooperation with the National Census Bureau.

The Final Solution of the Czech Question () was the Nazi German plan for the complete Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. German sociologist and anthropologist Karl Valentin M√ºller asserted that a large part of the Czech nation was racially Aryan and could be Germanized. This was in stark contrast to Germany's Final Solution to the Jewish Question. However, M√ºller asserted that the Germanization should take place without coercion; instead, he suggested a system of social incentives.Kub≈Ø, Eduard: ‚ÄûDie Bedeutung des deutschen Blutes im Tschechentum‚Äú.

On 27 September 1941 Reinhard Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the part of Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reich on 15 March 1939) and assumed control. The Reich Protector, Konstantin von Neurath, remained titular head but was sent on \\"leave\\" because Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich felt his \\"soft approach\\" to the Czechs had promoted anti-German sentiment and encouraged resistance via strikes and sabotage. On his appointment, Heydrich told his aides: \\"We will Germanize the Czech vermin.\\" Heydrich came to Prague to enforce policy, fight resistance to the Nazi regime, and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were \\"extremely important to the German war effort\\". He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistance's \\"stabs in the back\\". In the furtherance of his goals, Heydrich decreed racial classification of those who could and could not be Germanized. He explained: \\"Making this Czech garbage into Germans must yield to methods based on racist thought.\\" Racial surveys, conducted under the pretext of tuberculosis prevention, found the Czechs to be more Nordic than the Sudeten Germans, East Prussians, and many Austrians and Bavarians. These results were kept secret.Mastn√Ω, The Czechs under Nazi Rule, p. 131. In 1940 Hitler agreed that around half of the Czech population were suitable for Germanization, while the \\"mongoloid types\\" and the Czech intelligentsia were not to be Germanized and were to be ‚Äúdeprived of [their] power, eliminated, and shipped out of the country by all sorts of methods.‚Äù Under Generalplan Ost, the Nazis had intended to displace the un-Germanizable population to Siberia.

Early life Jack Buckland was born in 1864 in Sydney, the eldest child of William Wilberforce Buckland and Harriet Emmeline Hopkins. His mother was born in Sydney in 1842, the daughter of John Hopkins, a ship chandler who died when she was young. Her father's business partner, John Carr, and his wife Eliza later adopted Harriet in addition to the ship chandler business. Buckland's father was from Wraysbury in England, the son of an auctioneer, William Thomas Buckland. Buckland's father worked as a merchant and shipbroker in Australia and in 1863 married the 21-year-old Harriet Hopkins in Sydney. Buckland was their first child, born in 1864. When he was 9, Buckland's family returned to England, leaving him with the now elderly John and Eliza Carr who adopted him as their son. John Carr was therefore Buckland's stepfather as well as step- grandfather. The Carr family lived in a house called \\"Neepsend\\" in Lavender Bay, North Sydney. Part of this property was later sold and it was from this sale that John Carr made sufficient money to provide Jack with his allowance. John Carr died in 1881 and the money from the property sale was left in a trust from which Jack received an annual allowance. In 1883, now living on his own, Jack visited his parents and siblings living near London in England. Later he returned to Sydney and subsequently worked for Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, as a copra trader.The Circular Saw Shipping Line , Anthony G. Flude. 1993. (Chapter 7) Life of an island trader Nonouti Atoll From the mid-1880s to about 1891, Buckland was a trader at Nonouti atoll, in Kiribati (at the time known as the Gilbert Islands)Journal entry 11 April 1890, The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press) and during the 1890s he traded at Niutao and Nanumea in Tuvalu (at the time known as the Ellice Islands). The resident trader who succeeded him on Niutao was Fred Whibley. Buckland's primary income was ¬£700 a year, paid to him by the trustee of the trust fund established by John Carr. That amount was sufficient to allowed him to live comfortably for part of the year in Sydney. To supplement this income, Buckland worked as a trader in the central Pacific. This was an isolated existence where he was likely to be the only European on a Pacific atoll. As a trader working for a trading company, he bought copra (dried coconut flesh), and sharks fin and sea cucumbers, for sale into Asia, as well as selling islanders tobacco and other European goods. As a trader, Buckland chose an isolated life on a Pacific atoll rather that being a castaway or beachcomber. Howe (1984) estimated that in 1850 there were over 2,000 beachcombers throughout Polynesia and Micronesia.K.R.Howe, Where the Waves Fall: A New South Sea Islands History from First Settlement to Colonial Ruler (1984), 103. It was not only shipwrecked sailors forced, by circumstances, into a life of beachcombing with many choosing to escape from a life of respectability in the Victorian era.Milcairns, Susanne Williams (2006) Native Strangers: Beachcombers, Renegades and Castaways in the South Seas, Auckland: Penguin Books (New Zealand).David A. Chappell Secret Sharers: Indigenous Beachcombers in the Pacific Islands (1994) 17 (2) Pacific Studies Cruise of the Janet Nicoll As a respite from the isolated life on a Pacific atoll Jack Buckland would spend time enjoying the high life of Sydney where, in few months, he would dissipate his income. Furnas (1951) describes Jack Buckland as spending \\"a short period each year in Sydney playing spendthrift on the accumulations of a small funded income and the rest of the year vegetating penniless as a petty trader out in the islands.\\"Furnas J.C. Voyage to Windward: The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson, Apollo ed.

However, on leaving harbour the ‚Äòcalcium fire‚Äô, which was promised by the chemist to be \\"safe as a packet of sugar\\", spontaneously caught alight causing the fireworks to explode in technicolour flashes endangering the ship ‚Äì until the crew put out the fire.Journal entry 20 April 1890, The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (UWP /UNSW) Tin Jack and the character of Tom Hadden Jack Buckland is acknowledged by Robert Louis Stevenson, as the inspiration for the character of Tom Hadden in The Wrecker (1892), for which Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne shared the writing.Hadden is described as being based upon Jack Buckland (‚ÄòTin Jack‚Äô) a well-known remittance man and copra trader in Sydney. Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2001) p. 418, n. 3 Jack Buckland also receives a dedication in Island Nights' Entertainments (also known as South Sea Tales) a collection of short stories by Robert Louis Stevenson, first published in 1893. This collection is dedicated to Jack Buckland, Ben Hird, (supercargo or manager of the cargo owner's trade) and Harry Henderson partner in the firm Henderson and Macfarlane that owned the Janet Nicoll. A character referred to as ‚Äòyoung Buncombe‚Äô and inspired by Jack Buckland makes a brief appearance in chapter 2 of The Beach of Fales√°.The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson. Volume Seven, September 1890 ‚Äì December 1892, Bradford A. Booth and Ernest Mehew (Editors). Yale University Press. Jack Buckland stayed at Vailima with Robert and Fanny Stevenson in 1894. In later correspondence to Lieutenant Eeles, an officer on H.M.S. Curacao, Stevenson expresses his pleasure that his correspondent had met Jack Buckland:Letter Stevenson to Eeles of 15 November 1892, Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2001) > \\"But the cream of the fun was your meeting with Burn. We not only know him, > but (as the French say) we don't know anybody else; he is our intimate and > adored original; and ‚Äì prepare your mind ‚Äì he was, is, and ever will be, > TOMMY HADDON! As I don't believe you to be inspired, I suspect you to have > suspected this. At least it was a mighty happy suspicion. You are quite > right: Tommy is really 'a good chap,' though about as comic as they make > them.\\" While The Wrecker was not a commercial or critical success, in adopting Jack Buckland as a character, Stevenson describes a specific era of European engagement with the Pacific. Watson (2007) describes Stevenson's The Wrecker as \\"a prophetically postmodern vision of a depthless world of travel, exile, novelty and rootlessness, of 'discarded sons' whose corruption, in a world they neither understand nor fully belong to, is curiously innocent.\\" Tin Jack and Vailima, Samoa The letters of Robert Louis Stevenson of January 1894 also record that Jack Buckland, and his \\"avaga\\" ('married one' in the Niutaon language) Meri Matavaka of the Luaseuta family of Niutao,identified in S. Aris, Fred Whibley and his Family (1966) visited Vailima, Samoa for three weeks. Jack Buckland was still at Vailima on 6 February 1894.Memories of Vailima by Isobel Strong & Lloyd Osbourne, Archibald Constable & Co: Westminster (1903) During his time at Vailima Jack Buckland is mentioned as flirting with Addie (Adelaide),Selected Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, ed. by Ernest Mehew (New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2001) the daughter of Henry Ide, American Chief Justice in Samoa. Jack Buckland then became the island trader on Nanumea in Tuvalu in about 1895. Meri Matavaka refused to move to Nanumea, the oral history of the Luaseuta family is that Jack Buckland abandoned Meri Matavaka in Sydney, Australia; her father travelled from Niutao to bring Meri back to Niutao. Meri Matavaka became the \\"avaga\\" ('married one') of Fred Whibley.S. Aris, Fred Whibley and his Family (1966) Death of Tin Jack Anchorage Island, Suwarrow Robert Louis Stevenson draws directly from the life of Jack Buckland in describing Tom Hadden in The Wrecker as being \\"heir to a considerable property, which a prophetic father had placed in the hands of rigorous trustees.\\" (p. 296). Tin Jack's dissolute life came to an end in 1897. A sanitised version of the death of Jack Buckland published by Simpson (1913) describes him as being blown to pieces by an explosion on Suwarrow Island.Eve. Blantyre Simpson, The Robert Louis Stevenson Originals (1913) 195 Fanny Stevenson in her journal of the voyage of the \\"Janet Nicoll\\" published in 1914 described the trustee that provided Jack with the majority of his income as defrauding the trust of all the funds:post-script added to Journal entry 8 July 1890, The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (UWP /UNSW) > \\"Some years ago when Jack was at his station he received word that his > trustee, who was in charge of his property, had levanted it all.

Eddy relocated the band from Cleveland to St. Peters, Missouri in late 2004. As a result of the move, the band experienced changes in their lineup. Bassist Rek Mohr and guitarist Brandon Lozano moved to St. Peters with Eddy. Drummer Chad Szeliga and bassist Dan Griffith left the band and remained in Ohio. Szeliga eventually went on to join Breaking Benjamin on drums in 2005. Lozano decided to leave Leo and return to Ohio just a couple days after relocating with Leo to the St. Louis area.

Bell was a controversial leader of the Colorado National Guard during the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903-04. While Bell received high praise from Theodore Roosevelt and some others, he was vilified as a tyrant by the leadership and the miners of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM).Weston Arthur Goodspeed, The Province and the States: Biography, The Weston historical association, 1904, pages 393-396 Sherman Bell, a former deputy United States marshal in Cripple Creek, Colorado, participated in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as one of Roosevelt's Rough Riders. General Bell was active in the Masonic order and the order of Elks, and was honored by the Knights of Pythias. A former hardrock mine manager, Bell took the side of the Mine Owners Association against the strikers during a strike of smelter workers, which ultimately included the miners of the Cripple Creek District.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, University of Illinois Press, 2000, page 28 Persona Much of the history written about Sherman Bell has to do with his characteristics, his attitude, and his affectations. William MacLeod Raine spent some time interviewing Bell in 1904, and concluded that Bell, filled with \\"cocksureness\\", > ...sums up [any situation], largely regardless of the evidence, and comes to > an immediate decision. He is one of the most unfettered of men. It is a safe > guess that deep down in his heart he does not care one jackstraw for > abstract law.

Furthermore, he does not value criticism in the least. Raine said that Bell was \\"entirely devoid of humor\\", and \\"I have never seen him smile except when he was telling how he had hammered the Western Federation.\\" In 1998 J. Anthony Lukas wrote, > If his campaigns against the federation sometimes took the guise of a holy > war, Sherman Bell readily attributed its direction to the sacred trinity of > \\"Me, God, and Governor Peabody.\\" Whatever his military skills‚Äîand they were > often called into question‚ÄîBell had a knack for vivid expression.J.

In the cartoon, General Bell repeatedly refers to Governor Peabody as \\"His Excellency the Governor of Colorado\\" and the \\"Commander in Chief\\".General Bell was direct about his purpose: \\"I came to do up this damned anarchistic federation.\\" Bell justified the ensuing reign of terror as a \\"military necessity, which recognizes no laws, either civil or social.\\"Jameson, All That Glitters, pg. 207, from Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 50. Benjamin Rastall said of Bell, > He returned to Colorado [from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War] to be hailed as a > popular hero for a time, but soon lost the admiration of the public through > his overbearing ways and self-conceit... his idea seemed to have been to > make the most gorgeous military display possible, and to give himself the > largest notoriety as a military leader.Benjamin McKie Rastall, The Labor > History of the Cripple Creek District, 1905, page 157. According to Lukas, Sherman Bell's uniform was custom made, with gold lace, cords, and tassels at an estimated cost of a thousand dollars. But on occasion he was also known to wear \\"an old battered campaign hat, a black shirt, and a rag of a tie.\\" At least one writer was impressed with Sherman Bell. Weston Arthur Goodspeed wrote in 1904, > [During the Colorado Labor Wars] one figure towered above the discord, > strode boldly into the strife, met anarchy more than half way and compelled > it to meet him, fight and be quelled, or chased away in arrant fear. It was > Brig. Gen. Sherman M. Bell, adjutant general of the Colorado National Guard, > who, with patience that was marvelous in a man of his high mettle, with > judgment rare in one just past thirty and with courage which no soldier of > any age has excelled, stamped out the nest of vipers that had fastened > deadly fangs on the richest mining community in the world, drove the > assassins from the State, preserved the lives and property of honest > citizens and restored law and order to a section of the State which, for > years, had writhed beneath the oppression of groundless malice and envious > ignorance... Goodspeed declared Bell world-famous, \\"the most successful opposer of strikes that this or any other country has ever produced.\\" Bell was also \\"ruggedly strong\\" with a \\"trim and soldierly figure\\" and a \\"well shaped head\\" featuring an \\"almost boyish ... expression, and yet, commanding in every feature, from the square, firm chin, the straight line of the lips and the strong, Grecian nose\\". Bell is \\"humane, as well as brave; kindly and at the same time chivalrous. Should one of his men be ill, no matter what his station in the Guard, it is General Bell who is the first to administer aid...\\" According to Goodspeed, the Colorado militia had been \\"a mere handful, of three hundred or more willing but untrained troopers\\" whom Bell turned into \\"one of the best organized, the best drilled and the most loyal and able bodies of military men to be found outside the regular army.\\" Goodspeed attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt the statement, \\"I never saw such resolution as Sherman Bell displayed. If I had a regiment and could have only one man in it, that man would be Sherman Bell.\\" Describing Sherman Bell's exploits with the Rough Riders in Cuba, Goodspeed stated that Bell \\"shared valiantly in the distinguished services of that great command.\\" According to someone who was actually there, Bell was suffering from a hernia, and \\"limped through the jungles and across the hills most of the time, but always seemed to stay up with the troops despite the pain.\\"Billy McGinty, Oklahoma Rough Rider: Billy McGinty's own story, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, page 48 While Bell performed \\"splendid service\\" according to future president Theodore Roosevelt, most of fellow soldier Billy McGinty's published recollection describes a difficult trip to transport an ailing Sherman Bell to the rear aboard a small two-wheeled cart pulled by a mule. When McGinty saw Bell again, Bell was with a lady whom he told \\"a line of bull\\" about the Cuban experience, apparently exaggerating McGinty's role in saving his life.Billy McGinty, Oklahoma Rough Rider: Billy McGinty's own story, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, page 50 Raine observed that Bell's \\"reckless irresponsibility is a continual thorn in the side of his superiors.\\" When Theodore Roosevelt was campaigning for Vice- President in 1900, \\"Bell enrolled himself promptly as his bodyguard.\\" After Roosevelt spoke in the Victor town hall, some boisterous miners seemed to Bell to show insufficient respect. Bell was described as having \\"blood in his eye\\", and \\"a very lively time ensued.\\"Munsey's magazine, The Frank A. Munsey Company, 1904, page 687 The miners followed the party to Roosevelt's special train, and some of them were flinging stones. Roosevelt stepped from inside the rail car to the rear platform where Bell was confronting the miners, and Bell pushed him back inside. Roosevelt was irritated with the confrontation between Bell and the miners and sharply ordered, \\"As your superior officer, Lieutenant Bell, I order you inside.\\" While Bell saluted and complied, he immediately began organizing the party inside the train, telling them to \\"shoot if any of the mob [throw] stones...\\" When someone objected that shedding blood would damage Roosevelt's campaign, Bell curtly replied, \\"I'm not running the campaign. I'm maintaining order just now in Victor.\\" Roosevelt later told newspaper correspondents that his \\"principle fear in that distressing hour was that Sherman Bell would begin killing people.\\" Deputy days As deputy sheriff (other accounts say deputy marshal) in El Paso County, Sherman Bell once used a thirty-eight Smith & Wesson pistol to shoot out the lights in a dance hall in Independence, Colorado, so that three bullion thieves could be arrested.Caspar Whitney, editor, Outing, the Illustrated Magazine of Sport Travel Adventure and Country Life, Volume 41, 1903, page 599 Colorado Labor Wars In 1903, the WFM called a strike of smeltermen in the Colorado Springs, Colorado area, which was extended to Cripple Creek. Colorado National Guard leaders imported a thousand Krag- Jorgensen rifles and sixty thousand rounds of ammunition were sent to the district.Jameson, All That Glitters, pg. 210. As Brigadier General of the Guard, Sherman Bell, a former manager of the Smith-Moffat mining interests in the Cripple Creek District, had a conflict of interest: in addition to his state salary, he received $3,200 annual incentive pay from the mine owners.Peter Carlson, Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood. 1983; pg. 62. George Suggs observed, > Using force and intimidation to shut off debate about the advisability of > the state's intervention, Brigadier General John Chase, Bell's field > commander, systematically imprisoned without formal charges union officials > and others who openly questioned the need for troops. Included among those > jailed were a justice of the peace, the Chairman of the Board of County > Commissioners, and a member of the WFM who had criticized the guard and > advised the strikers not to return to the mines.George G.

On September 10 the National Guard began \\"a series of almost daily arrests\\" of union officers and men known to be strongly in sympathy with the unions.Benjamin McKie Rastall, The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, 1905, page 80\\" When District Judge W. P. Seeds of Teller County held a hearing on writs of habeas corpus for four union men held in the stockade, Sherman Bell's response was caustic. \\"Habeas corpus be damned,\\" he declared, \\"we'll give 'em post mortems.\\"Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, page 62 Approximately ninety cavalrymen entered Cripple Creek and surrounded the courthouse. The prisoners were escorted into the courtroom by a company of infantry equipped with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets,Benjamin McKie Rastall, The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, 1905, page 101. and the soldiers remained standing in a line during the court sessions. Other soldiers took up sniper positions and set up a gatling gun in front of the courthouse. Angered by the intimidating display, an attorney for the prisoners refused to proceed and left the court.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 97. Undaunted after several days of such displays, the judge ruled for the prisoners. Judge Seeds commented in his closing remarks, > I trust that there will never again be such an unseemly and unnecessary > intrusion of armed soldiers in the halls and about the entrances of American > Courts of Justice. They are intrusions that can only tend to bring this > court into contempt, and make doubtful the boasts of that liberty that is > the keynote of American Government.Friedman, Morris, The Pinkerton Labor > Spy, Wilshire Book Co., New York, 1907, page 77. Colorado National Guard General John Chase. The caption reads: ADJUTANT- GENERAL JOHN CHASE The Denver oculist in command of the National Guard. General Chase was a brigadier-general in the Cripple Creek strike, and no love is lost between him and the labor men.Yet General Chase, acting in conjunction with General Bell, refused to release the men until Governor Peabody ordered him to do so. Even those Colorado newspapers which had supported the intervention expressed concern that court orders were not being obeyed by the National Guard.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 98.

The Colorado Constitution of the period \\"declares that the military shall always be in strict subordination to the civil power.\\"Benjamin McKie Rastall, The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, 1905, page 101 The district court ruled that Bell and Chase should be arrested for violating the law. Bell responded by declaring that no civil officer would be allowed to serve civil processes to any National Guard officer on duty. Within a week after the arrival of troops, the Findlay, Strong, Elkton, Tornado, Thompson, Ajax, Shurtloff, and Golden Cycle mines began operations again, and replacement workers they had recruited were \\"practically forced\\" to go to work. The mine owners recruited from surrounding states, telling the potential miners that there was no strike. Emil Peterson, a worker recruited from Duluth, decided to run when he realized the purpose of the military escort. Lieutenant Hartung fired a pistol at him as he ran away. A warrant issued for the lieutenant's arrest was ignored by the military officers.Benjamin McKie Rastall, The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, 1905, page 102. The Cripple Creek Mine Owners Association (CCMOA) began to pressure companies to fire union miners who were still working in mines that had not been struck. Companies that refused to do so, or who in some other way refused to join the employers' alliance movement, were blacklisted.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners. 1972; pp. 107, 115. When the Woods Investment Company ordered their employees to quit the WFM, the employees joined the strike instead. The superintendent and the shift bosses accompanied all of the workers out the door.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters: Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1998; pg. 209. On November 21, two management employees at the Vindicator mine were killed by an explosion at the 600 foot level. The coroner's jury could not determine what had caused the explosion.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters, pp. 211-212. Although the mine was heavily guarded by soldiers and no unauthorized personnel were permitted to approach, the CCMOA blamed the explosion on the WFM. Fifteen strike leaders were arrested but were never prosecuted because evidence of their involvement never materialized. 1904 caricature of Colorado General Sherman Bell produced by B.S. White of American Cartoonist MagazineThe union blamed the employers for the Vindicator mine explosion, claiming it was just another devious plot that went wrong. That incident and the apparent efforts to wreck a train raised tensions and provoked rumors throughout the Cripple Creek District. It was said that a shadowy vigilante organization called the Committee of 40, which was composed of \\"known 'killers' and the 'best' citizens,\\" was formed to uphold law and order. The miners were said to have formed a \\"Committee of Safety\\" in response, for they feared that the Committee of 40 planned acts of violence that could be blamed on the WFM, thus creating a pretext for the union's destruction.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 102-103. The National Guard stepped up its harassment, and began arresting children who chided the soldiers.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 103, citing the Victor Daily Record, November 24, 1903. On December 4, 1903, the governor proclaimed that Teller County was in a \\"state of insurrection and rebellion\\"George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 103. and he declared martial law.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters‚ÄîClass, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 212. Jameson states that Peabody later called it \\"qualified martial law.\\" Suggs suggests that Bell (mis-)interpreted the declaration as martial law. Sherman Bell immediately announced that \\"the military will have sole charge of everything...\\" The governor seemed embarrassed at Bell's public interpretation of the decree and tried to soften the public perception.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters ‚Äî Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 212. Bell was undeterred; within weeks, the National Guard suspended the Bill of Rights. Union leaders were arrested and either thrown in the bullpen, or banished.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 105-106. Prisoners who won habeas corpus cases were released in court and then immediately re-arrested. The Victor Daily Record was placed under military censorship, and all WFM-friendly information was prohibited. Freedom of assembly was not allowed. The right to bear arms was suspended‚Äîcitizens were required to give up their firearms and their ammunition. An attorney who dared the Guard to come and get his guns found himself confronting soldiers and was shot in the arm.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters‚ÄîClass, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 213. On January 7, 1904, the Guard criminalized \\"loitering or strolling about, frequenting public places where liquor is sold, begging or leading an idle, immoral, or profligate course of life, or not having any visible means of support.\\"Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters ‚Äî Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 214. Francis J. Ellison, a commissioned officer of the Colorado National Guard, was assigned by General Sherman Bell to the Cripple Creek District for \\"special military duty\\". Although Ellison acquired \\"certain evidence in regard to the perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion,\\" which \\"would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine,\\" Sherman Bell failed to follow up on that evidence.Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487 On January 26, 1904, a cage full of non-union miners broke from the hoist at the Independence mine, and fifteen men fell to their deaths. The coroner's jury found that management was negligent, having failed to install safety equipment properly,Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, pages 101-102. and the hoisting engineer responsible for the men's lives, who was hired as a replacement worker, was inexperienced. > [T]he employer had taken the man's word ‚Äì nothing more ‚Äì as to his > qualifications. The engineer involved in the fatal accident, however, had > been recommended by a former employer. The WFM echoed the accusation about negligence, while management claimed the WFM had tampered with the lift, in spite of the union having no access to the militarized property. Reportedly 168 men quit the mine. About the middle of February, 1904, leadership of the Colorado National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were failing to finance the occupation by covering the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to \\"hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine\\" in order to convince the mine owners to pay. Major Ellison believed that the miners took a route out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots from their revolvers into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him General Sherman Bell and Governor Peabody knew about the plan. Major Ellison, who had been under the leadership of Adjutant General Sherman Bell, testified in October 1904 about one of Bell's policies, > At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller > County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. > McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential > adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights > were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on > duty there.

Major McClelland's > instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their > throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except > kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of > March. Thomas McClellend, one of Bell's two junior officers in charge of the beatings of striking miners, had previously been quoted, \\"To hell with the constitution, we aren't going by the constitution.\\"Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, University of Illinois Press, page 28. On March 12, troops occupied the WFM's Union Hall in Victor. Merchants were arrested for displaying union posters.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters ‚Äî Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 215. Then the CCMOA began pressuring employers inside and outside the district to fire union miners, issuing and requiring a \\"non-union card\\" to work in the area, while the WFM took counter-measures to limit the impact. In spite of all the repression, only 300 of the original 3,500 strikers had returned to work as scabs. The rest of the miners had not repudiated their leadership, as the CCMOA had expected. There was evidence that the non-union mine operators were paying a heavy price for their actions, and the union believed that it was winning the strike.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters ‚Äî Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 216-218. On March 28, 1904, WFM President Moyer was arrested, > ...on the rather flimsy excuse of having desecrated the American flag. The > real reason for his detention was the fact that his speeches and his > presence were believed to have an inflammatory effect on the heated > strikers. The courts ordered the release of Moyer, but though it fairly > rained writs of habeas corpus, General Bell shed them as a duck does water. The Colorado Supreme Court intervened, and Bell stated that if the court didn't see things his way, then he would simply ignore their ruling. A writ subsequently filed with the United States Supreme Court on Moyer's behalf alleged, in part, that \\"said Sherman Bell and the said Buckley Wells loudly and boastfully, through the public press and otherwise, threatened the destruction and death of anyone who should interfere or attempt to interfere with them by the service of said writ\\", that \\"said Sherman Bell and the said Buckley Wells did call to their aid and assistance the members of the National Guard\\", and that the \\"Sheriff is powerless to execute the order of the court ... by calling to his aid a posse for the reason that the force under the control of the said Bell and the said Wells and the said Governor of the State of Colorado is vastly greater than any force which the said Sheriff could command.\\"Records and briefs of the United States Supreme Court, United States Supreme Court, 1907, pages 10-74 On June 6, 1904, there was a horrific explosion at the Independence Depot. Thirteen non-union men were killed ‚Äî some of them mutilated ‚Äî and six more were injured. Sheriff Robertson rushed to the scene, roped off the area, and began an investigation. The district split into opposing camps based upon whether the WFM was presumed innocent or guilty. Immediately after the explosion, the CCMOA and the Citizens' Alliance met at Victor's Military Club in the Armory and plotted the removal of all civil authorities that they did not control. Their first target was Sheriff Robertson. When he declined to resign immediately, they fired several shots, produced a rope, and gave him the choice of resignation or immediate lynching.The Western History and Genealogy section of the Denver Public Library has an online photograph, copyright ¬© 1995-2007 by the Denver Public Library, Colorado Historical Society, and the Denver Art Museum, provided with the caption, \\"Colorado National Guard soldiers lynch labor sympathizer ‚Äì Colorado National Guard soldiers prepare to lynch a man during a labor strike in Cripple Creek, Colorado.

The mine owners replaced him with a man who was a member of the CCMOA and of the Citizens' Alliance. In the next few days the CCMOA and the Citizens' Alliance forced more than thirty local officials to resign, and replaced them with enemies of the WFM. Then ignoring the objections of the county commissioners, the employers called a town meeting directly across the street from the WFM Union Hall in Victor. The city marshal of Victor deputized about a hundred deputies to stop the meeting, but Victor Mayor French, an ally of the mine owners, fired the marshal. An angry crowd of several thousand gathered, and anti-union speeches were made by members of the CCMOA. Rastall records, > C.C.

Fifty union miners left the scene to cross the street to the union hall.The Labor History of the Cripple Creek District, Benjamin McKie Rastall, 1905, page 123. Rastall states, \\"the square was promptly cleared, many of the union men retiring to their hall.\\" And, Emma F. Langdon, Labors' Greatest Conflicts, May 1908, page 10, 21-22. Langdon states, \\"The miners retired to their own hall and the non-union men raided the building.\\" Accounts written much later describe the union miners as fleeing to their hall. Cartoon of General Sherman Bell. Caption reads, \\"I DREAMED I WAS A MONARCH!\\" \\"--AND THEN HIS PIPE WENT OUT!\\"Company L of the National Guard, a detachment from Victor that was commanded by a mine manager, surrounded the WFM building, took up sniper positions on nearby rooftops, and began to fire volley after volley into the union hall. Four miners were hit, and the men inside were forced to surrender. The Citizens' Alliance and their allies then wrecked the hall, wrecked all other WFM halls in the district, and looted four WFM cooperative stores. The Victor Daily Record workforce was again arrested. The day of the explosion, all mine owners, managers, and superintendents were deputized. Groups of soldiers, sheriff's deputies, and citizens roamed the district, looking for union members. Approximately 175 people ‚Äî union men, sympathizers, city officials ‚Äî were locked into outdoor bullpens in Victor, Independence, and Goldfield. Food requirements were ignored until the Women's Auxiliary was eventually allowed to feed the men.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters ‚Äî Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, 1998, page 218-219. Company L was also referred to as the Victor militia. On June 7, the day after the explosion, the Citizens' Alliance set up kangaroo courts and deported 38 union members. General Sherman Bell arrived with instructions to legalize the process of deportation. He \\"tried\\" 1,569 union prisoners. More than 230 were judged guilty ‚Äî meaning they refused to renounce the unionGeorge G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H.

For all practical purposes, in a matter of days the Western Federation of Miners had been destroyed in Colorado's mining camps.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972, page 76 In an interview, Sherman Bell was asked the reason for the deportations. He replied that \\"It is a military necessity. They are men against whom crimes cannot be specified, but their presence is regarded as dangerous to law and order.\\"Wilbur Fiske Stone, editor, History of Colorado , Volume 1, S. J. Clarke, 1918, page 865 =United Mine Workers strike= The United Mine Workers of America, attempting to organize the Colorado northern and southern fields, called a strike in 1903. Adjutant General Sherman Bell was given jurisdiction over this strike as well. The Colorado National Guard took the side of the mine owners against the miners.

Bell responded, \\"To Hell with the party. I'm not breaking up this lawlessness in the interests of any party.\\" However, this behind the scenes disagreement would boil over into a public flap. There had been several misunderstandings with Governor Peabody during the occupation of Colorado's mining districts, and once again Bell went to the media declaring, > I shall resign the office of adjutant general probably Monday, and by the > 1st of July there will be another man in my place.

Venezuela, Mexico, or New Mexico? In a bitterly disputed 1904 election, Governor Peabody was persuaded by his own party to withdraw, and Sherman Bell was destined to lose his military commission.

He is a member of the organization ¬´Defend Science¬ª (US). Life and career Alex Battler was born in Astrakhan. In 1966 he entered the Faculty of Oriental studies of the A. Zhdanov Leningrad State University. After graduating in 1971, he enrolled in the post-graduate school at the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies in Moscow. In 1975 he was conferred the Degree of Candidate of Science (= PhD), and in 1988 his Doctor of Science dissertation in the specialty \\"history of foreign policy and international relations\\". In 1993 he immigrated to Canada where he acquired Canadian citizenship. In 1997 he returned to Russia and worked at several institutions of higher learning in Moscow. In 2001 he moved to the United Kingdom; later he lived for several years in France. Currently he has permanent residence in New York. Through the years he held various positions at different research institutions: the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies; the Institute of World Economy and International Relations; the Institute of Social Sciences of the CPSU Central Committee; Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Institute of Philosophy. He served as Director of the Institute of Economic and International Studies of the Pacific Region (Vladivostok). He also taught as a professor of political science, economics, and international relations at several universities and institutes in Russia (Moscow State University; the Institute of Philosophy; the International Independent University of Ecology & Political Science); in Japan (Nagoya University); in Canada (the University of British Columbia). Work The result of Battler's scientific work is a number of laws and regularities in the areas of philosophy, sociology and the theory of international relations; he discovered these laws based on re-interpreting key terms and turning into concepts and categories. The single most important among them is the category of force which in the book Dialectics of Force turned into ont√≥bia (ontological force) ‚Äì one of the attributes of being, along with the categories of matter, motion, time and space. This attribute status of ont√≥bia enabled Battler to advance his own version of the Big Bang conception and of the Universe's expansion process. In the organic world ont√≥bia turns into org√°bia (the organic force). From the perspective of Battler's theory, life begins with man. The ont√≥bia theory also makes its possible to resolve the problems of consciousness and thought, of their qualitative differences and manifestations. In another book titled Society: Progress and Force (Criteria and First Principles) Battler formulated new definitions of the concept Progress and the forms of social forces' manifestation through the laws of force (principles): The First Principle of social development, or the law of social force; and the Second Principle of social development, or the law of social knowledge. In the book On Love, Family, and the State he presented the laws of love and family, which are tied to the functioning of the law of entropy growth. Within the framework of the international relations theory Battler formulated (in his monograph The 21st Century: the World without Russia) two laws: the law of geoeconomics (poles) and the law of geostrategy (center of power). He also introduced a new concept: the foreign policy potential of a state ‚Äì and methods for calculating it, as well as the optimal proportions of expenditures on foreign policy in accordance with the state's foreign policy goals. Battler also authored the 13 commandments of the roslyane, which he promotes as a replacement for the well-known Biblical commandments.

Jan Wouwerman (1629 in Haarlem - 1666 in Haarlem), was a Dutch Golden Age painter. According to Houbraken he was the youngest brother of the painters Philips and Pieter Wouwerman, who lived and worked in Haarlem. Jan Wouwerman Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His work was relatively unknown when Houbraken was writing, and he assumed this was because he died young, two years before his oldest brother in 1666. Houbraken saw one of his landscapes at the home of Laurens van der Vinne, which was a mountainous landscape with a brown foreground, with rough and unclipped trees, while on the horizon a clear view of a valley could be seen. Especially the foreground was cleverly done, a bit loose and with original colors, the way one would have expected of his brother Philips in his younger years when he painted with more monotones than in his later years. According to the RKD he was the youngest brother of Philips Wouwerman who was known for his landscapes in the manner of Jan Wijnants.Jan Wouwerman in the RKD He was buried in the St. Bavochurch of Haarlem. The RKD does not list him as a member, but his name is on the list of 173 members of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke that Vincent van der Vinne produced in 1702.The list has been published in the book De archiefbescheiden van het St. Lukasgilde te Haarlem 1497-1798, by Hessel Miedema, 1980, References *Jan Wouwerman on Artnet 1629 births 1666 deaths Dutch Golden Age painters Dutch male painters Dutch landscape painters Artists from Haarlem Members of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Jan Wouwerman"},{"id":"31521600","text":"Genealogy of the Virgin, Cathedral of Asti.

He was born at Asti and apprenticed under his father, Giovanni da Roreto, but no works are known from that period. His first documented work is and Assumption with Saints now at the Galleria Sabauda, Turin (1493). His style was influenced by that of Ligurian and Proven√ßal artists, such as Ludovico Brea.

Florida Scientist 64:2 107. The plant only occurs in Highlands and Polk Counties in Florida. It is one of the many endemics that are native to the Lake Wales Ridge. There are 66 occurrences known, but only 31 are on protected land.USFWS. Hypericum cumulicola Five-year Review. September 2008. Even land that is protected may be improperly managed, however. This plant occurs in the Florida scrub, an endangered habitat type. The substrate is white sand. The plant may grow alongside other rare scrub vegetation, such as the wedge-leaved button snakeroot (Eryngium cuneifolium). The plant is a gap specialist, growing in gaps in the tree and shrub layer where sunlight can reach it. These gaps in the woody vegetation of the scrub are maintained by periodic wildfires; one of the main threats to its existence is fire suppression. In the absence of a normal fire regime, the taller and woody vegetation grows up and shades out the plants of the understory. The plant is fire-dependent.Quintana-Ascensio, P. F., et al. (2003). A fire-explicit population viability analysis of Hypericum cumulicola in Florida rosemary scrub. Conservation Biology 17:2 433. It resprouts after fire, becoming more abundant in seasons after fire moves through an area. Habitat is also lost outright when it is claimed for development. The land is used for residential and agricultural uses, including ranches and citrus groves. Land management practices that could benefit the plant include less suppression of fire, avoiding fire during drought times, formation of gaps in the scrub through other means, and avoiding disturbance of the soil crust, which may have a protective effect on the seedlings.

N.. It was completed in 2011. It tells the personal story of the director as his ancestral house is dismantled in a remote village called Miyar in Karkala Taluk in Udupi district in Karnataka, South India. The film was produced by the director's own firm, Sonk Films, and it features many members of the filmmaker's extended family. The film has a particular dialect of Kannada that is spoken by a few in that part of Karnataka. Plot The filmmaker's 200-year-old ancestral house is dismantled, giving him an opportunity to undertake a journey into the past. He shares history not only with his extended family, but also with successive generations of India‚Äôs rural population. Armed with a cranky digital camera, he and his friend Ajay Raina set out to document the dismantling process. They meet the four owners of the house ‚Äì the uncles and aunt of the filmmaker - and gather from them what it means to undergo the process of change and migration. A sense of nostalgia and loss, as well as the excitement and the insecurity of the future, accompany this process, the essence of which is transition. A realization of the inevitability of this transition marks this journey. It could well have been the journey of a country that has propelled itself into modernity. As plans are on for the house to get reconstructed elsewhere in an open-air museum, out of its original context ‚Äì for the filmmaker, the fossilization seems to be complete. The film ends with a tile saying that the filmmaker's father died in Mumbai in 2010. Production Filming took place over a period of three days in 2001. After having reached a saturation from doing excessive content for television in the city of Mumbai, the filmmaker and his film school friend Ajay Raina set off 1000 kilometers south to his parents' house in Udupi and then to Miyar. A still from the film Editing For eight years the eight hour long rushes lay unused with the filmmaker. Ramchandra PN gathered himself to assemble the film in 2009 when he had an opportunity to do a teaching stint in Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, the school in which he himself had learned the art of making films. Characters The filmmaker himself is the main character in the film. The film follows him as he makes his journey and as he convinces his father, uncle and aunt to make one last visit to Miyar, as the house gets dismantled. The filmmaker's extended family members are also prominent characters in the film as they remember the days and times when they used to visit Miyar. Antique collector Vijayanath Shenoy's Heritage Village in Manipal, where the Miyar House was to be finally built, also features in the last part of the film.

Rapid changes have occurred in the village since the 1970s, such as the development of local communications by the central government, the opening up to tourism, the breaking of the endogamic rules.Breguet, Georges:  From Isolation to Modernity: Demographic Transition and Public Health Changes in Tenganan Pageringsingan (Bali) Over Two Decades: 1976-1995. Tourists are attracted to Tenganan by its unique Bali Aga culture that still holds to the original traditions, ceremonies and rules of ancient Balinese, and its unique village layout and architecture. It is known for its Gamelan selunding music and geringsing double ikat textiles. Historical legend of Tenganan Pegringsingan According to legend, the people of Tenganan Pegringsingan were selected by the god Indra to administer a territory that was conceived in accordance with his divine plan to be a microcosm of the world. They were instructed to use every means to keep it pure and clean. The concept of territorial, bodily and spiritual purity and integrity is of paramount importance in the village. Another variation of this legend is of the magical horse Uccai Srawa, of King Udayana, king of the 10th century kingdom of Swa Prabhu centered in Pejeng, Bedulu. The horse was to be sacrificed but escaped. The king was distraught and sent search parties out to find him. A group of ten trusted servants, men from the Peneges family were assigned to search the eastern area of the island in the area of Klungkung. The king had promised a huge reward to whoever found Uccai Srawa, however when they did find him, he had died of exhaustion. The king promised the finders that he would gift them the land for as far as the smell of the dead horse could be detected. The men of Peneges dismembered the horse and carried the parts to various places around the place where the horse had died. Unbeknown to the king's men, the Peneges men also slipped a portion of the horses penis into the clothes of the kings soldiers, so the scent of the dead horse followed them everywhere. The Peneges men brought their families to the place called ngetengahang which means middle of the low plains surrounded by hills, now known as Tenganan.The Spirit Journey, Kajeng Madi Kertonegoro, Yayasan Daya Putih, 1986, 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 Village layout The main concourse of Tenganan Pegringsingan Village 1981 2002 view of the main concourse Houses in Tenganan Pegringsingan village are built on either side of the north to the south concourse with their doors opening on to it. The entrances of the houses are narrow, only allowing one person to enter or leave at any one time. One enters the village through the gate on the southern end. On either side of the entrance are two small temples. Across from these is the long bal√© agung, where the administrative decisions for the village are made. Next to that is the drum tower, kul-kul. The kul-kul is beaten 21 times each morning to start the day. Up the center are a series of communal pavilions (bal√© banjar) for formal and informal meetings, ceremonial gatherings.Bali, A Traveller's Companion.

US Library of Congress 1-86-946404 The People of Tenganan Pegringsingan The people of Tenganan Pegringsingan are called Bali Aga‚Äîthe original Balinese. They descend from the pre-Majapahit kingdom of Pegeng. There are strict rules as to who is allowed to live in the village. Only those born in the village can stay in the village and become full members of the community. There are rules regarding marriage and anyone who marries outside of the village has to leave. A strict protocol regarding marriages among the kin groups have steered the Tengananese through the genetic perils of intermarriage Bali, A Traveller's Companion.

Rites and Rituals thumb Many of the life-cycle rituals of the Tengananes are similar to those of the Balinese in general, but have subtle differences. Some ceremonies are unique. One of the distinguishing features is the use of geringsing. By virtue of their magical qualities geringsing are not only capable of keeping impurities and danger out of the village, but also shield and protect humans from baleful influences during rites of passage as they transition from one phase of life to the next. The Tengananese receive their first geringsing at the hair cutting ritual. His hair is cut and placed in a basket which is placed on a folded geringsing on the bal√© tengah, on which the Tegananese both enters and leaves the world. In the ceremony that admits a boy or girl to the youth association of the village, they are carried in a geringsing cloth on their father's right shoulder. In the concluding ceremony of teruna nyoma which is the initiation, the candidates wear a geringsing and bear a keris. for the tooth filing ceremony, an essential rite of passage for all Balinese Hindu, the participants pillow is covered by geringsing. After death the genitals of the deceased are covered by a geringsing hip sash. These cloths may not be used again and so usually are sold . In the purification of the soul ceremony (muhun) the dead person's presence, which is symbolizes by an inscribed palm leaf, is also arrayed in a geringsing. In the wedding ceremony the groom invites his in-laws to visit his parents home where the couple, dressed in festal geringsing clothing while relatives bring symbolic gifts which are placed on a geringsing cloth.

Depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art date back to early Christianity and can be seen in the Catacombs of Rome.Vested Angels: Eucharistic Allusions in Early Netherlandish Paintings by Maurice B. McNamee 1998 pp. 22‚Äì32 Google books linkChristian Art, Volume 2007, Part 2 by Rowena Loverance p. Google books link The Last Supper was depicted both in the Eastern and Western Churches. By the Renaissance, it was a favorite subject in Italian art. It was also one of the few subjects to be continued in Lutheran altarpieces for a few decades after the Protestant Reformation.Schiller, 40‚Äì41 There are two major scenes shown in depictions of the Last Supper: the dramatic announcement of the betrayal of Jesus, and the institution of the Eucharist. After the meal the further scenes of Jesus washing the feet of his apostles and the farewell of Jesus to his disciples are also sometimes depicted.Schiller, 24‚Äì38 Setting Jesus with the Eucharist (detail), by Juan de Juanes, mid-late 16th century The earliest known written reference to the Last Supper is in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (11:23‚Äì26), which dates to the middle of the first century, between AD 54‚Äì55.The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4 by Erwin Fahlbusch, 2005 pp. 52‚Äì56 Google books linkhttps://www.blueletterbible.org/study/intros/corinthi.cfm The Last Supper was likely a retelling of the events of the last meal of Jesus among the early Christian community, and became a ritual which referred to that meal.The Church According to the New Testament by Daniel J. Harrington 2001 p. 49 Google books link The earliest depictions of such meals occur in the frescoes of the Catacomb of Rome, where figures are depicted reclining around semi- circular tables. In spite of near unanimous assent, the historicity of the evidence, one lone scholar comments that \\"The motif of the Last supper appears neither among the paintings of the catacombs nor the sculptures on sarcophagi ... The few frescos in the catacombs representing a meal in which Christ and some of the disciples participate show not the Last supper but refer to the future meal promised by the exalted Christ in his heavenly kingdom\\", seeing the subject as beginning to be depicted in the 6th century.Schiller, 27‚Äì28 A clearer case is the mosaic in the Church of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy, where a similar meal scene is part of a cycle depicting the life of Jesus and involves clear representation of him and his disciples. Byzantine artists sometimes used semi-circular tables in their depictions, but more frequently they focused on the Communion of the Apostles, rather than the reclining figures having a meal. The Last Supper was also one of the few subjects to be continued in Lutheran altarpieces for a few decades after the Protestant Reformation, sometimes showing portraits of leading Protestant theologians as the apostles. By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a favorite subject in Italian art, especially in the refectories of monasteries. These depictions typically portrayed the reactions of the disciples to the announcement of the betrayal of Jesus. Most of the Italian depictions use an oblong table, and not a semi-circular one, and sometimes Judas is shown by himself clutching his money bag. Last Supper by James Tissot, between 1886 and 1894. Tissot shows the Apostles as they most probably were eating the meal, on couches, as it was the custom of the time. With an oblong table, the artist had to decide whether to show the apostles on both sides, so with some seen from behind, or all on one side of the table facing the viewer. Sometimes only Judas is on the side nearest the viewer, allowing the bag to be seen. The placement on both sides was further complicated when halos were obligatory; was the halo to be placed as though in front of the rear-facing apostles faces, or as though fixed to the back of their head, obscuring the view? Duccio, daringly for the time, just omits the halos of the apostles nearest the viewer. As artists became increasingly interested in realism and the depiction of space, a three-sided interior setting became more clearly shown and elaborate, sometimes with a landscape view behind, as in the wall- paintings by Leonardo da Vinci and Perugino.Schiller, 37 Artists who showed the scene on a ceiling or in a relief sculpture had further difficulties in devising a composition. Typically, the only apostles easily identifiable are Judas, often with his bag containing thirty pieces of silver visible, John the Evangelist, normally placed on Jesus's right side, usually \\"reclining in Jesus' bosom\\" as his Gospel says (see below), or even asleep, and Saint Peter on Jesus's left. The food on the table often includes a paschal lamb; in Late Antique and Byzantine versions fish was the main dish. In later works the bread may become more like a communion host, and more food, eating, and figures of servers appear.Schiller, 31, 37 Major scenes There are two major episodes or moments depicted in Last Supper scenes, each with specific variants. There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.Gospel Figures in Art by Stefano Zuffi 2003 p. 252 Google books link =The Betrayal= Jesus hands Judas the sop, Tilman Riemenschneider, Holy Blood Altar, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, 1501‚Äì05 The first episode, much the most common in Western Medieval art,Schiller, 32-38 is the dramatic and dynamic moment of Jesus' announcement of his betrayal. In this the various reactions produced by the Apostles and the depictions of their emotions provide a rich subject for artistic exploration,Gospel Figures in Art by Stefano Zuffi 2003 pp. 254‚Äì259 Google books link following the text of Chapter 13 of the Gospel of John (21‚Äì29, a \\"sop\\" is a piece of bread dipped in sauce or wine): > 21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, > and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. > 22 The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 23 There > was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus > loved. 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell > [us] who it is of whom he speaketh. 25 He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' > breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 26 Jesus therefore answereth, He it > is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the > sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot. 27 And > after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, > What thou doest, do quickly. 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent > he spake this unto him. 29 For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that > Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that > he should give something to the poor. 30 He then having received the sop > went out straightway: and it was night. Especially in Eastern depictions, Judas may only be identifiable because he is stretching out his hand for the food, as the other apostles sit with hands out of sight, or because he lacks a halo. In the West he often has red hair. Sometimes Judas takes the sop in his mouth directly from Jesus' hand, and when he is shown eating it a small devil may be shown next to or on it.Schiller, 30‚Äì34, 37 The betrayal scene may also be combined with the other episodes of the meal, sometimes with a second figure of Christ washing Peter's feet.Schiller, 32‚Äì33, 37‚Äì38 =The Eucharist= The second scene shows the institution of the Eucharist, which may be shown as either the moment of the consecration of the bread and wine, with all still seated, or their distribution in the first Holy Communion, technically known in art history as the Communion of the Apostles (though in depictions set at the table the distinction is often not made), which is common in very early depictions and throughout Byzantine art, and in the West reappears from the 14th century onwards.Schiller, 38‚Äì40 The depictions of both scenes are generally solemn and mystical; in the latter Jesus may be standing and delivers the communion bread and wine to each apostle, like a priest giving the sacrament of Holy Communion. In early and Eastern Orthodox depictions the apostles may queue up to receive it, as though in a church, with Jesus standing under or next to a ciborium, the small open structure over the altar, which was much more common in Early Medieval churches. An example of this type is in mosaic in the apse of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, under a very large standing Virgin.Schiller, 28‚Äì30 File:Last Supper (Pisani).jpgThe Main Altarpiece of the Corpus Christi Parish Church in Gƒßasri, Malta File:Comunione degli apostoli, cella 35.jpgCommunion of the Apostles, by Fra Angelico, with donor portrait, 1440‚Äì41 File:√öltima Cena - Juan de Juanes.jpgThe first Eucharist, by Juan de Juanes, mid-late 16th century File:Jacopo Tintoretto - The Last Supper - WGA22649.jpgTintoretto, Last Supper, 1592‚Äì94, showing the Communion of the Apostles File:Valentin de Boulogne, Last Supper.jpgValentin de Boulogne, 1625‚Äì26 =Washing of feet and farewell= The washing of feet was an element of hospitality normally performed by servants or slaves, and a mark of great respect if performed by the host. It is recorded in John , as preceding the meal, and subsequently became a feature of Holy Week liturgy and year-round monastic hospitality at various times and places, being regularly performed by the Byzantine emperors on Maundy Thursday for example, and at times being part of English Royal Maundy ceremonies performed by the monarch. For a while it formed part of the Baptism ceremony in some places.Schiller, 41‚Äì42 It mostly appears in cycles of the Passion of Jesus, often next to the Last Supper meal and given equal prominence, as in the 6th century St Augustine Gospels and 12th century Ingeborg Psalter, and also may appear in cycles of the Life of Saint Peter. Where space is limited only Jesus and Peter may be shown, and many scenes show the amazement of Peter, following John.Schiller, 42‚Äì43 A number of scenes appear on 4th century sarcophagi, in one case placed to correspond with a scene of Pontius Pilate washing his hands. Some types show Jesus standing as he is confronted by Peter; in others he is bending or kneeling to perform the washing. The subject had various theological interpretations which affected the composition, but gradually became less common in the West by the Late Middle Ages, though there are at least two large examples by Tintoretto, one originally paired with a Last Supper.Schiller, 42‚Äì47; National Gallery, London for the paired Tintoretto, an even larger one is in the Prado. The last episode, far less commonly shown, is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left the supper; it is mostly found in Italian trecento painting. The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure.

It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci was already familiar with Ghirlandaio's Last Supper, as well as that of Castagno, and painted his own Last Supper in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a Cosmic Drama and an Act of Redemption by Michael Ladwein 2006 pp. 27, 60.

This was delivered in 1573 as a Last Supper to the Dominicans of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice for their refectory, but Veronese was called before the Inquisition to explain why it contained \\"buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities\\" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese was told that he must change his painting within a three-month period - in fact he simply changed the title to the present one, still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.David Rostand, Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto, 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP The altarpiece of the main church in Martin Luther's home of Wittenberg is by Lucas Cranach the Elder (with his son and workshop), with a traditional representation of the Last Supper in the main panel, except that the apostle having a drink poured is a portrait of Luther, and the server may be one of Cranach. By the time the painting was installed in 1547, Luther was dead. Other panels show the Protestant theologians Philipp Melanchthon and Johannes Bugenhagen, pastor of the church, though not in biblical scenes. Other figures in the panels are probably portraits of figures from the town, now unidentifiable.Noble, 97‚Äì104; Schiller, 41 Another work, the Altarpiece of the Reformers in Dessau, by Lucas Cranach the Younger (1565, see gallery) shows all the apostles except Judas as Protestant churchmen or nobility, and it is now the younger Cranach shown as the cupbearer. However such works are rare, and Protestant paintings soon reverted to more traditional depictions.Schiller, 41 In Rubens' Last Supper, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas, it perhaps representing greed, or representing the evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.Rubens: the passion of Christ by J.

Barton. Biography Together with Juan Flores, Pancho Daniel led a band of fifty robbers in California. In 1857, the gang was reported to have robbed and murdered a German shopkeeper named George W. Pflugardt. Sheriff James Barton investigated the murder and, despite being warned against pursuing the band, he began to search for them. They were ambushed by the gang and Barton was killed, along with four of the men with him. Pancho Daniel was eventually captured in January 1858, and brought to Los Angeles to await trial. Daniel's defense attorney, Captain Cameron E. Thom, was dissatisfied with the jury that had been appointed for Daniel's trial, on the basis that he considered them unable to deliver an impartial verdict. When Judge Benjamin Ignatius Hayes dissolved this jury and appointed a new one, Thom insisted that the judge dissolve this one as well. Upon examining the third jury, Thom asserted that no jurors from Los Angeles would be able to be impartial in the case and requested for a trial in Santa Barbara County. On 30 November 1858, a group of citizens of Los Angeles County gathered at the Los Angeles jail where Daniel was being held, dissatisfied with the delay in bringing Daniel to justice. Obtaining the keys from the jail keeper by force, some individuals brought Daniel out and hanged him from the cross beam of the jail gate. At the inquest, the judge returned a verdict of 'death from strangulation, by a crowd of persons to the jury unknown'. California Governor John B. Weller labelled this lynching as a 'barbarous and diabolical execution', issuing a reward of $1000 for the arrest of the perpetrators. Despite this, those responsible were never identified.

History The opus was composed for the coronation of Charles VI in 1723. The work was commissioned in 1722 by Prague Jesuits who were involved in the grand preparation for the coronation act. The composer came to Prague in 1723 to complete, rehearse and perform his work. It was performed in the presence of the imperial couple at the Jesuit Clementinum in Prague in the afternoon of 12 September 1723, with Zelenka himself as conductor. Besides the eight soloists and musicians of the orchestra, a further 142 persons, including dancers and walk-on actors, were involved in that grandiose performance. Vocal soloists were selected from among native Czechs who attended Jesuit schools. This event was probably the social culmination of Zelenka's career, something he had not been able to achieve during his time in Dresden.  Description The composition is a monumental allegorical opus, its character between melodrama, oratorio, stage play and contemporary opera, celebrating the memory of the greatest Czech saint and patron of Bohemia, Saint Wenceslas, one of founders of Czech state, who lived from c. 907 to 935. The libretto was written by Matou≈° Zill, a member of the Jesuit order in Prague. The drama begins with a dispute between Prince V√°clav (Wenceslaus) and the Prince of Kou≈ôim in which Wenceslaus wins not by sword but the mind. The principal characters, who are allocated the majority of the musical numbers are allegorical figures that appear throughout all three acts of the drama. There is not any apparent plot in the play, it being rather a work in praise of religious devoutness and fortitude. The work opens with an orchestral Sinfonia scored for 3 instrumental groups comprising two trumpets with timpani, a pair of oboes with bassoon and string ensemble with continuo. The Baroque concertante principle is utilised in several numbers in the score, polyphonic writing is featured in two pieces. In many parts, we can find innovative elements, e.g. the use of cello as a solo instrument (in part no. 28), combination of two concertino recorders with a couple of flutes (in part no. 24), solo part of flute (which was still a very young component in the range of Baroque instruments) in aria no. 33 and chorus no. 36, that combines strict fugal with richly scored orchestral music. The ceremonial character of the composition is emphasized by the use of trumpets and timpani in many parts of the work.  Orchestration All parts of the orchestra were original Baroque instruments. There were used: 17 violins, 7 viols, 5 cellos, 3 double basses, 4 oboes, 3 flutes, 2 bassoons, 2 recorders, 2 trumpets, 1 chalumeau and theorbo, timpani, harpsichord and positive organ. Vocal casting included 2 sopranos, 2 tenors, countertenor, bass and boy's choir. The tradition of Jesuits did not allow the use of female figures in the play. Consequently, soprano and alto parts were taken by students from the lower grades of Jesuits' music school.  Parts  ;Symphonia *I. Symphonia ‚Äì Allegro assai ;Prolusio *II. Chorus. Allegro () *III.

The NPSM is awarded for \\"15 years 'ethical and diligent service' on or after 14 February 1975, or for a lesser period if that service was terminated due to the member's death, or to an impairment related to the discharge of their duties as a Constable of Police\\". Australian police continue to receive the National Medal to recognise their long service. Thus, at the completion of 15 years 'ethical and diligent service', a police officer may receive both the National Police Service Medal and the National Medal. Background The Australian Government announced that Her Majesty had given in-principle approval on Thursday 30 October 2008 for the introduction of a new award in the Australian honours and award system to recognise the special contribution made to the Australian community by police.http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/national_police_service_medal.cfm The medal is only awarded once; there are no clasps awarded for additional periods of service. The National Police Service Medal is not an award to recognise long service. Rather, it acknowledges the ethical and diligent commitment, and the unique contribution to the community, demonstrated by sworn members of Australia‚Äôs police forces. In most Australian police forces, long and diligent service has been recognised since May 1956 with the award of the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/awards/medals/australian_police_medal.cfm Since the introduction of the Australian honours system on 14 February 1975, service has been recognised by award of the National Medal. It was estimated that over 20,000 former Australian police would be eligible for the award upon its introduction.http://www.pansw.org.au/public/latest-news/national-police- service-medal-eligibility-extendedhttp://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest- news/queen-approves-police-service-medal/story- fn3dxiwe-1226881714042http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-04-12/extending- eligibility-national-police-service-medal The medal sets an uncommonly high standard for its award and retention. Although a police officer may qualify for the award and be presented with same, should their service be later found to be unethical or not diligent, in an act either before of after the NPSM was awarded to them, then the award may be cancelled at any time on the advice of their Commissioner of Police. The award came about as a result of the lobbying of various individuals and professional bodies, but principally by the Police Federation of Australia. Description The National Police Service Medal is 38 millimetres in diameter and 3.5 millimetres in depth. It is finished in cupro nickel with the St Edward‚Äôs Crown located on the suspender bar. The obverse (front) of the medal features the Federation Star representing the Commonwealth of Australia. The Federation Star is located inside a circular chequered band, known as the Sillitoe Tartan, which is an internationally recognised symbol of Police. The chequered band is unbroken and surrounds the star. This design signifies the unity and cooperation between each of the individual state, federal and territory police forces, which thereby join together as a shield to protect the entire Commonwealth. The reverse (back) of the medal has two sprays of golden wattle, (Acacia pycnantha Australia‚Äôs national floral emblem), located immediately below a horizontal panel 25 millimetres across and 8 millimetres high. The panel is centrally located and used to record the recipient‚Äôs details. The words: ‚ÄòFOR SERVICE AS AN AUSTRALIAN POLICE OFFICER‚Äô in capital letters appear around the inside of the outer rim. The medal ribbon draws inspiration from police awards under both the Imperial and Australian systems, including the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the Australian Police Medal, and the King‚Äôs/Queen‚Äôs Police Medal for Gallantry. The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and has a central yellow gold stripe 5 millimetres wide, flanked by navy blue stripes 5.5 millimetres wide, flanked by white stripes 3.5 millimetres wide, flanked by crimson red stripes 1 millimetre wide, flanked by white stripes 3.5 millimetres wide. The blue and gold are Australia's heraldic colours, defining this as an Australian award, while the blue and white are colours traditionally associated with police and police awards. The thin red stripes represent the ever-present hazards experienced in service as an Australian police officer. The medal device of the National Police Service Medal has been designed by Inspector Rick Steinborn of the New South Wales Police Force (NSWPF) and the ribbon was developed by Detective Senior Constable James Cheshire of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Order of Wear In Australia the position of medals when worn is defined by the Order of Wearing. The NPSM appears immediately after the Civilian Service Medal 1939-1945, before all long service awards. This is in recognition that the medal is not a long service award, and is made only to sworn police officers who have provided ethical and diligent service for the entirety of their police career.

Biography According to Houbraken when he returned from Italy he had with him a copy he had made himself after Nicolas Poussin, which the postmaster of Zwolle bought without asking him who had painted it. Izak de Moucheron in Gerard Uilenburg Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature When Isaac later declared that it was a copy by his own hand, he claimed the postmaster had never explicitly asked who had painted it, but had wished to see his things that he had brought back with him. This anecdote was told in order to show the popularity of Poussin in the art market of the Netherlands in Gerard Uilenburg's time. Houbraken mentioned him again as a Rome traveller with the bentname Ordenantie in his biographical sketch of Pieter de Molyn, who he knew in Rome. Moucheron told Houbraken that he judged De Molijn at that time to be a man of about 50 in 1697.P. Molyn biography in De groote schouburgh Houbraken intended to write a biographical sketch of Isaak in his birth year of 1667, and mentioned this in his biographical sketch of his father Frederik de Moucheron, but never got that far (he died before publication of Volume III, which ended with birth year 1659). According to the RKD he was one of eleven children of the landscape painter Frederik de Moucheron and Maria Magdalena de Jouderville, the daughter of the Rembrandt pupil Isaac de Jouderville, for whom he was named.Isaac de Moucheron in the RKD His father taught him to paint and then he travelled to Italy for two years in 1695. When he returned he became known for Italianate landscapes on wall hangings for wealthy Amsterdam families. He collaborated on larger projects with Jacob de Wit, and many of their collaborations still remain in the patrician homes where they were painted in Amsterdam.

He was known for leading a rebellion against Queen Seondeok of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Prior to his rebellion, he held the position of a Sangdaedeung (the highest official in the court). Details about his birth or achievements are vaguely known as there are no actual records containing them. However, being a Sangdaedeung, could have meant that he was part of the royal nobles or a Jinggol. Revolt against Queen Seondeok of Silla On year 635, Bidam was appointed for the highest position in the court (Sangdaedeung) by Queen Seondok. At that time, the Queen's health was deteriorating and could no longer fulfill her duties as she once did, thus leaving most of the work to Bidam. During that time, Silla was suffering from incursions from the joined forces of the Baekje and Goguryeo which took over 40 fortresses from the west part of Silla. On the other side, the noble members of the Hwabaek Council were also worried about the growing influence of the monarch. The nation was at the point of crisis and not far from ruined. Two years after his appointment, Bidam led a rebellion to dethrone the Queen, asserting that: \\"The female king failed to rule the country, therefore women should stop ruling\\". Bidam was a person who had a strong political influence over the court and held he highest position next to the king, and his reputation among the people was also high. Because of this, a lot of them supported his cause and made it the biggest rebellion in Silla's history. He gathered his supporters at Myeonghwalsanseong fortress, to prepare for the battle against Kim Yushin and his army in Wolseong Fortress where the Queen resides. The rebellion started around 8 February 647 and ended on 17 February 647. Queen Seondeok died before the rebellion was completely suppressed. Her cousin was then proclaimed as the next female ruler of Silla and became Queen Jindeok, later on. Queen Jindeok ordered the execution of Bidam and 30 of his men along with their entire family on 26 February 647 (9 days after Queen Seondeok's death). Although some story says that Bidam died in the middle of his rebellion, prompting for it to end just less than 10 days after it started; and that Queen Seondeok, died just two days after the Rebellion started. There was an anecdote about Bidam's rebellion, it says that: On the night of Bidam's rebellion, Bidam saw what appeared to be a star falling on the Wolseong fortress where the Queen resides. Bidam used it as a sign of the Queen's downfall to encourage his superstitious followers. When the Queen heard of it, she was shaken by fear but Kim Yushin calmed her by telling her not to worry for he has a plan to quell his rebellion. He then attached a burning scarecrow to a huge kite and flew it in the sky to make it appear that the star was back in its place. When Bidam's followers saw it, they were greatly discouraged and their morale dropped. The rebellion was then suppressed by Kim Yushin and Kim Alcheon. Reason for his rebellion Bidam's reason for rebellion has remained debatable. The constant invasion from the joined forces of the Baekje and Goguryeo almost brought the whole kingdom into ruin. They lost lands and fortresses. The Queen has lowered the tax for the poor but built many temples and statues at a high cost for the royal treasury. They received mockery from the Tang Emperor and to make the matters worse, Queen Seondeok decided to build Hwangnyongsa (was said to be the tallest temple at that time) - a decision that wasn't well received by her people, knowing that they will shoulder the expenses for the said temple, in a time that fund was needed the most. Bidam and Yeomjong used this as one of the reasons for their rebellion. His rebellion may be due to the idea of having another female ruler (Queen Jindeok) after Queen Seondeok, due to the amount of humiliations and loss that they suffered during her reign. According to the Tang emperor, the reason why they suffered from constant invasion was due to the fact that their neighboring countries didn't fear them for having a woman as their ruler. According to Silla's custom, in the event that a king passed away without a legitimate successor, the Sangdaedeung may be allowed to the throne as the new ruler, any other candidate will have to be approved first by the Hwabaek Council. Bidam, who was the Sangdaedeung at that time and has good reputation and influence over the court, was the strongest candidate for the throne. However, Jindeok was named as the successor even with the Hwabaek's approval. But Bidam, who have been favored by the Queen, shouldn't have a reason for his sudden animosity or the desire to take the throne, without anyone noticing ‚Äì especially the Queen. And so, some historians believed that Bidam, may have just been a victim of political manipulations by Kim Yushin, who have been trying to establish an absolute monarchy for Kim Chunchu. There was an alliance that was formed between Kim Yushin's supporters and King Kim Chunchu's supporters, after Kim Chunchu married Kim Yushin's sister. This alliance is what gave Kim Yushin a strong influence and power in the court, rivaling Bidam's power at that time. The problem starts after Bidam got appointed as the Sangdaedeung ‚Äì a position that made Bidam the most powerful man in Silla. One of the theories about it was that: During the time that Queen Seondeok's health was getting worse, the talk about her successor became an issue especially because Queen Seondeok refused to name her successor (out of fear of being manipulated). Bidam, who was a Sangdaedeung at that time and was people's favorite, has the strongest chance to become the next ruler. One night, Kim Yushin started a secret coup inside the palace and surrounded the whole place with his soldiers and didn't let anyone on the opponent's side to enter. When the Queen asked what the commotion was all about, Yushin told her that Bidam betrayed her and planning to start a coup to dethrone her, the Queen didn't believe him at first, but days has passed and Bidam and the rest of the nobles still hasn't shown up. Bidam and the royal nobles who heard of this news was enraged with what they believed was a plan to usurp the throne and gathered their soldiers and supporters to march towards the palace. A messenger then came and reported to the Queen, that the royal nobles, led by Bidam were marching towards the palace with their entire army. The Queen was shocked and disheartened by this news, but Kim Yushin calmed her and told her that \\"Bidam was a traitor who betrayed his Queen. But fear not! For I, have a plan to quell him\\". However, not too long after that, the Queen died. Although some story says that Queen Seondeok, may have been killed by one of the soldiers from the coup. Thus, despite Bidam's rebellion being said as one of the biggest in Silla's history ‚Äì it didn't even last for 10 days, because it wasn't planned. Some reasoned out that if Bidam, was truly against the idea of having a female ruler then he should have rebelled against that idea early on- back when she was still competing for the throne and not during the time that she was sick enough to die. Bidam, should have been wise enough to know the consequences of a failed rebellion; not to put his name, his entire clan, his position and everything he worked hard for at risk, by leading the rebellion himself. Aftermath Bidam's rebellion caused a lot of changes in Silla. Because of this failed rebellion, the influence of the nobles inside the court was decreased and since the rebellious nobles were purged, the power of the monarch was firmly established over Silla. King Taejong Muyeol (Kim Chunchu) passed over 60 laws aiming to establish a centralized government in Silla based on the legal system. He is considered the 'Greatest Rebel in Silla History'. It is also believed that Bidam considered his main rival for the power in Silla to be Kim Yushin. Theories about his early life It is said that Bidam and Alcheon were close in age and served during King Jinpyeong's reign. And since Alcheon was a hwarang, there is a chance that Bidam may have been a hwarang back in his younger days and got promoted for his achievements later on. Another belief was that he was once a scholar whom people loved. He and Alcheon, together with Kim Yongchun, were said to be the people behind the power that supported Queen Seondeok during her time as a princess. His political clan may have played a big part in the fall of Gaya during Gaya- Silla War, prompting the rivalry between him and Kim Yushin.

Premise Kacey Simon (Cymphonique Miller) is a popular girl who was once mean, and whose status goes down after she must briefly wear braces and glasses. Ignored by her fellow mean girls, Kacey finds a new way to express herself through music by becoming the lead singer of the pop/hip-hop band, Gravity 4 with Stevie (Lulu Antariksa), Zander (Max Schneider), Nelson (Noah Crawford), and Kevin (Christopher O'Neal). The success of the band, now renamed Gravity 5, begins a rivalry with Kacey's former group The Perfs, a rival band featuring her former friends, and now archrivals, Molly (Samantha Boscarino) and Grace (Halston Sage). Characters =Main= * Kacey Simon (Cymphonique Miller) is the former leader of the Perfs (\\"perf\\" is the abbreviation for \\"perfect\\") and the lead singer of Gravity 5. After getting glasses and braces, her social status takes a dive. Although she originally ridiculed the Gravity 5 band members, Zander convinces her to join. Kacey is confident, bold, somewhat self-centered, and now on a campaign to take her new friends and bandmates to the top of the school social ladder. With the help of her new friends, Kacey learns to look past appearances and accept herself and others as they are. Her and Molly's last names are references to 1960s singing duo Simon & Garfunkel. * Molly Garfunkel (Samantha Boscarino) is the new leader of the Perfs and the antagonist of the series. Molly is competitive, popular, and a talented singer/dancer. She is Kacey's former best friend and it is implied that Kacey treated Molly badly when she was the leader of the Perfs. Molly is insecure and jealous of Kacey, and often tries to humiliate her and Gravity 5. Her best friend is Grace King, whose kindness serves as a counterpoint to Molly's snarky nature. Over the course of the series, she becomes kinder towards the Gravity 5 members, partly due to her crush on Zander and her reconciliation with Kacey. * Zander Robbins (Max Schneider) is the new kid at Brewster High School who acts as the guitarist, keyboardist, and DJ for Gravity 5 as well as its leader. Zander is cool, handsome, and sometimes vain. A running gag in the show is that he can never stop staring at himself in the mirror or combing his hair. Because he is new, he is oblivious to the Perf's bullying behavior and is more inclined to believe the best in them. In the episode \\"How to Rock a High School Sensation,\\" Zander is shown to have a crush on Molly. In \\"How to Rock a Yearbook,\\" it is shown that Zander constantly takes bad yearbook pictures and has a younger sister. * Stevie Baskara (Lulu Antariksa) is Gravity 5's smart, sarcastic, tough bass player. The Perfs always call her \\"Loserberry,\\" much to her annoyance. She is a tomboy and has a number of unfeminine habits, including burping on command. She has four older brothers, and the only clothes she gets offered are sweatpants and sweat socks. Throughout the series, she works in food service at Danny Mango's and the school cafeteria. In addition to playing the bass, Stevie also plays the violin and the cello. Stevie was not featured in the 2011 novel. * Grace King (Halston Sage) is Molly's gorgeous but na√Øve sidekick, as well as the second- in-command of the Perfs. Although she tries to emulate Molly's cruel attitude, Grace can never find it in herself to be mean to others. In \\"How to Rock Cee Lo,\\" Grace temporarily leaves the Perfs due to Molly's mean attitude but later reconciles with Molly. She has a mutual crush on Nelson. * Nelson Baxter (Noah Crawford) is the tech-savvy, sci-fi loving keyboard player for Gravity 5. He is also Kevin's best friend. Nelson gets socially awkward and tongue-tied around girls,. Nelson is the treasurer of the science club and has a love for video games. He has a mutual crush on Grace. Along with Kevin, he was briefly addicted to the video game Furious Pigeons, a parody of Angry Birds. In \\"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\\" it is shown that Nelson still sleeps with his baby blanket, which he calls Captain Blankie. In \\"How to Rock a Birthday Party,\\" Kacey and Nelson are revealed to have the same birthday and to have known each other since grade school. * Kevin Reed (Christopher O'Neal) is the drummer for Gravity 5 and Nelson's best friend. He is obsessed with food and is socially awkward with the girls. He is athletic enough to join various sports teams, but too lazy to be a good player. He is demonstrated to be a terrible liar and a bit of a nervous wreck. He shares Nelson's love of video games and also loves to make and hear bad puns; he often gives Nelson a high-five when they hear one. He has a crush on Kacey, but also finds Molly attractive. In the episode \\"How to Rock an Election,\\" Kevin is shown to be somewhat of a skilled rapper. In \\"How to Rock a Lunch Table,\\" it is shown that he still sleeps with an old stuffed animal named \\"Mikey the Manatee.\\" =Recurring= * Andy Bartlet (Jacob Houston) is an odd but well-meaning student who goes to Brewster High School. Most of the school sees him as a geek, but despite his quirks, the Gravity 5 members see him as a dependable friend. He tries to make friends but has many disgusting habits that turn others away from him. He is shown to like \\"Furious Pigeons\\" along with Nelson and Kevin, and he is impressed by Stevie's burping skills. In \\"How to Rock Cee Lo,\\" he auditioned to be the new lead singer of Gravity 5. * Mr. March (Kirk Fox) is the history teacher at Brewster High School. His catchphrase is \\"What's up?!\\" and he often tries to talk like a young person. He serves as a mentor for the Gravity 5 members. * Iverne (Fuschia J. Walker) is the ill-tempered school lunch lady of Brewster High School. She has an unrequited crush on Mr. March. The food she makes is often reviled by the students. * Danny Mango (T.J. Miller) is the eccentric owner and namesake of Danny Mango's, a fruit smoothie store in the mall. He also works as a driving instructor. He is Stevie's boss, as well as Kacey's temporary boss in \\"How to Rock a Part-Time Job.\\" He has a habit of referring to himself in the third person at all times. * Dahlia (HaleyAnn Johnson) is a student who goes to Brewster High School. She has an obsessive crush on Zander. She served as a moderator of the Class President debate and works on the school newspaper. * Mall Cop (Jason Sims-Prewitt) is the frustrated security guard at the mall where Stevie works.

The title comes from the poem \\"Farewell, Rewards and Fairies\\" by Richard Corbet.\\"Farewell, Rewards and Fairies\\" in English Poetry I: Chaucer to Gray, The Five Foot Shelf of Classics, Vol. XL The poem is referred to by the children in the first story of the preceding book Puck of Pook's Hill. Rewards and Fairies is set one year later chronologically although published four years afterwards. The book consists of a series of short stories set in historical times with a linking contemporary narrative. Dan and Una are two children, living in the Weald of Sussex in the area of Kipling's own home Bateman's. They have encountered Puck and he magically conjures up real and fictional individuals from Sussex's past to tell the children some aspect of its history and prehistory, though the episodes are not always historically accurate. Another recurring character is Old Hobden who represents the continuity of the inhabitants of the land. His ancestors sometimes appear in the stories and seem very much like him. Some stories contain elements of the supernatural as well as history. Each story is preceded and followed by a poem, including If‚Äî, often described as Britain's favourite poem.Emma Jones (2004) The Literary Companion Robson, 2004.Mike Robinson (2004) Literature and tourism. p.61, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2004 Other well known poems included in the book are Cold Iron and The Way through the Woods. Stories and poems =A Charm= A poem which gives a charm to see the treasures of familiar places. =Introduction= A brief summary of Puck of Pook's Hill and the main characters. =Cold Iron= There is a brief episode in which the children Dan and Una encounter Puck again a year after their previous experience. Then Puck tells the story of a young mortal taken by Fairies whose fate will be determined by the first piece of iron that he encounters. =Cold Iron= A poem which compares how various metals affect human life but states in a recurring line that 'Iron‚ÄîCold Iron‚Äîis master of men all!' , ending with a reference to the iron nails used to crucify Jesus Christ at Calvary. =The Two Cousins= A poem which foreshadows the story making references to the devotion of her courtiers to the Queen and the sacrifices they make. =Gloriana= Dan and Una meet a lady who the reader realises is Queen Elizabeth I. She tells them about a mission to prevent the Spanish settling in Virginia. (The Queen engages the services of two gallant young lordlings who are willing to endure any peril in order to earn her approval. She makes it clear that they must undertake their desperate venture without her official blessing, and indeed that she will officially denounce them before the Spanish King should the need arise. It appears from the narrative as though the mission miscarried, but the Queen is interested to know whether Dan and Una thought it was right to send the young men.) =The Looking-Glass= This poem shows an ageing Queen Elizabeth being taunted by the spirits of Mary, Queen of Scots and the Earl of Leicester for being too afraid to look in a mirror. But the Queen rallies her courage as daughter of King Henry VIII and looks at her ageing features. =A Truthful Song= This poem has two verses both deal with the theme how a craftsmen's skills from the past can be applicable in modern life. The first verse has an ancient Egyptian Pyramid builder and the second refers to the story of Noah and shipbuilding. =The Wrong Thing= Sir Harry Dawe (introduced in 'Hal o' the Draft' in Puck of Pook's Hill) tells Old Hobden and Dan about his design to decorate Henry VII's ship Sovereign and how he gets knighted for advising the King not to use it. (The story also involves Harry's rivalry with the similarly gifted but jealous Benedetto. When Harry is knighted‚Äînot for good work, but for giving the King advice that will save him some money‚Äîhe cannot help laughing since he had always hoped he would be ennobled for his clever craftsmanship. Benedetto, who was on the point of murdering him, sees him overcome with mirth and insists that he should at least have his laugh out before dying, and by the time he has understood the joke himself he is willing to drop their quarrel for good.) =King Henry VII and the Shipwrights= The King watches how his shipbuilders start to take apart a warship for their own benefit until stopped by one of their fellows who admits to some minor pilfering. He is promoted and the others punished and the king advises him to 'steal in measure'. =The Way Through the Woods= The poem describes how an old road has been shut and taken back by nature but still occasionally you can hear the ghostly presence of past travellers. =Marklake Witches= A young girl dying of consumption, describes Ren√© Laennec's invention of the stethoscope while a prisoner of war in Sussex. (The narrator, Miss Philadelphia Bucksteed, is clearly innocent of the seriousness of her condition, believing it to be a \\"silly cough\\" that will disappear when she goes to London. However, as she describes the reactions of M. Laennec, \\"Witchmaster\\" Jerry Gamm, Doctor Break, Sir Arthur Wesley and her own father, it is clear that they all know better. Laennec's presence in Sussex as a prisoner-of-war on parole is entirely Kipling's invention.) =Brookland Road= A man falls in love with a mysterious silent girl who seems to be supernatural. =The Run of the Downs= A poem about the South Downs and Sussex naming various landmarks. =The Knife and the Naked Chalk= A neolithic shepherd barters with prehistoric metal working newcomers for metal knives so that his people can fight off the marauding wolves. =Song of the Men's Side= This poem reprises the basic plot of the preceding story. =Philadelphia= The poem refers to the story to follow and states that while men and places in the story have passed, that the landscape and nature persist. =Brother Square-Toes= Pharaoh Lee, known as Brother Square-Toes, is a Sussex smuggler, in 1793 he ends up in Philadelphia and lives there and among the Seneca people. He attends a meeting of the Seneca and George Washington where Washington states that he will not fight with the French against Britain. =If‚Äî= One of the most famous and popular poems in English, it gives guidance on the ideal behaviour to be considered a man. =A St Helena Lullaby = A poetic history of Napoleon's career. =A Priest in Spite of Himself= The continuation of Brother Square-Toes story and how he meets Talleyrand while he was exiled in Philadelphia. Later Talleyrand helped him recover his ship which had been seized as a prize by the French Navy. (Talleyrand is keen to learn what was said in the conversation between Washington and other White leaders, that was witnessed by the Indian chiefs known as Red Jacket and Cornplanter, but Pharaoh will not speak without Red Jacket's leave and he already knows that Red Jacket has held his tongue out of loyalty to Washington. Despite the inconvenience this causes Talleyrand, Pharaoh expects that he will nevertheless wield as much influence in Europe as he wishes, and Talleyrand accepts the compliment once he understands that it is sincerely meant. Talleyrand respects his integrity enough to repay him a favour before Napoleon Bonaparte himself.) = 'Poor Honest Men' = A lament of smugglers that after all their difficulties they are treated as criminals not honest traders. =Eddi's Service= Eddi, one of St Wilfrid's priests in Manhood End (Selsey), holds a midnight service and only a donkey and a bullock come, so he preaches to them. =The Conversion of St Wilfrid= St Wilfrid tells Dan and Una how he converted √Üthelwealh, the pagan king of Sussex, by showing tolerance for his old faith in Wotan while they were in danger. =Song of the Red War-Boat= A Viking ship survives a storm by hard work and faith in Odin and Thor. =An Astrologer's Song= An astrologer's praise for his art and how the stars rule over humanity. =A Doctor of Medicine= Nicholas Culpeper explains how he stopped the plague in a Sussex village by getting the rats killed for astrological reasons. (Although Culpeper was already dead by the time of the Great Plague of London in 1665 - 1666, lesser outbreaks were common occurrences during his life. Culpeper prescribes the right course of action for all the wrong reasons, but his shade, conjured by Puck, knows only what Culpeper knew in life and naturally believes his reasoning to have been sound.) = 'Our Fathers of Old' = A poem which lists many medicinal plants and how they were boldly used but laments that in the past medical knowledge was poor and mostly ineffective. =The Thousandth Man= How one man in a thousand is a true friend who will stand by you forever. =Simple Simon= A Rye shipbuilder tells a story about Francis Drake and the Spanish Armada. =Frankie's Trade= A sea shanty style poem of how Francis Drake learned his skills as a sailor and to fight against the Spanish. =The Ballad of Minepit Shaw= Two poachers are saved by falling into a pit but claim they were hidden by a fairy. =The Tree of Justice= Sir Richard Dalyngridge from Puck of Pook's Hill explains how King Harold survived the Battle of Hastings and ended up a blind beggar. =A Carol= A lament of the hardships of winter but asking And who shall judge the Lord? for bringing them.

It has large, orange to red flower spikes and consequently is a commonly cultivated species. In 1797, James Edward Smith described the plant as: \\"The most beautiful of the genus. It grows in swampy ground ...is plentiful in the English gardens, and was generally taken for an Hypericum, till it lately produced, in several collections near London, its elegant flowers.\\" Description Melaleuca hypericifolia is a large woody shrub or small tree growing to in height, with greyish papery bark. Its leaves are arranged in alternate pairs (decussate), long, wide, narrow elliptic in shape with a central groove on the upper surface. The flowers are red to orange, arranged in a spike, usually on the older wood. The spike is up to in both diameter and length and contains up to 40 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 16 to 25 stamens per bundle. The flower spikes appear in spring and summer and are followed by fruit which are woody, oval-shaped capsules long with the sepals remaining as teeth around the rim. As the plant ages, the capsules become compressed together.M. hypericifolia fruit Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by English botanist James Edward Smith in 1797 in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London from material collected in \\"swampy ground\\" in New South Wales. The species name references the similarity of the leaves to those of species of Hypericum. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca hypericifolia occurs in damp areas of sandy heath and woodland in mostly coastal areas from Bermagui to Sydney and inland as far as the Blue Mountains. The species is naturalised in South Australia and Victoria. Use in horticulture Hillock bush is a hardy, adaptable and attractive shrub that has been known in gardens for many years. It is moderately frost hardy, although the flowers tend to be hidden inside the shrub. It is a dense screen plant, unless pruned to display the flowers. It has caused problems in some areas where it has spread from gardens into bushland in other states and care should be taken with the species in southern Victoria.

The cave was explored to a depth of 742 m by the time the expedition was forced to return to the surface.

Biography The Harem Dance Giulio Rosati was born in Rome in 1861 into a family of bankers and militarists. He did not follow his family's career and instead studied art at the Accademia di San Luca under Dario Querci and Francesco Podesti. He also studied with Luis √Ålvarez y Catal√° (1836-1901), director of the Prado Museum, Madrid. He worked mainly in watercolor, and occasionally in oil, and focussed most of his entire painting career on Orientalist art. He devoted himself particularly to representations of the Maghreb, that he never visited himself. His painting, Oriental Scene was exhibited at the Exposition di Belle Arte, in Rome in 1900. Juler, C., Les Orientalistes de l'√©cole Italienne, [French edition], Paris, ARC, 1994, p. 138 He was part of a large group of painters, who at the time were depicting similar Middle Eastern subject matter. He became one of the most prolific Orientalist painters of the 19th century. Unlike other Orientalists, he never journeyed to the Middle East. He rarely participated in exhibitions, preferring to sell his works directly through art dealers.

Since the death of bishop Lukijan Vladulov in spring of 2017, the eparchy is administered by bishop Irinej Buloviƒá of Baƒçka. The eparchy has three vicarages (in Osijek, Vukovar and Baranja), with a total of 39 priests and two deacons. History Osjeƒçko polje (lit. Osijek field) is an old name created in the first years of the 18th century, the area that included the entire area around the city of Osijek and the region between the lower course of the Drava and Danube river and practically whole flow of the river Vuka. Because Osijek field lies on the border of Syrmia, Baranja and Slavonia, it was added, sometimes to one and sometimes to the other of three neighboring Eparchies, while sometimes it had its own bishop. In 1710, the Church Parliament in Monastery Kru≈°edol elected Bishop Sofronije as Bishop for all Serbs under Habsburg authority, and Eparchy of Osjeƒçko polje provided care to the newly elected Bishop Nicanor Melentijeviƒá. It remained an independent diocese up to 1733, when it was abolished and its Hungarian part was attached to the Eparchy of Budapest, while its Slavonian part to the Syrmian archdiocese. Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta handed Eparchy of Osjeƒçko polje in 1746 to his Bishop Jovan Georgijeviƒá. The residence of Bishop Jovan was in Osijek, where Eparchy then had two houses. Archbishops Synod after the election of a new Metropolitan in 1748 joined this Eparchy again to the Eparchy of Slavonia-Pakrac. From 1758 the Eparchy definitely came into the composition of Syrmian diocese till the year 1991. Holy Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1991 renewed Osjeƒçko polje eparchy and joined the whole Baranja to it, so the eparchy got its present name: Osjeƒçko Polje and Baranja Eparchy.

As a cataract is a clouding in the lens of the eye, couching is a technique whereby the lens is dislodged, thus removing the opacity. Although couching is nowadays routinely practiced only in remote areas in third world countries, it was a precursor to modern cataract surgery and pars plana vitrectomy. History Cataract surgery by ‚Äúcouching‚Äù (lens depression) is one of the oldest surgical procedures. The technique involves using a sharp instrument to push the cloudy lens to the bottom of the eye. Perhaps this procedure is that which is mentioned in the articles of the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 1792-1750 BC). However, Maharshi Sushruta, an ancient Indian surgeon, first described the procedure in ‚ÄúSushruta Samhita, Uttar Tantra‚Äù, an Indian medical treatise (800 BC) (Duke-Elder, 1969; Chan, 2010). From then on the procedure was widespread throughout the world. Evidence shows that couching was widely practiced in China, Europe and Africa. After the 19th century AD, with the development of modern cataract surgery (Intra ocular extraction of lens (1748)), couching fell out of fashion, though it is still used in parts of Asia and Africa. Modern use Couching continues to be popular in some developing countries where modern surgery may be difficult to access or where the population may prefer to rely on traditional treatments. It is commonly practiced in Sub- Saharan Africa. In Mali it remains more popular than modern cataract surgery, despite the fact that the cost of both methods is similar, but with much poorer outcome with couching. In Burkina Faso, a majority of patients were unaware of the causes of cataracts and believed it to be due to fate. It is not performed by ophthalmologists, but rather by local healers or \\"witch doctors\\". Technique A sharp instrument, such as a thorn or needle, is used to pierce the eye either at the edge of the cornea or the sclera, near the limbus. The opaque lens is pushed downwards, allowing light to enter the eye. Once the patients sees shapes or movement, the procedure is stopped. The patient is left without a lens (aphakic), therefore requiring a powerful positive prescription lens to compensate. Results Couching is a largely unsuccessful technique with abysmal outcomes. A minority of patients may regain the ability to sense light and some movement, but over 70% are left totally blind. A Nigerian study showed other complications include secondary glaucoma, hyphaema, and optic atrophy. Couching does not compare favourably to modern cataract surgery.

Tredegar Iron and Coal Company was an important 19th century ironworks in Tredegar, Wales, which due to its need for coke became a major developer of coal mines and particularly the Sirhowy Valley of South Wales. It is most closely associated with the Industrial Revolution and coal mining in the South Wales Valleys. Background In 1778 an iron furnace was built in the upper Sirhowy Valley by Thomas Atkinson and William Barrow, who came to the area from London.\\"A look at Old Tredegar in photographs\\" Volume 1 Philip Prosser Old Bakehouse Publications 1990 Fuel was needed for the furnace so men were employed to dig coal at Bryn Bach and Nantybwch, the first small scale coal mining operation in the area. The furnace failed in 1794, and hence also the business. Sirhowy Ironworks In 1797, Samuel Homfray, with partners Richard Fothergill and the Matthew Monkhouse built a new furnace which they called the Sirhowy Ironworks, leasing the land in Bedwellty, Newport from the Tredegar Estate.B. Gardner's History of Tredegar and other information In 1800, the company was renamed the Tredegar Iron Company, named in honour of the Tredegar Estate at Tredegar House and Tredegar Park in Newport. The company was taken over by the Harfords of Ebbw Vale in 1818. It was expanded in the late 1830s and early 1840s, producing significant volumes of rails, largely for export. The works was purchased by the Tredegar Iron Company Limited in 1873 and nine years later began to produce steel. Operations The company ironworks were developed on a single site, which later became known as Whiteheads, after that company took over the southern section of the site in 1907. By 1850, TICC employed between 2000 and 3000 people at its 9 furnaces, mills shops and ancillary plants. However, all of this production on such a vast scale had a price. Adrian Vaughn, in his 1985 book \\"Grub, Water & Relief,\\" mentions that in 1832 John Gooch took a managerial post in the Tredegar iron works: With many people in such a small area, and with poor sanitation provision, there were several cholera epidemics in the town in the 19th century. A dedicated cholera burial ground was later established at Cefn Golau. =1875-1946= In 1875, the company renamed itself the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, to allow development of additional coal mining capacity. In 1891, the company ceased production of iron, but continued to develop coal mines and produce coal. The former Tredegar Ironworks were effectively abandoned, with Whiteheads taking over the southern section of the site from 1907. In 1931, they also closed down their operations, moving everything to their Newport works. TICC continued to develop coal mines and work pitts, until it was nationalised in 1946, becoming part of the National Coal Board. Its last chairman was Henry McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway.

Description The adult males grow up to long, while females reach long.Linnea D. Hollis (1968): A revision of the genus Aiolopus Fieber (Orthoptera : Acridoidea). Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History). Entomology 22: 307-356.download The colouration of Aiolopus strepens is quite variable (green, yellow and brown). The basic color of their sturdy body is usually light brown, but sometimes is green or with some green areas or reddish stripes. There are also completely green colored insects, especially females. The immature adults usually show the same brown colors, but when autumn arrives and the exoskeleton stiffens, the colors redefine and the green vanishes. In spring, with the breeding season, especially females regain green color and a more \\"complex\\" pattern. Naturdata Pronotum is almost flat and it is usually monochrome, rarely with a broad longitudinal stripe on the top, which continues on top of the head. Hind legs are relatively short. Antennas are shorter than the head and pronotum The tibiae of the hind legs are usually red and the femora are quite robust. The wings are transparent with a darkened brownish apex. The hind wings are often bluish at the base. The front wings (tegmina) are dark with clear markings. This species is rather similar to Aiolopus thalassinus from which it differs for the larger posterior femora, the transparent-blue wings and the coarse punctuation in the posterior part of the pronotum.

He was bankrupted in the 1860s owing to the loss of ships which were attempting to trade with the Confederate states during the United States civil war, in an ill-fated effort to buy cotton in order to reopen Hull's cotton mills. Biography Pearson was born, to Zachariah and Elizabeth, in the Sutton area of east Hull. At 12, he stowed away on a ship, but was returned home until he was 16, when he enlisted as a cabin boy. By the age of 21 he was captain, four years later acquiring his own ship, and going on to build a successful shipping business. As a member of Trinity House, he was a keen advocate of the marine trade and commercial business of Hull, and one of the leading shipowners to initiate a dock improvement scheme. He was frequently invited to Whitehall to advise the Board of Trade. He played a key role in social welfare in the city, including financial contributions to the conversion of a bank building in Salthouse Lane into a Sailors‚Äô Home in 1860 and the opening of the Hull Temporary Home for Fallen Women in Nile street in 1861. He chaired the Restoration Committee for Holy Trinity Church and built Beverley Road Wesleyan Chapel. Pearson held the offices of Sheriff of Kingston upon Hull in 1858, and Mayor (Chief Magistrate and Officer) in 1859 and 1861. See List of Sheriffs of Kingston upon Hull and List of Mayors of Kingston upon Hull. During his first term as Mayor he was instrumental in organising the construction of Hull's first purpose built town Hall (begun in 1862 and opened in 1866, to a design of Cuthbert Brodrick). His was the Council that broke the deadlock of providing Hull with a clean water supply, and in 1862 he ‚Äòturned the first sod' at Stone Ferry where the reservoir would store the artesian water piped in from the west of Hull. In 1860 Pearson gifted of the of land he had acquired near Beverley Road to the Hull Board of Health, for the establishment of a public park (now named Pearson Park), keeping the remainder of the land for building development; and paid ¬£300 for the construction of an access road. In this way, he aimed to provide relaxation space and clean air for the workers to breathe, and a desirable residential location for Hull‚Äôs businessmen and merchants to remain in the town and continue to contribute towards its success. The plan was to reimburse the Council‚Äôs expenditure in laying out the park from the sale of the villa plots around the periphery of the park. Pearson handed over the Deed to the Park at a ‚ÄòColossal Fete‚Äô in August 1862. During his second term as Mayor, the American Civil War began, resulting in the closure of the two cotton mills in Hull and the loss of many jobs; the Hull Flax and Cotton Mill alone employed 1500 workers. In the early 1860s Pearson had acquired several ships on credit from the Banking house of Overend and Gurney; In 1862 he tried to use these ships to break the blockade of the Confederate states and bring back the cotton bales needed in order to reopen the mills and restore jobs. For some, this apparent support for the Confederate cause puts Pearson, a Wesleyan, at variance with the abolitionist views held by some of his non-conformist peers. Whatever its motivation, the venture did not go well. Six of the ships were captured by the Federal forces, and a seventh was run aground and sank. Coupled with the previous loss of two ships in the Baltic and another to fire in the Thames, London it led to business failure, after which three more vessels were sold at a pittance. Pearson was declared bankrupt in 1864 with ¬£646,000 of debts and liabilities. He had resigned as Mayor of Hull and as Commandant of the Hull Volunteer Artillery in October 1862. Before his financial crash Zachariah Pearson had been hailed as one of Hull's great philanthropists. His disgrace was severe, and distressing to him. The Bankruptcy Commissioner was sympathetic, describing him as the victim of bad luck, who had made some bad judgements, and two of the charges were thrown out; Pearson was discharged on the other two for three months each, without imprisonment. Many of his creditors, who had supported him despite knowing the risky business he was engaged in, heaped scorn and vitriol on him. The Town Council too was upset when the Assignees claimed the income from the sale of the villa plots and left the Council to foot the bill for laying out the Park. Pearson's name was omitted from the marble statue of Queen Victoria he had commissioned for the Park, and for which he had paid a handsome deposit; Mayor Moss paid the outstanding cost to the Assignees and his is the name on the statue today. Pearson's considerable assets were sold to pay his creditors, and he dedicated the remaining 27 years of his life to working to repay his debts. He gradually rebuilt his civic standing, and by 1875 was a guest of honour and speaker at the opening of The Avenues residential project in the town. Zachariah Charles Pearson died in Hull in 1891 at his residence in Pearson Park, the people's park that is his tangible lasting legacy. His other legacy is the controversy that still surrounds his role in the development of Hull.

In 1860, the pioneers of the fledgling movement settled on the name, Seventh-day Adventist, representative of the church's distinguishing beliefs. Three years later, on May 21, 1863, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists was formed and the movement became an official organization. Overview The Seventh-day Adventist Church had its roots in the Millerite movement of the 1830s and 1840s, during the period of the Second Great Awakening, and was officially founded in 1863. Prominent figures in the early church included Hiram Edson, James Springer White and his wife Ellen G. White, Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews. Many of the Adventist pioneers first began their work when they were teenagers. When the Seventh-day Adventist Church was newly formed, it was teenagers and young adults who held many leadership positions and helped to build up the church. Pioneers such as Ellen Harmon White, John Loughborough, J. N. Andrews, and Uriah Smith were teenagers and young adults when they began making an impact in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, many starting even before in the Advent movement started by William Miller.Young Adventist Pioneers by Lynette Frantzen William Miller was a farmer, and Baptist preacher, who, from 1831 to 1844 began the Millerite movement, preaching the imminent return of Christ. After the War of 1812 he was converted and began a systematic study of the Bible and in the process he discovered the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation, especially Daniel 8, which seemed to predict that Christ would soon return to earth. Hundreds of ministers and laymen joined in preaching the message. By the expected time for Christ's return, Miller had between 50,000 and 100,000 followers, commonly known as Millerites. After the disappointment of October 22, 1844, which Miller and many of the leaders of the first movement accepted as the date, groups of Millerites formed what later became the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Pioneer Ellen White has written positively about Miller in The Great Controversy and elsewhere. She heard him preach, and accepted his teachings, going through the disappointment at age 16. She believed that his preaching fulfilled the prophecies of Scripture, and saw him being guided by the Lord. Pioneers =John Nevins Andrews= John Nevins Andrews. John Nevins Andrews (July 22, 1829 in Poland, Maine ‚Äì October 21, 1883 in Basel, Switzerland), was a Seventh-day Adventist minister, missionary, writer, editor, and scholar. J. N. Andrews was the first SDA missionary sent to countries outside North America. He was the most prominent author and scholar of his time, in the Adventist church. Andrews became a Millerite in February 1843 and began to observe the seventh-day Sabbath in 1845. He met James White and Ellen G. White in September 1849. Later, the Whites boarded with the Andrews family. In 1850 he began itinerant pastoral ministry in New England and ordained in 1853. Andrews played a pivotal role in the establishment of Adventist theology. Among his more memorable achievements in Adventist prophetic interpretation, was identifying the two-horned beast of Revelation as the United States of America. On October 29, 1856, Andrews married Angeline Stevens (1824‚Äì1872) in Waukon, Iowa, where the Andrews and Stevens families had recently moved. In June 1859 a conference in Battle Creek voted that Andrews should assist J. N. Loughborough in tent evangelism in Michigan. He returned to Iowa in the fall of 1860. During these years their first two children were born: Charles (b. 1857) and Mary (b. 1861) and wrote the first edition of his most famous book, The History of the Sabbath and the First Day of the Week (Battle Creek Steam Press, 1859). In June 1862 John left Waukon to work with the evangelistic tent in New York and assisted in the founding of the New York Conference. In February 1863 Angeline and their two children moved from Iowa to join him in New York. Two more children were born to John and Angelina while in New York, both of whom died in infancy from tuberculosis. In 1864, John was chosen as the denominational representative to the provost marshal general in Washington, D.C., to secure recognition for the church as noncombatants. In 1867 he became the third president of the General Conference, (until May 18, 1869) after which he became editor of the Review and Herald (1869‚Äì1870), now the Adventist Review. In 1874 after his wife Angeline died from a stroke, John, along with his two surviving children, Charles and Mary, were sent as the first official Seventh-day Adventist missionaries to Europe. Andrews helped start a publishing house in Switzerland and an Adventist periodical in French, Les Signes des Temps (1876). As a theologian Andrews made significant contributions to the development of various doctrines of the SDA denomination. Andrews‚Äô extensive writings on the subject of the seventh-day Sabbath in history were published in a book entitled History of the Sabbath and the First Day of the Week. Andrews was also active helping in the development of church organization. He was chairman of a three-man committee to suggest a plan of organization for the denominational publishing house, also chairman of a committee to draft a constitution and bylaws for the central organization of the church. During the Civil War, Andrews represented the church in Washington, D.C., to explain why SDA's believe that participation in combat is contrary to Christian principles, with the result that SDA draftees could apply for noncombatant service. =Joseph Bates= Joseph Bates. Joseph Bates (July 8, 1792 ‚Äì March 19, 1872) was an American seaman and revivalist minister. He was the founder and developer of Sabbatarian Adventism, a strain of religious thinking that evolved into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Bates is also credited with convincing James White and Ellen G. White of the validity of the seventh-day Sabbath. Joseph Bates was born in Rochester, Massachusetts on July 8, 1792. (He did not have a middle name.) His father, also named Joseph, was a volunteer in the American Revolutionary War and his mother was the daughter of Barnabas Rye of Sandwich, Massachusetts. In June 1807, Bates sailed as cabin boy on the new ship commanded by Elias Terry, called the Fanny to London via New York City. This was the commencement of Bates sailing career. and after subsequent voyages he emerged as a captain of a ship and owner of vessels. During one of his voyages he read a copy of the Bible that his wife packed for him. He experienced conversion and became involved in a variety of reforms including helping to found an early temperance society. During the spring of 1845 Bates accepted the seventh-day Sabbath after reading a pamphlet by T. M. Preble. Bates soon became known as the \\"apostle of the Sabbath\\" and wrote several booklets on the topic. One of the first, published in 1846, was entitled The Seventh Day Sabbath, a Perpetual Sign.Joseph Bates: The Seventh Day Sabbath, a Perpetual Sign, from the Beginning to the Entering into the Gates of the Holy City, According to the Commandment, 1846 (www.gutenberg.org) One of Bates' most significant contribution was his ability to connect theologically the Sabbath with a unique understanding of the heavenly sanctuary. This apocalyptic understanding of theology would become known as the Great Controversy theme. Joseph Bates was a strong supporter of James White and the prophetic gift, which he believed was manifested in visions received by the young Ellen G. White. He contributed to early publications such as A Word to the \\"Little Flock.\\" Bates was active with the Whites in participating in a series of Bible Conferences held in 1848 to 1850 that have become known as the Sabbath and Sanctuary Conferences. During the 1850s Bates supported the development of more formal church organization that culminated in 1863 with the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Joseph Bates died on March 19, 1872 in Battle Creek, Michigan and is buried in Poplar Hill Cemetery in Monterey, Michigan. =John Byington= John Byington. John Byington (1798‚Äì1887) was a lay preacher and first president of the newly organized Seventh-day Adventist church. Born in Vermont, son of a Methodist preacher who had served as a soldier in the Revolutionary army. John was baptized into the Methodist church at age 17. He shortly was given a license to preach as a lay preacher. After moving to New York state, he helped build a house of worship for the Methodist Church around 1837 in Buck's Bridge. He became strongly involved in the antislavery movement, which eventually led to a schism in the Methodist church. John joined the new Wesleyan Methodist Church and helped to build its church building and parsonage in Morley. In 1844 he heard sermons on the soon coming of Christ, and began studying the prophecies. In 1852 H. W. Lawrence gave him a copy of the Review and Herald containing articles on the seventh-day Sabbath. He accepted the Sabbath truth before the year was out, and was baptized. He helped then to build the first Sabbath-keeping Adventist church built for that purpose. James & Ellen White invited the Byingtons to move to Battle Creek in 1858. John bought a farm nearby, and from there would travel to minister to the scattered believers. In 1863 at age 65 he accepted the first presidency of the newly organized Seventh-day Adventist church. He worked as a genuine shepherd and pastor during his term in office. Then he returned to his farm, but continued his visitation of believers throughout Michigan for the next 22 years. \\"I must feed the lambs of the flock,\\" he wrote. =Daniel T. Bourdeau= Daniel T. Bourdeau (1835‚Äì1905) Daniel T. Bourdeau Daniel T. Bourdeau was an evangelist and missionary, and brother of A. C. Bourdeau. At 11 years of age he joined the Baptist Church and at 16, with his brother, attended a Baptist French- language institution at Grand Ligne, Lower Canada. In 1861 he married Marion E. Saxby. Ordained to the SDA ministry in 1858, he, with his brother, spent many years in evangelism in New England and Canada. As far as is known, the two brothers were the first of French descent to have accepted the SDA faith. In 1868, with J. N. Loughborough, he responded to a call from an SDA group in California, headed by M. G. Kellogg, to open SDA work in that State. When he returned to the East in 1870 he resumed work among the French-speaking people and organized churches in Wisconsin and Illinois. In 1876 he went to Europe to spend a year of evangelistic work in Switzerland, France, and Italy, and associated with J. N. Andrews in editorial work. Again in 1882, with his brother, he took up evangelistic work in Europe, working in France, Switzerland, Corsica, Italy, and Alsace-Lorraine. Altogether he spent seven years overseas. On returning to America (1888), he continued as a minister and writer, working at first for French-speaking people, and then largely for the English folks. =Merritt E. Cornell= Merritt E. Cornell (1827‚Äì1893) Born in New York state, and raised from age 10 in Michigan, Merritt Cornell early believed the advent message, and dedicated his life to preaching it. In 1852 he was shown and believed the Sabbath truth, and immediately began sharing it with others, J. P. Kellogg and Cornell's father-in-law, Henry Lyon, being among the first persons he met. Both accepted the Bible evidence for the seventh day sacredness. With J. N. Loughborough during 1854 in Battle Creek he held the first Sabbatarian Adventist tent meetings. He continued to be active in evangelism, working at various times with Hiram Case, James White, J. H. Waggoner, R. J. Lawrence, D. M. Canright, and J. O. Corliss. His wife, Angeline, assisted him in evangelism. He traveled from Maine to California and to several states in the South, defending Seventh-day Adventist views of scripture in public debate, holding evangelistic meetings, and writing articles and news items about his experiences for the Review and Herald. Like Peter of old, he was headstrong and had other serious character faults, with which the Lord labored with him, sending messages through Ellen White. For some 13 years, from 1876 to 1889 he was not connected with the organized work, but continued some free-lance preaching for part of that time. In 1886 Ellen White wrote that he was \\"a deeply repenting man, humbled in the dust.\\" For the last three years of his life, he was again in the ministry. =O. R. L. Crosier= Owen Russell Loomis Crosier (1820-1912) was a Millerite preacher and editor, from Canandaigua, New York. He collaborated with Hiram Edson and Dr. F. B. Hahn in publishing a small Millerite paper, the Day-Dawn. He was with Edson on the morning after the great disappointment on October 22, 1844. Edson received an inspiration from God which explained that the Millerites‚Äô error was not in the date, but in the event; that Jesus had begun His work as High Priest in the most holy place in Heaven. Crosier, Edson, and Hahn joined together to study the subject, and Crosier was selected to write out their findings on the subject of the sanctuary and its cleansing. Joseph Bates and James White were among those Millerites who were convinced by the resulting article. When Ellen White read the second and expanded printing of the article published in the Day-Star Extra, of February 7, 1846, she immediately recommended it to the brethren as \\"true light.\\" When Elder Bates presented the Sabbath message to a group at Edson's, Crosier at first accepted the new light and kept the Sabbath. But eventually, he abandoned Sabbath keeping, and also his early sanctuary view. Even though Crosier made no contribution other than the development of our early views of the sanctuary, this doctrine is unique to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The plan of salvation is perfectly typified and beautifully explained by the services carried out in the tabernacle Moses built. =Hiram Edson= Hiram Edson (1806‚Äì1882) was a pioneer of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, known for introducing the investigative judgment doctrine to reveal to the early Sabbath-keeping Adventists the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary. The understanding of the investigative judgment was given to the members when Hiram Edson felt he was given it after a night of prayer after the Great Disappointment to explain why Jesus had not come: the sanctuary needed to be cleansed and a review of the records in heaven needed to be completed before Christ would appear. With Joseph Bates and James White, he was one of the pioneers who developed the Seventh-day Adventist movement. In the 1840s he lived on a farm near Port Gibson, New York, a little town on the Erie Canal almost midway between Albany and Buffalo. The Millerite message came to Rochester, New York, in 1843 and soon spread to Port Gibson. The message was based on the preaching of William Miller and predicted that Christ would return about the year 1843, which was later refined to October 22, 1844. This belief was based on the day-year principle and an interpretation of the 2300 days mentioned in which predicted that \\"the sanctuary would be cleansed\\". The Millerites understood this verse to point to Christ's return to \\"cleanse\\" the earth. On October 22, 1844 on his farm about a mile south of town, the Adventists gathered to await the coming of the King. But Christ did not come as they expected. On the morning of October 23 in answer to their prayers for light, as they were passing through Edson's cornfield where he claimed to have seen a vision. In this vision, Edson came to understand that \\"the cleansing of the sanctuary\\" meant that Jesus was moving from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place in the heavenly sanctuary, and not to the Second Coming of Jesus to earth: Edson shared this light with his friends, Owen Crosier and Dr. F. B. Hahn of nearby Canandaigua. They determined to study the sanctuary and its cleansing from the Biblical viewpoint. The results of their research appeared in their little advent paper published in Canandaigua, the Day Dawn. Later also in the Day Star, Cincinnati. From this point on, light came to the disappointed Adventists and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of their pain and disappointment began to dawn upon them. It was Edson who advanced funds to purchase the first Seventh-day Adventist press. It was at Edson's home in Port Gibson that the third Sabbath Conference of 1848 was held. Edson sold his farm, turned to preaching and became a successful evangelist. In his later life he labored near Roosevelt, New York. For years he was leader of our work there. He lies buried in the Roosevelt cemetery. He died on January 8, 1882. =John Norton Loughborough= Photograph of John Loughborough John Norton Loughborough (1832 ‚Äì April 7, 1924) was an early Seventh-day Adventist minister. He first heard the present truth preached by J. N. Andrews in September 1852 at Rochester, New York, and was immediately convinced of the seventh-day Sabbath. He took a public position to keep the Sabbath in October 1852 and immediately began to proclaim his new belief. Loughborough was involved in the Seventh-day Adventist movement from its early days, having been called to preach by Ellen White in 1852. He was ordained in 1854, and for several years conducted evangelistic work in Pennsylvania, New York State, and the Middle West. He pioneered the selling of Adventist literature in quantity when in 1854 he began selling it at 35 cents a packet at one of his tent meetings in Michigan. He worked for the church in New England, Michigan, Ohio, Great Britain, and California. As a result of a serious illness brought on by overwork (1865), he became deeply interested in health reform and wrote a book called Hand Book of Health; or a Brief Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (1868). In 1868 with D. T. Bordeau, he pioneered Seventh-day Adventist work in California, and in 1871 had helped establish five churches in Sonoma County, one of them in Santa Rosa, where the first Seventh-day Adventist Church building west of the Rockies was erected in 1869. He baptized the first three SDA members in Nevada in 1878. In 1878 Ellen White told him that his work for the church \\"must be made to tell for its full value\\". The same year (1878) he was sent by the General Conference to open SDA work in England, although the field had been prepared previously by the work of William Ings, a colporteur. Loughborough's five years in England resulted in the baptism of 37 persons and the establishing of a church in Southampton. After his return to America (1883), he traveled as a representative of the General Conference in the North Pacific region, visiting camp meetings and strengthening members who had become confused because of apostate movements. He was president of the Michigan Conference (1865‚Äì1868), was treasurer of the General Conference (1868‚Äì1869), and for six years (1890‚Äì1896) was superintendent of several General Conference districts. He was also first president of the California Conference (1873‚Äì1878; again, 1887‚Äì1890), and of the Nevada Association (1878), the Upper Columbia Conference (1884‚Äì1885), and the Illinois Conference (1891‚Äì1895). In 1892 he published The Rise and Progress of the Seventh-day Adventists, the first denominational history (revised in 1905 as The Great Second Advent Movement). He published a number of other books, among them The Church, Its Organization, Order, and Discipline (1907), which for many years served in place of the church manual, and wrote many articles for denominational papers and edited the Pacific Health Journal for a time. Loughborough made a world tour in 1908, including Europe, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand in his itinerary. He published an account of the message and history of Seventh-day Adventism in 1902 titled The Rise and Progress of the Third Angel's Message, but the book was lost when the Review and Herald burned in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1903. He then published another book, The Great Second Advent Movement, in 1905. In it, Loughborough describes his first-hand experiences in the history of the church, the visions and prophecies of Ellen White, early divisions in the church, and various philosophical and religious matters, as well as some autobiographical material.Loughborough, J.N. The Great Second Advent Movement, Review and Herald Publishing Assn., Washington, D.C., 1905 =Uriah Smith= right Uriah Smith (May 3, 1832 ‚Äì March 6, 1903) was a Seventh-day Adventist author and editor who worked for the Review and Herald (now the Adventist Review) for 50 years. His book Daniel and the Revelation became the classic text on Adventist end-time beliefs. His family was Millerite Adventists so at the age of twelve he went through the 1844 disappointment. Around 1852, he became involved in the early Seventh-day Adventist Church and became a Sabbath keeping Adventist; then the next year he joined James and Ellen White in the publishing work in Rochester, New York. In 1853, he published his first contribution- a 35 000 word poem entitled ‚ÄúThe Warning Voice of Time Prophecy.‚Äù Uriah became the editor of Review (now the Adventist Review) in 1855 at age 23 and served for almost 50 yrs as editor or editorial staff. He taught Bible at Battle Creek College and also served as the secretary of General Conference when it started in 1863. His main contribution to Adventist theology was a commentary on the prophetic Biblical books of Daniel and the Revelation, but he also wrote extensively on conditional immortality and other topics. He advocated religious liberty, the abolition of slavery, and noncombatancy for Adventists. In 1903, at the age of 71, Smith died of a stroke on his way to the Review office. =Stephen Haskell= Stephen N. Haskell (1833‚Äì1922) Stephen Haskell was an evangelist and administrator. Stephen Haskell began preaching for First-day Adventists in 1853, but the same year, after reading a tract on the Sabbath, he became a Sabbath keeper at the age of 20. Following some years in self-supporting work in New England, he was ordained in 1870 and became president of the New England Conference, serving from 1870 to 1887. While in that position, he served three times president of the California Conference (1879‚Äì1887, 1891‚Äì1894, 1908‚Äì1911) and also of the Maine Conference (1884‚Äì1886). He also founded South Lancaster Academy (now Atlantic Union College) in 1882. In 1885 Elder Haskell was in charge of the first group of Seventh-day Adventist missionaries who went to open the work in Australia. Together with two other Adventist preachers, John Corliss and Mendel Israel, he helped start the Signs Publishing Company first began as the Echo Publishing Company, in North Fitzroy, a suburb of Melbourne, which by 1889, was the third largest Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in the world. From 1889 to 1890 he made a round-the-world tour on behalf of Adventist missionary work. His first wife died in 1894, and in 1897 he remarried, this time to a Bible worker named Hetty Hurd. Stephen and Hetty did evangelistic and Bible work in Australia and the United States. In addition, he also authored several books including The Story of Daniel the Prophet, The Story of the Seer of Patmos, and The Cross and Its Shadow. Elder Haskell died in California in 1922. =Ellen G. White= Ellen White in 1899. Ellen Gould White (born Harmon) (November 26, 1827 ‚Äì July 16, 1915) was a prolific Christian author and one of the American Christian pioneers whose ministry was instrumental in founding the seventh-day Adventist movement that led to the rise of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Seventh-day Adventist believe she had the spiritual gift of prophecy as outlined in Revelation 19:10. Her restorationist writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Christian history. This cosmic conflict, referred to as the \\"Great Controversy theme\\", is foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her involvement with other Sabbatarian Adventist leaders, such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, would form what is now known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. White was considered a sowewhat controversial figure, though she was greatly respected especially among Seventh-day Adventists . She received a vision soon after the Millerite Great Disappointment. In the context of many other visionaries, she was known for her conviction and fervent faith. Randall Balmer has described her as \\"one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion\\".\\"White, Ellen Gould (n√©e Harmon)\\" in Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism\\" by Randall Balmer, p614‚Äì15 Walter Martin described her as \\"one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history.\\"Walter Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Bethany Fellowship, 1965, p379 White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender. Her writings covered theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education and health (she also advocated vegetarianism). She promoted the establishment of schools and medical centers. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books; but today, including compilations from her 50,000 pages of manuscript, more than 100 titles are available in English. Some of her more popular books include Steps to Christ, The Desire of Ages, and The Great Controversy. Her masterpiece of successful Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been published in more than 140 languages.http://www.whiteestate.org/pathways/ewhite Sometime in 1845 Ellen came into contact with her future husband James Springer White, a Millerite who became convinced that her visions were genuine. A year later James proposed and they were married by a justice of the peace in Portland, Maine, on August 30, 1846. James later wrote: > We were married August 30, 1846, and from that hour to the present she has > been my crown of rejoicing....It has been in the good providence of God that > both of us had enjoyed a deep experience in the Advent movement....This > experience was now needed as we should join our forces and, united, labor > extensively from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific....Life Sketches, 1880 > edition, 126, 127. right James and Ellen had four children: Henry Nichols, James Edson (known as Edson), William Clarence (known as Willie or W. C.), and John Herbert. Only Edson and William lived to adulthood. John Herbert died of erysipelas at the age of three months, and Henry died of pneumonia at the age of 16 in 1863. Ellen White spent the final years of her life in Elmshaven, her home in Saint Helena, California after the death of her husband James White in 1881. During her final years she would travel less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church. Ellen G. White died July 16, 1915, at her home in Elmshaven, which is now an Adventist Historical Site. =James Springer White= James Springer White. James Springer White (August 4, 1821, Palmyra, Maine - August 6, 1881, Battle Creek, Michigan), also known as Elder White was a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and husband of Ellen G. White. In 1849 he started the first Sabbatarian Adventist periodical entitled \\"The Present Truth\\" (now the Adventist Review) in 1855 he relocated the fledgling center of the movement to Battle Creek, Michigan, and in 1863 played a pivotal role in the formal organization of the denomination. He later played a major role in the development of the Adventist educational structure beginning in 1874 with the formation of Battle Creek College (which is now Andrews University). The paper which James White initially started, \\"The Present Truth\\", was combined with another periodical called the \\"Advent Review\\" in 1850 to become the \\"Second Advent Review and Sabbath Herald\\". This periodical became the main source of communication for the Sabbatarian Adventist movement regarding points of doctrine and organization. It also became a venue for James and Ellen White to quickly and efficiently share their views to like-minded believers. James White served as editor of the periodical until 1851 when he invited Uriah Smith to become editor. He played a senior role in the management of church publications as president of the Review and Herald Publishing Association. He also served on several occasions as president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.(1865‚Äì67; 1869‚Äì71; 1874‚Äì80). In 1865 White suffered from a paralytic stroke. White eventually determined that he should retire from the ministry and live out his days gracefully. In 1880, G. I. Butler replaced him as General Conference president. During the summer of 1881, White came down with a fever and was taken to the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Despite the efforts of Dr. Kellogg, White died on August 6, 1881. Major teachings of the pioneers The early Adventists emphasized the concept of \\"present truth\\"‚Äîsee (NKJV). James White explained, ‚ÄúThe church [has] ever had a present truth. The present truth now, is that which shows present duty, and the right position for us‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄùPresent truth is present truth, and not future truth, and the Word as a lamp shines brightly where we stand, and not so plainly on the path in the distance.‚Äù Ellen White pointed out that ‚Äúpresent truth, which is a test to the people of this generation, was not a test to the people of generations far back.‚ÄùWhite, James, 1846, Present Truth, July, pg. 1 and 1857, Review and Herald, Dec 31, p 61; White, Ellen, Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 693; from Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, Review and Herald Pub., pp. 19-20 This view is echoed in the preamble to the 28 Fundamentals. \\"...Revision of these statements may be expected at a General Conference session when the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds better language in which to express the teachings of God's Holy Word.\\" The founders of the SDA church had a dynamic concept of what they called present truth, opposed to creedal rigidity, and had an openness to new theological understandings that built upon the landmark doctrines that had made them a people.Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, Review and Herald Pub., pp. 27 Yet, the possibilities of dynamic change in Seventh-day Adventist beliefs were not unlimited.Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, Review and Herald Pub., pp. 24 Those landmark doctrines were non-negotiables in Adventist theology. Collectively they had provided the Seventh-day Adventists with an identity. In their eyes the pillars of their faith‚Äîthe Bible doctrines that defined who they were as a people‚Äîhad been thoroughly studied out in the Scripture and had been attested to by the convicting power of the Holy Spirit. As Ellen White put it, \\"When the power of God testifies as to what is truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth. ... Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are not truth. The truth for this time, God has given us as a foundation for our faith.Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, Review and Herald Pub., pp. 26 Robert Johnston noted, ‚ÄúWithout repudiating the past leading of the Lord, it [the Seventh-day Adventist church] seeks even to understand better what that leading was. It is always open to better insights to learn‚Äîto seek for truth as for hid treasure. ‚Ä¶ Adventists are still pilgrims on a doctrinal journey who do not repudiate the way marks, but neither do they remain stopped at any of them.‚ÄùJohnston, R. 1983, Adventist Review, Sept, 15, p. 8, from Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, Review and Herald Pub., pp. 28 Ellen White wrote, :\\"There is no excuse for anyone in taking the position that there is no more truth to be revealed, and that all our expositions of Scripture are without an error. The fact that certain doctrines have been held as truth for many years by our people, is not a proof that our ideas are infallible. Age will not make error into truth, and truth can afford to be fair. No true doctrine will lose anything by close investigation.\\"Counsels to Writers and Editors, p35. Chapter, \\"Chap. 4 - Attitude to New Light\\" These pillars, landmarks, way marks,\\"Chap. 3 - The Foundations, Pillars, and Landmarks\\" of Counsels to Writers and Editors by Ellen White are the investigative judgment, the sanctuary that brings this judgment to light, the three angel's messages of Revelation, the law of God, the faith of Jesus, the Sabbath, the state of the dead, and the special gift of prophecy.Venden, Morris, 1982, The Pillars, Pacific Press, pp. 12-13 What are the pillars of our Adventist faith? They are as follows: The Investigative Judgment. The sanctuary service or a broader understanding of the\\"heavenly sanctuary\\". The spirit of prophecy The Three Angels' Messages (exposing the papacy, Babylon, ecumenism, explaining the Sabbath-Sunday-question, exalting the law of God, etc.) The state of the dead and the exposure of spiritualism The Investigative Judgment understanding came about from the application of the day-year principle of prophetic interpretation by William Miller and spread among his followers in the Millerite Adventist movement.Ellen White, Great Controversy, 1888 Edition, p.375 paragraph 3 who were expecting Jesus Christ to return to earth on October 22, 1844. They arrived at this date from an interpretation of the Bible verse . They understood the 2300 days to represent 2300 years (according to the day-year principle of prophetic interpretation), a time period stretching from the biblical era to the nineteenth century. However Miller had not been the first to arrive at this interpretation, as he himself emphasized. Others had earlier concluded that a prophetic period of 2300 years was to end \\"around the year 1843\\" (Miller's earlier estimate).Le Roy Edwin Froom, Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers, vol. 4, p403; as cited by Cottrell When Jesus did not return as expected ( an event Adventists call the \\"Great Disappointment\\") several alternative interpretations of the prophecy were put forward. The majority of Millerites abandoned the 1844 date, however some members Ellen White, Early Writings, p. XVII; as stated in the book's prefece written by the Ellen White Estate 1963 ( including Hiram Edson and O. R. L. Crosier) concluded the event predicted by Daniel 8:14 was not the second coming, but rather Christ's entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.\\"Investigative Judgment\\" article in Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia (Review and Herald, 1996) Edson claimed to have a vision in a cornfield the day after the Great Disappointment, which resulted in a series of Bible studies with other Millerites to test the validity of his solution. This became the foundation for the Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary, and the people who held it became the nucleus of what would emerge from other \\"Adventist\\" groups as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. From scripture, such as \\"And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments therefore, even so shall ye make it.\\" Exodus 25:8-9. \\"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.\\" Revelation 11:19, they came to an understanding that there is a temple in heaven of which the earthly sanctuary was a pattern. This heavenly sanctuary is composed of two apartments; the first is the holy place, the second the most holy place. The revelation was greatly encouraging for the [Seventh-day] Adventists. As Ellen White wrote later, \\"The scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the advent faith, was the declaration, 'Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.'\\" (quoting Daniel 8:14)Ellen White, The Great Controversy, p409, 1888. See also her later statement, \\"The correct understanding of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary is the foundation of our faith.\\" White, Evangelism, p221. As cited by Cottrell She also predicted that criticism of the belief would come.\\"Not one pin is to be removed from that which the Lord has established. The enemy will bring in false theories, such as the doctrine that there is no sanctuary. This is one of the points on which there will be a departing from the faith.\\" Ellen White, Evangelism, pp.221, 224; as quoted by Cottrell They believed that Christ's first apartment (holy place) ministry began at His ascension and continued until October 22, 1844 at the end of the 2300 days/years when He entered into the second apartment (most holy place) to begin His final mediatorial work of intercession, atonement, and investigative judgment to cleanse the heavenly sanctuary as our High Priest.Great Controversy, p 352, 409, 412-22, 428, 480, 647-48; Spirit of Prophecy, vol 4, p 265-270, 431, 440; Early Writings, p 36, 54-56, 256; Testimonies, vol 6, p 364; vol 5, p 86, 575; Counsels to Writers and Editors, p 78; Testimony to Ministers, p 37, 445; Manuscript Releases, vol 12, p 392; Selected Messages, book 1, p 124-126, 232, 344; Notebook Leaflets, p 99, col 1; Battle Creek Letters, p 116-117; Review and Herald, January 21, 1890. Many of the Adventist Church pioneers came out of the Methodist or Wesleyan/Arminian branches of Protestantism which tended to have a view of emphasis on sanctification and the possibility of moral perfection in this life.SINLESS SAINTS OR SINLESS SINNERS? by Rolf J. Poehler, page 2 Ellen White in The Great Controversy wrote the following of the perfection of those saints who stand at the end while Christ still intercedes in the Most Holy Place, and what would happen when His work was done: ‚ÄúNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation. . . . This is the condition in which those must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble‚Äù (GC 623). The urgency for attaining perfection comes from the knowledge that the remnant must live perfectly during the time of trouble at the end to prove to the universe that fallen human beings can keep the law of God. Ellen White states, ‚ÄúWhen He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor.‚Äù (GC 614). And explains this is necessary because the ‚Äúearthliness‚Äù of the remnant must be cleansed that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected: \\"God‚Äôs love for His children during the period of their severest trial is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful for them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness must be consumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected.\\"(GC 621). The Adventist Pioneers held to the belief of overcoming sin and all who will can be overcomers,[S.D.A. Bible Commentary Vol. 7, Page 974] and \\"that the final generation would become perfected, or sinless, men.\\" Ellen White wrote \\"Our Saviour does not require impossibilities of any soul. He expects nothing of His disciples that He is not willing to give them grace and strength to perform. He would not call upon them to be perfect if He had not at His command every perfection of grace to bestow on the ones upon whom He would confer so high and holy a privilege.\\" and \\"Our work is to strive to attain in our sphere of action the perfection that Christ in His life on the earth attained in every phase of character. He is our example. In all things we are to strive to honor God in character.... We are to be wholly dependent on the power that He has promised to give us.\\" Our Father Cares, Page 214. TMK 130 (MS 148,1902) In addition to the many writings of Ellen White there were many others that wrote on the Great Controversy theme and how Christ withstood temptations and conquered the same as we may conquer. One of the most well known was A. T. Jones a Seventh-day Adventist known for his impact on the theology of the church, along with his friend and associate Ellet J. Waggoner. Both of who were key participants in the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference Session a landmark event in the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In addition to the message of righteousness by faith, A. T. Jones held that Christ was made \\"in all things\\" like unto us, or the fallen nature of mankind after Adam and yet overcame sin as our example and the perfection of character, is the Christian goal.The Consecrated Way ‚Äì A.T Jones, pg 28 and was also our example and there must be a moral and spiritual perfection of the believers before the end time. In the Consecrated Way, he wrote: \\"Sanctification is the true keeping of all the commandments of God. In other words, this is to say that the will of God concerning man is that His will shall be perfectly fulfilled in man. His will is expressed in His law of ten commandments, which is \\"the whole duty of man.\\" This law is perfect, and perfection of character is the perfect expression of this law in the life of the worshiper of God. By this law is the knowledge of sin. And all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God‚Äîhave come short of this perfection of character....In His coming in the flesh‚Äîhaving been made in all things like unto us and having been tempted in all points like as we are‚ÄîHe has identified Himself with every human soul just where that soul is. And from the place where every human soul is, He has consecrated for that soul a new and living way through all the vicissitudes and experiences of a whole lifetime, and even through death and the tomb, into the holiest of all at the right hand of God for evermore....Perfection, perfection of character, is the Christian goal‚Äîperfection attained in human flesh in this world. Christ attained it in human flesh in this world and thus made and consecrated a way by which, in Him, every believer can attain it. He, having attained it, has become our great High Priest, by His priestly ministry in the true sanctuary to enable us to attain.\\"[The Consecrated Way, A.T Jones. Chapter 12, 43,45] The Sabbath truth they felt was from God Himself, who after six days of creationary work, blessed, sanctified, and rested on the seventh day as His only Sabbath (Genesis 2:2-3). This was a sacred day of rest requiring abstinence from all unnecessary labor and secular work, and the performance of sacred and religious duties. The Adventists embraced the Three Angels messages, starting with the first in Revelation 14:6-7, which changed the thinking of many denominations who today embrace the pre-millennial and literal Second Coming of Christ instead of a thousand years of peace and prosperity that was taught back in the early 19th century. Here are the verses of the Three Angels messages: The first angels message was a warning message to the world: to fear God, our Creator to worship only Him, and give glory to Him for the hour of investigative judgment (first for the dead and then for the living) has come, and to proclaim the Everlasting Gospel, which involves the plan of redemption, and salvation from all sin through Jesus Christ the only Mediator between God and man. The second angels message was on Babylon or the false church which had fallen because they rejected the light of truth sent to them from heaven as proclaimed in the First Angel's Message. According to their interpretation of these passages, this angel proclaims a chance for repentant sinners to accept the righteousness of Christ by faith. It also warns all mankind against worshiping the beast (Papacy), or his image (apostate Protestantism), or receiving the mark of the beast which is false worship. They also believed that It also warns all of God's people to willingly separate themselves from all unclean apostate, harlot churches of Babylon. Adventist came to understand from scripture that death is a state of silence, inactivity, and entire unconsciousness, referred to in the Bible as \\"sleep\\". The investigative judgment determines whether the dead will awaken at Christ's second coming being raised in the first resurrection to inherit everlasting life, or remaining in the grave until the second resurrection to be consumed in the lake fire which is the second death, according to their interpretation on . The teaching about the non-immortality of the soul, while it may seem at odds with the majority of Protestants, it nonetheless represents their interpretation that immortality is only possible through Christ. This doctrine supports the teaching of the resurrection and thus it is a very important part of the Adventist eschatological model. = Health reform = Ellen White expounded greatly on the subject of health and nutrition, as well as healthy eating and a balanced diet. At her behest, the Seventh-day Adventist Church first established the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1866 to care for the sick as well as to disseminate health instruction. Over the years, other Adventist sanitariums were established around the country. These sanitariums evolved into hospitals, forming the backbone of the Adventists' medical network and, in 1972, forming the Adventist Health System. The beginnings of this health ministry are found in a vision that White had in 1863. The vision was said to have occurred during a visit by James and Ellen White to Otsego, Michigan to encourage the evangelistic workers there.E.G. White, Review & Herald, Oct. 8, 1867; Counsels on Diets and Foods, p. 481. As the group bowed in prayer at the beginning of Sabbath, Ellen White reportedly had a vision of the relation of physical health to spirituality, of the importance of following right principles in diet and in the care of the body, and of the benefits of nature's remedies‚Äîclean air, sunshine, exercise and pure water. Previous to this vision, little thought or time had been given to health matters in the church, and several of the overtaxed ministers had been forced to become inactive because of sickness. This revelation on June 6, 1863 impressed upon the leaders in the newly organized church the importance of health reform. In the months that followed, as the health message was seen to be a part of the message of Seventh-day Adventists, a health educational program was inaugurated. An introductory step in this effort was the publishing of six pamphlets of 64 pages each, entitled, Health, or How to Live, compiled by James and Ellen White. An article from White was included in each of the pamphlets. The importance of health reform was greatly impressed upon the early leaders of the church through the untimely death of Henry White at the age of 16, the severe illness of Elder James White, which forced him to cease work for three years, and through the sufferings of several other ministers. Early in 1866, responding to the instruction given to Ellen White on Christmas Day in 1865Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p.489 that Seventh-day Adventists should establish a health institute for the care of the sick and the imparting of health instruction, plans were laid for the Western Health Reform Institute, which opened in September, 1866.Battle Creek Sanitarium While the Whites were in and out of Battle Creek from 1865 to 1868, James White's poor physical condition led them to move to a small farm near Greenville, Michigan. White's idea of health reform included vegetarianism in a day and age where \\"meat and two vegetables\\" was the standard meal for a typical North American. Her health message inspired a health food revolution starting with John Harvey Kellogg in his creation of Corn Flakes. The Sanitarium Health Food Company as it is now known was also started by this health principle. It is also based on White's health principles that Kellogg differed from his brother's views on the sugar content of their Corn Flake breakfast cereal. The latter started Kellogg Company. White championed a vegetarianism that was intended to be spiritually helpful and with regard to the moral issues of the cruel treatment of animals.Ministry of Healing pg. 315 Her views are expressed in many of her writings such as Important Facts Of Faith: Laws Of Health, And Testimonies, Nos. 1-10 (1864), Healthful Living (1897, 1898), The Ministry of Healing (1905), The Health Food Ministry (1970), and Counsels on Diet and Foods (1926).

He was also Duke of Silesian duchies M√ºnsterberg and Oels and 1465‚Äì1472 Duke of Opava. At times, he served as the Landeshauptmann and governor of Bohemia.  Family background  Henry was descended from the Podƒõbrady branch of the Kun≈°t√°t family. His parents were King George of Podƒõbrady of Bohemia and Kunigunde of Sternberg. In order of siblings Henry was the third son after the older brothers Boƒçek and Victor.  Life  Henry was initially planned by his father, George of Podƒõbrady, as his successor. As early as 1459 Emperor Frederick III appointed Henry's older brother Victor to imperial count. On 7 December 1462 the Emperor appointed Henry and his younger half-brother of the same name Henry the Younger to imperial count. At the same time, the Emperor confirmed the appointment by King George in 1459 of Victor, Henry the Elder and Henry the Younger as dukes of M√ºnsterberg and counts of Kladsko. After their father also acquired the Duchy of Opava in 1464, he gave this duchy in 1465 to his sons Henry the Elder, Victor and Henry the Younger. Although Henry and his brothers adhered to the Catholic faith, the Pope refused to recognize their royal titles because the Ban imposed on George of Podƒõbrady should also apply to his sons. After King George's death on 22 March 1471, Henry was appointed to supreme governor of the Kingdom of Bohemia until the arrival of the new king. In this position he received on 10 August 1471 the newly elected King Vladislas II of Bohemia in Kladsko, who was on his way from Krak√≥w to Prague for the coronation. Later, Henry the Elder was appointed Governor for a period of absence of the king. King George's possessions were divided among his sons according to the inheritance plan in 1472. Henry the Elder received the County of Kladsko, the Silesian Duchy of M√ºnsterberg, including Frankenstein and the East Bohemian dominions N√°chod, V√≠zmburk Castle, Kunƒõtice Mountain Castle and the lands of the now defunct monasteries of Opatovice and Sezemice that had been devastated in the Hussite Wars. King Vladislas confirmed on these possessions on 3 and 29 April 1472. After the emperor had confirmed the privileges for the vassalage of the county of Kladsko, he asked his subjects in Kladsko to paid homage to Duke Henry. The estates of the county paid homage to the new Duke at his castle in Kladsko. As the first count of Kladsko Heinrich resided with his family on Kladsko Castle, where his court was located. At first, the office of Landeshauptmann was held by Hans of Warnsdorf, who had been appointed by George of Podƒõbrady. He was succeeded by in 1474 by Hans of Bernstein, who was succeeded by Hans Pannwitz of Rengersdorf in 1477. His marshalls were, in order, Jan Horu≈°ovsky of Roztok, Jan Fulstein of Slavkov and Zbynƒõk of Buchov. His comptroller was George of Bischofsheim; Court Chancellor was Kliment of Jak≈°onov. Although Henry himself had an excellent knowledge of the German language, most of the documents produced in his office were written in Czech. At the request of the Abbot Peter of Broumov, Heinrich the Elder's troops entered the city of Broumov on 24 April 1472 without a fight. The city had been occupied by captain Franz von Hag of the Bohemian counter-king Matthias Corvinus in 1469, and the Hungarian soldiers still were in the city. Thus, Henry acquired Broumov and the surrounding land. He ruled it until 1483 and then incorporated it into the county of Kladsko, with the consent of king Vladislas II. Hans of Warnsdorf went on making incursions against Silesia, at Henry's request. Because of the associated threats, some Silesian towns voluntarily paid war funds and contributions to Duke Henry.Laur. Wintera: The belfry of Braunau in 1477, in: Communications of the Association for the History of Germans in Bohemia, 37 (1899), p. 194 On 9 January 1473 the Pope lifted the interdict imposed on George of Podƒõbrady and his sons, and gave them absolution. That same year, Henry and his brothers Victor and Henry the Younger tried to resolve their dispute about the Crown of Saint Wenceslas. To this end, they invited representatives of Bohemia, Poland, Silesia and Lausitz to participate in negotiations in Opava, which was held by Victor at the time. Although the negotiations were not successful, King Vladislas promised to erase the brothers' debts. To this end, taxes would be levied. In a dispute in 1473 between the county's Free Judges and the cities of Kladsko, Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka, Radk√≥w and LƒÖdek-Zdr√≥j about the brewing right Henry decided in favor of the cities. In 1477 Henry annexed the barony of Homole, which hitherto had belonged to the Bohemian circle of Hradec Kr√°lov√©, to the County of Kladsko. He also enlarged Homole with the parishes Lewin and and the villages of and . On 13 November of that year, Vladislas II confirmed the continuing validity of Henry's possession of the Kunƒõtice Mountain Castle and the former monastic estates of Opatovice and Sezemice and three days later he gave Henry Frankenstein as a hereditary fief. In 1477, Henry participated in the peace negotiations between Bohemia and Silesia in Broumov as a representative Vladislas II, together with William Kru≈°ina of Lichtenburg (as governor of Hradec Kr√°lov√©), Peter Kdulinec, Christoph von Talkenberg auf Talkenstein and Hans of Warnsdorf. The negotiations did not produce a lasting peace. On 3 July 1479, Henry welcomed the anti-king Matthias Corvinus of Poland in Olomouc, on behalf of king Vladislas II of Bohemia. Before 1491, Henry the Elder received Litice Castle from his eldest brother Boƒçek. In 1492, a dispute arose between Henry and King Vladislas over the rule of the baronies of Podƒõbrady and Kostomlaty. The king had claimed these lands for himself after the death of Henry the Younger for themselves, although Henry's testament had awarded them to Henry the Elder. The dispute was settled after the Oels branch of the Piast family died out in the male line in 1495. Henry had to give up Podƒõbrady and, in a treaty concluded on 28 April 1495 in Bautzen which also applied to Henry's sons, he received the Duchy of Oels as a hereditary fief, except the Free Estates of Milicz, ≈ªmigr√≥d and Syc√≥w, that had been split off from Oels in 1492. Also in 1495, Henry had to sell Litice and other East Bohemian lands to the High Stewart of Bohemia, William II of Pernstein, to pay the debts he had incurred during his participation in the war against Matthias Corvinus. In earlier years, Henry had already been forced by his creditors to sell off most of the former monastery villages. In 1497, he finally had to pledge the large barony of N√°chod to Jan ≈†petle z Prudic a ze ≈Ωleb≈Ø. Henry died a year later, and his sons failed to pay off the loan, so they had to sell N√°chod to Jan ≈†petle. After they sold the County of Kladsko in 1501, his descendant were left with only his Silesian possessions. Henry died in 1498 and was buried in the church of the Franciscan monastery of St. George he had founded in Kladsko. In 1558 he and eight of his relatives who had been buried there as well, were reburied in the main church in Kladsko.  Marriage and Issue  In 1467 Henry married in Cheb () with Ursula of Brandenburg, a daughter of the Elector Albert III Achilles of Brandenburg. The marriage produced 8 children: * Albert (1468‚Äì1511), Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels : married in 1487 Princess Salome (1475/76-1514), daughter of Duke John II of ≈ªaga≈Ñ and Gro√üglogau * George (1470‚Äì1502), Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels : married in 1488 Princess Jadwiga (1476‚Äì1524), also a daughter of John II of ≈ªaga≈Ñ * John (23 June 1472 ‚Äì 7 August 1472) * Margaret (1473‚Äì1530) : married in 1494 Prince Ernest of Anhalt-Dessau * Charles (1476‚Äì1536) : ‚àû 1488 Princess Anna (1480/83-1541), also a daughter of John II of ≈ªaga≈Ñ * Louis (21 June 1479 ‚Äì 27 April 1480) * Magdalena (25 January 1482 ‚Äì 11 April 1513) * Sidonie () (3 June 1483 ‚Äì 1522), married in 1515 Ulrich of Hardegg Through Henry's mediation his surviving sons Albert, George and Charles married in 1487 and 1488 with three daughters of Duke John II of Sagan and Gro√üglogau. As Duke of M√ºnsterberg, Henry founded the Silesian branch of the House of Podƒõbrady, which became extinct in the male line in 1647. With the marriage of his sister Ludmilla with Frederick I of Liegnitz on 7 September 1474 Henry created a family connection to the House of Piast. Henry and his wife Ursula were generous sponsors of monasteries. In 1475 they founded the Franciscan Monastery of St. George in Kladsko, which became the home monastery of her family. In 1494 they gave half of the village Polanica to the Augustinian canons in Kladsko.

Death and Legacy  On 22 April 2001, McIntyre and fellow Kerryman and Garda George Rice were in Cork responding to an emergency call when their patrol car when they lost control and collided with a hackney travelling in the opposite direction. Rice (age 45) was a husband and father of three and McIntyre had been engaged at the time of the accident. The case was due to a faulty gearbox and in 2007 the court approved a settlement order for the sum of ‚Ç¨75,000. An annual hurling tournament in his name is played each year between Garda teams from around the country.

He was a devotee of the Tamil god Murugan and composed and wrote poems in his praise. His samadhi is located at Tiruvanmiyur, Chennai.  Early life and education  Pamban Swamigal was born sometime between 1848 and 1850 to a Saivite family in the town of Rameswaram, which then was part of the Ramnad District. He was named AppƒÅvu but later became known as Pamban Swamigal as he had lived and left his family at Pamban Island. A psychic predicted that AppƒÅvu would be great man of words and wisdom. In his school days, AppƒÅvu was very good in his studies and other activities and ranked high in Tamil and English. At the age of thirteen, on a Friday at sunrise AppƒÅvu had a vision and was induced to write poems on Lord KumƒÅraguru, which he wrote immediately on a palm leaf in a facile pen in his coconut estate. He wrote one poem each day before his lunch for 100 days, ending each decad with his manasika guru's name Arunagiri NƒÅthar. After seeing AppƒÅvu's poem, a temple priest named Seddu Madhava Iyer marveled at the young boy's knowledge of Tamil and his faith in Lord Murugan. Later AppƒÅvu was given upadesam on the holy six-letter mantra on Vijaya Dasami day at Agni Tƒ´rtham by the Rameswaram seashore temple and was made to read Sanskrit by Sethu Madhava Iyer.  His experiences with Lord Muruga  Since PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi was interested in the holy life from the early days, his parents and guru Sethu Madhava Iyer were keen to get him married soon in the year 1878. His wife's name was Kalimuthami; they had one son and two daughters. Even after marriage Pamban Swami lived like a saint, mostly doing pujas and prayers. After his father's death PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi took over the family business. He won many legal cases related to his business by the grace of Lord Murugan. One night PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi's daughter was crying due to illness. Her mother requested Pamban Swami to give vibhuti to the crying child but PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi refused to do so and informed his wife to pray to Lord Murugan for help and started his meditation to Lord Murugan. She did as she was told by PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi. After sometime Pamban Swami saw the child was not crying and found her fast asleep. When PƒÅmban SwƒÅmi asked the mother about the change she replied that after her prayer to Lord Murugan, a saintly figure came inside the house and applied vibhuti on the child and went away. From that moment on the child was cured. He felt that Lord Murugan himself came and helped him at their request.  Palani Incident  One day a friend of Pamban Swami informed him that he was going to Palani, the sacred hill temple. Pamban Swami also wanted to go to Palani and left his family life without informing them. When his friend asked if he had permission from his god, Pamban Swami said 'Yes' and lied to his friend. On the same day Lord Palani Murugan appeared before him with a frowning face and said Did I asked you to come there? \\" If I want your presence at the hill I could have done it easily. There is no reason for you to lie. I will call you when the time comes. You may remain there without any attachments.\\" Then He asked Pamban Swami to promise that he would not go to Palani without His permission. To keep his word Pamban Swami never went to Palani till his last days. Pamban Swami also gave up the taste of lime, salt, and hot spices. He used to take plain rice with green dal and ghee. He used to take food only once a day before noon; if he missed the time he would take food the next day only.  Making of Shanmuga Kavacham  In 1891 Pamban Swami wrote Shanmuga Kavacham, a powerful hymn of 30 verses composed for the benefit of Lord Murugan's devotees to protect them from illness of body and mind as well as from foes, wild beasts, poisonous creatures, demons, devils and biting insects. Several instances prove that this Shanmuga Kavacham verses effective in this respect. If you recite it with heart and soul to Lord Murugan, the results will be swift and miraculous.  Making of Panchamirtha varnam  Also in 1891 Pamban Swami composed Panchamrita Varnam. Lord Murugan Himself has said to an old lady in Tiruchendur that \\"I will be present physically wherever the song is sung on a pleasant note.\\" If anyone does puja inside the heart by reciting this poem, it is equal to doing abhisekam and puja. One time Pamban Swami was walking on a rough track and a thorn pricked and pierced into his foot. The terrible pain made Pamban Swami to shed tears and pray to God. On the same night Lord Murugan came in the dream of a cobbler in the next village and informed him to make and give a pair of slippers to Pamban Swami. When Pamban Swami was traveling to the village the next day the shoemaker came with the pair of slippers to Pamban Swami saying that in his dreams Lord Murugan came and had given instructions to make a pair of slippers for him. Pamban Swami was very much pleased and thanked Lord Murugan for his kindness to His devotees. Pamban Swami was once very ill due to diarrhea. Due to this he fainted and fell down and upon seeing this his wife fainted too. Lord Murugan came to their house just then and tapped with a stick, made Pamban Swami's wife get up and said \\"Don't worry. He will be alright. Just smear vibhuti on his body and say 'I will never leave you'.\\" But Pamban Swami's wife was afraid to touch vibhuti as it was her menstrual time. Lord Bala Murugan said to her, \\"There is no prohibition during emergency.\\" She did as she was told. Immediately Pamban Swami was cured. One day someone told Pamban Swami that a poet was writing a song of 100 verses that was incomplete for the last two months. Upon hearing this Pamban Swami decided that he would compose a song similar to that. So he started and finished 125 verses within an hour. To this day no poet or saint has duplicated such a feat. The poem is called Tiruvorumalai Komagan. The first verse of four lines consists of 64 words to each line with total 256 words. Pamban Swami composed the remaining 124 verses without adding any other words. He said with the divine guidance anything is possible.  Visit to Kumarakottam  On his visit to Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, Pamban Swami had failed to visit Kumarakottam, the famous Murugan temple in the town. On his way back Lord Murugan appeared before him in the form of a 30-year-old man with a turban and asked if he had visited Kumarakottam where Kanda Puranam was composed by the temple priest Kanchiappa Sivachariyar. He took Pamban Swami near to the temple and vanished. After the pujas, Pamban Swami was very much delighted by the grace of Lord Kumaran. In the railway station the train was delayed due to some fault as though it was only waiting for Swami and then the train proceeded without delay. In the year 1894 at Peerapan Valasai near Ramanad in Tamil Nadu, Pamban Swami was determined to get upadesam from Lord Kumara Palani Andi himself and from no one else. So he obtained permission from the government officer to dig a pit in the burial ground to the size of 3' x 3' x 3' covered with lock & key for the roof. Before starting meditation he asked his followers to have faith in God. Because this was a burial ground there were a lot of disturbing events that took place. Once a big demon tried to seize Pamban Swami, but by hurling his dandam the demon vanished. On the seventh night a voice commanded Pamban Swami to get up. Pamban Swami replied that unless Lord Palani Andi Himself comes he would not get up, even if he had to die. Once again the voice said, \\"Your Lord has come to see you. Open your eyes.\\" Pamban Swami was delighted to see Lord Murugan in the form of Palani Andi with a dandam in one hand and the other hand in chin mudra accompanied by two rishis. With a smiling countenance Palani Andi came forward and gave a \\"single utterance\\" (oru mozhi) upadesam in Pamban Swami's right ear. After that they turned back, walked towards the west and vanished. Without getting up on hearing that one word Pamban Swami was very much pleased and continued his meditation for 28 days without food, water or sleep. On the 35th day once again a voice was heard and commanded him to \\"Come out of the pit.\\" Once again Pamban Swami replied that only if it is by his Lord he would get out. The voice said \\"Yes it's me.\\" At once Pamban Swami got out of the pit and saw Chitra Poornima full moon in the sky. He had a cloth of one piece cloth like Patanatar or an ƒÅndi. Later his followers requested him to wear two pieces of white cloth one around the waist and the other over his shoulder. Pamban Swami was content to remain in silence but others wanted him to speak of his experience. Even today the oil lamp that Pamban Swami used in the pit is preserved in Ramanad town by Pamban Swami's followers. In 1895 Pamban Swami took sannyasa and left Pamban village. One day Lord Murugan appeared in his dream and asked him to proceed to Madras. But he accepted the command of his Lord and proceeded to Madras by train.  Madras Trip  On his arrival at Egmore railway station in Madras a cartman came to Pamban Swami and requested Pamban Swami to sit in his cart. Without saying anything Pamban Swami sat in the jatka. The cartman took Pamban Swami to St. George Town to house number 41 Vaithiyanath Mudali Street. Pamban Swami got down from the jatka and in front of him an old lady Mrs. Bangaru Ammal came to Pamban Swami and told him that in a dream the previous night Lord Murugan had said that a saint would come to her house and that she should provide him with food and accommodation. And Pamban Swami accepted her invitation and stayed there for some time.  Making of Thagaralaya Rahasiyam  In the year 1896 Pamban Swami went to Chidambaram and wrote an upanishad known as Thagaralaya Rahasiyam. Lord Guha lives in every heart in a tiny light form. Pamban Swami gives examples from the Vedas, agamas, upanishads, Tevaram, Tiruppukazh and other scriptural sources. Pamban Swami also wrote two books known as Tiropa and Paripuranat B≈´than. In this book, Pamban Swami provides quotations from all the 108 upanishads. Pamban Swami is the only saint who has composed 50 poems on Lord Murugan in pure Tamil without any words from other language due to his love on Tamil. Pamban Swami once said that any one who speaks ill of Sanskrit or Tamil is his enemy. The two sacred language are like two eyes. You cannot have one and despise the other if you want full knowledge of the spiritual world. On Pamban Swami's visit to Varanasi, he stayed at KumƒÅra Guruparar Mutt. Pamban Swami wrote that he was very happy to stay at this famous mutt. The head of the mutt once offered kavi cloth by taking away his white dress and requested Pamban Swami to wear it. Pamban Swami at first hesitated but upon reflection Pamban Swami took it as God's wish from that day to wear two-piece kavi dress. Once on a Shasti P≈´ja when Pamban Swami was present, the devotees had cooked rice for one hundred. But the one rice pot kept giving rice enough to feed nearly 400 people. So much was the demand that the other foods like vegetables, sambar and rasam had to be prepared three times, but the cooked rice never got emptied. Such miracles were commonplace in the life of Pamban Swami. While in Madras, Pamban Swami had a premonition of his mother's death and his elder son's death. Before the telegram came Pamban Swami gave instruction for no one to disturb him because he is a sannyƒÅsi, a man without family or bindings.  Fracture Cure  In December 1923 Pamban Swami had an accident at Thumbu Chetty Street in Madras. Pamban Swami was run over by a jatka and his left ankle was broken. He was admitted to the General Hospital. The doctors who attended upon Pamban Swami's leg said it would have to be amputated. Pamban Swami was only praying and said \\"Let them do what they want do.\\" On hearing the news only Chinaswami Jothidar had extraordinary faith in Pamban Swami's poem Shanmuga Kavacham and started to recite it. Chinnaswamy Jothidar had a vision of the Vel entering Pamban Swami's broken ankle. Miraculously the leg was cured in the hospital. Even British doctors were astonished and described it as divine grace. On the 11th day Pamban Swami saw two peacocks dance before him and also saw Lord Murugan in an infant form lying next to his bed. In remembering the day Pamban Swami told his followers of the Maha Tejo Mandal Sabhai to believe in Lord Murugan and to do May≈´ravahana Sevana VizhƒÅ without fail, which is still done annually at his temple in Thiruvanmiyur. Pamban Swami's life proves this- \\"Vƒìlum Mayilum Thunai\\" is a not just a saying; it really helps sincere devotees in need. One day Pamban Swami called Chinaswami Jothidar to look for land in Tiruvanmiyur as his last days were near. Pamban Swami marked the floor corners with his leg all arrangements were made to for that portion of land to be purchased. On 30 May 1929 at 7:15 am Pamban Swami called his followers and advised them to believe in Lord Murugan. Then he took a deep breath, held it inside his stomach and entered samƒÅdhi state. Pamban Swamigal was a believer one God that is Siva the Para Brahman and Subrahmanya is part of Siva and comes from Siva. He clarifies this in his book Subrahmanya Veyasam. Pamban Swami got the name \\"Kumara Guru DƒÅsa SwƒÅmigal\\" because of his deep love for Palani Murugan. His Sanskrit teacher named him as Kumara Guru and also as PƒÅmban SwƒÅmigal because Swami lived and left his family at PƒÅmban Island. Pamban Swami's full name is Adhyaasrama Suddha Vaidheega Saiva Siddhantha GnanabƒÅnu, which means Pamban Swami is full of sayasi. He was a sanyasi who followed the suddha advaita in the Vaideha way of Saiva Siddhanta in the DƒÅsa Marga. In his lifetime Pamban Swami wrote 6,666 poems, 32 viyasams and 1000 names of Lord Murugan. By reading his GnƒÅnam≈´rtham hymn one will benefit in both worlds. He composed poems on Lord Kumara in more than 130 different forms as per Tamil grammar. Pamban Swami always liked to do silent AkƒÅ P≈´ja rather than audible p≈´ja.

It also gave authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the administration of bankruptcy filings. One effect was to remove investment banks from control of the corporate reorganization process by eliminating the equity receivership technique. Instead, a trustee was appointed by the bankruptcy court to oversee the reorganization process. The Bankruptcy Act, though now superseded by the Bankruptcy Code, remains an important interpretive tool for current bankruptcy law. Several United States Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the Bankruptcy Code by looking back to the history of the Chandler Act. Some of the most notable decisions include: * United States v.

Inheritance As the Ottoman Empire conquered new territories, it adopted and adapted the existing tax systems already used by the previous governments. For instance, at the conquest of Belgrade, the Sultan instructed an official to gather information on the pre-conquest tax system, which would be replicated post-conquest. At the start of each area's tahrir (a tax ledger) was an outline of the traditional tax laws in that area. This led to a complex patchwork of different taxes in different parts of the empire, and between different communities. In the Fertile crescent, the Ottomans inherited muqasama (sharing), a proportional tax on agricultural output, from the Mamluks; it was distinctly different from the uniform tax rates in other newly conquered territories. As farmers reacted to locally varying taxes on different farm products, this increased variations in agricultural output between areas, or even between villages; farms subject to the highest taxes switched to alternative crops. Discriminatory rates tend to lead to production inefficiencies. Defter The defter was a tax register. It recorded names and property/land ownership; it categorised households, and sometimes whole villages, by religion. The names recorded in a defter can give valuable information about ethnic background; these tax records are a valuable source for current-day historians investigating the ethnic & religious history of parts of the Ottoman Empire.Malcolm, pp. 42, 52‚Äì53 The Ottoman double-entry accounting method, merdiban, was inherited from the Abbasid empire. Feudal estates The primary role of the Timar system was to collect feudal obligations, before cash taxes became dominant. The Ottoman Empire had a hierarchy of different types of estate; a Hass was larger than a Zaim estate, which in turn was larger than a timar. In the Balkans, peasants on timars typically paid a tithe or a tax in kind, of around 10‚Äì25% of their farm produce; they were also obliged to pay other charges and perform corvee for the landlord, although these obligations may have been a lighter burden than in some contemporary Western European states.Malcolm, p. 47 This system closely resembles the medieval Serb feudal system, which in turn inherited from the Byzantine.Malcolm, p. 51 A patchwork of different communities and taxes A treaty from 1536, granting concessions to the French across the whole of the Ottoman Empire As well as regional variation, there were different taxes applied to different religious and ethnic groups; Muslims paid resm-i √ßift whilst non-Muslims paid ƒ∞spen√ße. These taxes might be further graduated according to people's ability to pay. In 1530, the Eyalet of Rumelia had graduated taxes even between different religious subsets of a small ethnic minority; Muslim Romani paid 22 aspers per household, nonmuslim paid 25.Malcolm, p. 115 In some cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion;Malcolm, p. 165 conversely, measures might be taken at other times to prevent conversion, in order to prop up tax revenues. There was a practice of making villages communally responsible for the hara√ß tax; if one villager fled (or converted to Islam), the others would have to pay more.Malcolm, p. 118 In good years, community pressure would ensure compliance; but in bad years the difficulty of paying a share of other people's taxes could lead to a vicious circle, as more taxpayers fled: In the Balkans, Vlachs had tax concessions under Byzantine and Serb rulers in return for military service, and this continued under Ottoman rule.Malcolm, p. 78 There was a special vlach tax, rusum-e eflak: one sheep and one lamb from each household on St Georges day each year. Because Vlachs were taxed differently, they were listed differently in defters.Malcolm, p. 79 There could be considerable regional variance, and local lords might try to line their own pockets; around 1718 the kadi of Janjevo complained to the Porte that the local lord had set ƒ∞spen√ße at 80 ak√ßes, rather than the official rate of 32 ak√ßes. There was also a patchwork of tax exemptions called muafiyet, which might be applied to towns, social groups, or even individuals. Church taxation Orthodox churches were allowed to raise taxes among their communities; this led to a position where priests would pay very large amounts‚Äîto both church superiors and Ottoman officials‚Äîto get a senior post, expecting that the cost could be amply recouped from tithes. Sometimes, the \\"taxation\\" of churches by the Ottoman authorities could be shockingly direct: in 1603 Franciscan friars in Bosnia were imprisoned until they paid an arbitrary fee of 3000 aspers for permission to stay in their monasteries.Malcolm, p. 56 Waqufs Waqfs were, in one sense, a form of tax avoidance; a perpetual trust which was not, itself, taxed. However, some were very well-endowed, and provided various local services such as education which compensated for the Ottoman government's inability to provide local services funded by taxation. Some became so powerful that whole towns developed around the social services they provided; there are towns in the Balkans which include the name \\"Vakuf\\". A well-endowed vakuf might even take on the role of helping a community pay their annual tax obligations. Conflict Taxes were often difficult to collect, especially from rebellious areas. Conversely, high taxes could often provoke rebellion. The demand for taxes was higher during times of war; these factors together could provoke a vicious circle of taxation and rebellionMacolm: \\"As usual in times of war, new Ottoman taxes had been imposed and bread prices had soared; the Catholics of Janjevo had seriously considered fleeing from Kosovo altogether in 1683, and a tax register for the Vu√ßit√´rn district in 1686 lists one third of the previous year's cizye-payers as fugitives ‚Äì in 1585, 2000 villagers near Debar revolted over an increase in cizye. The Ottoman state went bankrupt in 1590; this led to economic collapse and several years of revolts across the empire. Complexity and reform A receipt for cizye (poll-tax) paid by the village of Chokmanovo. In 17th‚Äì18th century, changes in warfare (favouring professional infantry over feudal cavalry) put more emphasis on taxes rather than on military duties; hence, when timars fell vacant they were taken over by the state and converted into tax-farms and private estates.Malcolm, p. 83 Avariz, a centralised cash tax, became the norm rather than an exception.avariz-i divaniye (Ottoman tax) ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-20. There was a shift towards fully owned hereditary estates rather than feudal lords; ciftlik were preferred to timar, because tenants had fewer rights ‚Äì hence more cash could be extracted from them.Malcolm, p. 93 The Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane declared the equality of different ethnic and religious groups ‚Äì abolishing the Kanun-i Raya ‚Äì and reformed taxes. However, not all these changes percolated to the outer areas of empire.Malcolm, p. 123 In Bosnia, hara√ß was not abolished until 1855, at the same time that Christians were permitted to serve as soldiers; however, a new charge in lieu of military service appeared and was levied to hara√ß, so the only real change was a tax increase on those Muslims not serving in the military.Malcolm, p. 125 An 1859 decree set a tax-in-kind of one third for peasants on Agaluk (formerly Timar) estates, which became known locally as \\"tretina\\". This was in addition to a state tithe set at 10% of crop value. Other charges would push the total tax burden over 40% ‚Äì all this in a state which could not provide the social benefits that are offered in modern countries with similarly high tax rates. In 1839, Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I pushed a set of major new reforms to the tax system, including the abolition of tax- farming.Malcolm, p. 185 The Tanzimat reforms introduced a new income tax; they also did away with many of the complex old taxes, although cizye remained. Taxation on corporate profits, in the modern sense, only really became possible after a cadastral survey in 1858‚Äì1860; the temettu (profit tax) was set at 3% in 1860, and later raised to 4% in 1878. The Tanzimat reforms The two most important sources of tax revenue were the zakat, which taxed commodities and land (and similar taxes like the aƒünam resmi, a tax on sheep) and the cizye tax that was paid by Christian and Jewish subjects. The restructuring of the tax system was a central goal of the Tanzimat (\\"ordering\\") reforms, even though practical implementation remained limited. The reform policies were proclaimed in the 1839 Edict of G√ºlhane and the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 that lead up to the Ottoman constitution of 1876. Faced with the economic, military, and technological superiority of the Western European powers and Russia, the Sublime Porte aimed to centralize and strengthen the administration, while granting formal legal equality and self- administration rights to the members of the Millet confessional communities. In this context, a central goal of the reforms was to expand the tax base and reorganize tax collection, in order to increase government revenue and cover the growing military costs. Despite the efforts at reform, however, increases in tax revenue did not match the growing expenditure, so that the government more and more had to rely on foreign loans. Also, the rural population had to suffer a high tax burden as the government was trying to reduce the budget deficit. Among the taxes levied were property and military service exemption taxes as well as tithes. The latter were usually collected by private persons who were authorized by the government to do so.√ñzbek, p.776 This often lead to conflicts as, according to contemporary reports, the tax collectors abused their powers and exerted violence on the population.√ñzbek, p.786 In addition, an excise tax (M√ºskirat resmi) was charged on the manufacture of wine and spirits. This affected only non-Muslim groups, as Muslims were not allowed to consume and produce alcohol. Another problem that came up with the reforms was that of double taxation. For instance, Armenians in the Anatolian provinces traditionally paid protection taxes to local notables and tribesmen, most of them Kurds. This practice did not vanish as the government extended its fiscal reach into the provinces. As a consequence, the Armenians suffered from a double tax burden, as well as from forceful tax collection practices and other acts of violence.√ñzbek, p.792 Another key aspect of the tax reforms was the abolition of the Iltizam tax farming system, which had been implemented in the Arab provinces, with the Reform Edict of 1856. The system, however, remained in place in various forms and regions until the twentieth century. All in all, it must be mentioned that taxation practices and the degree of reform implementation varied considerably from province to province, so that generalizations must be avoided.

The Paleo-Indian site dates to an estimated 8000‚Äì6500 B.C. and provides evidence for bison hunting, using a game drive system, long before the use of the bow and arrow or horses.Wheat, J.B. (1967). \\"A Paleo-Indian bison kill\\". Scientific American 216 (1): 44‚Äì53. The site was named Olsen‚ÄìChubbuck after the amateur archaeologists who discovered the bone bed, Sigurd Olsen and Gerald Chubbuck. The Olsen‚ÄìChubbuck site was excavated between 1958 and 1960 by Joe Ben Wheat, an anthropologist employed through the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.Wheat, J.B. (1972). \\"The Olsen-Chubbuck site: a paleo-Indian bison kill\\". Memoirs of the Society for American Archaeology 26. The site contains a bone-bed of almost 200 bison that were killed and processed by Paleo-Indian hunters.  Bison  Following the extinction of megafauna such as mammoth in the late Pleistocene, Bison became the most important game for native Paleo-Indians for food and many other uses, including use of hides for clothing and shelter. Bison, relying on their sense of smell, traveled in search of food in herds of 50 to 300. Their poor eyesight allowed hunters to use a game drive system, in which they would get close to the herd, scare them and cause them to stampede into bison jumps or arroyo traps. Discovery The Olsen‚ÄìChubbuck was first discovered by Gerald Chubbuck, a young archaeologist, in 1957 when he came across several Scottsbluff projectile points and five separate piles of bones at the northernmost area of the Arkansas River valley. He notified the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History of his discovery and performed an initial excavation.  Excavation  Located in a dry gulch, or arroyo, the excavation dig was in an irregularly shaped area up to wide, long and deep. Nearly 200 Bison occidentalis were found in a section long. =Chubbuck and Olsen= With Sigurd Olsen, another amateur archaeologist, Chubbuck excavated the bones of about 50 bison in of the site in 1957. =Joe Ben Wheat, University of Colorado Museum= By the spring of 1958, the University of Colorado Museum was granted permission to excavate by the owner of the land, Paul Forward, and Chubbuck and Olsen. The excavations were led by Joe Ben Wheat between 1958 and 1960. Wheat and his team uncovered 143 more skeletal remains. The total number of bison found included 16 calves, 27 immature bulls, 38 immature cows, 46 adult bulls, and 63 adult cows. Wheat's careful and detailed descriptions of the arroyo drive, kill site, butchering process, and consumption estimates set a standard for excavation of Paleo-Indian sites and won national attention.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 83‚Äì84, 91. . = Theory about the stampede = From the positioning of the 190 Bison occidentalis skeleton bones, it was found that they were stampeded by the hunters into the arroyo. The animals that plunged first were killed from the fall and their remains were contorted, with twisted spines, and covered by following bison from the stampede. The bison were theorized to have run in a north-south direction with the hunters upwind of the southerly wind. The presence of 16 nearly newborn calves means the kill was likely in late May or early July. The arroyo drive to cause the mass killing would have required significant \\"cooperative planning\\".Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. p. 195. . = Butchering = The site contained 3 distinct layers of bison remains: 1) the bottom layer held skeletons of 13 untouched bison, 2) the middle contained nearly complete, or only partially butchered, skeletal remains and 3) the top layer had butchered single bones and articulated bison skeletal segments. The top layer illustrated that as the Paleo-Indians methodically removed the meat from the bones they placed them in separate piles or units that contained the skeletal remains from a number of animals. The butchering process was similar, but much more methodical, to that of modern Plains Indians. Positioning the Bison occidentalis bones for butchering would have required a great deal of manual effort. The Olsen-Chubbuck hunters ate the tongues of the bison as they worked, given the isolated occurrences of tongue bone in the piles. It would have likely taken half a day for 100 people to butcher the bison. = Consumption = The amount of edible meat for each bison is: 50 pounds for a young calf, 165 for an immature male, 110 pounds for an immature female, 550 pounds for an adult male, and 400 for an adult female. Based on the number of skeletal remains, it is estimated that the hunters obtained 56,640 pounds of meat, and a significant amount of edible mass in the form of fat and internal organs from the bison. Knowing that fresh meat is only good for about a month and assuming that a third of the meat was dried, the archaeologists estimated that the band would need to have about 150 adults and children to consume the remaining two thirds of the fresh meat from this kill in that time. Meat was likely dried for preservation, with 20 pounds of dried meat yielded from 100 pounds of fresh meat. It is thought Paleo-Indians may have preserved butchered neck meat into pemmican, dried meat pounded into a powder, like later Plains Indians who found bison neck meat tough to eat. = Artifacts = 27 projectile points were found at the site, 21 of which were complete or almost whole. The points included Scottsbluff and Eden lanceolate points and Milnesand points.First View points. Retrieved 1 April 2011. Other artifacts were also found at the Olsen-Chubbuck kill site, including: * 1 bifacial flaked knife and 1 Alibates knife * 1 side-scraper and 3 end-scrapers * 2 utilized flakes and 3 resharpening flakes * 1 hammer/anvil stone * 3 small stones, 1 limonite pebble, and 4 cut, notched or polished bones.  Cody complex  The Olsen‚ÄìChubbock site is a Cody complex site, a Plano culture that existed 9,000 to 7,000 years ago in the Plains.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archaeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. p. 82. . Many of the artifacts were similar to the set of tools used by the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition, such as knives, stone scrapers and bone ornaments and needles. The Scottsbluff and Eden points, dated about 6,500 B.C. are of the Cody culture.

In 1964 he began a long and influential teaching career at Carnegie Mellon University. In the 1970s Demarest's research on the social novel of Western Pennsylvania led to the publication of a pioneering anthology, From These Hills, From These Valleys, and the re-publication in 1976 of Out of This Furnace by Thomas Bell, an overlooked 1941 proletarian novel of the American steel industry that became a bestseller for the University of Pittsburgh Press. Demarest's play \\"Gift To America\\" brought attention in the 1980s to the Croatian-American artist Maxo Vanka and his Millvale Murals at St. Nicholas Croatian Church. In the 1990s Demarest's work to document and preserve industrial landscapes resulted in a book and film commemorating the centennial of the Homestead Strike of 1892 and the historic restoration of the Pump House of the Homestead Steel Works, where agents of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency attempted to land their barges and re-take control of the mill for Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick from the locked-out workers.

The meteorite fell in the afternoon, hitting the ground around 3:35 pm. Although there were reports that sound generated as the object travelled through the Earth's atmosphere was heard in some areas of Yorkshire, the meteorite was unusual in that the sonic boom that would normally be associated with a meteorite entering the atmosphere was not heard by anyone who witnessed the fall, nor were there were any reports of either a fireball or smoke trail. The site of the impact was at the railway siding Pennymans's Siding, close to the site of the now demolished St. Luke's Hospital (now Roseberry Park). The impact was witnessed by workmen only yards away, who heard a \\"rushing or roaring\\" sound followed by thud, as the meteorite hit a nearby embankment, leaving a hole described by the astronomer Alexander Herschel as a \\"round vertical hole into which a man's arm might be thrust\\". The meteorite had penetrated to a depth of about 30 cm and was described as \\"new milk warm\\" to the touch by the workmen when they retrieved the object. Herschel, who was then Professor of Physics and Experimental Sciences at Durham College of Physical Science in Newcastle upon Tyne, rushed to Middlesbrough on hearing the news to supervise the recovery and examination of the meteorite. By experimentation, replicating the conditions of the impact, he determined the speed of the object at the time was 412 feet per second (281 mph). This result was viewed as partial confirmation of a theory of the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli that meteorites lost most of their cosmic velocity (the velocity they had before entering the Earth's atmosphere), due to air resistance at a high altitude in the atmosphere. The Middlesbrough meteorite is classified as a chondrite. It is approximately 4,500 billion years old and was formed at the same time as the Earth and the solar system. It is approximately 6 inches in diameter, weighs 3 pounds 8.75 ounces (approximately 1.5 kg) and has a crust of unusual thickness - it was recovered in one piece. A 3D scan of the object was made by NASA scientists in 2010. Due to Middlesbrough not having a museum at the time of its fall to Earth, the meteorite was handed over to the Yorkshire Museum where it has been ever since. In March 2011, the 130th anniversary of its fall to Earth, it was lent to the town's Dorman Museum where it was put on display for several weeks.

It is based on sketches made during Bierstadt's travels with Frederick W. Lander's Honey Road Survey Party in 1859. The painting shows Lander's Peak in the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains, with an encampment of Native Americans in the foreground. It has been compared to, and exhibited with, The Heart of the Andes by Frederic Edwin Church. Lander's Peak immediately became a critical and popular success and sold in 1865 for $25,000. Background Hudson River School landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (1830‚Äì1902) was born in Germany, and, though his family moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, when he was two, he spent many of his formative years in Europe. He made his debut in an 1858 exhibition, but his breakthrough came in the aftermath of a journey he made the following year. In the spring of 1859, Bierstadt joined the Honey Road Survey Party led by then-colonel Frederick W. Lander.Hendricks (1964), pp. 333‚Äì9. He traveled as far as the Wind River Range in the Rocky Mountains, and made studies for numerous paintings along the way.Hendricks (1964), p. 338. Bierstadt was greatly impressed by the landscape he encountered, and described the Rocky Mountains as \\"the best material for the artist in the world.\\"Hine & Faragher (2007), p. 196. He had a habit of doing extensive preparation for his work, on occasion making as many as fifty sketches for a single painting.Mayer & Myers (1999), p. 61. In 1860, he exhibited Base of the Rocky Mountains, Laramie Peak at the National Academy of Design. His greatest success, however, came with The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak, which he exhibited in 1863 at the Tenth Street Studio Building, where he also had a studio.Houston & Houston (1999), p. 69. Composition and theme The painting shows Lander's Peak, a mountain with a summit of in the Wind River Range in modern-day Wyoming. The peak was named after Frederick W. Lander on Bierstadt's initiative, after Lander's death in the Civil War. In one description of the painting, \\"Sharply pointed granite peaks and fantastically illuminated clouds float above a tranquil, wooded genre scene.\\"Hyde (1993), p. 368. The foreground is dominated by the campsite of a tribe of Native Americans. The landscape in the painting is not the actual landscape as it appears at Lander's Peak, but rather an ideal landscape based on nature, altered by Bierstadt for dramatic effect. Bierstadt's painting hit a nerve with contemporary Americans, by portraying the grandeur and pristine beauty of the nation's western wilderness. It was a reference to the idea of Manifest Destiny, where the Rocky Mountains represented both natural beauty, and an obstacle to westward expansion.Facos (2011), p. 138. In the words of historian Anne F. Hyde: \\"Bierstadt painted the West as Americans hoped it would be, which made his paintings vastly popular and reinforced the perception of the West as either Europe or sublime Eden.\\" At the same time, the Native Americans in the foreground gave the scene authenticity, and presented it as a timeless place, untouched by European hands.Miller (2001), pp. 46‚Äì7.  Depiction of Shoshone Peoples  At the forefront of the painting, Bierstadt paints a band of Shoshone Native peoples. According to a review in Harper's Weekly from March 26, 1864, Lander's Peak, \\"is purely an American scene, and from the faithful and elaborate delineation of the Indian village, a form of life now rapidly disappearing from the earth, may be called a historic landscape.\\" Bierstadt illustrated Shoshone people along with the majestic peaks as a marker of the \\"sublime\\" which authors like James Fenimore Cooper, John C. Fr√©mont, and Washington Irving wrote about. Bierstadt does not include who these people are in his painting title. Unlike Catlin, Bierstadt focused not on the individuality of members of the Shoshone people, rather, his focus was on their relationship with landscape. As Bierstadt scholar Matthew Biagell suggests, as \\"He placed them, as he placed European peasants in earlier works, in the middle distance so that we witness their presence in a landscape setting rather than focus on their movements.\\" In 1859, Eastern Shoshone peoples lived in the region now called Western Wyoming. Bierstadt commented on the Shoshone people he saw in a letter from July 10, 1859 which The Crayon, an art magazine, published in September 1859. \\"The manners and customs of the Indians are still as they were hundreds of years ago, and now is the time to paint them, for they are rapidly passing away, and soon will be known only in history. I think that the artist ought to tell his portion of their history as well as the writer; a combination of both will assuredly render it more complete\\" Bierstadt adds, \\"We have a great many Indian subjects. We were quite fortunate in getting them, the natives not being very willing to have the brass tube pointed at them. Of course they were astonished when we showed them the pictures they did not sit for; and the best we have taken have been obtained without the knowledge of the parties, which is, in fact the best way to take any portrait\\" The Shoshone people are depicted on a similar level as the nature of the image, and Biertstadt is attempting to capture an image of them and the Rockies, something which he believes must be preserved as a part of history. Reception Lander's Peak has often been compared to Frederic Edwin Church's The Heart of the Andes Lander's Peak was an immediate success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter as well as a gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour.Wolf (1992), pp. 433‚Äì4. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class.Wolf (1992), p. 434. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for $25,000, the most paid for an American painting to that point. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907. Comparisons were made between Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes, a contemporary painting by one of Bierstadt's main rivals in the landscape genre, Frederic Edwin Church. The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the United States Sanitary Commission to raise money for the Union war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other.Miller (2001), p. 46. Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes are still exhibited on opposite walls at their current location at the Metropolitan.Houston & Houston (1999), p. 70. Most reviews of the painting were positive; one review called it \\"beyond question one of the finest landscapes ever painted in this country\\", adding, \\"Its artistic merits are in some respects unrivalled: and added to these it has the advantage of being a representative painting of a portion of the most sublime and beautiful scenery on the American Continent.\\"Houston & Houston (1999), pp. 69‚Äì70. The painting won a prize at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American Pre- Raphaelites found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained that it would have been better \\"if the marks of the brush had, by dexterous handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as it is, we have only too little geology and too much bristle.\\"Mayer & Myers (1999), p. 62.

He is an exponent of so-called \\"deep soul\\" and is considered one of the best kept secrets of soul music.  Life  Wiggins was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where he grew up encouraged by his parents to engage with music, especially gospel; his mother sang in the choir of the Baptist Church where she attended services. He lived in the same area as singers James Carr and Bobby Bland. While at Booker T. Washington High School, he formed a gospel group with his brother Percy and sister Maxine and, on leaving school, formed an R&B; group, the Four Stars, that included his brother Percy and David Porter, later to become a leading songwriter and record producer. Biography by Mark Deming at Allmusic.com. Retrieved April 27, 2013 In the early 1960s, he began singing in clubs in Memphis, where he was discovered by Quinton Claunch, head of Goldwax Records. In 1964 Wiggins recorded his first single, \\"Lover's Crime\\", produced by Claunch, for the label, though his early recordings were licensed for release through the sub-label Bandstand USA. The recording was followed by eight further singles, but none became a hit. His recordings for Goldwax included \\"Uptight Good Woman\\", written by Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham, and \\"I Never Loved A Woman (The Way I Love You)\\", recorded at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals with guitar by Duane Allman. In 1969, after Goldwax collapsed, Wiggins went on to Fame Records, where he recorded two more singles, including \\"Double Lovin'\\", which reached no.44 on the Billboard R&B; chart in 1970. However, other singles for Fame, and for the Pama and Vivid Sound labels, were unsuccessful. In 1973 Wiggins left Memphis, married, and moved to Miami, Florida, where he became active in the Baptist church and in gospel music. He became a deacon and choir director at the New Birth Baptist Church in Miami, and worked with a number of gospel choirs. He has since released gospel recordings, including Keys to the Kingdom released by Tavette Records in 2003.

His birthdate is unknown but is presumably before 1330. His death date fell between July 28 and August 21, 1397.Letter from the Archbishop of Santiago to the prior of Caaveiro, where he counts the knight as dead on 21 August The fourth son of Ruy Freyre de Andrade and In√©s Rodriguez de Sotomayor, he belonged to a family associated with the knights of the Orden de la Banda (Order of the Sash) since its founding by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1332. He was married to Sancha Rodr√≠guez,The author Jose A. Garcia Ledo adds a previous wife, before Sancha, called Tareyga de Guzman, but she doesn't show in any document as such daughter of Aras Pardo and Tareyga Affonso, and with whom he was known to have had two daughters, Maria and In√©s Fern√°ndez, nuns of the Order of Saint Clare, and a son (whose name is unconfirmed, though some sources mention Nu√±o) who died at an early age, leaving the family without a direct male heir.His nephew Don Pedro Fern√°ndez, son of his brother Don Juan Freyre de Andrade, inherited the notorious family state Pires de Andrade was a knight always ready for battle who enjoyed hunting, poetry and chivalric books, as befitted the tastes of those days. He was a sponsor and protector of the Catholic Church, though it is well documented that he usurped the Church's properties, and abused his power in his domains when it suited him. He sided with Henry II of Castile {Enrique de Trast√°mara} in Henry's confrontation with his half-brother Peter in the last years of the feud, until Henry's assassination in Monteil. After the king's death, and the accession of Henry II to the throne, Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade continued to be influential with the monarchy and reached the status of a Lord in Galicia. left Andrade \\"Andrade\\" seems to be an old toponym of Celtic origin, according to D. Isidro Mill√°n, but it is unknown if it referred to a village or a parish. The name of the place was incorporated into the family name, and the name is mentioned in several documents dating from the twelfth century. It is possible that this name was used by unrelated individuals or families residing in the area, as is common today. The first documented Andrades were vassals of the Traba family, along with some other hidalgo family. They remained in the background of the social scene until the fourteenth century, when their influence in the areas of Ferrol, Vilalba and Pontedeume increased to the point of becoming of the most powerful Galician family of the time. With Don Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade o B√≥o (o Boo meaning \\"the Good\\" in Galician language) - the fourth to have that name - the family achieved greater importance during the reign of Henry II. Their successor descendants continued this increase, being Fernando de Andrade (1477‚Äì1540) the one to achieve Count status, as the first Conde de Andrade; the second title of count of Vilalba, Count of Andrade is currently in possession of the House of Alba. Most genealogies compiled during the 19th and 20th century connect the Andrades to the most important families as Fr√≥ilaz- Traba; these are, however, only weak connections, and are contradictory or obscure connections, as yet unconfirmed. To further muddy the water, there are several legendary stories relating the Andrades to the knights that reached the Iberian Peninsula in the retinue of Mendo de Rausona, brother of the last Lombard king, around the eighth century. Castle of Andrade Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade, knightly atmosphere and loyalty to Pedro I Fern√°n Perez de Andrade IV descended from a family of hidalgos and knights, vassals of a lord whom they served with arms. This family environment certainly influenced Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade; he was always ready for battle, but had a cautious and observing character in tumultuous times, with minimal romanticism. Two of his grandfather's brothers, Pedro and Fernan (the third) Perez de Andrade, were put to death in the Castillo de la Rocha in 1320; this demonstrated to the young Fern√°n how those were times in which it might be prudent to put caution aside and move swiftly to align oneself with the stronger parties. The Andrades were lords of a small estate, and, as most of the lords in the peninsula, aspired to broaden their domains and promote their lineage in the service of their overlord, Don Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro. Alfonso XI, an enthusiast of the chivalric code, fostered knights as pillars of his society, considering it necessary to bring order to his realm, and honour (and praise) to his subjects. As a result of this belief, he created the Orden de la Banda‚Äîfirst secular order of the West‚Äîand reinstated the practice of investiture of Knights, creating them himself by drawing on the vassals of his kingdom. Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro invested thirteen of his vassals as Knights of the Orden de la Banda on September 10, 1332. Among them were Nu√±o and Rui Freyre de Andrade, uncle and father of Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade (IV). (Libro de Ordenamiento de Banda-Cr√≥nica de Alfonso XI). Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade, listed as squire in several documents of this time, obtained his first concessions in 1356 from the hands of Henry, by then Count of Trast√°mara. He was married to Sancha Rodr√≠guez, only legitimate daughter of Aras Pardo, who was also knight of the Orden de la Banda, which augmented his social status. This served as the beginning of his career, which had been hindered by his partisan support for Henry against Henry's half-brother, Peter I, for the throne. In the beginning of the war between the brothers, circumstances were confusing and unclear. Many knights sided for the mutinous, and Fern√°n P√©rez seems to be one of them, following the allegiances of his natural overlord, Don Fernando Ru√≠z de Castro, who sided against Peter since the early stages of the confrontation. Later, Fernando Ru√≠z de Castro switched allegiance to King Peter. Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade's fate is unclear, although Henry's exile between 1356 and 1566 makes it unlikely that Fern√°n supported Henry wholly. While Fern√°n P√©rez fought beside King Peter in his campaign against Aragon in 1357, some authors cite his support for Henry, although Henry had fled to Asturias from Ferrol in 1356. During the years leading up to 1362, Fern√°n P√©rez achieved considerable wealth, largely due to inheritances from his family, lands and other mercies received from Henry, Count of Trast√°mara, and his marriage with Sancha. He also obtained an important privilegePrivilege of Murviedo, thru which he receives the villages of Pontedeume and Vilalba from King Peter in 1364, which increased his estates considerably, therefore strengthening his feudal power. Change of loyalty and the events of Montiel Fern√°n P√©rez later sided with Enrique, Peter seeming to have lost the war. Fernan probably fought by Henry's side previously in the Battle of N√°jera in 1367 but few accounts remain of his achievements or of the battle's aftermath. Two years later, on the night of 22 or 23 March 1369, King Peter died in Montiel, in an act of treachery by his half-brother Henry. Several knights were involved, possibly including Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade though this cannot be demonstrated. Henry's troops marched alongside those of Bertrand du Guesclin, French knight and leader of the free companies (Compa√±√≠as Blancas) which arrived from France. The besieged King Henry tried to negotiate his escape with Bertrand du Guesclin, and escorted by two of his men, went to the tent of the Frenchman, where Henry happened to be. It is not certain whether it was Bertrand himself who called Henry, or it was another knight that learned Henry was trying to flee the scene of the siege. Whatever the reason for Henry's presence in Bertrand's tent, Henry and Peter engaged in hand to hand combat. Some authors say one of the knights present helped Henry by restraining Peter, but it seems unlikely that Bertrand du Guesclin was involved in this murder beyond the fact that it happened in his tent, as his reputation for bravery and honour had been proven in the past and assisting in Peter's death would be inconsistent with this. Several sayBartolome Sagrario Molina y Frey Felipe de Gandara that the treacherous restraint of Peter, meant to be involved in one to one fight, inspired the well-known quote in Spain (\\"I'm not deposing nor proposing a King, but I am helping my lord\\") is more in line with Fern√°n P√©rez's attitude, than with that of Bertrand du Guesclin, whose \\"my lord\\" wouldn't help Henry, but rather the King of France. All the copious endowments and benefits enjoyed by Fern√°n after the death of king Peter, could very well be in payment for the well timed help inside the tent. Regardless of the lack of irrefutable proof of the level of Fern√°n's involvement in King Peter's death, documents of the time would seem to indicate his guilty remorse, which might indicate proof of this. Social progress and new fights Subsequently, Fern√°n P√©rez acted as a great lord, and it is likely that he was a knight at this time, probably having been knighted between 1369 and 1371. He began constructing the Castle of Nogueirosa, confronting the prior of the monastery of Sobrado to whom the lands surrounding the castle belonged. Fern√°n P√©rez acted without scruples, inspiring gear according to the chronicles, and letting his violent character show. He permanently abandoned the pre-existing family castle to rule his domain from the new Castle of Nogueirosa. The wars had not ended Galicia. After Henry (Henry II of Castile) rose to the throne, several \\"petristas\\", or knights favouring Peter, offered the throne to Fernando de Portugal. The old petrista Fernando Ruiz de Castro is reported as the instigator behind this, as his enmity towards Henry continued even after Peter's death. Henry, hearing of these maneuvers, returned to Galicia with Bertrand du Guesclin and other knights, Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade among them. Together, they forced don Fernando back to Portugal. The brother of Fern√°n P√©rez, Nu√±o Freyre, who was Master of the Order of Christ supported the cause of the Portuguese, so on being defeated had to leave Galicia. The war ended during 1371 and 1373 with several treaties in which Fernando Ru√≠z de Castro was exhorted to exile in Baiona. During this period, Fern√°n P√©rez received several more grants of land, and became lord of the villages of Ferrol, Pontedeume and Vilalba, with rights over those villages that until then only were for the king himself. Fern√°n P√©rez was the right hand man of King Henry in Galicia, to the point that he was appointed to make all the preparations for the wedding of Henry's son, Fadrique with Beatrice of Portugal. In 1371, he was appointed Governor of A Coru√±a. In 1384, he took part in the dynastic clash between John I of Castile and John I of Portugal. In 1386 he fought John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster in a new dynastic war in Castile and he defended A Coru√±a, although it is unclear whether he defended the city or turned it over to John of Gaunt. The war ended with the marriage of Catalina, daughter of the duke of Lancaster and granddaughter of Peter I of Castile, Peter the Cruel to Henry (to be Henry III), and Fern√°n P√©rez regained control of A Coru√±a. Fernan reached his \\"social zenith\\" around 1391, when after his first wife's death, he had already remarried to Constanza Moscoso, of an important family of Galician knights, which helped bolster his good social standing. Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade held several royal commissions in public office until the end of his life, and left behind a bigger patrimony than that received from his ancestors, placing his lineage as one of the most prominent of the Galician landscape. Some works Don Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade was an educated man, by the standards of knighthood of the day, and was concerned with his reputation, both at the time and in future. To indicate his power and wealth, he developed several castles in his lands. He also worried about his name being important among the lineages among the others later in time, and so he commissioned civil works and religious buildings that still stand today. The later public works included seven bridges, of which three still stand, one over the river Tambre, three meters wide and with a single ogival arch, another over the river Eume which spanned 913 meters and was known to have 79 arches, large enough to contain on its span a hospital with twelve beds and a chapel. Additionally, the Castle of Nogueirosa survives partially, and the Homage Tower of the old castillo de Andrade which is 12 meters wide and stands 18 meters tall. Fernan also sponsored several churches, including the and Santa Mar√≠a de Azougue in Betanzos, and he sponsored too the foundations of San Pantaleon de Cabanas, Santa Maria de Cabanas and San Paulo de Riobarba. Conclusions Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade was a knight who lived by the standards of his time: he followed the knightly model though adjusting it to his own interests. Even though he was given the nickname of ‚Äúo B√≥o‚Äù, Galician for \\"The good one\\", we must not overlook his abusive behaviour and lack of scruples, and his talent for siding with the winning party in a way that benefited him. He is remembered nonetheless as a great sponsor and a loyal knight of Enrique, being the first knight of the family to attain Lord status, promoting a lineage that would later reach Count status, as the Counts of Andrade.

Life  Christine Charlotte was a daughter of Duke Eberhard III of W√ºrttemberg from his first marriage to Anna Dorothea of Salm-Kyrburg. At the age of 17 she married on 14 May 1662 Count George Christian of East Frisia, who was raised in the same year to the rank of heritable Prince. =Regency= George Christian died on 6 June 1665, leaving his wife pregnant with their third child; four months later (1 October 1665), Christine Charlotte gave birth to a son, Christian Everhard. As the mother of the new-born prince, she became his guardian and regent of East Frisia. She tried to rule as an absolutist princess, which led to a series of conflict with the equally self-conscious Estates of East Frisia and brought the country to the brink of civil war several times. She was considered extraordinarily beautiful, intelligent and eloquent, but also domineering, unforgiving, unrepentant and wasteful. Her reign was marked by disputes within East Frisia. Historians have a negative view of her overall performance, which may be due to her conflicts with the Estates. Her major foreign policy success was a border treaty with Oldenburg on 22 December 1666. This treaty created the so-called Golden line, which separates East Frisia from Oldenburg Friesland to this day. In 1690, the Emperor confirmed the Estates and declared her son of age.

Background On 15 February soldiers mutinied in the capital Ouagadougou over unpaid housing allowances; President Blaise Compaor√© briefly fled the capital and sought safety in his hometown of Ziniar√©. By Sunday 17 April, the mutiny had spread to the town of P√¥ in southern Burkina Faso; there were also protests over a court's decision to sentence several officers to prison sentences. Protests The mutiny followed popular protests over rising prices in several cities across Burkina Faso, and protests starting 22 February over the death of a student in police custody in February, as well as the shooting of several other protesters. Five student protesters were reportedly killed in February. France24 suggested that Burkina Faso could be caught up in a full-scale uprising similar to that seen in several North African and Middle Eastern countries, proposing the rise of a \\"Burkinab√® Spring\\". On 22 April, a coalition of 34 Burkinab√® opposition parties called for a rally on 30 April to demand President Compaor√©'s resignation. By 27 April, farmers were protesting in Bobo-Dioulasso over low prices and merchants rioted in Koudougou over the closure of 40 shops due to unpaid rent. The house of Koudougou's mayor and its police station were burned. Later, that same evening, riot police joined the widespread mutiny in Ouagadougou. Four young demonstrators protesting the police mutiny on 28 April were injured when police fired live ammunition to disperse protesters after they torched a police station in Ouagadougou. On 29 April, President Blaise Compaor√© announced he had negotiated with the army and they had agreed to put a stop to the mutinies and protests ravaging the country. Some 3,000 protesters attended the opposition rally on 30 April in Ouagadougou, which lasted for hours despite the hot weather. Several local pop music stars joined the protest, performing and calling on Compaor√© to step down. Several protesters carried signs comparing Compaor√© to ousted Tunisian strongman Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who was toppled in a January revolution. B√©n√©wend√© Stanislas Sankara, an opposition leader, said the rally was to demonstrate the desire of the Burkinab√® people for reforms so that wealth from Burkina Faso's natural resources is distributed more evenly, not just benefiting those who are already rich and powerful. Health Minister Adama Traor√© said on 30 April that six people had died so far as a result of the mutinies, including an 11-year- old reportedly shot and killed while at school. On 1 May, an affiliation of trade unions and civil servants in Ouagadougou canceled a planned march to commemorate May Day and protest the government due to concerns about bolstered security and the risk of agents provocateurs infiltrating the demonstration. On 15 May, soldiers fired their guns in the air through the night, apparently to protest the tardiness of reforms and benefits promised to the army rank- and-file. Three people were reportedly killed and 136 were injured during major daylong protests by students and soldiers in Ouagadougou on 24 May. Students also protested in Gaoua and Bobo-Dioulasso in support of a teachers' strike, torching ruling party offices in Gaoua. The teachers' union and the government reached an agreement on 25 May, the day after the violent demonstrations, to raise wages in exchange for an end to the strike. Soldiers mutinied again on 27 May in Tenkodogo and 1 June in Bobo-Dioulasso, among other cities and barracks particularly in eastern and northern Burkina Faso, firing into the air for hours on end in both daytime and nighttime hours. Shooting reportedly quieted in the north by 27 May after continuing throughout the weekend, but it had again spread to other parts of the country by that time. On 3 June 2011, at least seven people were killed as pro-government forces quelled the protests and mutiny in Bobo-Dioulasso, including a 14-year- old girl. An army spokesman said 109 were detained in the government's strongest effort yet to end the mutiny. Traders upset by mutineers' extensive looting in Bobo-Dioulasso called for the government to offer swift recompense for their losses. The government said it replaced all 13 regional governors as of 9 June, appointing three army officers among others to replace them in a bid to ease tensions. Aftermath With the protests quieted, Reforms Minister Bongnessan Arsene Ye said on 23 June that the government established a 68-member committee to consider changes to the constitution. However, opposition leader Benewende Stanislas Sankara, a key figure in the protest movement, said the opposition had declined to be represented in the committee over concerns that the changes to the constitution would allow President Blaise Compaor√© to further extend his term of office rather than creating a more democratic process in Burkina Faso. In October 2014, protesters rose again to protest President Compaor√©'s attempt to change the Constitution of Burkina Faso so he could remain in power for another term. They stormed the National Assembly of Burkina Faso, Compaor√©'s presidential palace, and the state broadcaster's headquarters, among other locations.

He signed up for five years, like many recruits who were destitute like himself,\\"Nicolas Sarkozy\\", Dennis Abrams. Infobase Publishing, 2009. , . p. 22 and was sent for training to Sidi Bel Abbes, where the French Foreign Legion's headquarters were located. He was due to be sent to Indochina at the end of training, but the doctor who checked him before departure, who was also Hungarian, sympathised with him and gave him a medical discharge to save him from possible death at the hands of the Viet Minh. Return to civilian life He returned to civilian life in Marseille in 1948 and, although he asked for French citizenship only in the 1970s (his legal status was that of a stateless person until then), he nonetheless gallicised his Hungarian name into \\"Paul Sark√∂zy de Nagy-Bocsa\\". He met Andr√©e Mallah (known as DaduThe tough new president still loves his mum, France's real first lady. The Guardian, Angelique Chrisafis, 14 May 2007.) in 1949. Andr√©e Mallah Andr√©e Mallah, then a law student, was the daughter of Benedict Mallah, a well-off urological surgeon with a well-established reputation in the mainly bourgeois 17th arrondissement of Paris. Benedict Mallah, originally named Aaron Mallah (and nicknamed Benico), was born in 1890 in the Sephardic Jewish community of Thessaloniki (then part of the Ottoman Empire, now Greece). The family had originally been from Spain, then resettled in Provence, southern France, and later moved to Thessaloniki into the Jewish community established there by other Spanish expellee victims of the Spanish Inquisition. Benico Mallah, the son of jeweller Mordechai Mallah and Reyna Magriso, left Thessaloniki with his mother in 1904 at the age of 14 to attend the prestigious Lyc√©e Lakanal boarding school of Sceaux, in the southern suburbs of Paris. He studied medicine after his baccalaureate and decided to stay in France and become a French citizen. A doctor in the French Army during World War I, he met a recent war widow, Ad√®le Bouvier (1891‚Äì1956), whom he married in 1917. Ad√®le Bouvier, Nicolas Sarkozy's maternal grandmother, was born to a wealthy Catholic bourgeois family from Lyon. Mallah, for whom religion had reportedly never been a central issue, converted to Catholicism upon marrying Ad√®le Bouvier, which had been requested by Ad√®le's parents, and changed his name to Benedict. Although Benedict Mallah converted to Catholicism, he and his family nonetheless had to flee Paris and take refuge in a small farm in Corr√®ze during World War II to avoid being arrested and delivered to the Germans. During the Holocaust, many of the Mallahs who stayed in Thessaloniki or moved to France were deported to concentration and extermination camps. In total, 57 family members were murdered by the Nazis.http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/will_sarkozys_jewish_roots_impact_frances_policies_20070511 Paul Sarkozy and Andr√©e Mallah settled in the 17th arrondissement of Paris and had three sons: Guillaume, born in 1951, who is an entrepreneur in the textile industry and current vice president of the MEDEF (French union of employers); Nicolas, born in 1955; and Fran√ßois, born in 1957, who is the manager of a health care consultancy company. In 1959, Paul Sarkozy left his wife and his three children. He later remarried three times and had two more children, Caroline and Olivier Sarkozy.

When one refers to the Artland as a single landscape unit, it lies within an arc of ice age end moraine that today forms the Damme and Bippen Hills. The Artland was never a political unit; its church parishes did not belong to the same √Ñmter in the Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck. Rather it was economic, cultural and family ties that made the Artland a single entity. In the sparsely populated region today, between the meadows, fields and hedge- covered embankments (Wallhecken) typical of North German geestland, bushes and copses, there are more than 700, often protected, isolated, timber-framed farms. The designation Artland for this countryside was first used in the year 1309.Kohnen: Die Herkunft des Namens Art-Land. In: Osnabr√ºcker Land 1974, p. 49f.  History  After the end of the ice age the region of the present Artland became a vast glacial meltwater basin that was filled with alluvial sand by the local river, the Hase and its predecessor. This produced a rich farmland that has dominated the countryside for centuries up to the present day. The first record of name of this region as the Artland is in 1309. It continued to be used over the centuries but it never had a clear and permanent boundary. A prerequisite for the economic independence of the Artland were its good natural regional conditions and the highly fertile soil in the Quakenbr√ºck Basin. The gentle gradient of the River Hase in the lowlands below Bersenbr√ºck facilitated the deposition of fertile alluvial sands from the Osnabr√ºck Upland, resulting in very fertile farmland. The higher-lying Esch terrain was improved by fertilising it with plaggen soils taken from the rich pastures. Alongside the keeping of livestock, which was the dominant form of farming throughout the Osnabr√ºck Land until the Thirty Years' War, arable farming has always been carried out in the Artland which, in addition to oats and rye, also supported the more demanding and sought-after barley crops. Nowadays, however, the cultivation of maize is pre-eminent, as it is in the rest of the Weser-Ems region. Berner: Siedlungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte This fertile arable soil, which contrasted with that of the rest of the Osnabr√ºck Land where there were often shortages of grain, led in the \\"Corn chamber of the Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck\\" to the development of a wealthy, landed upper class with numerous individual farmsteads which, together with hedges, copses and oak groves (Hofeichenk√§mpen), resulted in a park-like countryside.Ottenjann: Bau-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialstruktur. The collective municipality of Artland, founded in 1972, covered Quakenbr√ºck, Menslage and Badbergen, which represented only a part of the original heartland of the region, to which Gehrde also belonged and which, like Menslage, Quakenbr√ºck and Badbergen, benefited from the fertile lowlands of the Hase river. Nortrup, by contrast, was not part of the Artland heartland. It first became politically and ecclesiastically independent of Ankum in the early 20th century, the first Roman Catholic parish being founded in 1908. Even Ankum is often counted as part of the Artland (Artland Cathedral), the village was however the centre point of the Farngau for centuries, to which Nortrup also belonged.

To support the economy and tourism of the region the Artland Economic Agency (Wirtschaftsagentur Artland, WAAL)Internetauftritt der Wirtschaftsagentur Artland and ARTour (Artland Touristik) were founded. Every year on the \\"Open Day\\" (Tag des offenen Denkmals) (second weekend in September) many farms and other buildings in Artland may be visited. In Quakenbr√ºck the 142-kilometre-long holiday road, the Artland Route, begins and ends. The sights of the Artland may also be enjoyed on special cycleways, the Gable Tour (Giebeltour), the Art Tour (Kunsttour) and the Garden Tour (Gartentour).

Albania has an embassy in the Haguehttp://albania.visahq.com/embassy/Netherlands/ and the Netherlands has an embassy in Tirana. The countries are both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Also Albania is an EU candidate and the Netherlands is an EU member.  History  Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in November 1912, during the First Balkan War. The leading European powers of the time recognised Albania's independence at the 1913 London Peace Conference, where it was decided that the Dutch would take responsibility for internal security. This led to the Netherlands deploying military personnel to help set up the gendarmerie of the Provisional Government of Albania. In 1946, the Netherlands called upon the United Nations Security Council to bring to a halt incidents along the northern border of Greece, involving the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria. The Socialist People's Republic of Albania started their diplomatic relations with the Netherlands, and eight other Western European countries, in 1970. In the early 1990s the socialist regime collapsed, and while Albania turned to democracy they had no previous experience of implementing it.

Groups of Albanian politicians and officials, from both national and local level, would attend the Hague for workshops with their Dutch peers where they discussed the practice of good governance and administration within the democratic framework.

Biography Alfred Edward Goodey's parents were William Henry Goodey and Rhoda Strutt and he was born in Derby in 1878.  Goodey family tree He was educated at home and at the Whitworth School before he attended Derby School of Art. He began collecting oils, watercolours, prints and photographs in 1886, searching as far afield as America for anything to do with Derby. He even commissioned artists to paint contemporary views of Derby, anxious to record anything that might be demolished or changed. Alfred John Keene: St Mary's on the Bridge - Bridge Chapel by the River Derwent at night Goodey had a range of interests including natural history and walking in Derbyshire; he was an amateur Shakespearean actor founding a local society and arranging \\"The Loft\\" for rehearsals near his own house, 40 Ashbourne Road, Derby. He has been described as a man about town in plus fours and a full beard and moustache who would frequent his favourite pub on Sadler Gate and discuss the issues of the day. However it was his interest in art that led him to the presidency of the Derby Sketching Club and a shrewd eye for a painting that would help to record Derby's history that ensured his notability. The Loft was almost completely demolished in September 2014.The Free Derby, magazine, issue 12. Goodey amassed a remarkable record of Derby as it existed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and in 1936 he gave over 500 paintings to the Derby Museum and Art Gallery. He also bequeathed to the town further works of art and ¬£13,000 to be used to build an extension to the Museum. He died in Derby in 1945 and the museum now houses not only Goodey's collection but the biggest collection of paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby. Goodey's collection included paintings by Alfred John Keene, a member of the Keene family of Derby which included his father and photographer Richard Keene who published the Derby Telegraph, his brother William Caxton Keene., and Ernest Townsend. Three of the paintings given to the Derby Museum and Art Gallery by Goodey were by artist Ernest Ellis Clark. Another was by C.T. Moore.

Bilateral relations are tense because of the Jyllands- Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Denmark is represented in Libya, through its embassy in Cairo, Egypt. Danish Foreign Minister Villy S√∏vndal visited Libya in February 2012, for the opening of the new representative office in Tripoli. History =Kingdom of Libya= In January 1952, Denmark and eleven other countries sponsored a resolution to admit Libya under King Idris to the United Nations, and recognize Libya as an independent state. =The Gaddafi Era= After the Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 incident, Denmark with France, Australia and the United Kingdom abstained from voting in the United Nations Security Council. After the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, Denmark ordered the Libyan diplomats in Denmark to leave the country. As a response to the expels, the Libyan government expelled a diplomat from Denmark. In January 2006, the Libyan Government closed their embassy in Denmark, as a protest against the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. In 2008, Libya boycotted Danish companies, and excluded Danish companies from big infrastructure projects worth 126.5 billion dollars. =National Transitional Council= On 18 March, Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen met with National Transitional Council representative Ali Zeidan. On 25 March, Danish politician Naser Khader supported a Danish recognition of the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya. On 19 April, the Libyan Observatory for Democracy and Human Rights, a non-governmental organization and umbrella organization for the National Transitional Council opened an office in Copenhagen. Denmark was among the countries a council spokesman said on 5 May 2011 had recognized the National Transitional Council as the Libyan government. However, Danish government spokesperson Jean Ellermann Kingombe said Copenhagen hadn't taken that step but considers the council \\"a relevant partner for dialogue\\". On 22 June, Denmark recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole legitimate representative of Libya. Libyan civil war On 5 March, during the 2011 Libyan civil war, the Danish Development Minister S√∏ren Pind assisted the United Nations Commission on Human Rights with 30 million DKK to help the Libyan people who have fled to Egypt and Tunisia. On 22 March, Libyan state television launched a propaganda offensive against Denmark, accusing Denmark of having led a campaign against Muslims for several years. In April, DanChurchAid sent some deminers to clear mines in Libya. In early April 2011, Denmark considered receiving about 10 Libyan refugees from Lampedusa, Italy. The Danish government considered imposing a freeze on Libyan assets in Denmark. Muammar Gaddafi had about 25 million DKK in Denmark. During the war, the Danish Foreign Ministry made a temporary travel advice for Libya on their website. Libyan consul general to Denmark, Munir Eldawadi, was expelled from Denmark and declared a persona non grata in May 2011. On 9 August 2011, Denmark gave two Libyan diplomats, loyal to Gaddafi, Saleh Omar AbuRwesha and Khaled Mansour Salem el-Asfar five days to leave Denmark, and both were declared persona non grata. =Operation Odyssey Dawn= On 13 March, by unanimous vote, Denmark's Parliament authorized direct military action by its air force to help enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973, marking the only time so far in the state's history that military commitment was supported by full parliamentary unity. The Royal Danish Air Force is participating with six F-16AM fighters, one C-130J-30 Super Hercules military transport plane and the corresponding ground crews. Only four F-16s will be used for offensive operations, while the remaining two will act as reserves. The first airstrikes from Danish aircraft were carried out on 23 March with four aircraft making twelve sorties as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. The Guardian reported in May 2011, that Danish F-16 fighters killed Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Arab Gaddafi. In June, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates praised Denmark, Canada and Norway, saying that although those two countries had only provided twelve percent of the aircraft to the operation, their aircraft had conducted one-third of the strikes.Cloud, David S. (11 June 2011). \\"Gates Tells NATO It Must Hold Up Its End\\". McClatchy- Tribune News Services (via Stars and Stripes). p. 3. Hannibal Gaddafi In 2008, Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi lost a lawsuit he brought in Denmark against Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet. Ekstra Bladet reported that in 2005, Gaddafi, then a student in Copenhagen, had directed the abduction and beating of a Libyan national at the home of the Libyan consul in Gentofte. Gaddafi failed to appear in court to present his side of the case, and the court ruled that the existing evidence supported Ekstra Bladet's version of events.

They know Italy and they hate Italy.\\" *\\"The protesters were determined to kill the consul and his family when they attacked the Italian consulate in Benghazi.

The reef has accumulated in shallow water, about deep, over the last 420 years, under static sea level conditions. The site was recommended for designation as a marine preserve in 1978, and was approved in 2015 as a part of the Hol Chan Marine Reserve.

Wildlife  Green moray eel at Mexico Rocks, Belize Patch coral reefs that predominantly consist of Montastraea annularis are a rare occurrence in Belize; the only other such patch reefs in the country are located at Glover's Reef. In addition, staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) occurs on the ridge's windward and leeward flanks. Thirty species of hard coral have been identified at Mexico Rocks. The reef is abundant in fish and invertebrate life. Common fish found at Mexico Rocks include Atlantic blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), and southern stingray (Dasyatis americana).

He wrote the first book on navigation in German language and established the first public nautical school in the Duchy of Schleswig. Within 30 years as a nautical teacher he examined about 3,500 navigator candidates. Life Hinrich Braren was born in 1751 in Oldsum on the North Frisian island of F√∂hr to whaling captain Brar Hinrichen. Only aged 12 he went to sea with his father and each year from 1763 to 1780 he used to sail to Greenland as a whaler. In 1780 he changed to merchant shipping and was incidentally able to acquire the full command over one of the ships of his Dutch ship-owner in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1786, while Braren sailed from Copenhagen to Greenland as a seal catcher for the Royal Greenlandic Trade, he received the order to support a Danish expedition that was determined to explore the east coast of Greenland. Inspired by this expedition Braren settled down as a navigation teacher on F√∂hr and opened a private nautical school. In 1794 he was also a merchant and harbourmaster in Wyk auf F√∂hr. In 1796 he was granted an examinator's license and the permission to establish a public nautical school. This school was later moved to T√∂nning at the mouth of the Eider river when Braren was posted there as inspector for the maritime pilots on the Eider and the Eider Canal. Due to the Continental System during the Napoleonic Wars, T√∂nning had become an important commercial harbour for a short time. During his work as a nautical teacher, Braren became aware of the lack of suitable books in German language since Dutch literature was common at the time. Therefore, he wrote the textbook System der praktischen Steuermannskunde [System of a practical Navigation] which was published in 1800 in Magdeburg and had three further editions. In 1807 he wrote another textbook System der praktischen Schifferkunde [System of a practical Shipmaster's Knowledge] and in 1820 he edited a nautical almanac in Altona. System der praktischen Schifferkunde received international acclaim and has been called the most advanced nautical textbook of its time in central Europe. This assessment is based on the fact that Braren not only published nautical lessons but was the first author to include physics, law of the sea and business administration. Also, 150 years prior to its official introduction at German nautical academies, the topic of human resource management was already part of this book. The two \\"practical\\" textbooks remained in use in northern Germany until the late 19th century. Hinrich Brarens worked as a nautical examiner for 30 years and examined some 3,500 candidates. A certificate issued by his school and signed by him in March 1826 bears the running number 3,422. Apart from his nautical textbooks, Braren also wrote a philosophical and religious treatise in 1819: Gedanken √ºber die Frage: Was sind wir Menschen? Was wissen wir? [Thoughts on the Question: What are we humans? What do we know?]. =Personal life= Hinrich Brarens' house in T√∂nning In 1773 Hinrich Braren married his first wife Thur (n√©e Fr√ºdden, born 15 March 1751 in Oldsum) who changed her name to Dorothea Brarens in T√∂nning. She died in 1809. Hinrich Braren was married a second time to Margaretha, n√©e Steffens, from Itzehoe. His first marriage spawned ten children while the second marriage remained without child. His daughter Gundalena (born Jung G√∂ntje Braren) married the Hamburg based ship-owner and ship-broker Robert Miles Sloman in 1806, four years later her sister G√∂ntje married Sloman's brother John Miles. Gundalena's daughter Eliza was the mother of Swiss general Ulrich Wille. After their removal to T√∂nning the family had changed their name to Brarens.

Plot On September 18, 1972, Dr. Hoffman and his wife, both of whom specialized in the study of telekinesis and the occult, are found dead in their Mulholland Drive ranch home on the night of their anniversary party. Their deaths, ruled a double suicide, were witnessed by the couple's thirteen-year-old daughter, Debbie, who was institutionalized due to a subsequent nervous breakdown. A couple who subsequently purchase the home also befall gruesome, unexplained deaths in it, as does the following buyer, Herman Royce. In 1982, the residence is reopened as a boarding house by Jim Royce, nephew of Herman, who has inherits the home. Jim, a playboy who himself is obsessed with the occult and telekinesis, places a newspaper ad encouraging young, single women to move in. Various young aspiring actresses and models‚ÄîSandy, Suzie, Cindy, Gloria, Pam, and Terri‚Äîrespond and move into the home. After they settle in, an English woman, Debbie, arrives, pleading to move in; she agrees to stay into the sole remaining cramped spare room in the house. Meanwhile, Detective Richard Grant is casing the home for unknown reasons. He sends a private investigator to the house, but he is electrocuted in a bathtub before being buried in the backyard by an unseen assailant. Meanwhile, Jim exhibits his own telekinetic powers to Victoria, an aspiring singer. She is fascinated by his abilities. That night, she suffers a vivid nightmare of being dragged into the grave of Dr. Hoffman. Richard eventually arrives at the house to visit Cindy, who is revealed to be his ex-girlfriend. Richard chastises Cindy for new living arrangement and for having fled upon his marriage proposal. Inspired by Jim and jealous of the other women in the house, Victoria begins attempting to hone her own supernatural powers. She soon discovers she too has the ability to harness telekinesis. Cindy mysteriously vanishes on the beach while having a rendezvous with Jim. A note left behind indicates she has reunited with Richard. The next day, Jim and the women prepare for a housewarming party they are holding that night. While cleaning the house, Victoria suffers another terrifying vision in which a looming, monstrous entity chases her through the house. Later, she finds her pet cat, Pumpkin, dead. At the housewarming party, Jim's college friend, a police officer, arrives to tell him that Cindy's body was recovered from the beach. He also informs him that it is the tenth anniversary of the Hoffman deaths. Outside, the officer is overcome by a supernatural force which makes him shoot a partygoer before killing himself. Meanwhile, Pam gets into an argument with Debbie, and upon returning inside, is overcome by the supernatural force, which causes her to claw her own eyeballs out. Shortly after, the house's gardener is found stabbed to death by the pool. Debbie soon reveals herself to Jim as Deborah Hoffman, the daughter of Dr. Hoffman, returning to claim her home. It is also revealed she had an incestuous relationship with her father, and was responsible for the deaths of him and mother. Using her supernatural powers, she has been killing the boardinghouse tenants one by one, deeming them trespassers. Jim and Victoria bond together and engage in a psychic battle with Debbie, and ultimately are able to defeat her. A postscript reveals that the Hoffman residence burned to the ground the night of the party, and that Jim is now working professionally as a programmer, while Victoria is a successful singer. Debbie Hoffman's body is yet to be found. Cast Production The original idea for the project was developed by John & Kalassu Wintergate at the end of 1978 and the script was started with the idea to film a comedy horror movie. A year or so later Elliot Van Koghbe read an article in American Cinematographer. The article mentioned that George Lucas was experimenting with producing films shot originally on video. Wintergate also had the same idea, because the large funds for a 35 mm production was not yet available. So after researching the idea more closely Wintergate decided to venture into producing a low-budget comedy horror film on video reserving the major portion of the budget for the expense of making the transfer to film. J & K Wintergate funded the project and wrote the script. As an assistant casting director in Hollywood, Van Koghbe had experience with video equipment that was helpful. He, under an alternate name (Obee Ray), also shot a couple of extra sequences for the eventual re-edit which the distributor insisted on. The distributor, in order to make it strictly horror, insisted for most of the real comedy scenes to be cut, which of course ended up to be virtually impossible since everything was shot with the underlying comedy aspect. This made it into a quirky somewhat puzzling film but it inadvertently helped the film to become an eventual cult classic all over the world. Boardinghouse is notable for being the first horror film to be shot on video. The film also used a movie gimmick titled Horror Vision, wherein a warning would pop up on the screen to let audiences know that a violent scene was happening soon. Release Despite being a shot-on-video project, Boardinghouse was blown up to 35mm film and was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Coast Films, with screenings beginning on October 21, 1983. =Home media= It was later released on VHS by Paragon Video Productions. The film was officially released on DVD by Code Red in 2008. On February 25, 2013, Slasher // Video founder Jes√∫s Ter√°n announced via a Youtube video that he had obtained the rights to release Boardinghouse for its 30th anniversary. The film was remastered from the original Betacam tape. The special features include a never before seen Director's Cut which is twice the length of the film, featuring several scenes cut from the previously released version due to the distributors request. Other features include a brand new commentary with director John Wintergate and actress/wife Kalassu, two never before seen interviews, two music videos made the same time as Boardinghouse, an extensive group of trailers and television spots, photo gallery, and more. The DVD was released on July 22, 2013 by Slasher // Video, being the first ever DVD to feature a Microsoft Xbox 360 Platinum Hits keep case. =Critical reception= A contemporaneous review published in Cinefantastique noted: \\"This film is a perfect example of why horror grosses have plummeted at the box-office. Charging anyone to see this crap is a crime. Special effects, acting and production values are non- existent.\\" In anticipation for a 2017 revival screening, the Chicago Film Society wrote of the film: \\"Boardinghouse is an essential piece of lunatic cinema, complete with requisite high levels of gore and camp.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club described the film as \\"a shotgun marriage of Halloween, Carrie and The Amityville Horror.\\" In his book The Gorehound‚Äôs Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s, film scholar Scott Aaron Stine called the film \\"godawful lousy.\\" Notes References Sources * External links  * 1982 films 1982 horror films 1980s independent films 1980s mystery films 1980s slasher films 1980s teen horror films American comedy horror films American films American supernatural horror films American independent films American slasher films Films set in Los Angeles Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"Boardinghouse (film)"},{"id":"31523963","text":"The Adventist Medical Center College - Iligan, Inc. (also known as AMC College), formerly the Mindanao Sanitarium and Hospital College, is one of the colleges of the Seventh-day Adventist Church located in Iligan City, Philippines. It is a medical school which focuses on healthcare courses like Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Medical Technology, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, Radiology and Nutrition and Dietetics. History The idea of establishing a college of medical arts was conceived when the administrators of Mindanao Sanitarium and Hospital felt the need for paramedical workers in the hospital. With the shortage of Adventist paramedical workers, particularly in the area of physical therapy, radiology, midwifery and other related fields and with the trends in the tertiary level of education, the MSH Board dreamed to establish a paramedical school in Iligan City. This school would offer courses and training programs in paramedical lines to talented young people of different religious affiliations and regional groups, especially the Seventh- day Adventist youth in Southern Philippines. Under the Leadership of Joel Y. Dalaguan, Dr. Lorenzo S. Lacson, Jr., and Cholita Suasi, the necessary requirements set by the then Department of Education, Culture and Sports for a college status were accomplished. On February 8, 1994, a temporary permit was granted for the School of Midwifery. A year later, March 10, 1995, the School of Midwifery was granted recognition. On June 6, 1994, the DECS issued a permit to open first year level of the School of Physical Therapy. Thus, the institution gained the distinction of being the first Seventh-day Adventist College of Medical Arts in the Philippines to offer a course leading to a recognized degree in BS Physical Therapy. The new college opened on June 13, 1994 in the campus of Mindanao Sanitarium and Hospital with the first batch of 19 midwifery and 88 physical therapy students. The working force was composed of five full-time and six part-time faculty members. The administrators were Joel Y. Dalaguan as president, Dr. Gladden O. Flores as academic dean, Merlyn A. Maquilan as registrar, Dinah W. Almocera and Roselyn A Senas as deans of Physical Therapy and Midwifery, respectively. The facilities like classrooms, library, laboratories, and offices were in the old elementary school building inside the MSH campus, while a new big building was going to be constructed. The groundbreaking ceremony that was well-attended by the members of the College Board, administrators, faculty, and students was conducted in the old tennis court on October 20, 1994. Thus began a new stage in the series of developments of MSH College of Medical Arts Foundation, Inc.

Low pressure hydrocephalus appears to be a more acute form of normal pressure hydrocephalus. If not diagnosed in a timely fashion, the individual runs the risk of remaining in the low pressure hydrocephalic state or LPHS. Shunt revisions, even when they are set to drain at a low ICP, are not always effective. The pressure in the brain does not get high enough to allow the cerebrospinal fluid to drain in a shunt system, therefore the shunt is open, but malfunctioning in LPH. In cases of LPH, chronic infarcts can also develop along the corona radiata in response to the tension in the brain as the ventricles increase in size. Certain causes of LPH include trauma, tumor, bleeding, inflammation of the lining of the brain, whole brain radiation, as well as other brain pathology that affects the compliance of the brain parenchyma. One treatment for the LPHS is an external ventricular drain (EVD) set at negative pressures. According to Pang & Altschuler et al., a controlled, steady, negative pressure siphoning with EVD, carefully monitored with partial computer tomography scans is a safe and effective way of treating LPH. In their experience, this approach helps restore the brain mantle. They caution against dropping or raising the pressure of the EVD too quickly as it increases risk and also destabilizes the ventricles. Getting the ventricles smaller, is the initial step, stabilising them is the second step before placing a shunt ‚Äì which is the final step in therapy. Any variation from this formula can lead to an ineffective, yet patent shunt system, despite a low- pressure setting. Care should be taken with EVD therapy, as mismanagement of the EVD can lead to long-term permanent complications and brain injury.

Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present. New York: Vintage Books, c1995, p. 392 From its creation in the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s, Arcadie played a dominant role in the lives of French homosexuals as both a political and a social organization. Founding The Association Arcadie was founded in 1954 as the first homophile group in French history. The goal of the organization was \\"to present homosexuals as respectable, cultured, and dignified individuals deserving of greater social tolerance\\". The Arcadie association also aimed to \\"educate adult homophiles, who, too weak and lacking knowledge, could not on their own live with dignity\\" through social activities and through its publication, Revue Arcadie. Revue Arcadie The Association Arcadie began publishing the literary review Arcadie: revue litt√©raire et scientifique, which became the most important French homosexual publication of its time, in January 1954, though some sources claim that it began publication in 1957.An image of the front cover and table of contents of the first issue of the Revue Arcadie in Jackson (2009), p. 74 clearly shows that the date of the first issue of the review was January 1954. During its years of operation, Arcadie became popular amongst a number of prominent French intellectual figures; Jean Cocteau contributed a drawing of a boy to the first issue of the review. Revue Arcadie remained in continuous publication until 1982 when the laws regarding homosexual conduct were changed to be identical with those relating to heterosexual behavior. Its emphasis on \\"dignity\\" and \\"respectability\\" led the Revue Arcadie to be increasingly out-of-step with the more revolutionary gay political organizations demanding civil rights for gay men and lesbians in France. Upon seeing that the review's message was no longer effective in creating social change and seeing more progressive organizations securing rights for homosexuals, the editors decided to cease publication. Club Arcadie In 1957, the Club Arcadie secured a clubhouse in Paris, from which it sponsored social gatherings, talks and cultural outings.Guide to the Arcadie Records, 1956-1979 The club strove to present gay and lesbian individuals as conventional members of French society. Historian Michael Sibalis describes the belief of the group \\"that public hostility to homosexuals resulted largely from their outrageous and promiscuous behaviour; homophiles would win the good opinion of the public and the authorities by showing themselves to be discreet, dignified, virtuous and respectable.\\"Sibalis, Michael, 2005. Gay Liberation Comes to France: The Front Homosexuel d‚ÄôAction R√©volutionnaire (FHAR), French History and Civilization. Papers from the George Rud√© Seminar. Volume 1 PDF link As such, Arcadie prohibited overt demonstrations of romantic affection such as kissing on its dance floor. At various points in its history, Arcadie also sponsored activities in the French provinces and in Belgium. The Arcadie club was also known as the Club litt√¢eraire et scientifique des Pays Latins (CLESPALA) and the Paris-Club. Evolution and disbanding The Club Arcadie disbanded in 1982 and publication of the Revue Arcadie ended shortly after the laws governing homosexual behavior were brought into accord with the laws governing heterosexual behavior. In a final letter to the readers of Arcadie published in the May 15, 1982, issue, the leaders of the association explained their reasons for closing the club and ceasing publication of the review: [Arcadie], created in 1957, decided upon its dissolution during a gen- eral meeting on May 13. The goals that each of us had fixed upon [Arcadie's] creation have been a constant concern during its twenty-five years of activity, and regardless of what has happened, they gener? ally have been kept. Times have changed, far too much, some would say. The painful declaration was made over the last months that this club could no longer justify itself, from the time when it became for most uniquely a space for pleasure, for frivolity, and for far too few a space for reflection, for courtesy, for respect, and for friendship. It was not created just to provide a better environment for unique weekend dances. The so-called cultural activities are dead. Those of you in Paris who are reading this, moreover, did NOTHING to maintain them by participating even a little through your presence. . . . This world of permissiveness, of irresponsibility, of frivolity, of obscenity - and the homophile people beat the records in this sad domain - breaks down our energies and makes the continuation of activities that no longer correspond to those of the club's founders entirely futile. --quoted in Gunther (2004) Bibliography *Jablonski, Olivier. ¬´ Arcadie ¬ª, Dictionnaire des cultures gays et lesbiennes, Larousse, 2003. *Jackson, Julian. ¬´ Arcadie : sens et enjeux de ¬´ l'homophilie ¬ª en France, 1954-1982 ¬ª, Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine, No. 53-4, 2006. *Jackson, Julian T. ¬´ Sur l‚Äôhomosexualit√© en France au XXe si√®cle (entretien avec Herv√© Baudry) ¬ª, La Ligne d'ombre, n¬∫ 2, 2007. *Jackson, Julian. ¬´ Arcadie ¬ª, La vie homosexuelle en France, de l'apr√®s-guerre √† la d√©p√©nalisation, Editions Autrement, Paris, 2009. *Miles, Christopher. ¬´ Arcadie, ou l'impossible √©den ¬ª, La Revue h, No. 1, 1996. *Miller, Neil.

It has received mixed to negative reviews. Synopsis On his second visit to the Dominican Republic, John Wilson, a land developer for a foreign company planning to build a hotel, leases a tropical island from the government, which - unbeknownst to him - carries a voodoo curse. He plans to go there to conduct a survey of the land. At night, he has sex in his hotel room with two prostitutes, whom he ends up scaring away by mentioning the name Cat Island. In the hall, he meets Fiona, a socialite who - as she tells him - has just left her elderly lover and his yacht. He performs cunnilingus on her. Sea captain Larry O‚ÄôHara spends the same night on his skipper, having sex with Liz, the owner of the local nightclub. Just as they are about to leave, Liz spots a zombie walking in the shallow water of the port, his hand outstretched towards them. O‚ÄôHara kills him with a grappling iron. Later in the morgue, the doctor examines the maggot-ridden corpse, which suddenly grabs him, kills him with a gory bite in the neck, and walks away. The next day, Wilson hires O‚ÄôHara to take him and Fiona for the trip to the island. O‚ÄôHara tells him about the legend surrounding the island, about zombies led by a cat. At night, in Liz's empty nightclub, Liz gets on stage and dances for O‚ÄôHara, uncorking a bottle of champagne with her vagina. Wilson, in his room with Fiona, suddenly feels someone's unseen presence. It is Luna's, who sits on the island graveyard and establishes contact with him, scratching her hand until her green blood shows. At the nightclub, O‚ÄôHara spots a black cat, which hisses and leaves. The group sails to the island the next day, where they are greeted by Luna and a shaman. They are warned to leave as the island is the reported home to zombies of dead natives. But Luna, who might be a ghost, takes a liking to Larry.

It often appears in bloodsmears as small (0.6Œºm) coccoid bodies, sometimes forming short chains of 3 to 8 organisms. It is usually the causative agent of Feline Infectious Anemia (FIA) in the United States. The ~1.15 Mb genome contains a minimalistic assortment of genes limited to the most basic cellular functions. This leaves M. haemofelis inextricably dependent upon its host for the provision of amino acids, cholesterol, vitamins, and fatty acids. The complex and specific conditions the bacterium requires have made it impossible to culture outside a host thus far. Arthropod vectors are thought to be the primary source of infection, although M. haemofelis is also known to be transmitted from queen to kitten and following blood transfusion. Immunocompromization and/or coinfection with FeLV, FIV, and other Mycoplasma species can exacerbate symptoms or cause symptoms to arise in previously asymptomatic individuals. Symptoms include anemia, lethargy, fever, and anorexia. In suspected cases, M. haemofelis can be identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis for species-specific 16S rRNA sequences as well as by light microscopy. Treatment usually includes the administration of doxycycline or enrofloxacin to quell the infection along with transfusion and administration of glucocorticoids to alleviate anemia. Recent evidence suggests that M. haemofelis may be transmissible to humans. Classification M. haemofelis belongs to the phylogenetically diverse class Mollicutes, which comprises 8 genera: Ureaplasma, Spiroplasma, Asteroleplasma, Mesoplasma, Entomoplasma, Acholeplasma, Anaeroplasma, and Mycoplasma. Haemoplasmas is the name given to the trivial cluster that includes M. haemofelis and its close relatives. Before the advent of modern PCR techniques, M. haemofelis and closely related Haemoplasmas Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum and Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis were collectively classified as Haemobartonella felis based on similarities in gross morphology. The Candidatus distinction is given to newly described species in which additional evidence is required to support their classification. The inability of researchers to culture many Mycoplasma spp. in vitro has made classification difficult. PCR analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of Haemobartonella spp. showed greater similarity to those of Mollicutes than to those of the family Anaplasmataceae in the order Rickettsiales to which they were previously thought to belong. PCR-based assays have provided evidence that the Ohio variant and California variant of H. felis are in fact distinct species, M. haemofelis and Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum respectively. A third Haemoplasma, Mycoplasma turicensis, was later identified in domestic cats. Haemoplasma species have also been identified in dogs (M. haemocanis), mice (M. haemomuris), opossum (Ca. M. haemodidelphis), and alpaca (Ca. M. haemolamae). In cats, M. haemofelis is the most virulent Haemoplasma species and is most often implicated in FIA in the United States.  Transmission  Although M. haemofelis is generally the least prevalent of the three known feline Haemoplasmas, it causes the majority of FIA cases in the United States. Blood-sucking Arthropod vectors including fleas, mosquitoes, and ticks are thought to be the primary mode of dissemination of M. haemofelis. Transmission from queen to kitten has also been observed, however it is unclear if this takes place in utero, during birth, or through nursing. M. haemofelis has been transmitted by transfusion and oral administration of infected blood. Males show a significant disposition towards M. haemofelis infection. It is thought that biting and scratching may result in the infection of toms involved in aggressive behavior.  Pathogenesis  Through reductive evolution, the average genome size of M. haemofelis has been decreased to 1.15 Mb. It has shed many biosynthetic systems found in related gram-positive bacteria as well as the ability to secrete a cell wall (rendering it technically gram- negative). This reduction of genetic information has committed M. haemofelis to a parasitic lifestyle in which it is entirely dependent upon host cells for the amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins it has lost the ability to synthesize. Consistent with its parasitic lifestyle, the M. haemofelis genome contains a significant number of genes devoted to adhesins, resistance to oxidative stress, and the production of variable surface antigens that allow it to persist in the host. Once in the blood stream, M. haemofelis individuals adhere to the cell membranes of red blood cells and eventually become partially embedded. After a delay of 2 to 34 days, the acute phase of infection occurs during which marked parasitemia is often observed. In some cases, up to 90% of red blood cells become parasitized. During this stage of infection, M. haemofelis organisms can be identified in a stained blood smear under light microscopy. Synchronous phase variation has been observed in natural M. haemofelis infections during which rapid fluctuations in parasitemia are observed. This spontaneous alteration of phenotype seems to allow individuals to detach from erythrocytes by the alteration or concealment of surface antigens. This may facilitate the persistence of M. haemofelis within the host by disguising or eliminating antigens that might elicit an immune response. Parasitized red blood cells often lose their biconcave shape. This decreases surface area, increases osmotic fragility, and increases the likelihood that these cells will be captured and destroyed by the spleen. The attachment of M. haemofelis to red blood cell membranes is often associated with positive Coombs test results, meaning IgG antibodies have become bound to red blood cells, marking them for destruction. For the most part, the anemia seen in M. haemofelis infection is a result of extravascular erythrophagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen, liver, lungs, and bone marrow. Left untreated, as many as one third of cats with acute M. haemofelis infection will die from severe anemia. In cats that mount adequate immune and regenerative responses to acute infection, a recovery time of a month or more may be required before the hematocrit returns to normal. During this recovery time,M. haemofelis is still often observed in circulating blood but in decreased numbers. Cats that recover from acute infections may remain infected for life. Intact M. haemofelis organisms have been observed in the phagocytic vacuoles of splenic and pulmonary macrophages, suggesting that these cells may serve as reservoirs. Co-infection with FIV, FeLV, and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum is common. Although M. haemofelis infection can cause acute hemolytic anemia in otherwise healthy cats, immunosuppression, including that brought on by retroviral pathogenesis, increases susceptibility to the most severe effects of M. haemofelis infection. In some cases, infected cats may remain asymptomatic carriers until compromising of the immune system permits increased parasitemia and the onset of acute symptoms. Chronic M. haemofelis infection may promote neoplastic transformation of white blood cells in FeLV- infected individuals,.  Diagnosis  The severity of disease produced by M. haemofelis varies, with some cats having mild anemia and no clinical signs to cats having marked depression and severe anemia. Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and anemia. M. haemofelis infection is suspected in cats with regenerative anemia, in which polychromasia and reticulocytosis are noted. During the acute phase of infection, M. haemofelis can be readily identified on stained blood films however M. haemofelis can disappear and reappear in the peripheral blood throughout the course of infection and can be mistaken for stain precipitate or vice versa. Commercially available PCR assays that detect the Mycoplasma 16s rRNA are more reliable means of diagnosis. Many such assays are species specific. Currently, no serological test for M. haemofelis is commercially available. Additional clinical findings may include positive Coombs test results, hypoglycemia, and dehydration.  Treatment  Antibiotic treatment is indicated only for Haemoplasma-positive cats that present clinical signs for FIA. While it is not believed that M. haemofelis can be completely eliminated, regimens of doxycycline or enrofloxacin are effective in reducing bacteraemia. Doxycycline and enrofloxacin combat M. haemofelis infection by interfering with translation and DNA synthesis respectively. These antibiotics carry side effects including esophagitis, GI disease, and retinal damage and are thus primarily administered only to cats suffering from acute infection with clinical signs. Furthermore, blood transfusion and administration of glucocorticoids relieve the severe anemia resulting from M. haemofelis infection of erythrocytes. Treated and untreated animals that recover from M. haemofelis infections generally remain carriers but seldom relapse with clinical disease.  Public Health Implications  Arthropod vectors appear to be the primary mechanism of M. haemofelis transmission. Mycoplasma DNA sequences have been detected in fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. Given that humans often cohabit with cats and that species of blood-sucking arthropods inhabit most temperate regions, transmission of Haemoplasmas to humans appears possible. Furthermore, all 3 feline Haemoplasma species have been detected in wild felids, suggesting the possibility that they may act as reservoirs of infection for arthropod transmission. In 2008, M. haemofelis was detected in an AIDS patient from Brazil. The zoonotic potential of M. haemofelis has yet to be fully assessed, but care should be taken when handling blood or tissues from infected cats.

She was a popular boat, providing day cruises until 1964. History TS Duchess of Montrose was built by William Denny and Brothers for the Caledonian Steam Packet Company in response to the growing competition from rival turbine steamers. She was the first one class vessel in the CSP fleet, carrying saloon class passengers only and proved popular with passengers. Her success led to her owners commissioning a sister ship, in 1932 for the important Ayr route. Eventually superseded by diesel vessels, she was laid-up in Albert Harbour, Greenock from 31 August 1964 and scrapped the following year. Layout Duchess of Montrose was similar in design to with modifications based on experience. A double-ended, coal-fired Scotch boiler operated at a more traditional pressure (180 psi) than those trialled on the \\"King\\". The screws were driven directly, eliminating the gear equipment of the earlier vessel. She had a centre screw driven by the high- pressure turbine and two screws driven by the two low pressure turbines. The two low pressure turbines incorporated \\"astern turbines\\" for reversing. Her single class made her spacious as facilities were not duplicated. She had an \\"Old English\\" style bar, a modern bright tea room and a large dining room with space for 100 diners at each sitting. A wooden wheelhouse was added in 1948 and fully enclosed in 1951. New thicker funnels were added in 1952 and, like much of the fleet, she was converted to oil in 1956 and fitted with radar in 1960. Service Duchess of Montrose sailed from her home berth at Gourock on a Round the Lochs cruise, via Ayr, Arran and Ailsa Craig. Towards the end of the decade, she operated CSP's newly acquired routes to Campbeltown and Inveraray, previously controlled by Turbine Steamers Ltd. In 1940, she briefly served as a troop ship, but for most of the war, she maintained the Weymss Bay-Rothesay service and continued until 1948, when she returned to her peacetime role. In October 1946, she ran aground in fog at Kirn. The grounding was very gentle (most passengers did not realise what had happened) but she the combined efforts of , and failed to pull her clear and she had to wait for tugs to pull her off. She remained in service until August 1964, when the Clyde services were scaled down. She was laid up, did not return to service and was towed to Ghent, to be broken up the following year.

The Alfonsists competed with the rival monarchists, the Carlists, for the throne of Spain.  Background  Since the crisis of the dynastic conservatism in the 1910s, the authoritarian accents within the former political camp had increased, with a new generation of Maurist politicians bringing ideas of corporativism, integral nationalism, economic interventionism and political catholicism. After 1923, the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera espoused as ideology a mix of authoritarian and bureaucratic conservatism with some traditionalist trappings. As the very same Alfonso XIII began to identify with the new regime, the remains of the liberal-conservative tradition largely distanced from the figure of the King or even from the monarchy altogether. After the forced resignation of Primo de Rivera in 1930, the authoritarian wing largely gathered into the National Monarchist Union.  History  After the overthrow of the monarchy of Alfonso XIII in 1931, the supporters of the later formed the Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola in 1933, a monarchist political party split from Popular Action, which held considerable economic influence and had close supporters in the Spanish army.Andrew Forrest.

In 2011 he was sentenced to four years in prison after he covered a protest rally as a journalist. He was listed by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience.  History of activism  He was a member of the Zubr movement of youth. In 2001 he was arrested after the police took a Zubr badge off of his jacket at a soccer game. In the same year he was arrested and charged with Article 156 of the Belarusian penal code, \\"petty hooliganism\\", after the police confiscated Zubr flags from his friends and arrested 15 people. He was the press secretary for the Zubr movement. He was one of many people charged with \\"slandering the president\\" (Article 367, par. 1 of the penal code) around the time of the 2001 Belarusian presidential election.His specific charge came in January 2002. The Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations said he felt his treatment was related to the invitation he had received from Amnesty International to travel to Germany. In mid-2002 he was jailed for 5 days for participating in the protests of April 19 in the same year. He has worked as a journalist for Charter 97 for 10 years. He also was a spokesman for the group named European Belarus.  Elections of 2010 & prison sentence  During the Belarus presidential election campaigns of 2010, he was the press secretary for candidate Andrei Sannikov. Sannkov's previous press secretary, Oleg Bebenin, had been found hanged; the government claimed it was suicide but his friends suspected otherwise. On December 19, 2010 Atroshchankau was working as a journalist covering the mass protests of the election results. Many of these protests took place at Nezalezhanstsi Square in Minsk. He was working for Lithuanian Delfi, a news portal. He was one of several hundred people arrested on December 19/20, and one of a few dozen eventually charged with offenses by the government. Amnesty International put him on a list of many Belarusian prisoners of conscience arrested during the protests. Daria Korsak, his wife, has stood picket outside of the KGB building in Minsk. Atroshchankau was charged with violating part 2 of article 293 of the Belarus penal code (organizing and taking part in mass riot). The court also alleged that he was \\"part of the mob\\" and \\"forcefully tried to burst into the House of Government\\". According to Belsat TV he pleaded not guilty. The trial lasted from March 1 to March 2. It was in the court for the Frunzenski district of Minsk. The judge was Cherkas Tatsiana Stanislavauna and the prosecutor was Tatsiana Maladtsova. Atroshchankau's trial was held at the same time as Aliaksandr Malchanau and Dzmitry Novik. On March 2, Atroshchankau was sentenced to four years in prison. The Human Rights Centre Viasna wrote that the sentence was \\"politically motivated and unlawful\\". It also claimed that the evidence against Atroshchankau and others did not show any violation of article 293. At the time of his arrest he was a student of International Law (–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ) at the European Humanities University. The University said that it would work to help him with his education despite the circumstances.

The genus is solely known from the Early Eocene, Ypresian Okanagan Highlands deposits in the Cariboo region of British Columbia, Canada. History and classification Palaeoperenethis thaleri is known only from one fossil, the holotype, number \\"ROM31304\\" consisting of part and counterpart impressions that is currently residing in the paleontological collections in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a single adult male individual preserved as a compression fossil in the fine-grained lacustrian rock and thus has been flattened from its dimensions in life. The compression specimen was mentioned in publication by Dr. Mark Wilson in his 1977 paper discussing the paleoecology of the Horsefly Lagerst√§tte fossil sites. P. thaleri was first studied by Paul A. Selden and David Penney, with their 2009 type description being published in the journal Contributions to Natural History. The generic name was coined by P. Selden and D. Penney as a combination of the Greek word palaios meaning \\"ancient\\" and Perenethis, a modern Nursery web spider genus. This is in reference to the age of the type specimen and the African-Asian genus which Palaeoperenethis is similar in appearance to. The specific epithet \\"thaleri\\" was designated by P.

The general shape of the carapace is indicated in the position and disposition of the legs which suggest a subcircular or polygonal carapace. The placement of Palaeoperenethis into Pisauridae is based on the shape and structure of the elongated pedipalps which have a brush of bristles along one edge. Several important characters of the family, such as nursery web construction and egg sack care, are not verifiable in the fossil. The presence of Palaeoperenethis in a lacustrine environment is another feature indicating a placement in Pisauridae. While bristles on the pedipalp are also known in the family Trechaleidae, other overall morphology found in Palaeoperenethis is much closer to Pisauridae.

The story is set at the fictional Vulindlela College, a performing arts college for youth in Johannesburg. The series originally aired on e.tv from 1 May 2000 to 6 July 2007, airing on weekday evenings at 18:30. The show was later cancelled and aired its last broadcast on 6 July 2007. A rebroadcast of Backstage premiered on e.tv on 5 January 2009, at 16:40. Synopsis Backstage is a youth-soap opera in which kids from different backgrounds in South Africa come to a college of performing arts in downtown Johannesburg. The story follows the characters as they experience the trials and tribulations of performers all trying to be the best. The business they are involved in seems to deal with musicians, dancers and filmmakers alike. Besides school and the pressures that come with it, the story also revolves around the personal life of the students dealing with love, passion and betrayal throughout the plot. The head of the college, Ipeleng Theledi, deals with the stresses of running a professional college and dealing with the personal lives of the other characters, mainly the students. The lecturers who assist her are mainly Katlego Rathebe, Naomi Singh, Sebastian Young, Charmaine Jacobs and Keketso Chaka. Cancellation E.tv cancelled the first running of Backstage in 2007. According to the channel, the reason given for cancelling the show was that \\"modern youth culture is dynamic and ever evolving, and it is the right time to adapt to these fresh challenges as well as the changing television market.\\" According to Deon Opperman of Bottom Line Productions, the time was right for the channel \\"to aggressively compete in this primetime slot.\\" The reason for cancellation may have arisen from the stiff competition from rival soap operas, such as SABC 1's Generations, SABC 2's 7de Laan and SABC 3's Isidingo.

These three factors converged in the Caribbean in the 1870s, and would lead to the development of large-scale banana plantations, usually owned and operated by highly integrated large corporations such as Dole and Chiquita Brands International. Origins The first step in the link can be said to have taken place when United States based business men began work on railroads that would allow the Isthmus of Panama to be traversed. Minor C. Keith won the right to build a trans-Isthmus railroad through Costa Rica in 1871. In 1876, a New York-based sea captain named Lorenzo Dow Baker returned from a voyage to the Orinoco River, and stopping in Jamaica bought 160 stems of bananas in the hopes that he could recoup losses from his voyage by selling them in Philadelphia. His gambit was successful, and he quickly began shipping from Jamaica to North America. He then joined with Boston-based Andrew Preston to form the Boston Fruit Company, the first company to engage in all aspects of the banana industry. Boston Fruit eventually merged with other firms to form the United Fruit Company that would eventually become today's Chiquita Brands International. The secret to the Boston Fruit Company's success was the use of early forms of refrigeration to keep the bananas from becoming overripe in the voyage from the Caribbean.Dan Koeppel, Banana: The Fate of the Fruit that Changed the World (New York: The Hudson Press, 2008), pp. 52-56 The combination of land concessions to the infrastructure builders, usually subsidiaries of the shipping companies turned fruit producers, and the monopoly over railroad infrastructure and shipping allowed the United Fruit Company and Standard Fruit to achieve nearly complete control over the economies of the countries in which they operated. Since banana exports came to dominate the overseas trade and most of the foreign exchange earnings of Central American countries, and the companies could use their financial clout as well as carefully established connections with local elites, they had great influence over politics in those areas, leading O. Henry, who lived in Honduras (which he called \\"Anchuria\\") in 1896-97 to coin the term banana republic for them. Company influence was buttressed both by their willingness to hire mercenaries as paramilitary forces and to involve the United States government in military interventions when they felt their interests were threatened. Impact of company dominance Although banana production for export had begun in much of mainland Central America in the 1880s, its initial impetus was from local small or medium-sized holdings. As infrastructure companies gained control of land around their railroads, however, they used their capacity to create much larger holdings and their control of trade to force the smaller competitors out. In addition they brought in thousands of new workers to labor on these large estates, many from the Pacific side of the country, many others from the English-speaking Caribbean. Company policies often favored the English speakers for higher level jobs, thus the most important positions were held by U. S.-born European-Americans, though African-descended Caribbean people were also favored in lesser but still skilled work. Although the companies claimed to pay better wages than prevailed in the local economies, their wage scale for rural workers was low, and company polities favored low wages and kept them low. As some compensation, company employees did have access to schools, hospitals and housing from the company. This housing was usually segregated. \\"White Zones\\" were reserved for the company elite, and included better houses, recreational facilities, and schools; other employees lived outside this zone. Racial discrimination policies that were widespread in the United States at the time were transported to Central America. The companies never used as much land as they acquired. They learned early that the plants were vulnerable to hurricanes, and to Panama disease, which first appeared in the 1910s in Panama, and completely destroyed banana growth very rapidly in areas where it had taken hold. As a result, they both acquired far more land than they needed to support banana cultivation, and they left these lands vacant as a reserve. Such policies in countries like Guatemala where landlessness was prevalent led to anti-company dissent and inhibited land reform efforts. During the Cold War, companies labeled land reform efforts as Communist and again were able to call on the U. S. to send military assistance to keep them down. History By the 1960s, the spread of Panama disease forced exporters of Gros Michel bananas (a susceptible cultivar) to switch to growing resistant cultivars belonging to the Cavendish subgroup (another Musa acuminata AAA). Marketing and labeling efforts in the late 1990s established a market for Fair trade bananas. The various organizations and companies involved focus on increasing the price paid to small banana growers and the wages of agricultural workers.

It lies on the River Lamme, a tributary of the Innerste. The village has a railway station served by the Lamme Valley Railway .  History  Wesseln was first mentioned in records as Westenem in 1146. Later, the village was also called Westheim. In a document written in 1215, Henricus sacerdote de Westene, the priest of Wesseln, was mentioned as a witness in a trial. In the 16th century, Wesseln ceased to be an independent parish and became part of the parish of nearby Detfurth where the Reformation was not introduced. Originally Protestants were not allowed to settle in Wesseln and Detfurth. Wesseln had a small gothic chapel on the right bank of the Lamme where the priest from Detfurth held regular services. When the number of inhabitants increased in the 19th century, the chapel proved to be too small. A church was built on the left bank of the Lamme in 1853-55, and the old chapel was used as a stable and barn until it burnt down in 1905. The extraction of potash salt at a mine in Salzdetfurth, which started in 1896, and the inauguration of the Lamme Valley Railway in 1900 promoted the economic growth and industrial development of the village.Webseite des Dekanat Alfeld Detfurth At the beginning of the 20th century, Wesseln had 388 inhabitants.Wilhelm Keil: Neumanns Ort- und Verkehrslexikon, p. 1170. Leipzig 1905. In 1974 Wesseln was incorporated into the borough of Bad Salzdetfurth together with several other villages. The railway station was closed in 1991, but reopened in 2003 after the line had been modernized and taken over by a private company.  Politics  The parish chair is held by Burkhard Helfenbein (CDU).  Sights  * St. John Baptist is a small Catholic church with about 60 seats in the village centre. Services are regularly held. It was built of quarrystone in a neogothic style in 1853-55. Its nave has large stained-glass windows set in pointed arches, and a gable roof with a fl√®che instead of a tower. The small apse in the northern part of the building has a tented roof and a round window. The entrance doorway in the southern part has a pointed arch. * There are several picturesque half-timbered houses in the village centre. * A glider airfield is located northwest of the village. * Wesseln is surrounded by wooded hills offering a scenic view of the village and the Lamme valley. Two noteworthy historic oaks on the Turmberg hill, the 600-year-old S√§ngereiche and 650-year-old Passeiche, can be reached by footpaths.Hartwig Kemmerer: Reisef√ºhrer Hildesheimer Land, p. 210. Hildesheim 2003.  Traffic connections  There are good train connections from Hildesheim to Wesseln and to Bad Salzdetfurth with one train per hour on working days and one train at least every two hours on Sundays and public holidays. From the railway station of Wesseln, Bockenem can be reached by bus on working days.

He is known for his writing in LGBT studies, gender/sexuality, culture and political economy, and critical science studies. His research tries to understand how sexual mores, racial hierarchies, and class predicaments interact in a changing world. Lancaster is a fellow in the American Anthropological Association. From 2004 to 2006, he served as the AAA's media liaison on kinship, the family, and marriage, fielding questions on same-sex marriage from a range of major media organizations.  Career  Lancaster's first book, Thanks to God and the Revolution: Religion and Class Consciousness in the New Nicaragua (1988), was a study of liberation theology and other religious currents in Sandinista Nicaragua. Joining debates on the nature and origins of class consciousness, the book reworked established Marxist understandings of the role of religion in social life. From a Marxist- populist perspective, it views popular or folk religion as a recurring site where poor people reflect on class inequalities and devise understandings of morality and justice consistent with their self-interests. Its main argument is that elements of an implicit class consciousness are discernible in traditional saint's cults and in popular rites and festivities, and that these elements provide a springboard for the subsequent development of forms of explicit class consciousness (in liberation theology, Sandinismo, and Marxism). Lancaster's first book had traced the Sandinista revolution's ascent; his second book examined its decline. Life is Hard: Machismo, Danger, and the Intimacy of Power in Nicaragua (1992) was an ethnography of everyday life during the contra war and its attendant economic crisis. Chronicling the lives of three poor families among their networks of friends and kin, it dissects plural and intimate forms of power‚Äîin gender relations, color discriminations, and same-sex relationships‚Äîthat, Lancaster argues, undermined attempts to construct a revolutionary New Man (and Woman) and thus subverted the Sandinista project from below. The book is noted for its development of an analysis of machismo as a system of male domination over both women and men, and for its analysis of active/passive roles in male same-sex intercourse in some Latin American settings. Weaving semiotics, poststructuralism, and the Bakhtin school into an overarching Marxist approach, Life is Hard traded in the topical eclecticism of cultural studies, setting brisk chapters of media criticism alongside interviews and descriptions of Nicaragua's survival economy. The book won the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award and the Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists' Ruth Benedict Prize.http://www.sssp1.org/index.cfm/pageid/122/m/335 Lancaster's third monograph, The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture (2003), was a polemic against evolutionary psychology and other reductionist explanations for gender roles and sexual orientations. The book contrasts anthropological and historical perspectives on cultural diversity with evolutionary just-so stories, defending a social constructionist approach to human nature in chapters on sexual selection, masculinity, beauty, the social organization of reproduction, and the gay gene. The book's argument proceeds in part by showing that reductionist ideas are unscientific on their own terms and in part by underscoring a historical irony: stories about a hardwired and immutable human nature fluoresce in a period marked by pitched political struggles around sex, when shifts in production and institutional changes have thrown gender and sexual roles into question. Such stories offer comfort and certainty at a time when not much really seems certain about the nature of men, women, and others. His fourth monograph, Sex Panic and the Punitive State (2011), won the author‚Äôs second Ruth Benedict Prize. The book's first part provides a historical and ethnographic account of modern sex offender laws in the US; it shows how a series of sex panics have institutionalized a culture of sexual fear and produced draconian, ineffective laws. Its second part provides a wider polemical analysis of the development of mass incarceration and other aspects of the punitive state. In addition to his monographs, Lancaster coedited (with Micaela di Leonardo) The Gender/Sexuality Reader: Culture, History, Political Economy (1997), a large advanced interdisciplinary introduction to the field. The Reader foregrounded historical, anthropological, and political-economic approaches at a time when literary theory dominated the field.

The genus is solely known from the early Miocene, Burdigalian stage, Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola. History and classification Tainosia quisqueyae is known only from one fossil, the holotype, number \\"BMNH Pal. PI II 62\\". It is a single individual of indeterminate sex preserved in a clear orange amber specimen. The specimen is mostly complete, though the right tegmen torn, and the hind legs are partly destroyed. The insect was entombed while in resting posture, with both the hemelytra and hindwings mostly closed. The amber is currently residing in the Department of Palaeontology paleoentomology collections of the Natural History Museum in London, England. T. quisqueyae was first studied by Jacek Szwedo and Adam Stroi≈Ñski, with their 2001 type description being published in the journal Genus. The generic name \\"Tainosia\\" was coined by Jacek Szwedo and Adam Stroi≈Ñski in reference to the Tainos people who were native to Hispaniola and other islands of the Greater Antilles. The specific epithet \\"quisqueyae\\" was designated in honor of one of the original names for Hispaniola, \\"Quisqueya\\". As with the extinct Tonocatecutlius gibsoni, T. quisqueyae is placed in the Nogodininae tribe Nogodinini. All other extinct members of the family Nogodinidae currently described from the Americas are restricted to the subfamily Nogodininae. Description Tainosia quisqueyae is in length and has a wing length of . Though similar to the related genus Tonocatecutlius known from Mexican amber, there are several notable differences between the genera. Tonocatecutlius has a mesonotum which is smooth and uninterrupted, while Tainosia has a mesonotum that bears anterolateral carinae. The forewing of Tainosia has a costal cell and clavus without transverse veinlets, while Tonocatecutlius has a costal cell and clavus crossed by veinlets. Similar to Tonocatecutlius is the network of veins crossing the upper half of the tegmen. The tegmen is semi-hyaline with faint but distinct color patterning present, the hindwing is hyaline and without any patterning.

The film was released on February 8, 2013. Plot Debris from a destroyed Soviet space station (where experiments were taking place on huge mutant spiders) fell toward Earth, crashing inside the tunnel of a New York City subway station. The film cuts to the subway station, where Jason Cole, a New York Transit subway supervisor, works. When the debris from the space station crashes into the tunnel, an alarm goes off and the authorities, afraid of a possible disease outbreak, begin evacuating passengers from the station. Jason's coworker Jimmy descends into the subway tunnel to investigate the area, telling Jason that he believes the debris is the remains of the Russian spacecraft. Jimmy feels something bite his leg, and suddenly starts to stumble, falling on the third rail, electrocuting himself. A coroner with the New York City Dept of Health, discovers a cluster of large, strange-looking \\"insect eggs\\" inside Jimmy's body and gives an egg to Jason in a canister so he can get it to the health department for further study. Meanwhile, at the site of the spacecraft crash, men in hazmat suits investigate for radioactive material. They find a piece of debris and bring it to a Russian doctor working on-site, who says it is \\"nothing to worry about.\\" The authorities declare the area \\"clear\\" and safe for reopening the subway station. except for Rachel, saying there are \\"waste disposal issues\\". One man says they'll do their best to fix it by rush hour. The debris is said to be from the soviet union. Back at the subway station, rats have infested the tunnels. The smell has gotten so bad that the subways were shut back down. Pest control is brought down to the source of the problem, an abandoned subway cart. Near it they find several bodies of homeless men, covered in webs filled with eggs. One of the men is then attacked by hundreds of spiders, which swarm his body. The authorities quarantine the area, reroute the subways to go around it, and jam cell phone service in the area. They tell the public that there is a \\"virus outbreak\\". Men in hazmat suits capture the spiders and put them in a large cage. Back at the morgue, a Dr. Darnoff, working in cooperation with the Russians, examines Jimmy's body and the eggs. He explains that Jimmy's body contained the queen spider egg, which is always implanted in the first host, which was Jimmy. Darnoff explains that 20 years ago, a spacecraft was discovered under the ice. They took the genes from the aliens found in the craft, and injected it into many different creatures, but spiders were the only ones with the structure to carry the gene and survive. He then explained that the queen spider can weave an infinite supply of lightweight, bulletproof material that will give the nation that controls it a military and industrial advantage. A U.S. Army colonel, Jenkins, who is revealed to be also working with the Russians, tells his men to kill off the people they quarantined. Darnoff tries to save the people by telling Jenkins killing them is no longer necessary, since they already have the queen spider egg. However, Jenkins tells Darnoff to mind his own business. The doctor also reveals that if they do not get the queen egg to the nest the spiders are building to protect her, she will die in 12 hours. Investigators see Rachel's report on the eggs found in the bodies and quarantine her apartment with her daughter Emily inside, saying she is \\"infected\\". They try to quarantine Jason as well, but he escapes. When tests are done on the eggs Jason brought to Rachel, it is found that they have no bacteria on them. Which is unusual because \\"everything on earth has bacteria.\\" Two men, apparently also working for Darnoff, manage to grab Rachel's purse which contains the canister holding the queen egg, from her car as she leaves her underground garage. Rachel calls Jason, who tells her to leave her car, as they are now being hunted by the Russians and their cohorts. Meanwhile, the spiders grow to giant proportions and begin to come up to street level from the subway tunnels. Jason and Rachel head towards their apartment to rescue Emily. They travel underground to avoid capture using the subway tunnels that Jason is familiar with, meeting huge and vicious spiders who attack them. However, they manage to fight off the spiders and reach the apartment, but learn through texting that Emily left and is hiding in a toy store. Jenkins moves out to capture the queen to acquire her webbing. Darnoff advises him not to, as she is still dependent on the other spiders, but Jenkins ignores him. Just then, the queen emerges from the ground and eats the doctor, who was in awe of her beauty. Jason and Rachel make it to the toy store. When they don't find Emily, Jason calls her but receives no answer. They hear her yelling and climb down to the tunnels to find her. They run into more spiders along the way and barricade a door to escape them. They find Emily and begin tearing at the webbing. They climb up a ladder that leads to the streets but Jason stays behind to fight off the queen who is coming for them. Jason begins breaking the eggs along the walls, which angers the queen. It chases him into a subway train, which it can't fit in due to its size. Jason finds the train's controls and drives it into a tunnel where the spider won't fit. He exits the train after sending it backwards through the tunnel, where the spider is waiting at the opening. The train crashes into the spider and at the same time, smashes gas pipes on the wall, starting a huge fireball that kills the spiders below ground, including the queen. Jason, Rachel and Emily reunite on the street, where soldiers load dead spiders into a huge truck. As the final scene slowly fades, a mutant spider is seen crawling across a broken traffic signal, and the film ends.

In order to make some parts of the film more closely resemble Manhattan, particularly the subway scenes, the director brought in some extra set pieces to help enhance the scenes. The spiders were predominantly CGI created, but Tak√°cs used a 3-foot- long soldier-spider claw for some shots. Reception Spiders 3D holds a 13% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eight reviews with an average rating of 3.17/10. Fearnet gave Spiders an overly negative review, but said that the movie would have some appeal to fans of films akin to Spiders.

Most of the Lebanese community's forebears immigrated to Colombia from the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for economic, political and religious reasons. When they were first processed in the ports of Colombia, they were classified as Turks because what is modern day Lebanon was a territory of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The first Lebanese moved to Colombia in the late nineteenth century. There was another wave in the early twentieth century. It is estimated that over 10,000 Lebanese immigrated to Colombia from 1900 to 1930. Many Lebanese settled in the Caribbean region of Colombia, particularly in the cities of Cartagena, Santa Marta, Lorica, Fundaci√≥n, Aracataca, Ayapel, Calamar, Ci√©naga, Ceret√©, Monter√≠a and Barranquilla, near the basin of the Magdalena River. The Lebanese subsequently expanded to other cities and by 1945 there were Lebanese living in Oca√±a, C√∫cuta, Barrancabermeja, Ibagu√©, Girardot, Honda, Tunja, Villavicencio, Pereira, Soat√°, Neiva, Cali, Buga, Chaparral and Chin√°cota. The six major hubs of Lebanese population were present in Barranquilla, Cartagena, Bucaramanga, Bogot√° and Cali. The number of immigrants entering the country vary from 5,000 to 10,000 in 1945. Some of these immigrants were Christian-Lebanese and others were adept to Islam. In the 1940s, another wave of Lebanese immigrants came to Colombia, settling in the town of Maicao in northern Colombia. These immigrants were mostly Muslims and were attracted by the thriving commerce of the town which was benefiting from the neighboring Venezuelan oil bonanza and the usual contraband of goods that flowed through the Guajira Peninsula.

He was born in Fife but lived in Aberdeen‚Äôs Bucksburn between the ages of nine and 17. He acted when he was a child and joined the Aberdeen Children‚Äôs Theatre at the age of 13, appearing in an episode of Dr Finlay‚Äôs Casebook. Park joined Granada Television after graduating from Edinburgh University. He rose through the television ranks and, after leaving for a two-year spell with Tyne Tees Television, he returned to Granada in 1992 as head of entertainment where he produced the award-winning Prime Suspect, September Song and the pilot for My Wonderful Life. In 1997, Park was appointed executive producer of the long- running soap opera Coronation Street following a decline in its ratings. Park became known as the \\"axeman\\" in the popular press after he sanctioned the removal of several long-running characters from Coronation Street, including Andy McDonald (Nicholas Cochrane), Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and Maureen Holdsworth (Sherrie Hewson). During Park's reign, three characters Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff) and Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) were killed off. Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow) left the popular soap in 1997, although it was Thelma's decision to go, and not Brian's. During 1997 and 1998, he introduced more sensational storylines such as Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride)'s wrongful imprisonment. A range of new characters were introduced such as transsexual Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) and the Battersby family, in a bid to capture a younger audience and reinvent the show. Many of his storylines were ratings successes. Park left Coronation Street in 1998 to start Shed Productions with Coronation Street script executive Ann McManus, which produced TV shows such as Bad Girls, Waterloo Road and Footballers Wives. In 2009, Park had a brain aneurysm while holidaying in Italy and underwent brain surgery.

This foundation seeks to provide \\"emotional, social, and legal support to hundreds of female victims seeking justice and protection.\\" According to the US Department of State, \\"in 2007 alone, her foundation helped find, prosecute and convict 30 individuals accused of murdering women.

However, the civil delictual law was highly developed and consistent in its operation (except where the King wanted to raise money by selling a new form of Writ). A local lord of the manor (or family) could hold their servants and tenants responsible in a manorial court and was among wealthy people who could more easily enlist the help of a county or city bailiff, posse comitatus if one existed and the justices of the peace. The sheriff was the often-armed representative of the king in a city, town or shire, responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing his laws. The church could hold ecclesiastical courts to resolve offences in its canon law and on its narrow territorial jurisdiction. Justice for crimes sought in older forums and by private prosecution declined--instead the state courts, and increasingly the state paying lawyers to prosecute became the normal route to justice for matters that conceivably affect or endanger the community at large. In the 18th century European countries began operating police forces; in 1829 the first force formed in England which began its own prosecutions. Consequently criminal law had a more harmonised way of enforcement. Crown Prosecution Historically in England, with no police forces and no prosecution service, the only route to prosecution was through private prosecutions brought by victims at their own expense or lawyers acting on their behalf. From 1829, as the police forces were formed, they began to take on the burden of bringing prosecutions against suspected criminals. Sir John Maule was appointed to be the first Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales in 1880, operating under the Home Office; his jurisdiction was only for decisions as to whether to prosecute in a very small number of difficult or important cases; once prosecution had been authorised, the matter was turned over to the Treasury Solicitor. Police forces continued to be responsible for the bulk of cases, sometimes referring difficult ones to the Director. In 1962 a Royal Commission recommended that police forces set up independent prosecution departments so as to avoid having the same officers investigate and prosecute cases, although technically the prosecuting police officers did so as private citizens. The Royal Commission's recommendation was not implemented by all police forces, however, and so in 1978, another Royal Commission was set up, this time headed by Sir Cyril Philips. It reported in 1981, recommending that a single unified Crown Prosecution Service with responsibility for all public prosecutions in England and Wales be set up. A White Paper was released in 1983, becoming the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, which established the CPS under the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, consisting of a merger of his old department with the existing police prosecution departments. It began in 1986.

It was a tax on farmland, assessed at a fixed annual rate per √ßift, and paid by land-owning Muslims. Some Imams and some civil servants were exempted from the resm-i √ßift. The tax was collected annually, on 1 March, from the holder of the timar or their tax-farmer. Some exemptions from resm-i √ßift were granted, but this was less common than exemptions from extraordinary taxes. Some of the sadat were initially considered exempt from taxes such as the resm-i √ßift, but this exemption ended in the 17th century; there were various exemptions for those involved in salt-making and mining. The √áift is a measure of land area, derived from the word for \\"pair\\"; it is an area of farmland which can be ploughed by a pair of oxen - the equivalent of the Byzantine Zeugarion.page 100 It has been argued that the basic land tax in Asia Minor and the Balkans was directly copied from earlier Byzantine tax methods. A nim √ßift was half of that area (or half a yoke of oxen); a √ßiftli bennak was an area less than half; these terms match the Byzantine zeugarion, boidaton, and aktemon - and the rates of tax were initially similar. In the 15th and 16th centuries, most taxpayers in the Ottoman empire paid resm-i √ßift at a rate somewhere between 22 and 70 ak√ße; this could have been collected by a sipahi, as either a tax in kind or a cash tax. However, later centralised tax reforms led to cash payments of av√¢riz and n√ºz√ºl replacing resm-i √ßift; this transition had begun by 1640. A typical defter record from the village of Eyucek in Antep shows that √ßiftliks held 10 √ßift, taxed at 40 ak√ße per √ßift, totalling 400 ak√ße; this, along with most of the village's other taxes (mostly taxes on individual crops), was paid to the fiefholder. Rates might vary for Muslims and nonmuslims; there are even instances of Muslim converts continuing to pay their \\"old\\" rate of tax. Landless peasants might pay Resm-i benn√¢k instead.

Following minor television roles between 1948 and 1965, he began to act on a regular basis during the 1970s, beginning with an appearance in a 1972 episode of Holly. Minor roles in shows including The Nearly Man, ITV Playhouse, Flambards and Fallen Hero followed later on in the decade. In 1984, in his 65th year, he landed his first regular television role, in How We Used to Live, with five appearances as George Holyrood.

Many of the Lebanese Argentines are descendants of immigrants, largely of Arab cultural and linguistic heritage and/or identity, originating from what is now Lebanon. Although a highly diverse group of Argentines ‚Äî in ancestral origins, religion and historic identities ‚Äî Lebanese Argentines hold a heritage that shares common linguistic, cultural and political traditions. They are closed related to the Syrian community and together are known as the sirio-libaneses (Syrian- Lebanese). The majority of the 1,500,000 Lebanese Argentines are Christians, with Muslims and Jews being a small minority in comparison to them. The interethnic marriage in the Lebanese community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Lebanese community in Argentina shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language. History In the 19th century, the first Lebanese settled in Argentina. From 1891 to 1920, 367,348 people of Arabic heritage immigrated into Argentina. When they were first processed in the ports of Argentina, they were classified as Turks because what is modern day Lebanon was a territory of the Turkish Ottoman Empire.Recopilaron casi 200 a√±os de los sirio libaneses en Argentina The causes for Lebanese to leave their homeland were an accelerated increase in demographics in Lebanon, the persecution by the Ottoman Turks, and the Italo-Turkish War.

It was in production, in three separate manufacturing versions, until 2004, when it was discontinued from sale in the U.S.A. In 2012 the gun has been reintroduced by Crosman. Design and Operation The Model 1322 is a pneumatic pump-action air pistol utilizing .22 (5.5 mm) caliber lead pellets. The pistol's integral pump lever mechanism is located underneath the barrel, integral to the forearm. This pump lever is cycled a variable number of times (up to a maximum of ten strokes) to store increasingly pressurized air in a chamber. When the trigger is activated, an air valve dumps the pressurized air into a transfer port integral to the breech, discharging the pellet from the barrel. According to the manufacturer, a maximum velocity of up to was achievable with ten pump strokes, using standard 14.3-grain .22 pellets.Crosman AirGuns, Crosman 1322 Medalist Owners Manual, p. 18Crosman AirGuns, Think Of It As A Rifle You Shoot With One Hand, Popular Mechanics, Vol. 154 No. 1 (July 1980), p. 139: Early Crosman advertisements listed a muzzle velocity of .

The Model 1322 was first introduced in 1977, and was produced over its lifetime in three distinct variants: Type I, 1977‚Äì81, Type II, made from 1978-1996, and Type III, 1998-2004. Type I featured a sliding metal breech cover, manual cocking using a three-ring external cocking knob, and a steel breech.Crosman, Field & Stream Magazine, Vol. 82 No. 1 (May 1977), p. 119: The Model 1322 used a solid zinc grip frame. The Type II adopted a plastic breech in place of the original steel version. The Type III dropped the external cocking knob and breech cover of prior types in favor of a brass bolt action mechanism that integrated loading and cocking functions.Crosman Products Dates of Manufacture , retrieved 17 April 2011 While the Model 1322 was not designed as a competition-level target airgun, its long rifled barrel makes the Model 1322 surprisingly accurate for a mass-produced air pistol.

The park was commissioned by magistrate D. Antonino La Grua e Talamanca, marquis of Regalmici, in 1777 with inspiration from Giovanni Meli. Construction began that year and was completed in 1778. It was extended and enlarged in 1866. Designed by Nicol√≤ Palma and named after Giulia Guevara (wife of Viceroy Marcantonio Colonna, prince of Stigliano, to whom the villa was dedicated), it was Palermo's first public park. The garden The original entrance overlooking the Foro Italico is of a monumental neoclassical design. It has been permanently closed, however, so access to the garden is now obtained through the primary entrance on Lincoln Street. That gate area is less developed. The heart of the villa is the dodecahedron fountain, featuring a sculpture of a dodecahedral marble clock created by the mathematician Lorenzo Federici, each face of the dodecahedron featuring a sundial. This is supported by a statue of Atlas by Ignazio Marabitti, set in the centre of a circular fountain. Decorations surrounding the fountain consist of various metal sculptures. Around the central fountain are four exedra, designed by Giuseppe Damiani Almeyda and intended to be used for musical performances. The entire central square was originally used for musical and theatrical entertainment. The southern exedra which faces the central fountain The four corners contained round seating areas, though only two of these still exist. The avenues of the garden are lined with various busts depicting notable people in the city's history.

It trends west-east, extending from approximately long. 297¬∞ to 309¬∞ E. The escarpment curves northward at the eastern edge of Tempe Terra where the northern segment of Kasei Valles debouches into Chryse and southwestern Acidalia Planitiae.

Antoniadi in 1930 to a telescopic albedo feature and canal centered at lat. 30¬∞ N., long. 55¬∞ W. (See List of Martian canals.) Scopulus is a descriptor term used in planetary geology for an irregular escarpment or cliff. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally adopted the name Nilokeras Scopulus in 1976. Scopulus is the Latin term for \\"crag\\" or cliff. Geology In geomorphology, an escarpment (usually shortened to scarp) is any steep, abrupt slope or cliff along the margin of a plateau, terrace, or other topographic bench. A scarp may be formed by tectonic, erosional, or depositional processes.Bloom, A.L. (1978) Geomorphology: A Systematic Analysis of Late Cenozoic Landforms; Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, p. 28. The term carries no implication of geologic origin. Nilokeras Scopulus likely formed from a combination of faulting and erosion from flood waters that formed Kasei Valles. Recent geologic mapping of the Kasei Valles region indicates that the west-to-east flow of the Kasei Valles floods followed the existing structural trend of rift valleys in southern Tempe Terra. Thus, the proto-Nilokeras Scopulus was probably an east-west oriented fault scarp or fracture zone (or zone of weaknessJ√∂ns, H-P. (1995). A Fossil Linear Zone of Weakness Beneath the Kasei Valles, Mars? 26th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1351. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1995/pdf/1351.pdf.) that was eroded and further downcut by at least one (and possibly two) episodes of early catastrophic flooding from the northern Tharsis region. (See outflow channels.) These floods occurred in Hesperian time between about 3.6 and 3.4 billion years ago (Gya). After initial flooding, the northern Kasei valley was covered by extensive late Hesperian-aged basaltic lava flows from Tharsis. Two final episode of flooding from the Echus Chasma region to the south occurred in Kasei Valles during Amazonian times (<1.8 Gya). The later floods carved the channels south of Nilokeras Scopulus and may not have strongly influenced development of the scarp. During the course of its history, Nilokeras Scopulus has been subjected to glacial/periglacial processes and modified by groundwater sapping, slumping, collapse, and other mass wasting processes. Rocks making up the scarp face are Noachian or Early Hesperian in age (>3.6 Gya). They probably consist of ancient impact breccias and volcanic materials. Layered bedrock is visible at the top of the escarpment in some medium and high resolution spacecraft images, but the scarp face is largely covered by talus aprons and dust.

Machapuchare from Annapurna Base Camp The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the mountain ranges of central Nepal. The total length of the route varies between 160‚Äì230 km (100-145 mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys and encircles the Annapurna Massif. The path reaches its highest point at Thorung La pass (5416m/17769 ft), touching the edge of the Tibetan plateau. Practically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the daily altitude gain is slower, and crossing the high Thorong La pass is easier and safer. In addition to the Annapurna Circuit Trek, Annapurna Seven Passes Trek or Annapurna Seven Hills trek is also popular in the region. However, this is less traversed and is off the beaten path trek in the region. The mountain scenery, seen at close quarters includes the Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu, Gangapurna, Tilicho Peak, Pisang Peak, and Paungda Danda. Numerous other peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna range. The trek begins at Besisahar or Bhulbhule in the Marshyangdi river valley and concludes in the Kali Gandaki Gorge. Besisahar can be reached after a seven-hour drive from Kathmandu. The trail passes along paddy fields and into subtropical forests, several waterfalls and gigantic cliffs, and various villages. Annapurna Circuit has often been voted as the best long-distance trek in the world, as it combined, in its old full form, a wide variety of climate zones from tropics at 600 m asl to the arctic at 5416 m asl at the Thorong La pass and cultural variety from Hindu villages at the low foothills to the Tibetan culture of Manang Valley and lower Mustang. Continuing construction of a road has shortened the trail and changed the villages. The Beisahar-Manag road has been built which passes through the trekking trail most of the time. With the construction of road, mountain biking is becoming popular, with Mustang, in particular, becoming one of the world's most popular mountain biking destinations.  Standard trek duration  The Annapurna Base Circuit trek usually takes about 15‚Äì20 days, leaving from Kathmandu with a stopover in Pokhara before returning to the capital. The trail is moderate to fairly challenging and makes numerous river crossings over steel and wooden suspension bridges. Tea houses and lodges along the circuit are available for meals and accommodations. Some groups may opt for tents but these are typically only used for side trips away from lodges such as climbing a peak.

Many trekkers short on time choose to fly out from Jomsom Airport, which shortens the trek by 6 days compared to the original AC. It is also possible to continue from Ghorepani to Tadapani, Ghandruk, Landruk, and then to Phedi, which follows the old Annapurna Circuit from the time when the road was not yet extended to Beni. This more faithful variation takes three days instead of the shorter one-day exit from Ghorepani to Pokhara outlined above. A popular addition to the AC is a visit to Annapurna Base Camp, ABC (also called Annapurna Sanctuary). This trail turns to the north from Tadapani and rejoins the old AC at either Ghandruk or Landruk. A visit to the ABC adds about 5 days to the duration of the Annapurna Circuit, slightly less than the normal trek duration to ABC, as trekkers coming from the AC are already acclimatized and \\"trail hardened\\". It is recommended that trekkers take the high trail from Pisang via Ghyaru and Ngawal to Manang, as the views are spectacular and the two villages along the route are some of the best-preserved samples of Tibetan style villages still in their original state. Sleeping in either of these villages assists with acclimatization, as they are located already higher than Manang. Another side trip gaining popularity is the visit to Tilicho Tal, a lake. There are now lodges along the trail and near the lake at the so-called Tilicho Base Camp, so tents are no longer required. If one wishes to cross to Jomsom via the Tilicho route, outdoor camping (and thus a tent) is required. At certain times of year, snow conditions can make the crossing dangerous or prevent it altogether. In October 2014, Seth Wolpin achieved the fastest known time in 72 hours and 4 minutes. He started in Besisahar and finished in Naya Pull, following all New Annapurna Trekking Trails.http://sethwolpin.com/2014/10/the- annapurna-circuit-going-round-and.html/http://trailrunningnepal.org/annapurna- circuit-trek-fastest-known-time-fkt/ It is reportedhttp://trailrunningnepal.org/new-annapurna-circuit-fastest-known-time- fkt/ that time has been recently surpassed by Greek athlete and philanthropist Lefteris Paraskevas, who, in May 2017 completed the classic route of the Circuit, from Besisahar to Nayapulin, in 68 hours and 22 minutes.  Annapurna circuit weather  While much of the Himalayas cannot be trekked in the wet season, much of the Annapurna circuit actually sits within a rain shadow. This means that it is possible to trek most parts of the circuit all year-round, including the monsoon period. Trekking in the wet season is often encouraged as hikers avoid the crowds that plague the summer months. However, the days are often damp and many of the views are obscured by clouds. = October ‚Äì November = This is the most popular hiking season in Nepal. Due to the recent monsoons, everything along the circuit is refreshed, clean and vibrant. Views are usually clear and the night sky is extremely visible. Though the weather is generally warm, nighttime temperatures drop below freezing. This is the busiest period on the circuit and tea houses book up very quickly. = December ‚Äì March = This is the coldest period on the circuit. Depending on the altitude, day time temperatures will be cold and nighttime temperatures drop well below freezing. The trade-off is that the trails are much less busy. Thorung La Pass, which stands at over 5,400 meters, is often blocked with snow and may be closed for days on end. Unless the snow blocks most trails, tea houses still remain open during this period. Clouds prevail more frequently, but clear days are still common. Towards March the rhododendrons start flowering, which brings hillsides alive with flaming colors. Unfortunately, this period is also when avalanches are most common. Completing the circuit might be possible during December but from January onward it becomes quite challenging and should be avoided unless advised by the locals. = April ‚Äì May = Because of the warming weather, April to May is the second most popular trekking season on the Annapurna Circuit. Most of the snow has dissipated, leaving crystal clear skies. There is often a strange haze that can be seen from the lower altitudes during May. However, this soon passes and cannot be seen from higher up the trail. As the monsoon period builds towards the end of May, the days become hotter and more humid which makes trekking at lower altitude quite uncomfortable. = June ‚Äì September = This is the monsoon period. Although there are stories of torrential downpours, mudslides and hordes of leeches, this is rarely the case on the Annapurna Circuit, particularly the northern section. Whilst the south section of the Annapurna Circuit near Pokhara does get a lot of rain, the northern parts often receive less than 10% of the precipitation due to the location within a rain shadow. The upside of trekking in the monsoon period is that many of the flora species flower during this period, making the trek exceptionally beautiful. This is also the time when the Tilicho Lake side trek is relatively easier.  History  The Annapurna area was opened to foreign trekkers in 1977 after the disputes between CIA backed Khampa guerrillas operating from the area into Tibet, and the local populace and Nepal army were settled. The original trek started from the market town of Dhumre situated at the Kathmandu - Pokhara highway and ended in Pokhara, and took about 23 days to complete. Road construction started in the early 1980s both from Dhumre to the north and from Pokhara to the west and then up the Kali Gandaki valley. The road has now reached Chamje on the Marsyangdi river valley and Muktinath on the Kali Gandaki side. Of the trek's original 23 days, only 5 walking days of the trek are now without a motor road. In places, new trails and routes have been marked so that the road can be partly avoided. The existence of the road has nevertheless changed the area, appearance, and atmosphere of the villages. The road facilitates transport, increasing the popularity of mountain biking in the area. Since 2011, companies in Muktinath and Jomsom rent out mountain bikes to tourists. As the road sees very little traffic, and one can ride downhill (dirt road and/or single track) from Muktinath to Tatopani and descend almost 3000 meters in 2‚Äì3 days. New areas near Annapurna have been opened for trekkers in the past years, such as Upper Mustang, Naar-Pho Valley, Manaslu and Tsum Valley. Currently, trekking these areas is restricted and subject to extra permits, costs, and other limitations. 2014 blizzard In October 2014, a sudden blizzard killed over 43 people, half of whom were Nepalese.Annapurna blizzardNepalese tragedy It was caused by the tail end of a dying cyclone which had ravaged the eastern coast of India; there were about 350 hikers caught in the blizzard.Hikers caught in blizzard  Communications  Multiple locations of the trek circuit now have an Internet connection. This multi-district circuit's trekkers can use wireless internet across different districts like in Kaski, Myagdi, Lamjung and Mustang. Cellular 3G is also available at some locations.

She was probably best remembered for her portrayal of Rhys Macchesney in the play The Three of Us. Early life Carlotta Nillson was born on February 25, 1876, inCarlota Nillson, Find a Grave MemorialCarlotta Nillson, Passenger Manifest SS April 11, 1927, Ancestry.com scan Sm√•land, SwedenNational Magazine, 1907, pg. 326 (Free Google Books) and was raised by her widowed mother. When she was about ten her mother brought her to America where they first settled in Wisconsin and later Minnesota. Nillson's mother was very poor at the time and it was soon decided that she should live with a more affluent neighbor with a large family. Though too young to be a nanny, Nillson was expected to entertain the younger children of the household. Because of her circumstances Nillson was not a happy child (later describing herself as being \\"born old\\") and at first found this chore somewhat challenging. This she overcame when it was discovered she had a knack for conjuring up fairy tales rich with goblins, sea pirates and fairies who lived in ice caves along the North Sea.The Theatre Magazine; Vol. 7; pg. 237 Several years later Nillson and her mother moved to San Francisco where the young teenager managed to be hired as a walk-on player with Madame Modjeska's stock company. Nillson's stage debut followed in a road production of Friedrich Schiller's play Mary Stuart. Modjeska had noticed how emotional Nillson became during Mary's (Modjeska) execution scene and cast her as one of the maids that accompanied the Scottish Queen to the scaffold.The Theatre Magazine; Vol. 7; pg. 237 Career Scenes from The Happy Life and The Private Secretary Theatre Magazine, 1907 Carlotta Nillson later moved to New York where she worked for Augustin Daly for a time and then went on a grueling forty-week tour of one-night stands as the ing√©nue in William Gillette's The Private Secretary (a.k.a. Digbey's Secretary) and later toured in John Stetson's The Crust of Society. After touring in Bronson Howard's Civil War play Shenandoah, Nillson decided to take some time off to hone her craft in England under the tutelage of William Farren Jr. and Genevi√®ve Ward. She returned to the theatre in 1898 as Mrs. Dasney in the West End production of Pearl Craigie's The Ambassador at the St. James Theatre and the following year at Terry's Theatre as Evelyn in The Happy Life.Carlotta Nillson ‚Äì Who's Who in the Theatre; 1916; pg. 469 Nillson made her Broadway debut as the slave girl Eunice, in a revival of Stanislaus Stange's Quo Vadis in December 1900 at the Academy of Music Opera House and would remain in demand throughout the decade in Broadway productions and road tours. She was probably best remembered by audiences of that time for her performances as Mrs. Elvsted in Hedda Gabler opposite Minnie Maddern Fiske, the title role in Pinero's Letty and Rhys Macchesney in the Rachel Crothers play The Three of Us, over its long run at the Madison Square Theatre. She twice played the title role in C. M. S. McLellan's melodrama Leah Kleschna, first in the silent film version (her only film released by the Famous Players Film Company) in 1913 and then in a road production produced by Daniel Frohman a year or two later.Orpheum Theatre-Fairbanks Daily News-Miner - Friday, February 12, 1915, Fairbanks, Alaska: col 1; pg. 4Carlotta Nillson ‚Äì Who's Who in the Theatre; 1916; pg. 469Leah Kleschna - Internet Movie Database In 1913 Nillson formed the Deborah Company and began a tour of North America playing the title role in Deborah by William Legrand Howlaind. Deborah was a story about a sheltered young woman who desperately wanted to have a baby. The play premiered in Toronto in May 1913 and was soon shut down and the cast arrested after some objected that the play was immoral. A judge later squashed the charges and the play reopened in June at Toronto's Princess Theatre and ran for a week. Afterward though, the play was eventually abandoned.The Man In The Green Goggles: Clergymen And Theatre Censorship (Toronto, 1912-13 by L.W.

During the Civil War he served as the Commissary-General of Prisoners and set policy for the treatment and release of prisoners.Buescher, John. \\"Who Earned a Medal for Cutting Costs by Starving Confederate Prisoners?\\" Teachinghistory.org, accessed September 24, 2011.  Biography  = Early life and education = William Hoffman Jr. was born in New York. He was the son of Lieutenant Colonel William Hoffman Sr., who fought in the War of 1812. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1829. He was a classmate of Robert E. Lee. = Early military career = Hoffman's early military career was on the frontier. Between 1829 and 1836 he was stationed at either Jefferson Barracks in Missouri or Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. In 1832 he fought in the Black Hawk War. On November 16, 1836 he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, 6th U.S. Infantry. Hoffman then moved south to Fort Jesup and Camp Sabine in Louisiana before fighting in the Second Seminole War from 1837‚Äì1842. On February 1, 1838 he was promoted to captain, 6th U.S. Infantry. In 1842 he served in the Recruiting Service before being posted at Fort Smith in Arkansas. In 1846 he mustered volunteers into the military before his engagement in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During the war with Mexico between 1846 and 1847, Hoffman was engaged in the march through Chihuahua, the Siege of Vera Cruz, the Battle of Cerro Gordo, a skirmish at Amazoque, the Capture of San Antonio, the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, where he was wounded. On August 20, 1847 Hoffman was brevetted to major for gallant and meritorious conduct in the Battles of Contreras and Churubusco. He was also involved in the Battle of Molino del Rey, the Battle of Chapultepec, and the Assault and Capture of Mexico City. He was brevetted a lieutenant colonel on September 8, 1847 for his gallant and meritorious conduct in the Battle of Molino del Rey. Between the war with Mexico and the Civil War Hoffman served on recruiting duty for two years before returning to the frontier. There he was garrisoned again at Fort Leavenworth and was promoted to major, 5th U.S. Infantry, on April 15, 1851. He returned to Jefferson Barracks in 1852 and was transferred back to the 6th U.S. Infantry the same year. From 1852‚Äì1854 he was garrisoned at Newport Barracks in Kentucky. He returned to the frontier in 1854 with his posting at Fort Laramie in the Dakota Territory. He was involved in the Sioux Expedition of 1855, the Utah Expedition of 1858 and the March to California the same year. Hoffman relocated to California for frontier duty in the Mojave Country and Benicia, California. On October 17, 1860 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, 8th U.S. Infantry, and was transferred to San Antonio, Texas. = Civil War = Hoffman was in San Antonio at the start of the American Civil War. He was taken as a prisoner of war by the Confederates when Brigadier General David E. Twiggs surrendered the Union command on February 18, 1861. On April 25, 1862 he was promoted to colonel, 3rd U.S. Infantry, while still a prisoner of war, and was released in a prisoner exchange on August 27, 1862. He was reassigned to Washington, D.C. where that year he became Commissary-General of Prisoners. The Office of the Commissary-General of Prisoners had been organized on October 7, 1861 under the Quartermaster General's Department. It was made directly responsible to the Secretary of War on June 17, 1862, so when Hoffman took the position, he had access to the top of the military and political structure. On November 11, 1864 the office was divided into an Eastern and Western Branch. Hoffman, who had been in charge of the whole office up to that date, was placed in charge of the Eastern Branch. On February 1, 1865, it was restructured as a single unit, and Hoffman was placed in charge overall again. Over 104,000 Confederate soldiers deserted the army during the war, with a third of them surrendering to the Union army. In addition, the army captured thousands of soldiers, whom they held as prisoners of war, transferring them away from the fronts to camps set up to house them. The two governments negotiated a prisoner exchange, which operated from 1862 and 1863 before it broke down for a variety of reasons. The Union was not prepared to handle the number of prisoners it took in and scrambled to set up facilities. On both sides, the prison camps were overcrowded, suffered food shortages and poor sanitation, and were plagued with infectious disease. In 1862 some of the Confederate prisoners of war refused to be exchanged, saying they would not return to the South. Hoffman, working with President Abraham Lincoln and War Secretary Edwin Stanton, developed a procedure whereby Confederate prisoners of war and deserters could swear allegiance to the Union to gain their release. Release requests from Union officials, Confederate soldiers, and Southern family members came to Hoffman's office for review and evaluation. Hoffman believed deserters, because they had already renounced their military obligation to the Confederacy, provided an opportunity to \\"reconstruct\\" the rebel soldiers and undermine the Confederate war effort. Military field commanders could administer the oath of allegiance to deserters if they could verify their stories and be assured they were not spies. He believed that prisoners of war presented a problem, as they could return to their units or act as spies. They could only be released after Hoffman's staff reviewed each case individually and the release was approved by Secretary of War Stanton. To encourage desertion, the Union started to offer incentives to Confederate soldiers, such as transportation home. Hoffman narrowed the conditions for Confederates to take the oath of allegiance, and the number of prisoners released decreased dramatically. On October 7, 1864 Hoffman was brevetted to brigadier general for faithful and meritorious services during the Rebellion, and then brevetted to major general on March 13, 1865, for faithful, meritorious and distinguished services as Commissary-General of Prisoners during the Rebellion. He served in the post of Commissary-General until November 3, 1865. = Later career and death = After the Civil War, Hoffman was placed in command of regiments at St. Louis, Missouri from 1865‚Äì1866 and Fort Leavenworth from 1866‚Äì1868. He was on leave from March 6, 1868 ‚Äì April 26, 1869 when he became the Superintendent of the General Recruiting Service. He retired from the army on May 1, 1870 as a colonel. Hoffman retired to Rock Island, Illinois where he married his second wife. He and his wife Mary started a school for girls there. Hoffman died in 1884 and was buried in Chippiannock Cemetery in Rock Island.  See also  * List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union)  References   External links  * Gen.

This high-energy compound combusts spontaneously and can only be studied in a solution.Wilberg, E.; Michaud, H.: Z. Naturforsch. B 9 (1954) S. 500.Gmelins Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, 8th Edition, Silicon Supplement Volume B4, Springer-Verlag 1989, S. 46. A further coordination to a six-fold coordinated structure such as a hexaazido silicide [Si(N3)6]2‚àí or as an adduct with bicationic ligands Si(N3)4L2 will result in relatively stable, crystalline solids that can be handled at room temperature.  Preparation  Silicon tetraazide is synthesized by conversion of silicon tetrachloride with sodium azide in benzene. 340px The reaction of silicon tetrachloride with an excess of sodium azide at room temperature in acetonitrile will result in the formation of sodium hexaazidosilicide which by adding ligands such as 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline will result in stable silicon tetraazide adducts. Other bases such as pyridine and tetramethylethylenediamine will not react with the hexaazido silicide ion. 566px Another preparation of a bis(triphenylphosphino)iminiumhexaazido silicide salt ((PPN)2Si(N3)6, [Ph3P=NPPh3][Si(N3)6]) is possible by conversion of bis(triphenylphosphino)iminium azide (PPNN3, [Ph3P=NPPh3]+N3‚àí) with silicon tetrachloride in acetonitrile.  Properties  Silicon tetraazide is a white crystalline compound that will detonate at even 0 ¬∞C. The pure compound, and also silicon chloride triazide and silicon dichloride diazide contaminated samples, can detonate spontaneously without clear cause.Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 7th revised edition, Academic Press 2006, The compound is susceptible to hydrolysis. It is soluble in diethylether and benzene. The addition compound with 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine is much more stable. A melting point of 212 ¬∞C with a melting enthalpy of 110 J¬∑g‚àí1 is recorded. The DSC measurement shows at 265 ¬∞C a sharp exothermic reaction with an enthalpy of ‚àí2400 J¬∑g‚àí1. Similar results are found for the addition compound with 1,10-phenanthroline. As the hemiacetonitrile solvatated isolated compound expels solvent at 100 ¬∞C, and shows then in the DSC measurement from 240 ¬∞C onwards a strong exothermic reaction with a generated heat of 2300 J¬∑g‚àí1. The enthalpies are higher than that of sodium azide with ‚àí800 J¬∑g‚àí1,T. Grewer: Thermal Hazards of Chemical Reactions, Industrial Safety Series 4, Elsevier 1994. but still lower than the values encountered with classic explosives such as RDX with ‚àí4500 J¬∑g‚àí1. The addition compounds are stable in solution. It can be concluded from IR-spectroscopy and proton NMR data that no dissociation occurs in silicon tetraazide and 2,2'-bipyridine or for example 1,10-phenanthroline. The bis(triphenylphosphino)iminiumhexaazidosilicate salt ((PPN)2Si(N3)6) on the other hand is relatively stable. the compound melts at 214 ¬∞C and shows in the DSC measurement at 250 ¬∞C a reaction. One mass spectrometry coupled thermogravimetric analysis investigation indicated as reaction products nitrogen, silicon tetraazide and hydrazoic acid.  Applications  A practical application of free silicon tetraazide is unlikely due to the high instability. In solution the compound has potential uses as raw material for nitrogen-rich materials. One application as reagent in the manufacture of polyolefins has been patented.Nomura, M.; Tomomatsu, R.; Shimazaki, T.: EP 206 034 (1985) pdf-Download The stabilized adducts can serve as energetic compounds as a replacement for lead azide.

G. (2010). Relationship Rewards. In Social Psychology (10th ed., pp. 418-420). New York: McGraw-Hill. More clearly stated this means people are attracted to those who in some way make them feel good, or are attracted to those who remind them of people that they enjoy being around. Effects on attraction We are attracted to those that we find it satisfying and gratifying to be with. If a relationship gives us more reward and pleasure than cost and pain, we will like that relationship and wish it to continue. Thus, even after a relationship ends, we may find ourselves drawn to people that remind us of the former person. This can help explain why no love can feel quite the same as that \\"first\\". These \\"firsts\\" can generate sensations so new and unfamiliar that the experience feels almost unreal.Dixit, J. (2010, January 1). Heartbreak and Home Runs: The Power of First Experiences. Psychology Today. Retrieved from http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200912/ heartbreak-and- home-runs-the-power-first-experiences Besides emotional engagement, these experiences also have a heavy dose of novelty. Novelty simply driving up dopamine and norepinephrine (brain systems associated with focus and paying attention and rewards). A first romantic relationship is the only time in which an individual is in \\"love\\" without ever having been hurt from such a relationship. If a person meets someone who reminds them of an ex, whether physically or a similarity in attitudes, gestures, voice, or interests, it may engage the representation in their memory. And since their first love, by result of its novelty and emotional significance, is potentially the most prominent, it may be the representation that is summoned when they meet a potential someone new, which effects the way they see that new relationship. Their old feelings, motivations, and expectations are all transferred into their memory, which can cause them to (if their new found partner reminds them of an ex) begin to repeat behaviors that they engaged in with that ex. The fact that people are attracted to those who make them feel good can also explain why people are attracted to those they cannot have. Forbidden love is the most intense. Again, dopamine plays a major role. Beyond pleasure, dopamine is also associated with focus, motivation, and goal-oriented behavior. When a person cannot get somebody, the dopamine system keeps on spitting out hormones, providing the adrenaline, focus and motivation necessary to keep trying.Chen, S. (2009, July 20). Bloodlust: What Women Want. Psychology Today. Retrieved from http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200908/bloodlust-what-women-want =Other influences explained= The reward theory also helps explain why people are more attracted to people of close proximity, of more attractiveness, more similar, and people who have feelings of mutuality. Proximity is rewarding. It cost less effort to receive friendship's benefits with someone who lives or works closer. People like attractive people because they perceive that attractive people offer other desirable traits, and they benefit from associating with them. If others have similar opinions as ourselves we feel rewarded because we presume that they like us in return. People also like to be liked and love to be loved. Therefore, liking is usually mutual because we like those who like us in return. Original research =Pawel Lewicki (1985)= Conditioning creates positive feelings towards things and people linked with rewarding events. Pawel Lewicki in 1985 tested this liking-by-association principle by conducting an experiment on students at the University of Warsaw. In the experiment students were given the option of choosing which of two pictured women (woman A or woman B) looked friendlier. Students were 50-50 in choosing which was friendlier. Other students, however, before viewing the pictures interacted with a warm and friendly experimenter who resembled woman A, chose woman A at a margin of 6 to 1. In a follow up study, the experimenter acted unfriendly toward half of the participants. When these participants later had to turn in their data to one of the two women, they almost always avoided the one who looked like the \\"unfriendly\\" experimenter. =Griffit (1970)= In Griffit's study college students that evaluated strangers in a pleasant room liked them better than students who evaluated strangers in an uncomfortably hot room. Recent research =Helen Fisher (Yale University)= Helen Fisher and colleagues conducted a neuroimaging study on men and women that had just \\"fallen madly in love\\". Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they collected data on 10 women and 7 men that reported being in love an average of 7.4 months. Each participant was shown a picture of their loved one as well as a photograph of an emotionally neutral person, each viewing was then followed by a distraction task to cleanse the mind of strong emotions. Brain activation with the picture of the loved one was high in the region of the brain that produces and distributes dopamine and also brains \\"reward system\\", or the neural network associated with pleasure, arousal, focus, and motivation.Fisher, H. (n.d.). The Drive to Love: The Neural Mechanism for Mate Selection. In R. J. Sternberg & K. Weis (Eds.), The New Psychology of Love (pp. 87-110). Retrieved from http://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/15npolve.pdf =Gingrich, Liu, Cascio, Wang, and Insel (2000)= In 2000 animal studies were conducted that supported that attraction is associated with elevated activity in central dopamine. In the experiment a female lab-raised prairie vole was mated with a male, and formed a distinct preference for him associated with a 50% increase of dopamine. When a dopamine antagonist was injected into the reward region of the brain, she no longer had the preference for the male. =Helen Fisher (2005)= In 2005 Fisher and colleagues conducted a second fMRI study in which participants were still in love with a past partner. The study included 10 women and 5 men. The rejected participants viewed pictures of their ex and of a similar, emotionally neutral individual. Within the participants dopamine was again increased with viewing of the photographs.

Resulting from the collaboration of economists from both developing and developed countries at the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures in Barcelona, Spain, the Barcelona Development Agenda outlines seven lessons learned from previous policy failures and successes, and presents them as priorities for future economic reforms. The principles emphasize a balance of market and government economic roles, flexible economic tools, and an increased role for sustainability and equity in governance. Background The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures met in Barcelona, Spain from May 9 to September 26, 2004 to promote human rights, diversity, peace, and sustainable development. On the last two days of the Forum, economists from organizations around the world met to discuss the impacts of economic policies, especially global policies, on developing countries. The opening statement of the agenda laid out the discussion of the meeting: Based on trends and concerns the participants noted in international development policy, the agenda outlined principles for policy implementation that reflected both widely accepted principles of macroeconomics, such as the importance of market development, and improved understanding of challenges and solutions in developing markets, such as capital inequity and environmental impacts. Agenda's observations regarding current policy =Three encouraging trends= *Gains in human rights in many developing countries: Though there are still examples of rights violations in many places around the globe, there is a general and increasing trend of recognition and implementation of human rights and democratic principles worldwide. Additionally, though human rights records are not always indicative of the strength of an economy, development and human rights causes are often similar. *Rapid growth in several countries that has pulled millions of people out of poverty: Development policies already in place have managed to increase the income of millions of people in some of the most highly populated developing countries on the planet, including China and India. While successful development paths are highly variable depending on the particular circumstances of each country, the right combination of policies and resources has the capacity to affect rapid change. *Recognition of the importance of macroeconomic stability: Though some economic adjustment policies have failed to produce stabilized economies, the consensus is now that macroeconomic stability (e.g., reduced inflation) is necessary for successful implementation of other development policies, as well as accelerating growth. =Three reasons for concern= *Recurring systemic financial crises affecting developing states: The application of Washington Consensus-style free markets and financial arrangements has not been beneficial for all developing states that have adopted them. The economies and financial systems of several countries that adopted them, particularly in Latin America, stagnated or suffered declines. It was presumed until this point that western-style policies were applicable across a broad spectrum of political situations, but assumptions made by these policies, especially in reference to markets and information flow, were flawed. *Lack of sustained growth in many regions that adopted reforms: In addition to financial difficulties experienced by some developing countries after adopting some economic reforms, other economies experienced growth which subsequently stagnated. *Persistence and growth of distributional inequalities in many developing states: When growth has occurred in developing countries, it is often disproportionately benefits wealthier households which makes equitable development more difficult. Not only does inequality reduce savings rates, promote inefficiency, and consolidate power, but it has the potential to destabilize social systems. Seven Lessons and Priorities for Reform Proposed by the Agenda #Institutional quality and market orientation matter: For successful development to occur, institutions such as property rights and the rule of law must be established and improved, though the exact form of these is heavily dependent on historical and cultural context. Additionally, markets should be balanced by state regulation, as assumptions involving a pure market economy are rarely met in developing countries. Lastly, though the mechanics are not provided for, equitable distribution of income is stated as an additional basis of successful development strategies. #Poor financial policies are barriers to development: Weak and maladjusted fiscal policy tends to inhibit development, and disproportionally affects low-income households upon failure. Large public debt can burden governments with debt service obligations that consume a significant proportion of the GDP. Large amounts of private debt can inhibit innovation and expansion in private sector industry. Poorly regulated financial institutions, such as some banks, and loose monetary policies, such as expanded money supply and credit are serious barriers to development. #Sustained growth cannot be guaranteed by a single set of policies: Development solutions that can trigger sustained growth will vary depending on the historical, cultural, and social attributes of a particular country. The primary impact of this is that states should have the flexibility to experiment with different economic policies that suit their specific context. Experimentation with different bundles of industrialization, technology development and acquisition, import/export, and other policies should be encouraged. Constraints to growth should be identified and addressed through both macro and microeconomic policies. #Multilateral trade negotiations should proceed in a manner that promotes development: Whereas protectionism in developed countries creates obstacles for market entry and expansion in developing countries, trade negotiations should include stakeholders from impacted states. Additionally, trade policies in developing countries should be examined to identify and correct those that limit growth. (Note: at the time of the BDA, it was hoped that the Doha Round would reduce trade barriers between and among developed and developing countries. Though currently stalled, there have been recent calls to restart negotiations.) #Current international financial relationships are faulty: Financial arrangements between developed and developing countries are often defective, insufficient, and detrimental to the recipients. This is largely due to missing or malfunctioning markets within the countries, and a lack of mechanisms to share risk between lenders and recipients. As such, financial capital flows tend to be volatile, and are underregulated by international lending institutions. Additionally, aid levels tend to be inadequate to address some financial problems in developing markets. Both unbalanced risk and shortage of aid are likely the result of lack of representation of recipient countries in decision-making processes regarding financial arrangements. #Labor and financial capital are not treated equally: Movement of different types of capital across international boundaries is not balanced. Current policies, especially in developed nations, favor the transfer of financial capital, but often discourage the movement of labor capital across borders. Increased migration of workers along with sufficient protection (e.g. workers rights, market integration) of labor has the potential to increase both equity and efficiency in production and service provision. Improved labor capital mobility can also increase financial capital exchange through remittances. #National and global sustainable development policies are necessary to address growing environmental problems: Whereas previous models on development ignored, misunderstood, or underestimated the environmental impact of growth policy, updated models must internalize and address the environmental impacts of development. As impacts including soil degradation, climate change, and reduced water quality and availability disproportionately impact developing countries and low-income families, sustainable development policies must address these impacts, whether through prevention or alleviation. However, economic policies in developed countries must also address domestic environmental impacts, some of which are exported to developing economies. Application Though no initiatives have been directly undertaken as a result of the Barcelona Development Agenda, the Center for International Relations and Development Studies (CIDOB, Centre d‚ÄôInvestigaci√≥ de Relacions Internacionals i Desenvolupament) has been working to implement some of the BDA principles into the Ibero-American Development Agenda (ADI, Agenda de Desarrollo Iberoamericana). The ADI has a goal of A collaboration between Latin American governments, economics, sociologists, and political scientists, principles stated in the BDA are being implemented through collaborative policy decision-making in the ADI.

It originally formed part of the Souvan family estate in 1885, which was taken over by the University of Ljubljana in 1952 and legally declared a place of cultural and natural heritage of national importance. Now independent of the university, it is the most visited botanical garden in Slovenia and in recent years has become well known for its spring flower shows. The arboretum is primarily a botanical garden for woody plants, the only one in Slovenia.http://www.culture.si/en/Arboretum_Vol%C4%8Dji_Potok Culture.si: Arbortetum Volƒçji Potok  History  The Volƒçji Potok estate, located near Kamnik, was already mentioned by Valvasor in the 17th century. The picture printed in his book presents the old castle at the top of the hill (first mentioned in 1220) as being already in ruins, and the newest mansion at the foot of the hill, built by Bonhomo family. The estate changed owners several times; the Bonhomo family was followed by the Burger family, then the Gozani family, and in 1882 it came into the ownership of Ferdinand Souvan. He rebuilt the mansion in 1885 and planted a park encircled by walls. His son Leon Souvan enlarged the park by pulling down the walls and planted around 12 hectares with domestic and exotic trees. In place of the demolished walls he planted a beech tree hedge at the south and southwest edge. The park was a venue for Slovene impressionists, including Matija Jama. The 300-year-old mansion was plundered and burned by the Partisans on 15 April 1944.≈Ωajdela, Ivo. 1991. Komunistiƒçni zloƒçini na Slovenskem, vol 2. Ljubljana: ƒåZP Novo jutro, p. 7.Jakiƒç, Ivan. 1997. Vsi slovenski gradovi: leksikon slovenske grajske zapu≈°ƒçine. Ljubljana: DZS, p. 373. After Leon Souvan died, the park came under the management of the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry in 1952, today the Biotechnical faculty, University of Ljubljana. The collaboration with the university ended in 1965. The arboretum was financially independent between 1965 and 1999 and has therefore shifted to manufacturing and services. Since 1999 it has been under the management of the Slovene Ministry of Culture.  Mission  The Volƒçji Potok Arboretum institute, established in 2003, manages the arboretum. It is responsible for expanding the park and garden culture in Slovenia, as well as for other cultural state-owned monuments of cultivated nature. It cooperates with similar institutions worldwide. The professional staff evaluations and develops the arboretum collection.  Estate  The original entrance tree avenue from the 19th century is continuous with the central part of the park and is geometrically formed in a French style. Other parts are in English style. The geometrical park, designed in 1918 by Leo Souvan, stood front of the mansion. The park leads up to the old park in the immediate vicinity of the former mansion. Two stone tables are surrounded by two horse chestnut trees and two plane trees, all originating in the 19th century. A hill overgrown with forest and an archaeological site at the top forms a background to the plantation at the north. At the top of the hill there are ruins of pentagonal Romanesque residential tower, originating in the 13th century, and of walled a castle courtyard with a Renaissance bastille at the entrance from the 16th century. The arboretum produces plants in its own nurseries, runs a garden centre, employs a group of landscape architects, and does practical landscaping all over Slovenia. The arboretum itself comprises 88 hectares of ground with a diversity of soil types, occupied by about 2,500 different species of trees and shrubs. The plant collection has been designed as a landscape park. The park includes five artificial lakes and 30 hectares of forest, which houses a particularly important union of fir and three-lobed moss (Bazzania trilobata).  Collections  Trees and bushes belong to the basic botanical species from Europe, North America, and Asia as well as to cultivars that have been raised for ornamental purposes. The richest collections of species are maple, linden trees, birch and beech. There is also a collection of cultivars of fan-maple (Acer palmatum), scaly conifers, rhododendrons, and roses, and a collection of evergreen deciduous trees. In 2003 and 2004 an interactive herbarium was established online. The collection consists of selected non-native and native woody plants from the arboretum. The park gallery, renovated in 1991 by the architect Andrej Kemer and designer Miljenko Licul, exhibits Janez Boljka's collection of animal statues. On the ground floor there is a hall for receptions and wedding ceremonies. It hosts various cultural events and exhibitions; for example, the exhibition of Minimundus models, which also presented a model of Bled Castle for the first time in 2010.

The adult males grow up to long, while females reach in length. Their bodies are usually gray, brown, or olive-coloured, and their antennae are relatively short and robust. The tibiae of the hind legs are blue, while the femora are orange. The hind femora have characteristic dark marks. They are easily identifiable also by the characteristic eyes with vertical black and white stripes. Their pronota show a dorsal orange stripe and several white small spots. The wings are clear with dark marks.Ostravska Univerzita Wildside Holidays Biology This species is a folivore, essentially feeding on leaves of various plants. It is a solitary species, not harmful to crops. Adults can mainly be encountered in August and September, but they are active throughout the year. After mating, these grasshoppers overwinter as adults. Spawning occurs in spring just under the soil surface and the nymphs appear in April. These grasshoppers undergo several molts. The nymphs have the appearance of the adults, their color varies from yellow to bright green and ocher and the wings are absent or small, as they are gradually developed after each molting.

On 25 August 1628 he was sent from Douay, with nine other students, under the care of the Rev. Joseph Harvey, to take possession of the newly founded English College of Lisbon. There he pursued his theological studies under Thomas White (alias Blackloe), and by degrees became professor of philosophy and divinity, doctor in the latter faculty, and president of the college. Afterwards he returned to England, and was elected dean of the Old Chapter at the general assembly held in November 1657, but he did not take the oath attached to the office until 14 October 1660, although in the meantime he acted in the capacity of dean. Some Jesuits and Franciscans were opposed to the reintroduction of a Catholic bishop in England. Claudius Agretti, canon of Bruges and minister apostolic in Belgium, sent by Pope Clement IX on a mission to examine Catholic affairs in England in 1669, stated in his report that Ellis was anxious for the confirmation of the status of the chapter; and was willing that the Pope should create afresh a new dean and chapter.

The Stem Cell Lineage Database (SCLD) was created by the University of Connecticut in order to have a more user friendly approach to retrieve and share data. The purpose of the Stem Cell Lineage Database is to consolidate the three key components into a database that is accessible and capable of storing information \\"about cell type gene expression, cell lineage maps and stem cell differentiation protocols for both human and mouse stem cells and endogenous developmental lineages\\". One of the major factors that separates SCLD from other stem cell databases is that it allows users to edit information pertaining to cell types, markers, and lineages. The database allows user to update information found from the organic developmental stages and it also allows users to discuss experimental practices that altered the stem cells. Stem cells are cells in the body that can divide indefinitely in a culture and can be formulated into specialized cells. In biological research, these cells have become a subject of extensive research. With these cells, scientists will be able to better understand how these cells are differentiated by the process of turning on and off genes. Through this research, scientists will be able to better understand certain diseases such as cancer and how these diseases arise. As stem cell research continues, scientists will need a database to store and share their information and research. Three key components are necessary for this database to be effective: cell type-specific gene expression profiles, anatomical and developmental relationships between cells and tissues and signals important for development and differentiation of stem cells to mature cell types. Database usage The purpose of the database is to provide an openly available, quick reference for information pertaining to stem cell lineages. Ini the database, researchers can acquire information that can influence the expression(s) of stem cells, such information includes: experimental details such as time required, reagents, and the physical manipulations necessary to transition between cell types. By having this information openly available to the public, it gives researchers a place to meet and share information that could possibly enhance the experimental success of stem cell research as well as provide techniques to influence stem cells down specific pathways. Also, another feature of the database is that it includes information based on in vivo and in vitro lineages. One could go in and compare certain lineage factors between in vivo and in vitro, as well as look at what factors influence the stem cells down specific pathways. One flaw to the system is that anyone can create an account and go into the database and change information. However, if an error or such actions did take place, a person who notices the change to be incorrect can contact the database management and they will conduct the necessary measures to correct it. Currently, the database only includes human and mouse stem cell lineages, but the database hopes to expand into more species. However, they did not specify which species they wanted to expand to. This database could potentially help identify the subcomponents and understand the workings of hematopoiesis. Currently, research is being conducted to identify transcription control on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. The Stem Cell Lineage Database could help compare stem cell information around the world and eliminate taking a global gene expression profiling approach, which although sufficient, is not as effective as it could be. There are other forms of Stem Cell Databases such as SyStemCell that is used to consolidate information gained by researchers focusing on stem cells. The needs for these databases are increasing with the amount of research being discovered. Human and mouse homology in stem cells Currently, the SCLD has stem cell information for only human stem cells and mice stem cells. However, the SCLD does have the intentions to add more species to their database. Due to the ethical constraints of conducting stem cell research on humans, the use of mice has been for advances in this field of study. \\"The most salient ethical values implicated by the use of human participants in research are beneficence (doing good), non‚Äêmaleficence (preventing or mitigating harm), fidelity and trust within the fiduciary investigator/participant relationship, personal dignity, and autonomy pertaining to both informed, voluntary, competent decision making and the privacy of personal information\\". Approximately 70.1% of amino acids are conserved between mice and humans, this allows for many studies in mice to be applied to the human complications. Also when the mouse genome is compared to that of a human genome, approximately 99% has a direct counterpart in the human genome. The two mammals share common similarities because they are derived from a common ancestor that dates back 75 million years ago. Even though this divergence was millions of years ago, only about 300 of the 30,000 genes found in the mouse have no correlation to the human genome. With this research finding, scientists will be able to conduct research in a more ethical and safer way. Advancements in stem cell research =Sickle cell anemia= In one experiment, they used a chimera of mouse and human stem cells to address sickle cell anemia treatment. There are still many issues that need to be addressed before performing stem cell therapeutic techniques on humans, but advancements are being made in model organisms with homologous structures. In the sickle cell anemia example mentioned, they made a humanized sickle cell anemia mouse model by implanting human alpha-globin genes in place of mouse alpha-globin genes, and they replaced the beta-globin genes of the mouse with sickle cell effected human beta-globin genes. Following this induction, mice formed symptoms similar to the symptoms of humans with sickle cell anemia. Through retroviral transduction of combinations of transcription factors, human and mice fibroblast cells were reprogrammed to pluripotent-stem cell- like cells (also termed ‚Äúinduced pluripotent stem cells,‚Äù or iPS). This was used to revert these cells into stem cell-like structures that did not differentiate, and therefore did not have a specified fate (allows cells to become almost any cell within the organism). Next, they wanted to test whether or not hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) would derive from the reprogrammed iPS cells and correct the sickle cell phenotype. Through many tests, they verified that the HPs had derived from the iPS cells. Later in their results, they concluded that when these iPS cells were introduced into sickle cell anemia positive mice, they significantly improved the sickle cell anemia and that these mice were comparable to those of the control mice who were not infected with sickle cell anemia. =Multilineage potential of mesenchymal stem cells= Fetal tissue stem cells can give rise to a variety of differentiated cell types. However, many adult tissues contain populations of stem cells that have the capacity for renewal after trauma, disease, or aging. Stem cells found in human adult bone marrow also possess the ability to differentiate into different cell types as well. These adult bone marrow cells give rise to mesenchymal stem cells these give rise to the regeneration of mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, adipose, and stroma. Unwanted cells were isolated through the process of a density gradient. After this process, the removal of hematopoietic stem cells and nonadherent cells were removed by changes in the medium. In the expanded cultures, hematopoietic stem cells were not found. The mesenchymal cells appeared to be different from marrow fibroblastic cells. \\"As many as 50 million to 375 million cells were generated from a 10-ml marrow aspirate that was obtained from 19- to 57-year-old donors. This range of yield is expected for the expansion of primary cells. We isolated these cells from the marrow of over 350 donors, and the expanded mesenchymal cells from at least 50 donors were tested in three lineage assays, with all tested donors responding positively in these assays. The cells did not differentiate spontaneously during culture expansion. Similarly isolated marrow mesenchymal cells maintained a normal karyotype and telomerase activity\\". The mesenchymal cells were placed in conditions that specified adipogenic, chondrogenic, or osteogenic conditions and differentiation. These were taken from three different adult donors and compared to two human fibroblasts. After 1 to 3 week, the cells had already begun to differentiate into their respective conditions. Adipogenic differentiation was visible through accumulation of lipid-rich vacuoles within cells (adipocytes) and they remained healthy within the culture for at least three months. Chondrogenic differentiation was evident in the development of type II collagen that is seen in articular cartilage. Lastly, osteogenic differentiation was visible through calcium accumulation after one week. \\"The sensitive RT-PCR assays, in addition to the immunological and histochemical data, showed that neither the adipogenic nor the osteogenic cultures were composed of cells of multiple lineages. The chondrogenic cultures did not appear histologically to contain cells that were of the other lineages, but they did express osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase\\". In a controlled manner, isolated and expanded human mesenchymal stem cells could differentiate into multiple lineages. This concept of human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation can be used for future approaches to damaged or diseased tissue throughout the human body. This research example could be integrated into the SCLD website by the authors supplying the in vitro and/or in vivo conditions they used to influence these stem cells. This database is a tool that could provide useful and necessary information to researchers across the world.

The burgmannnen were given these houses by their lords as part of their remuneration as well as a feud. The area of the burglehn and its inhabitants were under a special law. That is, they were neither subject to the territorial lord (Landesherr), nor to the town charter, not even if the burglehn was within the town walls. In law, they were subject to the holder of the castle. Such houses were often also freihauses. There were frequent disputes between the people of the burglehn and the adjacent town, about whether the inhabitants of these houses could exercise crafts that were otherwise regulated by the town's guilds. The burglehn began to be dissolved and placed under the local government in the 17th century. This process was completed in the 19th century. Some burglehns lasted much longer than the associated castles, which had often lost their military significance. Even today in some towns and cities a street name refers to the location of the former burglehns.

Embryo rescue plays an important role in modern plant breeding, allowing the development of many interspecific and intergeneric food and ornamental plant crop hybrids. This technique nurtures the immature or weak embryo, thus allowing it the chance to survive. Plant embryos are multicellular structures that have the potential to develop into a new plant. The most widely used embryo rescue procedure is referred to as embryo culture, and involves excising plant embryos and placing them onto media culture. Embryo rescue is most often used to create interspecific and intergeneric crosses that would normally produce seeds which are aborted. Interspecific incompatibility in plants can occur for many reasons, but most often embryo abortion occurs In plant breeding, wide hybridization crosses can result in small shrunken seeds which indicate that fertilization has occurred, however the seed fails to develop. Many times, remote hybridizations will fail to undergo normal sexual reproduction, thus embryo rescue can assist in circumventing this problem. History Embryo rescue was first documented in the 18th century when Charles Bonnet excised Phaseolus and Fagopyrum embryos and was successful in it , planted them in soil and the cross resulted in dwarf plants. Soon after this, scientists began placing the embryos in various nutrient media. During the period of 1890 to 1904, systems for embryo rescue became systematic by applying nutrient solutions that contained salts and sugars and applying aseptic technique. The first successful in vitro embryo culture was performed by Hanning in 1904, he however described problems with precocious embryos that resulted in small, weak, and often inviable plantlets. Applications * Breeding of incompatible interspecific and intergeneric species * Overcoming seed dormancy * Determination of seed viability * Recovery of maternal haploids that develop as a result of chromosome elimination following interspecific hybridization * Used in studies on the physiology of seed germination and development Techniques Depending on the organ cultured, it may be referred to as either embryo, ovule, or ovary culture. Ovule culture or in ovolo embryo culture is a modified technique of embryo rescue whereby embryos are cultured while still inside their ovules to prevent damaging them during the excision process. Ovary or pod culture, on the other hand employs the use of an entire ovary into culture. It becomes necessary to excise the entire small embryo to prevent early embryo abortion. However, it is technically difficult to isolate the tiny intact embryos, so often ovaries with young embryos, or entire fertilized ovules will be used. Factors to consider Embryos are manually excised and placed immediately onto a culture medium that provides the proper nutrients to support survival and growth (Miyajima 2006). While the disinfestation and explant excision processes differ for these three techniques, many of the factors that contribute to the successful recovery of viable plants are similar. The main factors that influence success are; the time of culture, the composition of the medium, and temperature and light. Timing mainly refers to the maturation stage of the embryo before excision. The optimal time especially for the rescue of embryos involving incompatible crosses would be just prior to embryo abortion. Nevertheless, due to difficulties involved with the rearing of young embryos compared to those that have reached the autotrophic phase of development, embryos are normally allowed to develop in vivo as long as possible. While in general, two main types of basal media are the most commonly used for embryo rescue studies, i.e. Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) and Gamborg‚Äôs B-5 media (Bridgen, 1994), the composition of the medium will vary in terms of the concentrations of media supplements required. This will generally depend on the stage of development of the embryo. For instance, young embryos would require a complex medium with high sucrose concentrations, while more mature embryos can usually develop on a simple medium with low levels of sucrose. The temperature and light requirement is generally species specific and thus its usually regulated to be the within the same temperature requirement as that of its parent with embryos of cool-season crops requiring lower temperatures than those of warm-season crops. Both plant and animal cells, tissues and organ culture is possible in artificial nutrient medium in controlled laboratory conditions. Many desired products can be obtained through tissue culture like pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies.

Standing 6 ft 10in, Dunkels was one of the tallest first-class cricketers of all time.Will Jefferson, who represented Essex and Nottinghamshire, is also reputed to be 6 foot 10 inches tall (Cricinfo Profile). The height of Anthony Allom of Surrey is recorded as between 6 foot 9 inches and 6 foot 10 inches (Cricinfo Profile). Dunkels first played county cricket for Devon in the 1969 Minor Counties Championship against the Somerset Second XI. He played Minor counties cricket for Devon from 1969 to 1975, playing 29 matches for the county. He additionally played for three first-class teams, playing a single first-class match for each one. His first-class debut came for Warwickshire in 1971 against the touring Indians. His second first-class match came in the same season for a combined Minor Counties team against the same opposition. The following season he played his third and final first-class match, this time for Sussex against Cambridge University. Despite his remarkable height, Dunkels was not a bowler who could bowl with great pace or generate steepling bounce, instead bowling medium pace. His three first-class matches yielded three wickets at an expensive bowling average of 84.33, with all three of his wickets coming for Sussex. He was called to the bar in 1972, and appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1993.

Life Ioan Giurgiu Patachi was born from a family of small nobility in Str√¢mbu, Cluj County in 1680. Orphan, he was raised by his uncle who left him in the Jesuits' care. He studied in Cluj, Vienna and later he was sent to the German and Hungarian College of Rome where he remained from 1705 to 1710. In Rome, on 24 September 1707, he was ordained a Roman Rite priest. After graduation, he served as Latin priest in FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü. The first Greek Catholic Bishop of Romania, the bishop of Alba Iulia, Atanasie Anghel, died on 19 August 1713, and his succession was problematic. At first the Synod of the Church elected a Jesuit, Francisc Szunyogh, who refused. Later the Synod elected the former secretary of Atanasie, Venceslav Franz, but this selection was opposed by the Habsburg monarch, the Emperor Charles VI, because Franz was a lay. Finally on 23 December 1715 a consensus was reached on the name of Patachi. The way to his formal enthronement was still long. On 14 February 1717 he entered in the Basilian Order, and he had to petition the Vatican for the change of liturgical rite to the Byzantine Rite. Moreover the Latin bishop of Alba Iulia opposed to presence of a Greek Catholic diocese in the same town, and the monastery in Alba Iulia, where the Greek Catholic Romanian Church was based, had to be demolished to give place to a fortress. Actually it was only on 3 February 1721 that Patachi was formally confirmed by Pope Clement XI and on 18 May 1721 the See was moved to FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü, thus founding the Greek Catholic Diocese of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü. His enthronement occurred in the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü on 17 August 1723. He died a few years later, on 29 October 1727 in S√¢mbƒÉta de Jos, Bra≈üov County.
