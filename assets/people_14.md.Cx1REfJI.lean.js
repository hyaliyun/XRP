Like the Mocho Nacional, the Caracu is a tropical European breed created in Brazil and its origin is of the race Minhota.Aristeu Mendes Peixoto, Francisco Ferraz de Toledo. Enciclopédia agrícola brasileira: C-D, Volumen 2. EdUSP, 1998. Its main use is as a cross to beef cattle. The Caracu accounts for less than 5% of Brazilian beef cattle; the Nelore breed is by far the predominant breed in Brazil. Origin The Caracu breed is from cattle imported from the Iberian peninsula and possibly with some influence from African cattle from the Moorish occupation of the area. The first entry of such animals occurred in 1534 in São Vicente-SP where for several centuries faced all kinds of difficulties in feeding and parasites. This natural pressure evolved into the Criollo such as the yellow Caracu. The Caracu in Brazil The arrival of zebu from India in the 19th and 20th century almost led to its extinction. The Caracu is the most suitable European race to tropical conditions found in Brazil. With more than four centuries of selection, Caracu today brings important qualities and increasingly sought after in the beef cattle segment, mainly for industrial crossing. The rusticity acquired over the years has resulted in a small food requirements, greater resistance to pests, and increased the longevity of cows. The Caracu is considered the most suitable Taurine breed for the tropical conditions found in Brazil. Since 1980 the Caracu has been upgraded via the most modern selection techniques for genetic improvement, led by the Brazilian Association of Caracu Breeders (ABCC). Major industry initiatives such as the Animal Science Institute of Sertaozinho (IZ), Embrapa - Beef Cattle (Campo Grande / MS) and the Agronomic Institute of Paraná (IAPAR), carry out studies and research related to the breed. In less than 30 years Caracu presented an accelerated evolution of performance in many ways, always keeping intact its rustic features. Characteristics The Caracu of European origin (Bos Taurus) is extraordinary in its adaptation to tropical and sub-tropical climate. The Natural Selection for almost 5 centuries in Brazil resulted in anatomical and physiological changes that provided the following characteristics: Short hair suitable for the Brazilian climate Resistance to heat, and climatic and environmental adversities Resistance to endo- and ectoparasites Good locomotion Strong legs and hoof resistant to both hard floors and wet conditions Ability to digest coarse fibers Calving ease Great adaptability to the severest environment High foreskin ideal for Brazilian pastures Fertility Females have high fertility rates, good body structure, easy calving, good production of quality milk and good conformation. The excellent maternal ability is a characteristic sought for in crossbreeding makes the breed one of the most recommended for use in crossbreeding. Females can be bred in 14-15 months old. Cows can be kept breeding until 16-17 years with some up to 21 years old. Average per cow are from 11 to 13 births. In addition, the race of females present: Fertility more than 80% F1 females have 10% more fertility and 20% more weight at weaning; Calving ease, with calves being born with an average of 32 kg. Females have their first breeding service at 15 months First calving between 24 and 28 months. Weight Under exclusively pasture regime, the average weight of cows is around 550-650 kg with some reaching up to 750 kg. The Bulls weigh around 1,000 kg. and up to 1200 kg. At two years old heifers reach about 400 kg., with some weigh up to 500 kg. Calves at one year old reach an average of 300 kg. due to good maternal ability of cows. In relation to meat quality, the Caracu have meat tenderness and desirable juiciness. Caracu crosses maintain the advantages with heterosis. Even compared to 5/8 synthetic races, the bull maintain strength through heterosis - 100% in the half-blood calves. Milk The Caracu selected for dairy production provide around 2,100 kilos per lactation (including heifers in 1st lactation) on pasture with little supplementation. Milk fat content is around 5%. Behavior The Caracu is a gentle and docile cattle, which facilitates the management of the herd in the field. The Caracu herd moves around in the pasture. It spreads, decreasing the intensity of trampling, allowing a better use and longevity of the pasture. In cold regions, cattle penetrates the woods, consuming leaves and protecting itself from the cold. In the Brazilian cerrado in the period of food shortages (drought), it complements its diet with a variety of native shrubs. Crossbreeding The breed is currently used for crosses, mainly on zebu cows in the areas of extensive production. Being a Bos Taurus (European) it breeds a mestizo with a high degree of heterosis with Zebu cattle (Bos indicus). The results have been encouraging as competing on equal terms with specialized breeds in quality and productivity of its mestizos. It takes advantage especially in areas where the system is pasture based. Bulls give good results in crossbreeding the field, and the Caracu is one of the few European races that perform well in natural breeding in the tropics. Another fact that demonstrates its multifunctionality is that it can be used at rotation crossbreeding with F1 females (1/2 blood) from other breeds, maintaining the good heterosis. The Caracu has been widely used in the formation of suitable cattle composite breeds.

The target markets for MODE 2 are in tagging systems for manufacturing, logistics, retail, transport and airline baggage. MODE 2 is especially suitable for high speed bulk conveyor fed applications. ISO/IEC 18000-3 Section 8 Table of characteristic differences between the MODES General description MODE 2 RFID tags are passive deriving their power from the interrogating signal generated by an RFID interrogator. Power is transferred from the interrogator to the tag by a high-frequency magnetic field using coupled antennae coils in the reader and the tag. The powering field frequency is 13.56 MHz ± 7 kHz. Dialogue between the interrogator and the tag is conducted on an Interrogator-Talks-First (ITF) basis. Following activation of the tag by the interrogator’s interrogating signal the tag waits silently for a valid command. After receiving a valid command the tag transmits a reply in response to the command. The air interface operates as a full-duplex communication link. The interrogator operates with full-duplex transmissions being able to transmit commands while simultaneously receiving multiple tag replies. Tags operate with half-duplex transmissions. Commands are transmitted from the interrogator to the tag by phase-jitter modulation (PJM)WO/1999/034526 \\"A Transmitter and a Method for Transmitting Data\\". of the powering field. PJM transmits data as very small phase changes in the powering field. There is no reduction in the transfer of power to the tag during PJM, and the bandwidth of PJM is no wider than the original double-sided spectrum of the data. The PJM sideband levels and data rates are decoupled, allowing the sideband levels to be set at any arbitrary level without affecting the data rate. The command data rate is 423.75 kbit/s encoded using modified frequency modulation (MFM). Tags reply to the interrogator by inductive coupling whereby the voltage across the tag antenna coil is modulated by a subcarrier. The subcarrier is derived from division of the powering field frequency. Tags can select from one of eight subcarrier frequencies between 969 kHz and 3013 kHz. The reply data rate is 105.9375 kbit/s encoded using MFM and modulated onto the subcarrier as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). To ensure that tags replying on different channels are simultaneously received, tag replies are band-limited to reduce data and subcarrier harmonic levels.WO/1999/039450 \\"A Transceiver\\". Multiple-tag identification is performed using a combination of frequency-division multiple access and time- division multiple access (FTDMA).WO/1989/005549 \\"Identification Apparatus and Methods\\". There are eight reply channels available for tags to use. In response to a valid command each tag randomly selects a channel on which to transmit its reply. The reply is transmitted once using the selected channel. Upon receiving the next valid command each tag randomly selects a new channel and transmits the reply using the newly selected channel. This method of reply frequency hopping using random channel selection is repeated for each subsequent valid command. The interrogator can selectively mute identified tags to remove them from the identification process. When a tag is muted, the tag will not transmit any replies. In addition to random channel selection the tags can randomly mute individual replies. When a reply is muted, the tag will not transmit that reply. Random muting is necessary when identifying very large populations of tags during singulation. All FTDMA frequency and time parameters are defined by the command. All commands are time-stamped, and tags store the first time stamp received after entering an interrogator. The stored time stamp defines precisely when the tag first entered the interrogator and provides a high-resolution method of determining tag order, which is decoupled from the speed of identification.WO/2001/065712 \\"Radio Frequency identification Transponder\\".

Email  An email is one of the common ways of using OTACs, there are two main methods used. With the first method, a service provider sends a personalised one time URL link to an authenticated email address e.g. @ucl.ac.uk, when the user clicks the URL link the server authenticates the user.Adida, B. (2008). EmID: Web authentication by email address. With the second method, a service provider sends a personalised OTAC (e.g. an Enciphered token) to an authenticated email address, when the user types the OTAC into the website the server authenticates the user.  Application  The web application generates a unique code (pin) that the user can input into the desktop client, the desktop client in turn uses that code to authenticate itself to the web application. This form of authentication is particularly useful in web applications that do not have an internal username/password store but instead use SAML for authentication. Since SAML only works within the browser, a desktop based web application client cannot successfully authenticate using SAML. Instead, the client application, can use the one time authorization code (OTAC) to authenticate itself to the web application. In addition, it is possible to use the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework when a third party application needs to obtain limited access to an HTTP service.Hardt, D. (2012). The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. = Post = It is possible to send OTACs to a user via post or registered mail. When a user requests an OTAC, the service provider sends it via post or registered mail and then the user can use it for authentication. For example, in the UK, some banks send their OTAC for Internet banking authorization via post or registered mail.Lloydsbank.com, (n.d.).

He played American football and baseball for the University of Michigan from 1921 to 1923. At 140 pounds, he was one of the lightest quarterbacks ever to start for a major college program. Despite his size, Michigan football coach Fielding H. Yost called him \\"the best field general I ever had.\\" Uteritz led Michigan to back-to-back undefeated seasons and a national championship in 1923. He also played three years of baseball for Michigan at second base and shortstop, hit above .300 and was elected as captain of the 1923 baseball team. Uteritz later served as a football and baseball coach at Northwestern University (1924–1925), the University of Wisconsin (1925–1935), the University of California (1935–1947), and Washington University in St. Louis (1947–1963). Playing career=Football= A native of Oak Park, Illinois, Uteritz was the quarterback for the Oak Park and River Forest High School football team coached by Glenn Thistlethwaite, who later became the head football coach at Northwestern. In 1920, Uteritz enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played quarterback from 1921 to 1923, leading the Wolverines to back-to-back undefeated football seasons in 1922 and 1923. Over the three years of his football career at Michigan, the Wolverines never lost a football game in which Uteritz played.The Wolverines lost no games in the 1922 and 1923 seasons. They lost one game in 1921, that loss coming the week before Uteritz took over as Michigan's starting quarterback. Uteritz stood five feet seven inches and weighed only 140 pounds in 1922. He was \\"one of the lightest 'big time' quarterbacks in American football history when he played at Michigan from 1921 to 1923.\\" Uteritz was known for his speed and his \\"heady\\" play as the Wolverines' field general. He was considered a \\"triple threat\\" player who had \\"about equal ability in kicking, forward passing and carrying the ball.\\" 1921 season As a sophomore in 1921, Uteritz became Michigan's starting quarterback after Theodore Banks, who started the first four games at quarterback, was injured. Uteritz took over for the final three games of the year. His first game as a starter was a 3–0 win over Illinois in which Frank Steketee scored the only points on a field goal. His second game as a starter was a 7–7 tie with Wisconsin. In addition to serving as quarterback, Uteritz was Michigan's punt returner, and a fluke play involving Uteritz resulted in Wisconsin's touchdown. Uteritz stood at Michigan's five-yard line waiting for a punt to cross the goal line. The ball apparently crossed the goal line, but bounded back. A Wisconsin player fell on the ball for the Badgers' only touchdown. Uteritz fared better in the final game of the 1921 season, the annual Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota. On Michigan's opening drive, Uteritz took the ball on the Gopher 28-yard line on a delay pass play and \\"tore down the field to the one-yard line.\\" On the next play, Uteritz plunged through for a touchdown to give Michigan the first points of the game. Near the end of the second quarter, Uteritz intercepted a pass at Michigan's 41-yard line and ran the ball back 59 yards going \\"through the entire team for a touchdown.\\" Uteritz's two first-half touchdowns gave Michigan a 17–0 lead. 1922 season In Uteritz's junior year of 1922, the Wolverines were 6–0–1 and outscored opponents by a combined tally of 183 to 13. Uteritz started six of Michigan's seven games in 1922. He missed the opening game against Case as Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost asked team captain Paul G. Goebel and Uteritz to accompany him to Columbus, Ohio to watch the Ohio State Buckeyes in action against Ohio Wesleyan. The scouting trip appears to have paid off as Uteritz led the Wolverines to 19–0 win over an Ohio State team that had been favored to win the Big Ten championship. After the Ohio State game, nationally syndicated sports writer Billy Evans called Uteritz a \\"star\\" and wrote that he was handling the team \\"in a brainy fashion.\\" And in November 1922, the Associated Press praised Uteritz's performance: \\"Uteritz, the Michigan quarterback, has shown to unusual advantage, his heady playing being responsible to a large degree for this year's victories.\\" A Wisconsin newspaper called Uteritz \\"one of the headiest pilots in the Big Ten\\" and noted that he always knows who should carry the ball and \\"his judgment at all times is excellent.\\" After shutting out Illinois (24–0) and Michigan Agricultural (63–0), the Wolverines had a bye week before playing Wisconsin. Yost used the bye week for another scouting trip, traveling with Uteritz, Harry Kipke and Paul G. Goebel to Madison, Wisconsin to watch the Badgers play. A stenographer was hired to sit next to Yost in the press box to take down his notes of the game. The following week, Michigan defeated Wisconsin 13–6, and Uteritz completed a pass to Harry Kipke in the fourth quarter that proved to be the difference in the game. After catching Uteritz's pass, Kipke ran 35 yards for the winning touchdown. At the end of the 1922 season, Uteritz was selected as a first-team All-American quarterback by syndicated sports writer, Frank G. Menke, and was a third-team selection by Walter Camp and Walter Eckersall. Uteritz was the first Michigan quarterback to be selected on Walter Camp's All-American football teams: > \\"Uteritz is the first Michigan signal-caller to be elected for any of Camp's > mythical teams. Not that Michigan hasn't had some good quarterbacks ... but > the palm goes to little Uteritz who in his two campaigns at Michigan has > developed into a twinkler of the first degree.\\" In picking Uteritz as its second-team All-Western Conference quarterback, the Chicago Evening Journal wrote: > \\"There were many heady quarterbacks on this seasons squads. For ability to > run his team, Uteritz of Michigan, perhaps stood out. He also handled punts > well, but called for free catches oftener than he attempted to run with the > ball. This is a fair indication of his good sense, for he is of such slight > build that he could not survive being dumped time after time by ferocious > ends.\\" Norman E. Brown, sports editor of the Central Press, picked Uteritz as his first-team All-Western quarterback in 1922, explaining his choice as follows: \\"Uteritz' handling of the Michigan team played an important part in its success. He is fast, a good passer, a sure tackler, a quick thinker.\\" 1923 season As a senior in 1923, Uteritz led the Wolverines to an 8–0 record and outscored opponents 150–12. Michigan's first conference game in 1923 was against Ohio State in Ann Arbor. Fifty-thousand spectators watched Michigan shut out the Buckeyes 23–0. Michigan's first two touchdowns were scored on passes by Uteritz, a 16-yard pass to Herb Steger in the third quarter and a 60-yard completion to Harry Kipke in the fourth quarter. Uteritz played his last game in a Michigan uniform against the Quantico Marines on November 10, 1923. Uteritz had one of his best games in a 26–6 win, but he also suffered a leg injury that ended his season. The Marines took a 6–0 lead in the first quarter of the game. Uteritz scored a touchdown in the second quarter, diving between center Jack Blott's legs to cross the goal-line. After tying the score with a touchdown, Uteritz then kicked for a successful extra point to give Michigan the winning points. Uteritz added his eighth point on an extra point kick in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Uteritz \\"limped perceptibly\\" after a hard tackle, but remained in the game until Michigan's trainer ordered him off the field. After the game, it was determined that Uteritz' leg had been broken, and he was unable to play in the last two games of the season. On learning that Uteritz would be unable to play in the remaining games, Coach Yost told reporters, \\"There goes half the football team. He was the best field general I ever had.\\" Despite missing the last two game of the season, Uteritz was selected as a second-team All-American by Lawrence Perry and a third-team selection by International News Service sports editor Davis Walsh. =Baseball= Uteritz also played three seasons on the University of Michigan baseball team. He was an infielder, playing at second base and shortstop. Uteritz was \\"rated as one of the best infielders of the Western Conference\\" and had a batting average above .300 in 1922. In June 1922, his teammates elected him team captain of the 1923 Michigan baseball team. Coaching career After receiving his degree from Michigan, Uteritz spent the rest of his life working as a football and baseball coach. In 1924, he accepted a position as an assistant coach at Northwestern where his former high school coach Glenn Thistlewaite was then the head football coach. From 1925 to 1935, Uteritz held various positions at the University of Wisconsin, including assistant football coach, head baseball coach, and assistant athletic director. While coaching at Wisconsin, Uteritz also played baseball for the Madison Blues. From 1935 to 1946, he was the backfield coach at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1947, Uteritz was hired as the backfield coach at Washington University in St. Louis. He became the head football coach for Washington University in 1949. Uteritz was head football coach at Washington for four years from 1949 to 1952 and coached his sons who played quarterback there during his tenure as head coach. The Washington University football team had a record of 18–18 in the four years that Uteritz was the head coach. Uteritz also served as the head baseball coach at Washington University for 11 seasons, in 1948 and from 1954 to 1963, compiling a record of 162–66. Uteritz had long been known by the nickname \\"Utz.\\" In 1952, he had his surname legally changed to Utz. He said he was tired of having his name \\"kicked around\\", and everyone called him Utz anyway. He died in St. Louis at age 63 of an apparent heart attack. He was survived by his wife, the former Genevieve Johnson, and four sons.

The first part of the Bill & Ted franchise, it stars Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter and George Carlin. It follows slacker friends Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves), who travel through time to assemble historical figures for their high school history presentation. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure received generally positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $40 million against a $6.5 million budget. Winter and Reeves reprised their roles in two sequels: Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) and Bill & Ted Face the Music (2020). Plot In 2688, humanity exists as a utopian society due to the inspiration of the music and philosophy of the Two Great Ones, Bill S. Preston, Esq., and Ted \\"Theodore\\" Logan. One of the citizens, Rufus, is tasked by the leaders to travel back to San Dimas, California, in 1988 using a time machine shaped like a phone booth to ensure that the young Bill and Ted, then dim-witted high school students, successfully pass a history class. Should they fail, Ted's father, police captain Logan, plans to ship Ted to a military academy in Alaska, ending Bill & Ted's fledgling band, the \\"Wyld Stallyns\\", and altering history. Rufus finds the two teenagers struggling to finish their history paper, which tasks them to describe how three historical figures would view the present San Dimas, trying to obtain help from customers at a Circle K convenience store. Rufus initially has difficulty convincing the two of his help when a copy of the phone booth time machine arrives, and versions of Bill and Ted from some later time in the future step out. The future Bill and Ted briefly discuss their situation with Rufus before disappearing in the time machine. Rufus offers the remaining pair a demonstration of the time machine, taking them back to 1805 where they find Napoleon Bonaparte leading his forces against Austria. As Rufus, Bill and Ted depart back to the present, Napoleon is thrown by a cannonball explosion into their wake, and is dragged through the Circuits of Time to the present. Rufus takes a moment to explain that time will continue to progress normally for Bill and Ted and they cannot miss their class presentation the next day, and then departs, leaving the empty time machine for the two. As Bill and Ted discuss where to go next, they discover Napoleon stuck in a nearby tree. This gives them the idea of kidnapping historical figures and bringing them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon before traveling. The two befriend Billy the Kid and Socrates, before stopping in 15th century England, where they become infatuated with Princesses Elizabeth and Joanna. This leads to them getting in trouble with their father the king, but Billy and Socrates rescue the pair, and the four escape, though the booth is partially damaged on their departure. They end up in the far future, discovering the society based on their influence, and are inspired to complete their report with \\"extra credit\\" by kidnapping additional historical figures: Sigmund Freud, Ludwig van Beethoven, Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, and Abraham Lincoln. After a brief stop in prehistoric times to repair the booth, Bill and Ted program the machine to return to the present, but end up outside the Circle K on the night before, where Rufus was introducing himself to them. Bill and Ted convince their earlier selves of Rufus' trustworthiness, and then are reminded by Rufus of how to get to the next day. When they arrive, they learn that Deacon has ditched Napoleon. They leave the other historical figures at the mall to learn about San Dimas while they seek out Napoleon at a local water park. The historical figures get into trouble and are arrested by Captain Logan. Bill and Ted execute an escape plan based on using the time machine in the future to set up what they need in the present. With the historical figures recollected, the two give their presentation to the school, which is a rousing success, allowing them to pass the course. Some time later, Rufus returns to Bill and Ted, presenting them with the two princesses before they were committed to pre-arranged marriages, noting that the two women will also be part of Wyld Stallyns. Rufus explains why Bill and Ted are the two great ones and how they changed the world with their music. Why they need to pass their history report if they were separated it would destroy the time line. Rufus asks to jam with the group, but upon hearing their cacophony, admits to the audience that \\"they do get better\\". Cast * Keanu Reeves as Ted \\"Theodore\\" Logan * Alex Winter as Bill S.

Director Stephen Herek called the screenplay \\"incredibly laugh-out-loud\\", but recognized that because of some of the off-center humor targeting a specific audience, the film was \\"either going to be a huge hit or a huge flop\\". Herek stated that shopping the film for distributors was difficult; Warner Bros. wanted to produce it within a budget, but could not figure out how to fund it. The film ended up being picked up by Dino de Laurentiis through the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG). In a 1991 interview, co-writer Ed Solomon said the characters of Bill and Ted were originally envisaged as \\"14-year-old skinny guys, with low-rider bell-bottoms and heavy metal T-shirts\\" who were despised by the popular kids at school. Casting Reeves and Winter changed the filmmakers' images of the characters because \\"...once you cast Alex and Keanu, who look like pretty cool guys, that was hard to believe\\". Originally as a spec script, the film had been called Bill & Ted's Time Van. While the core plot was similar, with Bill & Ted on the verge of failing their history class and threatening to ruin their idea of forming a band together, events in the spec script initiated when the pair had borrowed a van from their 28-year-old friend Rufus. While driving the van, they ended up in Nazi Germany, and after some hijinks, bring Adolf Hitler back to San Dimas in the present while they continue to collect other historical figures. Solomon affirmed this clearly became problematic, and Hitler was switched out with Napoleon in their final script. Other concepts in the spec script that were dropped included more involvement of Bill & Ted's classmates including having them travel in time with them, visiting Julius Caesar in the Roman Empire and ending up causing his death, and befriending a caveman in the prehistorical age as to help him invent fire so that they could light up a joint. The van, originally to be a 1969 Chevrolet, was abandoned as being too close in concept to the DeLorean used in the Back to the Future trilogy. This was later replaced with a phone booth, but contrary to common belief, it was not intended as a reference to the TARDIS from British sci-fi show Doctor Who, with Matheson saying \\"all of us were so clueless and knew nothing about Doctor Who\\". In earlier drafts of the script, other historical figures Bill and Ted plucked from history included Charlemagne (whom they referred to as \\"Charlie Mangay\\"), Babe Ruth, and a non-famous medieval person called \\"John the Serf\\". John is listed in the credits. =Casting= Herek screened between 200 and 300 actors for the main roles, asking actors to try for both parts during auditions. Pauly Shore was among the hundreds of actors considered for the role of Ted, while River Phoenix, Sean Penn and then-upcoming actor Brendan Fraser reportedly auditioned for Bill. Keanu Reeves was one of the first to audition, and Herek quickly identified him as their Ted, making much of the rest of casting to find a match against Reeves. Alongside Reeves, 24 actors were called back and auditioned in various pairs to find a good chemistry. On that day, Reeves was one of the first to arrive along with Alex Winter, and while waiting for the auditions to start, found out they had a lot of personal details in common, such as a common interest in bass guitar and motorcycles. They quickly developed a rapport between each other during auditions, which earned them the title roles. A longstanding urban legend has it that Reeves auditioned for Bill and Winter for Ted. According to Winter, the story emerged because the characters are so similar, and even he and Reeves sometimes became confused about who was who. Through rehearsals, Winter and Reeves worked on developing their Bill & Ted characters to move them away from being stereotypical comedic slackers and insert sincerity and other more human elements into them. While they developed mannerisms outside of the script, influenced partially by British comedians like Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan, the pair kept to the dialog written by Solomon and Mathseon, with Winter calling it \\"very floral, so paradoxical to how you think dumb Valley guys would speak\\". Winter said that to develop Bill's character, he borrowed from the looks and trends along Venice Beach, California, where he had been living, including wearing a baseball cap backwards and pulling part of his hair through that opening. Winter said of casting George Carlin as Rufus as a \\"very happy accident\\". The role of Rufus had not been established when filming started. Herek stated that their intention was to have Eddie Van Halen as Rufus, given the frequency of Van Halen references in the screenplay, but this was not possible because of the low budget for the film. They started looking at other actors who would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included Ringo Starr, Roger Daltrey, Sean Connery, and Charlie Sheen. They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian. Producers Scott Kroopf and Bob Cort had just finished filming Outrageous Fortune which co- starred George Carlin, and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming. The Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of ZZ Top. However, Solomon had connections to the E Street Band, The Tubes and The Motels, and were able to get Clarence Clemons, Fee Waybill, and Martha Davis, respectively, for the Most Important People. The film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \\"stupid\\" and \\"ugly\\" waiters, respectively. When Rufus plays his guitar solo, the hands in the close-up are those of Stevie Salas, who composed the film's guitar music. =Filming= The film was shot on a budget over a period of 10 weeks, including two weeks in Italy. As Herek was going after the same comedic approach to history as in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, they brought in its production designer, Roy Forge Smith, for this film. Principal filming was shot in 1987 in the Phoenix, Arizona and Tempe, Arizona metropolitan areas. Many scenes were filmed in and around Scottsdale's Coronado High School. Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the East High School auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project. The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in Carefree, Arizona. The scenes at Waterloo are a combination of establishing shots at Raging Waters in San Dimas and shots with the actors at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa, Arizona. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days. The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the AMF Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at US 60, three miles south of Arizona State University. The mall was Phoenix Metrocenter, between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at Interstate 17. It has since been renovated and no longer looks as it did in the film. The Circle K store is at the intersection of Southern and Hardy in Tempe. Additional filming took place at selected locations in Italy, including Odescalchi castle standing in as Henry VI's castle. The film also employs computer-generated imagery for the scenes where Bill & Ted are traveling through the 'Circuits of Time', created by the VFX house Perpetual Motion Pictures in Tempe. Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult because in order to come up with the desired effects, the filming required multiple people to stand inside the booth, which was on a gimbal in front of a green screen. Numerous equipment and prop failures ensued, and Reeves has called it \\"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you've ever been on\\". =Post-production= Initially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting. The initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived. In February 2020, Winter found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive and shared them on the Internet with some additional details on its production. Winter believed that Kenny Ortega had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming. Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \\"John the Serf\\" character that remained in the films credits. While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following the film, it is likely lost. The picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule. However, the original film distributor, DEG, fell into significant debt in late 1987, and by 1988 had filed for bankruptcy. At this point, the film was in post-production, and Herek attempted to show around the rough cut to other distributors. Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \\"Are there kids that really speak like this?\\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title. Some of the former DEG executives ended up at Nelson Entertainment, and along with Orion Pictures, were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about . Reception=Box office= Bill & Ted had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989. It was followed in 1991 by a sequel, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure grossed $40.4 million domestically on a budget of about $10 million. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 6.68/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just charming, goofy, and silly enough to make this fluffy time-travel Adventure work\\". On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The Washington Post gave the film a negative review, finding the script written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon as \\"made only the sketchiest attempts to draw their historical characters. They exist as foils and nothing else, and the gags that are hung on them are far from first-rate\\", and that if director \\"Stephen Herek, has any talent for comedy, it's not visible here. More than anything, the picture looks paltry and undernourished.\\" Variety wrote about each historical figure that Bill & Ted meet, stating that \\"Each encounter is so brief and utterly cliched that history has little chance to contribute anything to this pic's two dimensions.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to the film as a \\"painfully inept comedy\\" and that the \\"one dimly interesting thing about Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the way the two teen-age heroes communicate in superlatives. We are about to fail most egregiously, says Ted to Bill, or maybe it's Bill to Ted. They are also fond of odd words, such as bodacious.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman was also unimpressed, concluding: \\"Make no mistake, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure […] is not a satire of mindlessness; it's unabashed glorification of dumbness for dumbness' sake. Bill and Ted are heroic in their ability to reduce some of history's great minds to their level. However, writing for Radio Times, Alan Jones decided: \\"A nonstop giggle from start to finish, this beguiling grab-bag of time-travel clichés, hard-rock music and Valley-speaking cool dudes is a flawless, purpose-built junk movie\\". The successes of the film and the animated series spawned a short-lived breakfast cereal called Bill & Ted's Excellent Cereal. A phone booth used in the sequel was given away in a contest presented by Nintendo Power magazine, to promote Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure. It was won by Kenneth Grayson of Mississippi. In 2010, the city of San Dimas celebrated 50 years of incorporation. The celebration's slogan was San Dimas, 1960–2010 – An Excellent Adventure. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was selected as number 8 in Rolling Stone's '10 Best Stoner Movies of All Time' in 2013. Writing in The Guardian on the occasion of the film's 25th anniversary, Hadley Freeman found: \\"Of all the delightfully improbable scenarios depicted in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure – from Napoleon Bonaparte causing havoc on a waterslide to Billy the Kid and Socrates (a.k.a. \\"So-crayts\\", of course) picking up chicks in a California mall to George Carlin acting in a film alongside Keanu Reeves and a member of the Go-Go's – none would have seemed more unlikely on its release than the idea that one day, with much media fanfare, the public would be celebrating the film's 25th anniversary. By the time Bill & Ted was released in 1989, the 80s teen film explosion was starting to taper out. [...] Moreover, there had already been plenty of films about time-travelling teens by the time Bill & Ted rocked up in cinemas, such as Peggy Sue Got Married and Back to the Future. Few who were around then would have bet that a goofy movie about a pair of California metalheads skipping back through time in a phonebox collecting historical characters to bring back to 20th-century California for their history report would still be remembered today. But I am very much among those few\\".

The film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film Avengers: Endgame. An episode of the seventh season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was also named after the film. Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was released in 1989. The tracks are as follows: # \\"Play with Me\\" by Extreme # \\"The Boys and Girls Are Doing It\\" by Vital Signs # \\"Not So Far Away\\" by Glen Burtnik # \\"Dancing with a Gypsy\\" by Tora Tora # \\"Father Time\\" by Shark Island # \\"Breakaway\\" by Big Pig # \\"Dangerous\\" by Shark Island # \\"Walk Away\\" by Bricklin # \\"In Time\\" by Robbie Robb featuring Stevie Salas # \\"Two Heads Are Better Than One\\" by Power Tool These tracks are ordered for the album differently than they are in the movie.

A third theatrical film in the Bill & Ted franchise was planned, and a screenplay was written, though it never got past the pre-production phase. Although rumors claimed that the script was adapted into the 1996 film Bio- Dome, Alex Winter has said that it was not. In 2010, Reeves indicated that Matheson and Solomon were working on a script for a third film, confirming in April 2011 that a draft was complete. Winter said in March 2012 that he and Reeves both liked the finished script, which revisits the two characters after the changes of the past twenty years. The script did not feature the return of the Grim Reaper from Bogus Journey, but since actor William Sadler expressed interest, the writers considered ways to include the character. In August 2012, Dean Parisot (director of the sci-fi/comedy film Galaxy Quest) signed on to direct the film, although MGM, which holds the rights to the Bill & Ted franchise, did not officially greenlight the film until some years later. In an April 2014 article on the original film's 25th anniversary, Alex Winter reported that work on going ahead with the second sequel was still in progress. Bill & Ted Face the Music was officially announced to be in pre- production on May 8, 2018. On March 20, 2019 a video featuring Winter and Reeves was posted online which announced the third film in the franchise would be released in the summer of 2020.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_x2C4L6quA The film was finally released, after a delay due to the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, on August 28, 2020. =Television= Two spin-off television series were produced; both were titled Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures. * Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures was an animated series that first ran on CBS in 1990, and featured the voices of Winter, Reeves and Carlin returning to their roles in the film. A second season of eight episodes ran on Fox Kids, with the voice cast of Fox's then-upcoming live-action series. * Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures was a live-action series that ran only seven episodes on Fox in the summer of 1992. It did not feature any of the cast from the film. Evan Richards and Christopher Kennedy played Bill and Ted. =Comics= DC Comics produced a tie-in comic following the plot of the first movie timed to coincide with that film's release on home video. The sequel was adapted by DC's competitor Marvel Comics, published to coincide with the second film's release in theaters. Its popularity led to the ongoing Marvel series Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book by Evan Dorkin, which lasted for 12 issues. There was a weekly 2/4 page semi-adaptation of the animated series published for a year by UK's defunct Look-In Magazine from 1991 to 1992. =Video games= There were also Game Boy, NES, and Atari Lynx games released, which were very loosely based on the film's plot. A PC title and nearly identical Amiga and Commodore 64 port were made in 1991 by Off the Wall Productions and IntraCorp, Inc. under contract by Capstone Software and followed the original film very closely. =Theme parks= The annual Halloween Horror Nights events at Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood have featured since 1992 (Orlando) and 1997-1999/2007 (Hollywood) Bill & Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure, a show satirizing pop culture of the year with Bill & Ted as the protagonists fighting villains who steal their phone booth for their own schemes. The show differs from year to year, with spoofs of various pop culture icons. The main plot involves Bill and Ted being threatened by an evil villain from a popular film of that year, with appearances by a host of villains, heroes, and celebrities. The show usually includes elaborate dance numbers, stunts, and multiple double-entendres for the late night event crowd. In 2013, the Hollywood version of the show was canceled in the middle of its run following complaints of homophobic humor. On August 15, 2017, Universal announced that 2017 will be the final year of Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure in Orlando. And on November 4, 2017, Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure came to a final close, but not before a surprise appearance of Rufus.

A disciple of Plato, he became Dionysius I's most trusted minister and adviser. However, his great wealth, his belief in Platonism and his ambition aroused the suspicions of Dionysius I's son and successor, Dionysius II. An indiscreet letter from Dion to the Carthaginians led to his banishment. Settling in Athens, he lived a prosperous life until Dionysius II dispossessed him of his estates and income. Landing in Sicily in 357 BC, he was successful in conquering Syracuse (other than the citadel). However, Dion soon quarrelled with the radical leader Heraclides and was forced into exile. Recalled in 355 BC, he became master of the whole city but his imperious behaviour and financial demands on the people of Syracuse soon alienated the population. His supporters abandoned him and he was assassinated. His attempts to liberate Sicily only brought political and social chaos to the island which would last for nearly 20 years. Family Dion was the son of the Syracusan statesman Hipparinus, who had served with Dionysius I in the Syracusan army. Hipparinus' other children were Megacles and Aristomache. Aristomache married Dionysius I, who also married Doris of Locris at the same time. Although Dion's sister was popular with her fellow Syracusans, it was Doris who gave birth to Dionysius I's heir Dionysius II. Aristomache had four children. Of these children, Sophrosyne married Dionysius II and Arete married Dion (with their son being called Hipparinus).Plutarch, Lives: Life of Dion. (About/Wikisource)  Advisor to Dionysius I  As a trusted advisor to Dionysius I, Dion was given the most important diplomatic assignments. Dion excelled in managing the embassies that dealt with Carthage. Dionysius I was so satisfied with Dion's role as advisor that eventually Dion was authorized to withdraw money from the Syracusan treasury. The tyrant demanded, however, to be informed daily when he did so. Despite this requirement, Dion became extremely rich and his residence was magnificently furnished. Nonetheless, Dion occasionally criticized Dionysius I. Since his youth, Dion had excelled in intellectual activities, particularly philosophy. Plato and Dion first met in 387 BC when the philosopher, on a visit to Tarentum in southern Italy, accepted an invitation from Dionysius I to visit Syracuse. It was Dion who instigated this invitation. Dion joined Plato's philosophical school, with Dion excelling amongst Plato's disciples. Dion used every effort to inculcate Plato's maxims into the thoughts of Dionysius I. At one time, Dion invited the despot to a meeting with Plato. However, Dionysius I was offended by the philosopher when Plato spoke out against tyrannical leaders. This led to a quarrel, after which Dionysius I ordered the assassination of the philosopher (who managed to escape this fate, although he ended up being sold as an Athenian slave in Aegina). Despite this disagreement over Plato, Dion and Dionysius I's' close relationship continued as before. Dionysius I was on his deathbed when Dion attempted to discuss the succession with him. Dion hoped that Dionysius I would hand over the rule of Syracuse to him or to his family. However, his attempt to influence Dionysius I was stopped by Dionysius I's doctors who supported the younger Dionysius II. On hearing of Dion's plans, Dionysius II then deliberately poisoned his father, who was unable to utter another word before passing away. Dion and Dionysius II Dionysius I had dreaded that anyone might depose him treacherously. He had, therefore, cloistered his son Dionysius II inside the Syracusan acropolis so, as he grew up, he lacked the knowledge, capabilities, political skills or personal strength expected of a future leader of men. When Dionysius I died in 367 BC, he was succeeded by Dionysius II. (References to Dionysius in this article hereafter refer to Dionysius II unless otherwise specified.) As an adult Dionysius was given to libertine practices. Cornelius Nepos was of the view that Dionysius lacked his father’s strength of character and he paid too much attention to unscrupulous advisers who wished to discredit Dion. When he succeeded as tyrant of Syracuse, his entire court was composed of by licentious youngsters, who were completely disengaged from their political duties. The Syracusan institutions thus began to collapse. With his extensive political experience, Dion effectively ruled the city state. Soon, the people of Syracuse formed the view that Dion was the only one who might save the city. In Dionysius' court, Dion proposed a response to the continuing Carthaginian threat. Dion offered either to travel to Carthage (to seek a diplomatic solution) or to furnish Syracuse with 50 new triremes with his own money to fight the Carthaginians. Although Dionysius was delighted by these suggestions, his courtiers resented Dion's interventions. They suggested to Dionysus that Dion was trying to oust him in favour of the line of his sister Aristomache. Dion concluded that educating Dionysius would be the key to resolving Syracuse's problems. With his philosophical training, Dion began teaching him about philosophical principles and the importance of good governance with the aim of making him a philosopher king. Such lessons sparked Dionysius' interest, so Plato was invited again to Syracuse. The experiment, in spite of a promising beginning, failed, with Dion's opponents gaining influence over Dionysius, leading to the philosopher Philistus being recalled (after he had been banished by the elder Dionysius) and then leading the opposition to Dion. Facing increasing opposition to his plans, Dion began developing a plot, with generals Heracleides and Theodotes, to overthrow Dionysius. They agreed that they would wait in the hope of political reform, although they would oust Dionysius if this did not happen. Eventually Dion agreed with Heracleides to install a full democracy, by his wealthy patrician birth, he disliked this form of government. Nonetheless, Plato arrived and was welcomed with much enthusiasm. Plato's conversations with Dionysius were said to have led to significant changes in Dionysius' views and behaviour, who, became sober and attentive, whereas his court continued its libertine practices. Then, during a traditional sacrifice, Dionysius openly stated that he did not wish to be a tyrant any longer. Banishment When Dionysius expressed the view that he no longer wished to rule as a tyrant, this alarmed Philistus and his supporters and they campaigned intensively against Dion. They insisted to Dionysius that Dion was the greatest of deceivers, who was intending to seize the realm for his own nephews. Dionysius believed their arguments so he adopted a hostile attitude towards Dion. The situation reached a crisis point when Dionysius and Philistus intercepted a letter which had been sent by Dion to the Carthaginians. In that letter, Dion recommended that the Carthaginians should consult him regarding a peace agreement, because he would provide all of Syracuse's demands to them. Fearing a plot between Carthage and Dion and his supporters, Dionysius feigned a renewed friendship with Dion. They walked to the seashore where the despot showed the incriminating letter to Dion and, without giving Dion the opportunity to defend himself, immediately forced Dion into exile. Dion eventually made his way to Athens. Plato was confined inside the acropolis and received excellent treatment as an important guest, so he would not follow Dion. Later, when war with Carthage restarted, Dionysius allowed the philosopher to depart Syracuse, promising Plato that he would allow Dion to return to Syracuse during the next summer. Thanks to these events, there was growing speculation in Syracuse that Aristomache, who was popular with her fellow citizens, would attempt to seize the power. Dionysius became aware of these sentiments and he attempted to address the situation. Publicly, he explained that Dion was temporarily in Athens so that he wouldn't provoke some violent backlash against Dionysius. Dion was allowed to hold onto his Syracusan estate so he was still receiving his usual revenues. Furthermore, Dionysius handed two ships to Dion's relatives so they could send his possessions after him to Athens. Thus, Dion lived amongst the Athenian high society, dwelling with the patrician Athenian Calippus of Syracuse with whom he had become acquainted during the celebrations of the Eleusian Mysteries. Additionally, Dion purchased a rural residence for his leisure. His closest friend was Speusippus. Dionysius delayed Dion's return until the end of the war with Carthage. Dionysius recommended to Plato that Dion should not publicly criticise the Syracusan regime. Dion obeyed, staying within the Athenian Academy and studying philosophy. Later Dion did begin travelling throughout Greece meeting many local statesmen. Dion was regarded as a celebrity and many Greek cities welcomed him. For instance, the Spartans endowed him with citizenship, although the city state was at war with Thebes and was allied with Dionysius. Rebellion Eventually, Dionysius decided to seize all of Dion's properties in Syracuse and stopped him receiving revenue from his estates. Dionysius tried to mend his image by forcing Plato to visit him in Syracuse through public threats against Dion. The celebrated philosopher returned to Syracuse, but soon he and Dionysius began arguing bitterly about Dion's fate. The philosopher was jailed until an Athenian embassy arranged for his release. In his anger, Dionysus sold Dion's estate (keeping the proceeds) and compelled Dion's wife (and niece) Arete to marry the tyrant's close adviser, Timocrates. In response, Dion sought to start a revolt in Syracuse against Dionysius and his supporters. Dion's closest friends advised him that in Syracuse, the population could be expected to enthusiastically join Dion's revolt, if only he could get to the city. They told him that Dion did not need to bring either weapons or soldiers. Nevertheless, Dion managed to gather from his Greek supporters 800 soldiers who gathered on the Greek island of Zacynthus. Dion assured the leaders of the mercenaries that they would be made commanders once they defeated Dionysius. In 357 BC, Dion's fleet sailed for Sicily. As his coming was expected, the Admiral Philistus had a fleet in Italian coastal waters ready to waylay him. So Dion sailed straight across the open sea. After 13 days, Dion's fleet reached Sicily at Pachynus. However, despite his own helmsman's advice, Dion sailed further along the southern coast of Sicily where the fleet was hit by a storm and nearly smashed into pieces against the rocks near Cercina, in northern Africa. The fleet had to wait for five days until a favourable southerly wind brought it back to Sicily. Dion was then able to land in Carthaginian territory. As he was a personal friend of the governor Synalus of Heraclea Minoa, the Carthaginians offered lodging and plentiful supplies to Dion's expedition. Having learnt that Dionysius had sailed to Caulonia on the Italian peninsula with 80 ships, Dion's soldiers insisted on action. So Dion led his troops towards Syracuse. On the road through Agrigento, Gela, Camarina and the region surrounding Syracuse, they were joined by 5,000 Sicilians who wished to join the revolt. Near Acrae, Dion spread rumours that he would be attacking both Lentini and Campania. Dionysius' soldiers from these areas deserted Timocrates' forces to defend their respective towns. Then, during the night, Dion ordered the expedition to advance, and at daybreak, Dion launched his attack. With the news of the arrival of Dion, the people of Syracuse slew the tyrant's supporters and Timocrates had to flee. Dion led his army into Syracuse. He wore brilliant armour and a garland crowned his head. Dion was accompanied by Megacles and Callipus. The local community leaders greeted them. Dion proclaimed that Dionysius was now deposed. A week later, Dionysius returned to Syracuse and, protected by his loyal fleet, managed to gain entry into the Syracusan island acropolis which had not been captured as it was guarded by a large garrison loyal to the tyrant. Dionysus attempted negotiating with Dion but Dion responded by saying that the now free Syracusans should decide. Dionysius' proposals were spurned by the people and Dion suggested his surrender. Dionysus accepted this suggestion and he invited a local embassy to come to his palace to discuss the details. However, it was a deception on Dionysius' part and Dion and his representatives were immediately confined after entering into the palace. The next day, Dionysius' army surprised and overwhelmed the many besieging Syracusans who retreated in utter disorder. Because of the confusion, Dion was unable to issue orders more generally, so he and his men charged against Dionysius' troops. Dion was injured and ended on the ground but he was rescued by his men. Dion mounted a horse and was reunited with supporters. Dion's foreign mercenaries had superior fighting skills and forced Dionysius' men to retreat back into the acropolis. Leadership of Syracuse Following Dion's defeat of Dionysius' forces, Dion was elected to lead Syracuse (with his brother). Dionysius and his supporters were confined to the citadel. With his long connection with the former tyranny, it soon became clear to the people of Syracuse that Dion's political views were conservative and he did not favour the introduction of the democratic reforms sought by many of Syracuse's citizens. Dion was not a man who could hold the affections of the people, for he repelled men with his haughtiness. He was also seen as too keen to direct the Syracusans on how they were to use their freedom. As a result, the Syracusans started to distrust Dion's intentions. Dion soon fell out with Heracleides who formed his own political party. Heracleides was appointed admiral by the Syracuse assembly which increased his influence in the city. However, Dion undid this act on the grounds that his own consent was needed and then came forward himself to propose Heraclides for the role of admiral. Heracleides kept arguing in favour of democratic reform. Later, when Philistus returned from Italy with his squadron, Heracleides led a Syracusan fleet in a battle in which Philistus' fleet was defeated and Philistus was executed. The rivalry peaked after Heracleides failed to prevent Dionysius' subsequent escape from Syracuse, with Dionysius' son Apollocrates being left to command the citadel. Heracleides then proposed to the popular assembly that: *Syracusan land should be equally redistributed amongst the citizens *the foreign officers should lose their salary *new commanders should be appointed Dion opposed such plans but the Syracusans reacted decisively against what they saw as his oppressive government (which relied to a great extent on unpopular foreign mercenaries). The Syracusans deposed him from the post of general and appointed 25 new generals, among them Heracleides. They also refused to pay the Greek mercenaries who had come with Dion to Syracuse. While Dion and his mercenaries could have turned against the Syracusans, Dion decided to abandon Syracuse and with his 3000 foreign mercenaries moved to Leontini. At Leontini, Dion was well received and his foreign mercenaries were made local citizens. There, the Sicilian congress held a meeting, denouncing Syracuse, but the Syracusans responded that they preferred their actual liberties instead of a continuation of tyranny. Regaining power in Syracuse With the departure of Dion and his mercenaries, the Syracusans decided to lay siege to the island fortress where Dionysius' son, Apollocrates, and his garrison of mercenaries resided. However, just as they were about to attack, reinforcements arrived led by a Campanian from Naples, Nypsius, who sailed his fleet into Syracuse's Great Harbour. At first the Syracusans seem to be winning after Heracleides put out to sea and won a sea fight against the fleet supporting Nypsius. On the news of this victory, the people of Syracusan went wild with joy and spent the night drinking. The next day, while all in Syracuse were asleep, Nypsius and his troops issued from the gates of the island citadel and took control of key parts of the city and pillaged the city at will. The Syracusans were unable to offer effective resistance, so they sent an embassy to Leontini to meet with Dion. In response, Dion announced that his soldiers should prepare to march towards Syracuse on that same night. When he learnt about Dion's imminent arrival, Nypsius ordered to his men to burn the city. During that night, the city of Syracuse burned while many of its citizens were slain. The next day, Dion led his troops through the city cheered by the local people. However, Nypsius' troops had hidden behind the destroyed palisade of the acropolis and the liberating soldiers were unable to reach them. The Syracusans spontaneously decided to charge the enemy, which ended when Nypsius and his men retreated back into the citadel where many of Nypsius' soldiers were then captured. Nypsius somehow managed to escape from the city. Not long after, Dionysius' son Apollocrates, weary of the long siege, surrendered the island citadel to Dion and Dion's sister Aristomache, his wife Arete and the young Hipparinus were freed. The Syracusan assembly 'supplicated Dion as a god with prayers' when he returned to Syracuse (Plutarch, Life of Dion 29.2).Bruno Currie, Pindar and the Cult of Heroes, Oxford UP, 2005, p. 180, However, Diodorus (16.20.6) described these honours as heroic.Duncan Fishwick, The Imperial Cult in the Latin West, Brill, 1987, p. 4, During the next days, most of the opponents of Dion fled. Amongst the few who remained was Heracleides who sought Dion's pardon. Dion's foreign mercenaries suggested that he should be executed. However, Dion pardoned him and agreed to the arrangement where Dion would be general with full power on land while Heracleides would remain admiral by sea. The Syracusans began insisting, once again, about redistributing land and restoring democracy. However, according to Bury, Dion thought democracy was as bad a form of government as tyranny. Instead he hoped to create a Platonic state and establish an aristocracy with some democratic limitations and with a king and a senate made up of aristocrats. Also, the people of Syracuse wished to see the citadel of the tyrant demolished, but Dion allowed it to remain. Dion seemed to have no intention of allowing the Syracusans to manage their own affairs. His authority was now only limited by his joint command with Heracleides. Heracleides refused joining the aristocratic senate even after an invitation of Dion and, again, the populist leader began conspiring. He protested because Dion had not destroyed the acropolis and because he had brought in foreign politicians. At last, Dion was persuaded to consent to having Heracleides assassinated at his own home. Although Dion led the funeral for the popular leader, the assassination was quite resented by the people of Syracuse. Assassination Among those who had come with Dion from Greece to help liberate Syracuse was a pupil of Plato named Calippus. From his exile, Dionysius had offered a bribe to Calippus to kill Dion and Calippus had accepted the offer. Calippus used the money from Dionysius to bribe some of Dion’s troops to defect to him. He then won Dion’s trust by betraying some of these soldiers to Dion, who then enlisted Calippus as a secret agent to discover further plotters. So whenever Dion was told that Calippus was undermining him, Dion simply thought that Calippus was acting in his role as a spy. Shortly afterwards, Dion’s only son fell from a window and died. Dion’s wife, Arete, and sister, Aristomache, discovered Calippus’ plot against Dion, but Dion was still paralysed with remorse from his son’s death, and refused to take action. Arete and Aristomache continued their enquiries into Calippus' plot against Dion, and when Calippus discovered their inquisitiveness, he approached them and told them that he was loyal and that he would prove his loyalty. They told him to take the Great Oath, involving a ceremony in Persephone’s temple, which he took. Following the ceremony, Calippus broke his vow and planned to kill Dion on the day celebrating the god Persephone. On that date, Dion was celebrating at home with his friends. The assassins were Zacynthians, who wore light garments and who were unarmed. They walked into the house while other accomplices began shutting all doors and windows. The mercenaries attacked Dion choking him and then with a short Spartan sword he was stabbed to death. Following Dion's assassination, Calippus seized power himself and ruled as tyrant of Syracuse for about a year before Syracuse successfully revolted against his rule and he was exiled from the city. = In popular culture = Dion appears as a character in Mary Renault's novel The Mask of Apollo.

It consisted of the parishes of Athenry, Monivea, Tiaquin, Kilkerrin, Moylough, Killererin, Ballynakill- Aghiart (in Killian), Kilmoylan, and possibly Abbeyknockmoy. Clann Taidg consisted of a number of túaths, including Corca Mogha and Uí Diarmata. Clann Taidg seems to have come into existence during a wave of expansion by the Uí Briúin, specifically in the reign of King Tadg of Connacht (925-956). His son, Muiredaig mac Tadg, was the ancestor to the Uí Taidg an Teaghlaigh sept of the Síl Muiredaig who are recorded in the annals from 1048 onwards. The area, previously part of Uí Briúin Seóla, was called after the sept who are believed to have become its lords sometime in the mid-eleventh century. However, by the end of the twelfth century it was said to have been seized by Donn Cathaig Mór Mac Airechtaig of Síl Muiredaig. By 1241 much of the area was seized by Meyler de Bermingham, who made Athenry the seat of his lordship.

It is the third in a trilogy centered on an upper-class English family, and takes place twenty years after the events of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. It was Mitford's final novel, though she continued to produce works of biography for a number of years before her death in 1973. Plot As in the previous novels, Don't Tell Alfred is narrated by Fanny, now middle-aged and dealing with her own problems. Her husband Alfred Wincham, an Oxford don, has long been settled at this university as the Professor of Pastoral Theology but has now been named as the apparently unlikely British Ambassador to France. The novel suggests that this is a reward for the now \\"Sir\\" Alfred Wincham's \\"war work\\", but Fanny is unclear about her husband's role during this period. Fanny finds herself uprooted from Oxford and moving to a grand Embassy in Paris. She is at first clumsy and naive about Embassy life, but she is aided by Philip Cliffe-Musgrave. A former student of Alfred's and friend of the family, the young career diplomat, Philip, is at ease in the complex world of French politics and society. He and Fanny work together to find a way to dislodge the former ambassadress who has retained residence in the Embassy, and try to smooth the way for Alfred to concentrate on the complexities of his new position. Various characters in the novel often mutter, \\"Don't tell Alfred,\\" when anything difficult or dramatic occurs in the day-to-day life of the Embassy, hence the title. Fanny must also contend with her four free-thinking sons, her social secretary Northey (also her cousin Louisa's daughter) who spends more time leading a hectic social life in Paris, with a trail of suitors behind her, than actually working, and a grumpy gossip columnist who skews everything that happens at the Embassy into embarrassing and untrue news stories. Unlike the previous novels, The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, Fanny's narration focuses on her own life, rather than that of other people. This novel does provide details about the lives of some other characters from these novels and The Blessing, though these are not germane to Don't Tell Alfred.

It is one of the two most common forms of local government in the United States and is also used in Canada and Italy. It is the one most frequently adopted in large cities, although the other form, council–manager government, is the local government form of more municipalities. The variant may be broken down into two main variations depending on the relationship between the legislative and executive branches, becoming a weak-mayor or a strong-mayor variation based upon the powers of the office. These forms are used principally in modern representative municipal governments in the United States, but also are used in some other countries. Weak-mayor form In a weak-mayor system, the mayor has no formal authority outside the council; the mayor cannot directly appoint or remove officials, and lacks veto power over council votes. As such, the mayor's influence is solely based on personality in order to accomplish desired goals. The weak- mayor form of government may be found in the United States mostly in small towns that do not use the more popular council–manager form used in most municipalities that are not considered large or major cities, and is frequently seen in small municipalities with few or no full-time municipal employees. By contrast, in Canada the weak-mayor system is popular even in large cities. Strong-mayor form The strong-mayor form of mayor–council government usually consists of an executive branch, a mayor elected by voters, and a unicameral council as the legislative branch. In the strong-mayor form the elected mayor is given almost total administrative authority and a clear, wide range of political independence, with the power to appoint and dismiss department heads without council approval and little or no public input. In this system, the strong-mayor prepares and administers the city budget, although that budget often must be approved by the council. Abuses of this form led to the development of the council–manager form of local government and its adoption widely throughout the United States. In some strong-mayor governments, the mayor will appoint a chief administrative officer who will supervise department heads, prepare the budget, and coordinate departments. This officer is sometimes called a city manager; while the term city manager is used in the council–manager form of municipal government, the manager in the strong-mayor variant is responsible only to the mayor. Most major and large American cities use the strong-mayor form of the mayor–council system, whereas middle-sized and small American cities tend to use the council–manager system.

Beginning his career during the War of the Austrian Succession, he fought in the Seven Years' War, where he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lagos. Promoted to Captain in 1772, he was one of the aids of Admiral d'Estaing during the Naval battles of the American Revolutionary War, notably taking part in the Siege of Savannah. Suffren was then appointed to serve in the Indian Ocean under Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves, but assumed command himself at his death. Leading a 15-ship squadron, he fought five intense and evenly matched battles for control of the sea against Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes. Through these battles, Suffren managed to secure French dominance of the seas in Indian waters until the conclusion of the war at the Treaty of Paris. At his return, he was promoted to Vice-Admiral. He died shortly before he was to take command of the Brest squadron of the French fleet.  Biography =Early life= Pierre André de Suffren was born on 17 July 1729 in the Château de Saint-Cannat to the family of Marquis Paul de Suffren, the third son of an old nobility from Provence with two daughters and three other sons. Geneanet: Paul de Suffren In October 1743, as the War of the Austrian Succession was raging, Suffren, aged 14, went to Toulon to undertaken naval studies as a Garde-Marine. However, he spent only 6 months ashore before he was appointed on a ship. = War of the Austrian Succession= Suffren served on the 64-gun Solide and took part in the Battle of Toulon in 1744. During the battle, Solide engaged HMS Northumberland. In the spring of 1745, Suffren transferred on Pauline, part of a 5-ship and 2-frigate squadron under Captain Jean-Baptiste Mac Nemara, sent to America to harasse British forces. At his return, Suffren served on the 60-gun Trident, under Captain d'Estourmel, and took part in Duc d'Anville expedition. Suffren graduated from the Gardes- Marine in 1747 as an Ensign, and worked on commissioning the brand new 74-gun Monarque, under Captain La Bédoyère, in a squadron under Des Herbiers de l'Estenduère. He took part in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre on 25 October 1747, where La Bédoyère was killed and Monarque, badly damaged, was captured. Suffren was taken prisoner. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle restoring peace, Suffren joined the Order of Malta. He served in several commercial expeditions on galleys of the Order, escorting merchantmen and defending them against the depredation of the Barbary corsairs. In late 1754, Suffren departed Malta to return to Toulon. =Seven Years' War= In 1756, Suffren had returned to Toulon and had risen to Lieutenant. At the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, Suffren was appointed to the 64-gun Orphée, part of a 12-ship squadron under La Galissonière tasked with ferrying 12,000 men under Maréchal de Richelieu to strike Menorca. The squadron departed on 10 April, arriving on 17 and landing troops; the British garrison retreated to St. Philip's Castle and was forced to surrender after the Siege of Fort St Philip. Patrolling between Menorca and Mallorca to prevent British relief to support Fort St. Philip, La Galissonière intercepted a 13-ship squadron under Admiral Byng, leading to the Battle of Minorca. The British failed to break the French blockade, and Fort St. Philip fell on 29 July. In 1757, Suffren transferred to the 80-gun Océan, flagship of a 6-ship and 2-frigate squadron under Jean- François de La Clue-Sabran. The squadron departed Toulon in November, bound for Brest. On 7 December, it called Cartagena to resupply, and found itself blockaded by a British from under Henry Osborne. A relief squadron under Duquesne de Menneville attempted to break the blockade, but was destroyed in the Battle of Cartagena, as La Clue failed to sortie. Suffren witnessed the capture of Foudroyant and Orphée on 28 February 1758. La Clue's squadron eventually returned to Toulon. Toulon was blockaded by Edward Boscawen's forces but, on 16 August 1758, La Clue seized an opportunity to make a sortie with 12 ships and 3 frigates. The frigate HMS Gibraltar detected La Clue's squadron and reported to Boscawen, who moved to intercept. Meanwhile, the French squadron failed to maintain formation and scattered. In the ensuing Battle of Lagos, Océan ran aground in Almadora Bay and was burnt by the British, in violation of neutrality laws, while her crew was taken prisoner, including Suffren. He returned to France after several months and was left without employ at sea for several years. = Interwar period = On the return of peace in 1763 Suffren intended again to do the service in the caravans which was required to qualify him to hold the high and lucrative posts of the Order. He was, however, named to the command of the 20-gun xebec Caméléon, which he cruised against the Barbary pirates. Shortly thereafter, he transferred on Singe, also a 20-gun xebec, part of a squadron under Louis Charles du Chaffault de Besné. He took part in the Larache expedition. In 1767, Suffren was promoted to frigate captain and called to Brest to serve on the 64-gun Union, flagship of a squadron headed by Breugnon. Upon his return, he was promoted to Frigate captain on 18 August 1767. After the end of the expedition, Suffren returned to Malta to resume escort duty with the Order. He spent four years, rising from Knight to Commander. In February 1772, he was promoted to Captain in the French Navy, and returned to Toulon to take command of the 26-gun frigate Mignonne. He conducted two patrols in the Eastern Mediterranean. In 1776, Duchaffault appointed Suffren to the command of the 26-gun frigate Alcmène. She departed for a training cruise to drill new navy officers. From that time till the beginning of the War of American Independence he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of training its officers. = War of American independence = Tensions mounted between France and England in early 1778 in the context of the American Revolutionary War, with the Action of 17 June 1778 constituting a step up announcing France's participation in the American Revolutionary War. Suffren was appointed to the fleet of Admiral d'Estaing, leading a division comprising the 64-gun Fantasque, which he personally captained, and the frigates Aimable, Chimère and Engageante. The mission of his force was to support Franco-American efforts in the Battle of Rhode Island by striking a 5-frigate British squadron anchored in Narragansett Bay, off Newport, comprising HMS Juno, Flora, Lark, Orpheus and Cerebus. On 5 August 1778, Suffren entered the Bay and anchored next to the British, who cut their cables and scuttled their ships by fire to avoid capture. The Royal Navy ended up having to destroy ten of their own vessels in all, including five frigates.The remains of the Cerberus are now part of a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the \\"Wreck Sites of HMS Cerberus and HMS Lark.\\" The French fleet sailed to Martinique, where Suffren's division joined up with it, and from there to Grenada, leading to the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. Fantasque was at the front of the vanguard, preceding the 74-gun Zélé. When the two fleets came in contact, she came under fire from the 74-gun Royal Oak and the 70-gun Boyne, sustaining 62 men killed or wounded. After the battle, Admiral d'Estaing sent Suffren with a 2-ship and 3-frigate division to secure the surrender of Carriacou and Union Island. On 7 September 1779, d'Estaing ordered Suffren to blockade the mouth of Savannah River, to cover the landing of French troops in support of the Siege of Savannah, and prevent British ships from escaping. Suffren led the 64-gun Artésien and Provence, and the frigates Fortunée, Blanche and Chimère, sailing into the river and forcing the British to scuttle several ships, notably HMS Rose. On 1 March 1780, Louis XVI granted Suffren a 1,500 French livre pension in recognition of his services. In April, Suffren was given command of the 74-gun , part of a two-ship squadron along with Marseillais, under Captain d'Albert de Rions. They set sail on 19 May 1780 to patrol off Portugal, and joined up with a division under Rear-Admiral de Beausset in Cadiz on 17 June. He then joined up with a combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Luis de Córdova y Córdova. On 9 August, the fleet intercepted a large British convoy, leading to the Action of 9 August 1780. The British escort, comprising the 74-gun , under Captain Sir John Moutray, and the frigates Thetis and Southampton, fled before the vastly superior combined fleet. Suffren attempted to give chase, but the copper sheathing of the British warships gave them a decisive advantage, and he abandoned the pursuit to help with the capture of the merchantmen. After the battle, Suffren wrote a letter to Antoine de Sartine, Secretary of State of the Navy, to advocate for the French Navy to copper its own ships.The full text of Suffren's memorandum on copper sheathing is quoted in Cunat, p.353-354 =Campaign in the Indian Ocean= With the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, France and the Dutch Republic found themselves allied against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Dutch expected the British to send an expeditionary force to try and capture their Dutch Cape Colony, and Suffren was given command of a 5-ship squadron to reinforce it. The task force comprised the 74-gun Héros (under Suffren) and Annibal (under Trémignon), and the 64-gun Artésien (under Cardaillac), Sphinx (under Du Chilleau) and Vengeur (under Forbin), as well as the 16-gun corvette Fortune (under Lieutenant Lusignan), and seven transports carrying the Régiment de Pondichéry, under Brigadier General Thomas Conway. All these ships had a copper sheathing, except for Fortune and Annibal.  Battle of Porto Praya  The squadron departed Brest on 22 March 1781. En route, Artésien, which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at Santiago. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into Praia Harbour. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, Artésien spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \\"enemy ships in sight\\". Understanding that random chance had put him in contact with George Johnstone's squadron, and disregarding neutrality laws, Suffren ordered an immediate attack. At 1000, Suffren's squadron attacked, precipitating the Battle of Porto Praya. Having scattered and disorganised Johnstone's forces, Suffren rushed to The Cape, and arrived at Simon's Bay on 21 June. The Régiment de Pondichéry landed and started fortifying the Cape colony against attacks from land and from the sea, while the fleet repaired its ships and had its sick given medical attention in hospitals ashore. Johnstone arrived in the morning of 21 July, left two frigates to watch the bay, and sailed on to Saldanha Bay. On 24 July, Suffren set sail with four ships, chased away the British frigates, and patrolled the area around the Cape to ascertain the intentions of the British. Satisfied that Johnstone had renounced attacking the Cape colony, he resupplied and sailed to Isle de France (now Mauritius) with the rest of the squadron, arriving on 28 July.  Preliminary operations at Isle de France  Until the outbreak of the Anglo-French War, the French colony of Pondichéry maintained a small squadron under François-Jean-Baptiste l'Ollivier de Tronjoli, comprising the 64-gun Brillant (under Tronjoli), the 40-gun frigate Pourvoyeuse (under Captain Saint-Orens, and three armed merchantmen: the 26-gun corvette Sartine (under du Chayla), the 24-gun Brisson (under Captain du Chézeau), and the 24-gun Lawriston. During the Siege of Pondicherry in 1778, Tronjoli had lost some of his ships and escaped to Isle de France with the survivors, arriving there in late September. Pondichéry fell to the British on 17 October. With these reinforcements, the island was guarded by the 64-gun Brillant, the 54-gun Flamand, the frigates Pourvoyeuse and Consolante, and the smaller Subtile (a 24-gun corvette), Elisabeth (a fluyt) and Sylphide (a 12-gun corvette). Furthermore, on 28 December 1778, the 74-gun Orient departed Brest under Thomas d'Estienne d'Orves to reinforce the colony, and on 27 March 1779, so did the 64-gun Sévère, under la Pallière, escorting the transports Hercule and Trois-Amis, arriving on 9 August 1779. With four ships of the line now at his disposal, Tronjoli departed on 6 December 1779 to cruise off the Cape, but to no avail, and he returned to Isle de France on 13 January 1780. On 3 February 1780, the 64-gun Bizarre departed Lorient to further reinforce Isle de France. After it was confirmed that the British had despatched a squadron under Admiral Hughes in the Indian Ocean, France sent a convoy comprising the 64-gun Protée and Ajax, and the frigate Charmante (under Baron de la Haye), escorting 16 transports ferrying the Régiment d'Austrasie under Brigadier Duchemin de Chenneville. En route, the convoy encountered a British squadron under Admiral George Rodney, yielding the Action of 24 February 1780 in which Protée sacrificed herself and tree smaller transports to lure the British away from the others. Charmante returned to Lorient to bring the news of the engagement, while the other survivors sailed on to Isle de France. By 1780, Tronjoly was recalled to France, leaving d'Orves in command with a total of six ships of the line at his disposal. Suffren arrived at Isle de France on 25 October 1781. The island had been selected as the base for French operations in the Indian Ocean, falling under the overall command of Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau. On 7 December 1781, d'Orves led a 27-ship fleet to Ceylon, with his flag on Orient. He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from Trincomalee to Madras.Present-day Chennai On 19 January, Sévère detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached Héros and Artésien to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman Hinchinbrooke, until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandoned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached Héros, Artésien and Vengeur, but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun HMS Hannibal, under Captain Christy, which the French pressed into their service as Petit Annibal.  Battle of Sadras  In the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.Cunat, p.100 The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started preying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.Cunat, p.101 However, the monsoon caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.Cunat, p.102 Upon Hughes' arrival, Lord Macartney warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of Fort St. George and Black Town. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun HMS Monmouth, the 74-gun Hero, the 50-gun Isis and the armed transport Manilla, under James Alms. D'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re- appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapallière took command of Orient and Cillart that of Sévère; Captain Morard de Galles, of Pourvoyeuse, and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of Petit Annibal, exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on Bellone;Cunat, p.103 Tromelin- Lanuguy took on Subtile; and Galifet took Sylphide. General Duchemin transferred from Orient to Héros.Cunat, p.104 On 14 February, the usual monsoon wind from the North-East resumed, allowing Suffren's squadron to sail South. In the evening, Fine, under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast,Cunat, p.105 but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.Cunat, p.106 Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night Pourvoyeuse drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while Fine lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.Cunat, p.108 In the morning, signals from Fine informed Suffren that HMS Montmouth, Hero, Isis, Aigle and Burford where approaching the French transports. Suffren rushed with his warships to protect the convoy, and Hughes ordered his ships to regroup and form a line of battle.Cunat, p.109 In the morning of 17 February, the fleets were about 6 km apart, the British forming a line and had captured Lawriston, while the French were scattered due to an error in interpreting night signals. Suffren formed a line without consideration for the order of battle,Cunat, p.111 and at 1500 he closed in within gun range, starting the Battle of Sadras. Suffren sustained about 30 men killed and 100 wounded,Cunat, p.115 and light damage to his riggings.Cunat, p.116 At 1900 he broke contact.  Battle of Providien  Suffren returned to Pondichéry, where he arrived on 19 February 1782 and learned that the British squadron was heading for Trincomalee. After consulting Hyder Ali, he decided not to land his troops in Pondichéry, and rather to head for Porto Nove, where he arrived on 23 February.Hennequin, p.299 Hyder Ali despatched André Piveron de Morlat, the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 Lakh rupee a year.Hennequin, p.302 Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet. On 10 April, the two fleets came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvres, trying to gain an advantage on the other. In the morning, Fine captured a British courier and managed to retrieve the dispatches that her captain had thrown overboard, revealing British plans to expel the Dutch from Ceylon.Cunat, p. 127 On 12, the Battle of Providien broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged. Suffren retreated to the safety of the Dutch forts of Batacalo to repair, and tend to those members of his crews who were wounded or suffered from scurvy.  Battle of Negapatam  On 3 June 1782, Suffren departed Batacalo and sailed to Cuddalore, where he received letters from Hyder Ali requesting that he lay siege to Nagapattinam. The French troops reembarked on their transports, when Bellone, which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782. Before the battle, Suffren despatched Pourvoyeuse to Malacca, Résolution to Manila, and Fortitude and Yarmouth to Isle de France, to purchase spare spars, food and ammunition to resupply his fleet. He furtermore kept Sylphide and Diligent handy to bring news of the outcome of the battle to Isle de France. The Battle of Negapatam ensued. The two fleets exchanged fire to over 4 hours, until Hughes retreated. During the battle, Captain Cillart, captain of Sévère, panicked and struck his colours but two of the officers, named Dieu and Kerlero de Rosbo, refused to surrender and resumed firing. HMS Sultan had stopped to launch her boats and take possession of Sévère, and sustained serious damage when the broadsides of Sévère suddenly raked her. Seeing his hand forced, Cillart ordered his flag hoisted again. Suffren cruised off Nagapattinam to observe the moves of the British ships, and seeing them idle, returned to Cuddalore to repair. On the way, HMS Rodney joined up as cartel with Héros, with Captain James Watt of HMS Sultan bringing a letter from Hughes demanding that Suffren hand over Sévère after her surrender. Suffren answered that he was unaware that Sévère had surrendered and promised to launch an investigation, and also warned that without orders from his government he was not at liberty to give away his ships. Following the incident with Sévère, Suffren relieved Cillart of duty and sent him back to Isle de France to be returned to France and court- martialed. He also dismissed Maurville of Artésien, Forbin of Vengeur and De Ruyter of Pourvoyeuse, as well as three more junior officers. Command of Artésien went to Saint-Félix; that of Vengeur went to Cuverville, himself replaced by Lieutenant Périer de Salvert at the command of Flamand; Lieutenant Maureville de Langle was promoted to the command of Sévère; Lieutenant de Beaumont le Maître received command of Ajax, replacing Bouvet de Précourt; and Brillant went to Beaulieu, himself replaced on Bellone by Pierrevert. Later, Beaulieu returned to Bellone after Pierrevert's death in the Action of 12 August 1782, and from then on Lieutenant de Kersauson captained Brillant.  Battle of Trincomalee  Suffren meeting with Hyder Ali on 26 July 1782. Engraving by Jean-Baptiste Morret, 1789. On 25 July 1782, Hyder Ali arrived at Bahour under the gun salutes of the fortress and the whole French squadron. The next day, a 500-man cavalry troop under General Ghulam Ali Khan escorted Suffren, six of his captains and several officers to the encampment of Hyder Ali's army for a meeting with him. Suffren announced that Bussy-Castelnau had arrived to Isle de France with 6 ships of the line, 2 frigates and transports carrying 5,000 soldiers. He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees. He then ajourned the meeting until the next day. On 27, Hyder Ali invited Suffren and Piveron to a private dinner, with European-style seating in deference to his guests. Suffren reported on the battles against Hughes, and they reviewed plans of operations against the British. Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the Malabar Coast and the risk that the Maratha Empire would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore. The next day, Fine joined the squadron with a prize carrying British colonel Horn, of the Madras Army, and Lézard brought news of the arrival of Bussy-Castelnau, with the 74-gun Illustre and the 64-gun Saint Michel, on the theatre of operations. Meanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and Pourvoyeuse sailed to Malacca to pick up spars. In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for Tharangambadi in the hope of discovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find Consolante, arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From Consolante, Suffren learnt that Bussy's Illustre and Saint Michel were awaiting him at Galle with 8 transports of troops and supplies. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ships were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee. On 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. The same day, the cutter Lézard arrived, bringing despatches. The letter, dated from 22 November 1781, notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers, and promoted him to Chef d'Escadre. Furthermore, a letter from Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff (Bailli) of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. On 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to the fort of Trincomalee to negotiate its capitulation. Captain Hay MacDowall surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras. The next day, Captain Quelso, low on water, surrendered Fort Ostenburg under the same conditions. On 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the Battle of Trincomalee. The French line fought disorganised, especially after Vengeur caught fire and had to distance herself from the other ships. The flag of Héros was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After an hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandoning him. The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.  Battle of Cuddalore  When the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. Héros, in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Around that time, Captains Tromelin, Saint-Félix and la Landelle-Roscanvec, who could not get along with Suffren, requested to be relieved. So did Morard de Galles, who was wounded and weakened. On 23 September 1782, Suffren sent Pulvérisateur to Isle de France under M. Le Fer to bring despatches to Governor François de Souillac, with the four captains aboard. This yielded another reshuffle: Annibal went to Captain d'Aymar, Artésien to Captain de Vigues, Saint-Michel to Dupas, Petit-Annibal to Beaulieu, Bizarre to Lieutenant Tréhouret de Pennelé, Fine to Saint-Georges, Bellone to Villaret-Joyeuse, Consolante to Malis, and Lézard to Dufreneau. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, while Suffren chose to sail to Aceh. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by choosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew. The French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. Pourvoyeuse and Bellone arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs. After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau. Suffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of Ganjam, destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 January 1783, the frigate HMS Coventry, unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February. Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. With the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, Fine reported 17 sails closing in. The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. On 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transferred onto the frigate Cléopâtre to personally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea. Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore. On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the Battle of Cuddalore at 1530. On 25, Hughes retreated to Madras, and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel, bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the Treaty of Paris that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate Surveillante arrived from Europe with news of the Peace of Paris and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean. = Post-War = Suffren's squadron arrived at Trincomalee on 8 August. Most of it remained there until October. Suffren himself sailed to Pondichéry on 15 September with Héros and Cléopâtre to confer with Bussy, arriving on 17. There, he learnt of his promotion to Lieutenant général des Armées navales. He departed for Trincomalee on 26, arriving on 29. The fleet departed for Europe on 6 October. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. HMS Exeter ran aground, and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance. Suffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister Castrie and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. A fourth position of Vice-Admiral was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death. In October 1787, with the implementation of the Eden Agreement, tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louis XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788. Legacy= Assessment = Suffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition called him \\"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'. In The Influence of Sea Power upon History, Mahan writes: Lacour-Gayet cites Suffren's instructions before the Battle of Sadras as reminiscent of Nelson's style, in that he was giving advance instruction for a variety of scenarios and was attempting to take the British in a cross-fire and destroy they squadron. In 1942, Admiral Ernest King listed his five favourite admirals of the past as Jervis, Nelson, Tromp, Suffren and Farragut. On the other hand, Las Cases, who had served as a Lieutenant in the Navy, described Suffren to Napoléon as \\"A hard man, very weird, egoistic in the extreme, bad-tempered, poor comrade in arms, liked of no one.\\" More recently, François Caron stated \\"while Chevalier de Suffren displayed an indisputable bravery and an incomparable tactical insight, an analysis of his action shows it to be very mediocre and disappointing.\\" Rémi Monaque offers a more nuanced assessment, finding Suffren an aggressive and innovative commander comparable to Ruyter and Nelson, but also one whose lack of didactic qualities and social graces made misunderstood and disliked by his captains, and thus failed to develop his full potential. = Monuments and memorials = Eight ships of the French Navy have been named Suffren in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez. A number of streets and avenues through France are named in Suffren's honour. In Paris, the Avenue de Suffren runs alongside the Champ de Mars.

After resigning in 1945, Vargas returned to power as the democratically elected president in 1951, serving until his suicide in 1954. Vargas led Brazil for 18 years, the longest of any president, and second in Brazilian history only to Emperor Pedro II among heads of state. He favored nationalism, industrialization, centralization, social welfare and populism – for the latter, Vargas won the nickname, \\"the father of the poor\\". Vargas is one of a number of populists who arose during the 1930s in Latin America, including Lázaro Cárdenas and Juan Perón, who promoted nationalism and pursued social reform. He was a proponent of workers' rights as well as a staunch anti- communist. Vargas was brought to power by political outsiders and the rank- and-file of the Armed Forces in the Revolution of 1930; this was a reaction to his loss in the presidential election earlier that year. His ascent marked the end of the Brazilian Old Republic and the São Paulo-Minas alliance-dominated coffee-with-milk politics. He successfully influenced the outcome of the Brazilian presidential election of 1934, and used fears of a Communist uprising to institute an authoritarian corporatist regime in 1937 known as the New State, modeled on Mussolini's Italy, Salazar's Portugal and Franco’s Spain. Vargas went on to appease and eventually dominate his supporters, and pushed his political agenda as he built a propaganda machine around his figure. Vargas sought to transform Brazil from a plantation-based economy into an industrialized powerhouse, using government intervention. His embrace of developmentalism was expressed not only in strong rhetoric, but also by lending protection to domestic industries and by devoting much state funding to investment aimed at kick-starting \\"strategic\\" sectors and setting up the necessary infrastructure. Vargas created state monopolies for oil (Petrobras), mining (Vale), steelmaking (National Siderurgy Company), alkalis (National Alkalis Company) and automobiles (National Motors Factory). His policies shaped the Brazilian economic debate for decades, from the governments of Juscelino Kubitschek and leftist João Goulart to the right-wing military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985. The protectionist trend was reversed by the 1990s with the liberal reforms of Fernando Collor de Mello and Fernando Henrique Cardoso. With the global rise of democracy in the aftermath of World War II, Vargas was forced to step down in 1945 and was succeeded by José Linhares the same year. Nevertheless, the economic growth that occurred under his administration made him a popular figure in Brazilian politics even after his resignation. His popularity awarded him a late presidential term in 1951, but growing political strife over his views and methods led to his suicide in 1954. He was the first president in the country to draw widespread support from the masses and is regarded as the most influential Brazilian politician of the twentieth century.Hassan Arvin-Rad, Maria José Willumsen, Ann Dryden Witte.

He had also been a lawyer and landowner who occupied the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1943 until his death. Background Getúlio Vargas' parents: Cândida and Manuel Vargas. Photographed with his wife Darci Vargas in 1911, during the period known as Brazilian Belle Époque. Vargas was born in São Borja, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, on 19 April 1882, to Manuel do Nascimento Vargas and Cândida Dornelles Vargas. His father had origins in Azores and São Paulo, being a descendant of early São Paulo families (\\"paulistas\\"): he was a descendant of Amador Bueno, a noted paulista from the colonial Brazilian era. His mother was descended from a wealthy family of Azorean Portuguese descent.KOIFMAN, Fábio. Presidentes Do Brasil: De Deodoro A Fhc. The son of a traditional family of \\"gaúchos\\", he embarked on a military career. Vargas enlisted as a private in 1899 in the sixth infantry battalion and later joined the military college at Rio Pardo. Vargas then turned to law school at Porto Alegre in the Rio Grande, and while there he published a political newspaper, O Debate. Vargas was the chosen orator in his graduating class of 1907 and was immediately appointed district attorney. In 1909 he opened his own law office in São Borja.Lillian Fisher \\"Getulio Vargas, The Strong Man of Brazil\\" International Honors Society of Social Sciences Vol. 19 No. 2 Pg. 80–86 April, 1944 Entering Republican politics, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul and later to the federal Chamber of Deputies in 1922, where he became the floor leader for his state's delegation in Congress. He served as Minister of Finance from 1926 to 1928 under President Washington Luís, from which post he resigned to enter the gubernatorial race in his home state. Once elected Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, he became a leading figure in the national opposition, urging the end of electoral corruption through the adoption of the universal and secret ballot. As Governor of Rio Grande do Sul he distinguished himself as an excellent administrator. During his term as governor he reorganized the agricultural system. He established a state mortgage and agricultural bank. He also created the department of agriculture in his state. Vargas also worked hard to improve schools and infrastructure during his term as governor. He and his wife Darci Lima Sarmanho, whom he married in March 1911, had five children: Lutero, Alzira, Jandira, Manuel e Getulinho. According to legend, Vargas' real love was not his wife, but Aimee de Sa Sottomaior, later Aimée de Heeren, recognized by the international fashion press as one of the world's most glamorous and beautiful women. The relationship was a Brazilian state secret, although Vargas did mention her in a diary published after the death of his wife. Aimee de Herren, later living between France and the United States and admired by other famous statesmen such as the Kennedy brothers, never confirmed nor denied the rumor. Although he would later involve the Catholic Church closely with the state, Vargas was firmly agnostic. National politics Washington Luís and his cabinet, 1926. Vargas can be seen as the first, from left to right, on the second row. Between the two World Wars, Brazil was a rapidly industrializing nation popularly regarded as \\"the sleeping giant of the Americas\\" and a potential world power. However, the oligarchic and decentralized confederation of the Old Republic, dominated by landed interests, in effect showed little concern for promoting industrialization, urbanization, and other broad interests of the new middle class. The coffee planters of São Paulo, in particular, were content with exporting their product abroad while relying on foreign investment to build the economy. In addition, they feared reforms that might lead to radical social change. Through the agreements of café com leite, São Paulo and their junior partner, Minas Gerais, rotated the presidency and dominated national politics, securing political stability and the economic success of the upper classes. However, resentment had grown among the middle class, who shared the landowners' fears of radical social change, but who wanted to invest in industrialization and restrict foreign investment. In 1926, Washington Luis, a native of Macaé a city of Rio de Janeiro but ran for São Paulo, was elected president. His election had been assisted by the political machine of Borges de Medeiros, and so he nominated one of that machine's members, Getulio Vargas, to be his Finance Secretary. Although Vargas was only to serve two years as Finance Secretary before returning to Rio Grande do Sul to become governor, he gained valuable recognition and experience on the national level. First presidency=Vargas and the Revolution of 1930= Getúlio Vargas with other leaders of the Revolution of 1930 in Itararé, shortly after the overthrow of President Washington Luís. The Great Depression set off the tensions that had been building in Brazilian society for some time, spurring revolutionary leaders to action. The elections of 1930 pitted Júlio Prestes of the establishment, São Paulo-faction, against Vargas, who led a broad coalition of middle-class industrialists, planters from outside São Paulo, and the reformist faction of the military known as the tenentes. The middle class resented free market and café com leite policies that let foreign companies out-compete them and restricted industrialization. The non-São Paulo landowners feared radical change and had no desire for the economic nationalism advocated by the bourgeoisie, but did want to end the dominance of São Paulo. The tenentes had been led through the Brazilian countryside by Luis Carlos Prestes to rally support for a military coup, and though they failed to find support, they had become exposed to rural poverty and now favored social reform. Together, these disparate groups made up the Liberal Alliance. Support was especially strong in the provinces of Minas Gerais, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Sul, because in nominating another Paulista to succeed himself, Washington Luis had violated the traditional alteration between Minas Gerais and São Paulo. Vargas campaigned carefully, needing to please a large range of supporters. He used populist rhetoric and promoted bourgeois concerns. He opposed the primacy of São Paulo, but did not challenge the planters' legitimacy and kept his calls for social reform moderate. The election itself was plagued by corruption and denounced by both sides, and when it had become clear that the São Paulo candidate, Júlio Prestes, had won the election, tensions were high. When the vice-presidential candidate of the Liberal Alliance was assassinated, the military decided to initiate a bloodless coup. On October 24, 1930, they ousted President Washington Luís and the president-elect Júlio Prestes, installing Vargas as 'interim president'. =Provisorial Presidency (1930-1934)= Vargas with members of his cabinet on inauguration day, 3 November 1930. The man with glasses (center) is Lindolfo Collor, maternal grandfather of Fernando Collor de Mello, the future President of Brazil. Vargas and his cabinet in 1931. Vargas was a wealthy pro-industrial nationalist and anti-communist who favoured corporatism. Although he had been careful not to offend the landowners during the campaign, he did advocate moderate social reform and economic nationalism. He began by addressing the crisis in the coffee industry, which was suffering from low prices due to the Great Depression. Vargas implemented the traditional solution of valorization, in which the state bought up extra coffee supplies. In addition, Vargas promoted the diversification of agriculture, especially with cotton. Like FDR in the U.S., Vargas employed economic stimulus. A state interventionist policy utilizing tax breaks, lowered duties, and import quotas allowed Vargas to expand the domestic industrial base. Vargas linked his pro-industrial policies to nationalism, advocating heavy tariffs to \\"protect our manufacturers to the point where it will become unpatriotic to feed or clothe ourselves with imported goods.\\" Vargas quelled a female workers' strike in São Paulo by co- opting much of their platform but requiring their \\"factory commissions\\" to use government mediation in the future. Vargas, reflecting the influence of the tenentes, even advocated a program of social welfare and reform similar to the New Deal. One of Vargas' first acts in a pattern of Populist gestures was the promotion of Pedro Ernesto Baptista's candidacy for mayor of Rio de Janeiro. He also introduced voting reforms for the election of the constituent assembly that would draft the 1934 constitution, including a secret ballot, votes for women, and a voting age of eighteen instead of twenty-one. Opposition to Vargas was radicalised in the 1932 movement that was aimed at the restoration of democracy and the establishment of a new constitution. The revolt was beaten back, but a new constitution was written in 1934. After that, Vargas seized absolute power and controlled dissidents through press and mail censorship. His tenuous coalition also lacked a coherent program, being committed to a broad vision of modernization, but little more specific. Vargas, especially during his early years, was always in danger of being ousted by one or more of the groups in his coalition, including the anti-São Paulo planters, the bourgeoisie, and the military. =Constitutional Presidency (1934-1937)= Paint of Vargas The parallels between Vargas and the European police states began to appear by 1934, when a new constitution was enacted with some direct almost-fascist influences. Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July, contained provisions that resembled Italian and Spanish corporatism, which had the enthusiastic support of the pro-fascist wing of the disparate tenente movement and industrialists, who were attracted to Mussolini's co-optation of unions through state-run, sham syndicates. As in Italy, and later Spain and Germany, Fascist-style programs would serve two important aims, stimulating industrial growth and suppressing the communist influence in the country. Its stated purpose, however, was uniting all classes in mutual interests. The constitution established a new Chamber of Deputies that placed government authority over the private economy, which established a system of state-guided capitalism aimed at industrialization and reducing foreign dependency. \\"Progressive nationalization\\" would be used to bring natural resources under state control, and the government would have the right to set minimum wages, mediate in strikes, and enact labor legislation. Nonetheless, a significant amount of political power was still preserved for the states and the federalism of the Old Republic continued. After 1934, the regime designated corporate representatives according to class and profession, but maintained private ownership of Brazilian-owned business. Based on increased labor rights and social investment, Brazilian corporatism was actually a strategy to increase industrial output utilizing a strong nationalist appeal. Vargas, and later Juan Perón in neighboring Argentina, emulated some of Mussolini's strategy of mediating class disputes and co- opting workers' demands under the banner of nationalism. Under the increase of workers' rights also, Vargas greatly expanded labor regulations with the consent of industry, pacified by strong industrial growth. The working day was set at eight hours in commerce and industry, minimum wages were established nationwide, and benefits programs such as pensions and paid vacations were guaranteed. Despite the material gains of labor, Vargas began slowly shifting to the right. Reforms were not extended to cover the 85% of workers in the agricultural sector, and little effort was made even to enforce the minimum wage in rural areas. Meanwhile, the president came into increasing conflict with Luis Carlos Prestes, the former leader of the tenentes who was now in charge of the Brazilian Communist Party. Prestes was also in charge of the National Liberation Alliance (ANL), which was banned in 1935 after Prestes criticized Vargas. A rebellion of the ANL and Communists in 1935 gave Vargas the excuse he needed to consolidate his power.  The New State (1937-1945)  Propaganda of the New State. Vargas faced having to step down as president in 1938 because his own 1934 constitution prohibited the president from succeeding himself. On 29 September 1937, Gen. Dutra, his rightist collaborator, revealed \\"the Cohen Plan\\", which detailed a plan for a Communist revolution. He publicly demanded that the government declare a state of siege. On 10 November 1937, Vargas announced in a nationwide radio address that he was seizing emergency powers. He also dissolved Congress and canceled the elections due for January 1938. On the same night, the constitution was recast into a severely authoritarian document that concentrated virtually all power in Vargas' hands. The regime created by this document is known as the Estado Novo (New State). The short interval strongly suggests that the self-coup had been planned well in advance. Under the Estado Novo, Vargas abolished political parties, imposed censorship, established a centralized police force, and filled prisons with political dissidents, while evoking a sense of nationalism that transcended class and bound the masses to the state. He ended up repressing his erstwhile supporters, the \\"Integralists,\\" as well, once the communists were already defeated. The Integralists wished for a total fascist dictatorship, which was more than he desired. During the Estado Novo Vargas made major changes to the Brazilian economy for the betterment of Brazil. But also with help and pressure from the United States, because of the second World War. Vargas began to prioritize the middle class and provided for higher education and better job opportunities. Vargas also began to focus on industrialization; this led to the creation of the first steel mill in Brazil at Volta Redonda. To help further modernize and industrialize Brazil Vargas nationalized oil production and refinement. To improve the life of the laborer Vargas implemented the forty hour work week, a minimum wage, and other regulations to protect middle class and poorer workers. The 1937 Constitution provided for elections to a new Congress, as well as a referendum to confirm Vargas' actions. However, neither were held – ostensibly due to the dangerous international situation. Instead, under an article of the Constitution that was supposed to be transitional pending new elections, Vargas assumed legislative as well as executive powers. Also, under the 1937 Constitution Vargas should have remained president for only six more years (until November 1943), but instead stayed in office until 1945. For all intents and purposes, Vargas ruled for eight years under what amounted to martial law. =Vargas and the Axis Powers= Vargas meets with Italy's Air Marshal Italo Balbo in the Catete Palace, 15 January 1931. The repressions that followed the communist coup d'état attempt in Brazil in November 1935 increased the cooperation between Brazil and Germany. After Brazil deported the revolutionary Jewish German Olga Benário Prestes, wife of Luís Carlos Prestes to Germany in 1937, Brazil was invited to be part of the Axis Powers at the side of Japan, Italy and Germany. However, when Brazil refused this invitation at the advent of the \\"Estado Novo\\" at the end of that same year, the relations between Brazil and the countries of the Axis started to chill. Vargas (left) with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rio de Janeiro, during the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Brazil, 1936. Vargas sent Aimée Lopes de Sotto Maior, later known as Aimée de Heeren, to Paris as a secret agent to investigate the situation in Europe. Under cover as a \\"wealthy fashionista\\", Aimée connected with a range of society figures, not only French but also German, Italian and British. Through Helmuth James von Moltke she obtained secret information about Hitler's plans, prompting her to urge Vargas to withdraw from Germany. Aimée had a strong personal influence on the president. This estrangement also occurred in part due to the German-Italian-Japanese powers becoming frustrated in regards to what they believed the Estado Novo should represent. The policy of forced assimilation and nationalization imposed by Vargas and the military over every immigrant community, including German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese, as well as the prohibition of any political activities that were not directly endorsed by the central power in Rio de Janeiro, which included the Nazi Party in Brazil and its allies, the Brazilian Integralists, motivated Italian-Spanish-German support of the Integralists' coup d'état attempt in May 1938. The failure of that action and the British naval blockade on Atlantic trade with Germany, Italy and Spain, especially from 1940 onwards, led to a sharp deterioration of relations between Brazil and the Axis powers.Dennison de Oliveira, \\"Os soldados alemães de Vargas\\" Portuguese [Germans against Hitler; \\"The German soldiers of Vargas\\" ] 1st Chapter, Jurua print. 2008 World War II and the fall of the New State regime. From 1940, the US started to reach out to Brazilians with its \\"Good Neighbor Policy\\". The US also granted large loans to Brazil, which Vargas used to industrialize the country. Vargas, always a shrewd, low-key, and reasoned pragmatist, sided with the Allies for economic reasons after a period of ambiguity, since the Allies were more viable trading partners and helped with money. However, he and the military were slowly forced to liberalize the regime because of complications arising from this alliance. In siding with the Allies, one agreement that Vargas made was to help the Allies with rubber production in order to receive loans and credit from the US. In reprisal for breaking off diplomatic relations in January 1942, and assigning air bases to Americans in the north of Brazil, Hitler ordered the extension of the Axis naval offensive over the South Atlantic. After Brazil's merchant ships were sunk by German and Italian submarines, at the cost of hundreds of civilian deaths, Brazil sided with the Allies, declared war on Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 and eventually sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian Front in the second half of 1944. This siding with the Allies created a paradox at home not unnoticed by Brazil's middle class – an authoritarian regime, still with some fascistic overtones, joining forces with the Allies. This increased the anti- dictatorship sentiment at home even more. Vargas astutely responded to the newly liberal sentiments of a middle class that was no longer fearful of disorder and proletarian discontent by moving away from repression. He promised \\"a new postwar era of liberty\\" that included amnesty for political prisoners, presidential elections, and the legalization of opposition parties, including the moderated and irreparably weakened Communist Party. The forces released by this political liberalization severely weakened the Estado Novo and was substantial enough to prompt his own war ministry to force Vargas' resignation on 29 October 1945. Democracy returned a few months later with the 1945 presidential election. Labor legislation Despite the passage of many labor laws (such as paid vacation, minimum wage, and maternity leave), there were still many shortcomings in the enforcement and implementation of labor legislation.Loewenstein, Karl.

Pg 70 Time away from powerSecond presidency Official photograph of Vargas' second term as President, 1951 When he left the Estado Novo presidency, the economic surplus of Brazil was high and the industry was growing. After four years, however, pro-US President Eurico Dutra wasted huge quantities of money protecting foreign, mostly US, industry, and distanced himself from the ideas of nationalism and modernization of the country championed by Vargas. Vargas returned to politics in 1951 and through a free and secret ballot was re-elected President of the Republic. Hampered by the economic crisis largely engendered by the policies of Dutra, Vargas pursued a nationalist policy, turning to the country's natural resources and away from foreign dependency. As part of this policy, he founded Petrobrás (Brazilian Petroleum), a large, multinational petroleum concern largely owned by the Government of Brazil. Death Vargas' political adversaries initiated a crisis which culminated in the Rua Tonelero incident, where Major Rubens Vaz was killed during an attempt on the life of Vargas' main adversary, Carlos Lacerda. Lieutenant Gregório Fortunato, chief of Vargas' personal guard, also called \\"Black Angel\\", was accused of masterminding the assassination attempt. This aroused a reaction in the military against Vargas and the generals demanded his resignation. In a last- ditch effort Vargas called a special cabinet meeting on the eve of August 24, but rumors spread that the armed forces officers were implacable. Republic Museum in Rio de Janeiro. Having lost control of the situation, Vargas shot himself in the chest on August 24, 1954, in the Catete Palace with a pistol. Vargas' suicide note was found and read on the radio two hours after his son discovered the body. The famous last lines read, \\"Serenely, I take my first step on the road to eternity. I leave life to enter history.\\" Vargas' suicide has been interpreted in various ways. \\"His death by suicide simultaneously traded on the image of a valiant warrior selflessly fighting for the protection of national interests, alongside the image of a crafty and calculating statesman, whose political machinations reeked of demagoguery and self-interest.\\"Daryle Williams and Barbara Weinstein, \\"Vargas Morto: The Death and Life of a Brazilian Statesman,\\" in Death, Dismemberment, and Memory: Body Politics in Latin America, edited by Lyman L.

Vargas' body was on public view in a glass-topped coffin. The route of the cortege carrying the body from the Presidential Palace to the airport was lined with tens of thousands of Brazilians.

The popular outrage that his suicide caused had supposedly been so strong that it thwarted the ambitions of his enemies, among them rightists, anti-nationalists, pro- United States elements, and even the pro-Prestes Brazilian Communist Party for several years.

The spelling 'fibre' is typically used outside the US. CFRPs can be expensive to produce, but are commonly used wherever high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness (rigidity) are required, such as aerospace, superstructures of ships, automotive, civil engineering, sports equipment, and an increasing number of consumer and technical applications. The binding polymer is often a thermoset resin such as epoxy, but other thermoset or thermoplastic polymers, such as polyester, vinyl ester, or nylon, are sometimes used. The properties of the final CFRP product can be affected by the type of additives introduced to the binding matrix (resin). The most common additive is silica, but other additives such as rubber and carbon nanotubes can be used. Carbon fiber is sometimes referred to as graphite- reinforced polymer or graphite fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP is less common, as it clashes with glass-(fiber)-reinforced polymer). Properties CFRP are composite materials. In this case the composite consists of two parts: a matrix and a reinforcement. In CFRP the reinforcement is carbon fiber, which provides the strength. The matrix is usually a polymer resin, such as epoxy, to bind the reinforcements together.. substech.com Because CFRP consists of two distinct elements, the material properties depend on these two elements. Reinforcement gives CFRP its strength and rigidity, measured by stress and elastic modulus respectively. Unlike isotropic materials like steel and aluminum, CFRP has directional strength properties. The properties of CFRP depend on the layouts of the carbon fiber and the proportion of the carbon fibers relative to the polymer. The two different equations governing the net elastic modulus of composite materials using the properties of the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix can also be applied to carbon fiber reinforced plastics. The following equation, :E_c = V_mE_m + V_fE_f is valid for composite materials with the fibers oriented in the direction of the applied load. E_c is the total composite modulus, V_m and V_f are the volume fractions of the matrix and fiber respectively in the composite, and E_m and E_f are the elastic moduli of the matrix and fibers respectively. The other extreme case of the elastic modulus of the composite with the fibers oriented transverse to the applied load can be found using the following equation: :E_c = \\\\left( \\\\frac{V_m}{E_m} + \\\\frac{V_f}{E_f} \\\\right)^{-1} The fracture toughness of carbon fiber reinforced plastics is governed by the following mechanisms: 1) debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix, 2) fiber pull-out, and 3) delamination between the CFRP sheets. Typical epoxy-based CFRPs exhibit virtually no plasticity, with less than 0.5% strain to failure. Although CFRPs with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus, the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically. As such, recent efforts to toughen CFRPs include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix. One such material with high promise is PEEK, which exhibits an order of magnitude greater toughness with similar elastic modulus and tensile strength. However, PEEK is much more difficult to process and more expensive. Despite its high initial strength-to-weight ratio, a design limitation of CFRP is its lack of a definable fatigue limit. This means, theoretically, that stress cycle failure cannot be ruled out. While steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue or endurance limits, the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of CFRP are difficult to predict and design against. As a result, when using CFRP for critical cyclic-loading applications, engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life. Environmental effects such as temperature and humidity can have profound effects on the polymer-based composites, including most CFRPs. While CFRPs demonstrate excellent corrosion resistance, the effect of moisture at wide ranges of temperatures can lead to degradation of the mechanical properties of CFRPs, particularly at the matrix- fiber interface. While the carbon fibers themselves are not affected by the moisture diffusing into the material, the moisture plasticizes the polymer matrix. This led to significant changes in properties that are dominantly influenced by the matrix in CFRPs such as compressive, interlaminar shear, and impact properties. The epoxy matrix used for engine fan blades is designed to be impervious against jet fuel, lubrication, and rain water, and external paint on the composites parts is applied to minimize damage from ultraviolet light. The carbon fibers can cause galvanic corrosion when CRP parts are attached to aluminum. Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics are very hard to machine, and causes significant tool wear. The tool wear in CFRP machining is dependent on the fiber orientation and machining condition of the cutting process. In order to reduce tool wear various types of coated tools are used in machining CFRP and CFRP-metal stack. Manufacture Carbon fiber reinforced polymer The primary element of CFRP is a carbon filament; this is produced from a precursor polymer such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, or petroleum pitch. For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon, the precursor is first spun into filament yarns, using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer chains in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms (carbonization), producing the final carbon fiber. The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities, then wound on to bobbins. From these fibers, a unidirectional sheet is created. These sheets are layered onto each other in a quasi-isotropic layup, e.g. 0°, +60°, or −60° relative to each other. From the elementary fiber, a bidirectional woven sheet can be created, i.e. a twill with a 2/2 weave. The process by which most CFRPs are made varies, depending on the piece being created, the finish (outside gloss) required, and how many of the piece will be produced. In addition, the choice of matrix can have a profound effect on the properties of the finished composite. Many CFRP parts are created with a single layer of carbon fabric that is backed with fiberglass. A tool called a chopper gun is used to quickly create these composite parts. Once a thin shell is created out of carbon fiber, the chopper gun cuts rolls of fiberglass into short lengths and sprays resin at the same time, so that the fiberglass and resin are mixed on the spot. The resin is either external mix, wherein the hardener and resin are sprayed separately, or internal mixed, which requires cleaning after every use. Manufacturing methods may include the following: =Molding= One method of producing CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a mold in the shape of the final product. The alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material. The mold is then filled with epoxy and is heated or air-cured. The resulting part is very corrosion-resistant, stiff, and strong for its weight. Parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold, with epoxy either preimpregnated into the fibers (also known as pre-preg) or \\"painted\\" over it. High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or autoclave-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength. An alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or EPS foam inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber. =Vacuum bagging= For simple pieces of which relatively few copies are needed (1–2 per day), a vacuum bag can be used. A fiberglass, carbon fiber, or aluminum mold is polished and waxed, and has a release agent applied before the fabric and resin are applied, and the vacuum is pulled and set aside to allow the piece to cure (harden). There are three ways to apply the resin to the fabric in a vacuum mold. The first method is manual and called a wet layup, where the two-part resin is mixed and applied before being laid in the mold and placed in the bag. The other one is done by infusion, where the dry fabric and mold are placed inside the bag while the vacuum pulls the resin through a small tube into the bag, then through a tube with holes or something similar to evenly spread the resin throughout the fabric. Wire loom works perfectly for a tube that requires holes inside the bag. Both of these methods of applying resin require hand work to spread the resin evenly for a glossy finish with very small pin-holes. A third method of constructing composite materials is known as a dry layup. Here, the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (pre-preg) and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film. The assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure. The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes. Pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of autoclave pressures to purge the residual gases out. =Compression molding= A quicker method uses a compression mold. This is a two-piece (male and female) mold usually made out of aluminum or steel that is pressed together with the fabric and resin between the two. The benefit is the speed of the entire process. Some car manufacturers, such as BMW, claimed to be able to cycle a new part every 80 seconds. However, this technique has a very high initial cost since the molds require CNC machining of very high precision. =Filament winding= For difficult or convoluted shapes, a filament winder can be used to make CFRP parts by winding filaments around a mandrel or a core. Applications Applications for CFRP include the following: =Aerospace engineering= A composite Airbus A350 with carbon fiber themed livery The Airbus A350 XWB is built of 52% CFRP including wing spars and fuselage components, overtaking the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for the aircraft with the highest weight ratio for CFRP, which is 50%. This was one of the first commercial aircraft to have wing spars made from composites. The Airbus A380 was one of the first commercial airliners to have a central wing- box made of CFRP; it is the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross- section instead of the wings being partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing, continuous cross section optimises aerodynamic efficiency. Moreover, the trailing edge, along with the rear bulkhead, empennage, and un-pressurised fuselage are made of CFRP. However, many delays have pushed order delivery dates back because of problems with the manufacture of these parts. Many aircraft that use CFRP have experienced delays with delivery dates due to the relatively new processes used to make CFRP components, whereas metallic structures have been studied and used on airframes for years, and the processes are relatively well understood. A recurrent problem is the monitoring of structural ageing, for which new methods are constantly investigated, due to the unusual multi-material and anisotropic nature of CFRP. In 1968 a Hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly was in service on the Rolls- Royce Conways of the Vickers VC10s operated by BOAC. Specialist aircraft designers and manufacturers Scaled Composites have made extensive use of CFRP throughout their design range, including the first private manned spacecraft Spaceship One. CFRP is widely used in micro air vehicles (MAVs) because of its high strength to weight ratio. =Automotive engineering= CFRPs are extensively used in high-end automobile racing. The high cost of carbon fiber is mitigated by the material's unsurpassed strength-to-weight ratio, and low weight is essential for high-performance automobile racing. Race-car manufacturers have also developed methods to give carbon fiber pieces strength in a certain direction, making it strong in a load-bearing direction, but weak in directions where little or no load would be placed on the member. Conversely, manufacturers developed omnidirectional carbon fiber weaves that apply strength in all directions. This type of carbon fiber assembly is most widely used in the \\"safety cell\\" monocoque chassis assembly of high- performance race-cars. The first carbon fiber monocoque chassis was introduced in Formula One by McLaren in the 1981 season. It was designed by John Barnard and was widely copied in the following seasons by other F1 teams due to the extra rigidity provided to the chassis of the cars. Many supercars over the past few decades have incorporated CFRP extensively in their manufacture, using it for their monocoque chassis as well as other components. As far back as 1971, the Citroën SM offered optional lightweight carbon fiber wheels. Use of the material has been more readily adopted by low-volume manufacturers who used it primarily for creating body-panels for some of their high-end cars due to its increased strength and decreased weight compared with the glass- reinforced polymer they used for the majority of their products. =Civil engineering= CFRP has become a notable material in structural engineering applications. Studied in an academic context as to its potential benefits in construction, it has also proved itself cost-effective in a number of field applications strengthening concrete, masonry, steel, cast iron, and timber structures. Its use in industry can be either for retrofitting to strengthen an existing structure or as an alternative reinforcing (or pre-stressing) material instead of steel from the outset of a project. Retrofitting has become the increasingly dominant use of the material in civil engineering, and applications include increasing the load capacity of old structures (such as bridges) that were designed to tolerate far lower service loads than they are experiencing today, seismic retrofitting, and repair of damaged structures. Retrofitting is popular in many instances as the cost of replacing the deficient structure can greatly exceed the cost of strengthening using CFRP.Ismail, N. \\"Strengthening of bridges using CFRP composites.\\" najif.net. Applied to reinforced concrete structures for flexure, CFRP typically has a large impact on strength (doubling or more the strength of the section is not uncommon), but only a moderate increase in stiffness (perhaps a 10% increase). This is because the material used in this application is typically very strong (e.g., 3000 MPa ultimate tensile strength, more than 10 times mild steel) but not particularly stiff (150 to 250 GPa, a little less than steel, is typical). As a consequence, only small cross-sectional areas of the material are used. Small areas of very high strength but moderate stiffness material will significantly increase strength, but not stiffness. CFRP can also be applied to enhance shear strength of reinforced concrete by wrapping fabrics or fibers around the section to be strengthened. Wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section, greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading. Such 'seismic retrofit' is the major application in earthquake-prone areas, since it is much more economic than alternative methods. If a column is circular (or nearly so) an increase in axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping. In this application, the confinement of the CFRP wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete. However, although large increases are achieved in the ultimate collapse load, the concrete will crack at only slightly enhanced load, meaning that this application is only occasionally used. Specialist ultra-high modulus CFRP (with tensile modulus of 420 GPa or more) is one of the few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams. In typical use, it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section, both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the neutral axis, thus greatly reducing the maximum tensile stress in the cast iron. In the United States, pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) account for a vast majority of water transmission mains. Due to their large diameters, failures of PCCP are usually catastrophic and affect large populations. Approximately of PCCP have been installed between 1940 and 2006. Corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the pre- stressing wires in many PCCP lines. Over the past decade, CFRPs have been utilized to internally line PCCP, resulting in a fully structural strengthening system. Inside a PCCP line, the CFRP liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe. The composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range, to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained. CFRP liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe. CFRP is a more costly material than its counterparts in the construction industry, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (AFRP), though CFRP is, in general, regarded as having superior properties. Much research continues to be done on using CFRP both for retrofitting and as an alternative to steel as a reinforcing or pre- stressing material. Cost remains an issue and long-term durability questions still remain. Some are concerned about the brittle nature of CFRP, in contrast to the ductility of steel. Though design codes have been drawn up by institutions such as the American Concrete Institute, there remains some hesitation among the engineering community about implementing these alternative materials. In part, this is due to a lack of standardization and the proprietary nature of the fiber and resin combinations on the market. =Carbon-fiber microelectrodes= Carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber microelectrodes. In this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of 5–7 μm is sealed in a glass capillary. At the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75–150 μm to make carbon- fiber cylinder electrode. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes are used either in amperometry or fast-scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of biochemical signaling. =Sports goods= A carbon-fiber and Kevlar canoe (Placid Boatworks Rapidfire at the Adirondack Canoe Classic) CFRP is now widely used in sports equipment such as in squash, tennis, and badminton racquets, sport kite spars, high-quality arrow shafts, hockey sticks, fishing rods, surfboards, high end swim fins, and rowing shells. Amputee athletes such as Jonnie Peacock use carbon fiber blades for running. It is used as a shank plate in some basketball sneakers to keep the foot stable, usually running the length of the shoe just above the sole and left exposed in some areas, usually in the arch. Controversially, in 2006, cricket bats with a thin carbon-fiber layer on the back were introduced and used in competitive matches by high- profile players including Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey. The carbon fiber was claimed to merely increase the durability of the bats, but it was banned from all first-class matches by the ICC in 2007. A CFRP bicycle frame weighs less than one of steel, aluminum, or titanium having the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing, or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair. =Other applications= The fire resistance of polymers and thermo-set composites is significantly improved if a thin layer of carbon fibers is moulded near the surface because a dense, compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat. CFRP is being used in an increasing number of high-end products that require stiffness and low weight, these include: *Musical instruments, including violin bows; guitar picks, necks (carbon fiber rods), and pick-guards; drum shells; bagpipe chanters; and entire musical instruments such as Luis and Clark's carbon fiber cellos, violas, and violins; and Blackbird Guitars' acoustic guitars and ukuleles; also audio components such as turntables and loudspeakers. *Firearms use it to replace certain metal, wood, and fiberglass components but many of the internal parts are still limited to metal alloys as current reinforced plastics are unsuitable. *High-performance drone bodies and other radio-controlled vehicle and aircraft components such as helicopter rotor blades. *Lightweight poles such as: tripod legs, tent poles, fishing rods, billiards cues, walking sticks, and high-reach poles such as for window cleaning. *Dentistry, carbon fiber posts are used in restoring root canal treated teeth. *Railed train bogies for passenger service. This reduces the weight by up to 50% compared to metal bogies, which contributes to energy savings. *Laptop shells and other high performance cases. *Carbon woven fabrics. *Archery, carbon fiber arrows and bolts, stock, and rail. *As a filament for the 3D fused deposition modeling printing process, carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (polyamide-carbon filament) is used for the production of sturdy but lightweight tools and parts due to its high strength and tear length. *District heating pipe rehabilitation, using CIPP method. Disposal and recycling CFRPs have a long service lifetime when protected from the sun. When it is time to decommission CFRPs, they cannot be melted down in air like many metals. When free of vinyl (PVC or polyvinyl chloride) and other halogenated polymers, CFRPs can be thermally decomposed via thermal depolymerization in an oxygen-free environment. This can be accomplished in a refinery in a one-step process. Capture and reuse of the carbon and monomers is then possible. CFRPs can also be milled or shredded at low temperature to reclaim the carbon fiber; however, this process shortens the fibers dramatically. Just as with downcycled paper, the shortened fibers cause the recycled material to be weaker than the original material. There are still many industrial applications that do not need the strength of full- length carbon fiber reinforcement. For example, chopped reclaimed carbon fiber can be used in consumer electronics, such as laptops. It provides excellent reinforcement of the polymers used even if it lacks the strength-to-weight ratio of an aerospace component. Carbon nanotube reinforced polymer (CNRP) In 2009, Zyvex Technologies introduced carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy and carbon pre-pregs. Carbon nanotube reinforced polymer (CNRP) is several times stronger and tougher than CFRP and is used in the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II as a structural material for aircraft. CNRP still uses carbon fiber as the primary reinforcement, but the binding matrix is a carbon nanotube-filled epoxy.

The station was a part of the Cavite Navy Yard across the peninsula. The naval station had a runway that was built after World War II, which was used by U.S. Navy Lockheed P-2 Neptune, Lockheed P-3 Orion, and Martin P4M Mercator maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft. An adjacent seaplane runway, ramp area and seaplane tender berths also supported Martin P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft until that type's retirement from active naval service in the late 1960s. NAS Sangley Point/NAVSTA Sangley Point was also used extensively during the Vietnam War, primarily for U.S. Navy patrol squadrons forward deployed from the United States on six-month rotations. The naval station was turned over to the Philippine government in 1971. It is now operated by the Philippine Air Force and Philippine Navy.  Spanish Period  The Spanish colonial government in the Philippines, which had ruled the Philippines since 1571, found a useful purpose for the tiny peninsula across the bay. Ever distrustful of the Chinese merchants who called on every port from Japan to the Arabian peninsula, the Spanish passed laws restricting their entry into the capital city of Manila. These Chinese merchants, then known as sangleys, could, however, sell their wares across the bay from the city on the narrow strip of land that would eventually bear their name. In addition to their role as international traders, Chinese artisans and craftsmen were employed as inexpensive labor by the Spanish shipbuilders who built ships at Sangley that were used in the galleon trade route between Manila and Acapulco. In 1871 the Spanish established a naval hospital, managed by the Sisters of Charity, at Cañacao near the western end of the peninsula. In addition, as the age of sail began to wane and the age of steam was ushered in, the eastern end of Sangley Point became a coaling station and support facility for the Spanish naval base located just across Cañacao Bay at the Cavite naval yard.  American period = Battle of Manila Bay = Cavite Navy Yard in 1899. In 1898, diplomatic relations between the United States and Spain were strained by events related to the insurrection taking place on the Spanish island of Cuba. In anticipation of hostilities with Spain, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt ordered the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, under the command of Commodore George Dewey aboard , to proceed to the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. There he was to make preparations to move on the Spanish Fleet in the Philippines, believed to be anchored at Subic Bay. After war with Spain had broken out following the explosion of in Havana, Cuba, Dewey proceeded to the Philippines and arrived at Subic Bay just before sunset on 30 April 1898. However, Spanish naval authorities had determined that their position there was undefendable and had moved the fleet to Manila Bay. Under cover of darkness, Dewey proceeded to Manila Bay, arriving just off Corregidor after 11 . The ships stealthily moved past the south side of the island fortress, through Boca Grande, and into Manila Bay. Shortly after midnight they had nearly passed unnoticed when soot in 's smokestack caught fire, revealing the squadron's position. Spanish batteries on the south shore near Punta Restinga and on El Fraile Island opened fire on the shadowy ships. A few rounds were fired in response by . One shell scored a direct hit on El Fraile battery. The Spanish guns then fell silent after firing only three rounds. However, the big guns on Corregidor remained silent. Although concerned that his presence had been revealed, Dewey proceeded slowly eastward toward Manila. Dawn was beginning to break on the morning of 1 May as the squadron arrived at Manila. At first, however, lookouts posted high on the American ships could not locate the enemy fleet. Then, off to the right, they spotted a number of white buildings on the narrow strip of land known as Sangley Point, and beyond them a line of dark gray objects on the water. A hard turn to starboard brought the American squadron to bear on the Spanish fleet. The Spanish ships were anchored in an arch stretching eastward and southward from the mouth of Cañacao Bay near the tip of Sangley Point. As they approached, the column of American ships, with Olympia at the head of the line followed by , Raleigh, , , and , gradually turned to starboard, bringing their port guns to bear on the Spanish fleet. Dewey turned to Captain Charles V. Gridley, commanding officer of Olympia, and said, \\"You may fire when ready, Gridley.\\" At 5:41 , the squadron opened fire. The Battle of Manila Bay had begun. The firing became incessant, the white smoke of gunfire becoming so thick that it was difficult to gauge accuracy or effectiveness. Although trapped in the narrow confines of Cañacao Bay, the Spanish fleet managed to maintain a heavy barrage of return fire. However, most of the Spanish gunfire fell short of its mark. After making five passes in front of the enemy fleet, Dewey withdrew at 7:35 to investigate reports that he was low on ammunition. He passed the word that the men should take advantage of the break to eat breakfast. One gunner, eager to return to action, yelled out, \\"For God's sake, Captain. Don't let us stop now! To hell with breakfast!\\" Just after 11:00 , after determining that the report of low ammunition was in error and that his ships had suffered little or no battle damage, Dewey re-engaged the enemy. However, this time he met very little resistance. As the smoke cleared, the devastation inflicted by American guns became clearly evident. With the exception of a few gunboats, the Spanish fleet had been totally annihilated. More than 300 Spanish sailors had been killed or wounded. The lone American casualty was due to heatstroke. By 12:30 , the Spanish colors over the arsenal at Sangley Point were replaced by a white flag. The Battle of Manila Bay was over. O2U floatplane flies over the Cavite Navy Yard, circa 1930. The seaplane tender is docked at the yard, directly below the plane. Sangley Point is in the background. The following day, the naval facilities at Cavite and Sangley Point were officially taken over by U.S. Naval Expeditionary Forces under the command of Commodore George Dewey. Sangley continued to serve essentially the same function for the U.S. Navy as it had for the Spanish navy. The coaling facilities on the eastern end continued to supply the Navy with coal until ships converted to oil. At that time a tank farm was established as was an airfield and seaplane base. The Cañacao Naval Hospital Reservation was established on the western end. The US Navy continued to operate the hospital started by the Spanish. In the mid-1920s a modern new hospital was built as part of a major construction project to modernize the facility. The new hospital continued to serve the Navy and the local population until early 1942. It was destroyed during World War II. Three steel antenna towers were erected in 1915 for the operation of a powerful radio communications station, named Radio Sangley. Later on, a submarine support facility was established. The Cavite Navy Yard was made the headquarters for the U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet. Just across Cañacao Bay, became the major ship repair facility for the Asiatic fleet. However, World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines interrupted operations in 1942. = World War II = A Japanese air raid on 10 December 1941 leaves the Cavite Navy Yard in flames. The first bombing by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, heavily damaged the Cavite Navy Yard. Japanese forces occupied Cavite in January 1942. the Japanese continued to use Sangley and Cavite for basically the same purpose. They rehabilitated and expanded the facilities and used them for repair of their own craft and construction of small wooden vessels for coastal shipping of supplies. American carrier-based planes first bombed the repair facility in September 1944. The Cavite Navy Yard was again badly damaged, as were most of the hospital buildings at Cañacao. On 20 March 1945, units of the Seventh Fleet landed on Sangley Point, ridding the area of the remaining Japanese. Within a month, ACORN-45 arrived and set up an advance base maintenance organization under Commander Donald W. Darby. Seabees from the 12th Naval Construction Regiment immediately began construction and repair of the base and airfield. = Postwar years = The base maintenance organization was officially designated Naval Air Base, Sangley Point in 1945. Early in 1955, top echelon planners of the Navy recognized the importance of Sangley Point services and designated it a permanent facility. Later, after the establishment of Naval Air Station Cubi Point at Subic Bay, the designation was changed to Naval Station Sangley Point in accordance with the treaty with the Philippine government which allowed for only one official naval air station. The Naval Station Sangley Point was not large, encompassing an area of only . Half of which was occupied by its most valuable asset: the runway and its associated air-operations facilities and air-navigational aids. The primary mission of Sangley was to provide maintenance, support, and materials for the regional operations of U.S. Seventh Fleet. Sangley Point in the mid-1960s. The base was the headquarters of Commander U.S. Naval Forces Philippines/Commander-in-Chief Pacific Representative Philippines (COMNAVPHIL/CINCPACREPPHIL), which was considered to be the most important activity supported by Naval Station Sangley Point. It also supported two patrol squadrons of sea planes, deployed on Sangley on a rotational basis to help fulfill the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines. During the Korean War these were activated Naval Reserve Squadrons. The Coast Guard Air Station and the Coast Guard Ship Nettle played a vital role in search-and-rescue operations and in the maintenance of remote long-range aid-to navigation (LORAN) stations located throughout the Philippines. The Fleet Weather Facility was tasked with furnishing weather information to ships and aircraft operating in the Western Pacific and East China Sea areas. Naval Station Sangley Point also provided support for a Fleet Air Wing detachment, a Naval Communications Center, Marine Barracks, a Recruiting Detachment, and Navy Exchange and Commissary Stores. = John Paul Jones School = In 1945, upon the return of the Americans and in anticipation of the possible allied invasion of the Japanese mainland, an runway was constructed, along with the associated air operations and maintenance facilities. The invasion never took place, but Sangley's importance as a support facility for the Seventh Fleet continued to grow. So did its complement of Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and civilian personnel. As the number military personnel at Sangley grew, so did the need to provide accommodations and facilities for the dependents that would ultimately accompany them. Not the least of these facilities, of course, would be a school. With this in mind, a group of Quonset huts was designated, and in August 1948 the first dependent's school was opened at Sangley Point. The school comprised Grades 1–6 with only 65 students. As the number of dependents increased, the school began to grow, eventually adding a kindergarten and the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. Ultimately, in 1963, the Department of the Navy added 11th and 12th grades. The school comprised a series of quonset huts linked together with a central corridor. The original buildings were constructed on concrete piers with wooden floors, but the newer ones on the eastern end were built on concrete slabs. All the buildings, however, were metal Quonset huts. The entire school grounds was enclosed by a fence made primarily of chain link. There were numerous mango trees in the school yard. As the school grew, it remained nameless for more than ten years until 1958, when a contest was held among the students to name their own school. The prize of a U.S. Savings Bond went to Jackie Newell and Craig Wilcox ('56–'59) for choosing a name which commemorated the American naval hero of the Revolutionary War, John Paul Jones (JPJ). In 1967, JPJ came under the supervision of the United States Air Force and was incorporated into the District II, Pacific Area, Department of Defense Dependent Schools. In March 1968, it was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. By now, there were 650 students at JPJ from kindergarten to the 12th grade; ten times the number that was first enrolled in 1948. By 1970, that number would swell to 690. Plans were in the works for the construction of a new school when official word came on 10 December 1970, that Naval Station Sangley Point was to terminate operations as a U.S. facility. On 30 June 1971, after almost 23 years of service, John Paul Jones School was officially closed. The very next day, Naval Station Sangley Point changed status from active to inactive. This School was changed into Sangley Elementary School.  Closure  Overhead view of the Sangley Point facilities in the 1960s. Early in December 1970, it was officially announced that U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point would be closed. On 1 July 1971, Sangley Point changed status from active to inactive in preparation for the turnover of the facility to the government of the Philippines. The Sangley Point Closure Detail was activated under the command of an Officer-In-Charge, CAPT Waldo Atkins, with a 95-man, 7-officer contingent. In the extremely compressed 60-day period of deactivation, in excess of 350 items of automotive and construction equipment were transferred; more than 400 industrial buildings and government quarters were stripped of furnishings; installed equipment was disconnected and readied for shipment, and all buildings were secured. A total of 2,500 tons and of material assets were identified, packed and shipped by sea and land to various other U.S. military bases. Much of this transfer was accomplished at night and on weekends due to severely restricted barge and trucking schedules. Approximately 300,000 pounds of materials and supplies were prepared for turnover to the government of the Philippines, including 375 buildings, 77 structures and 60 utilities systems and improvements. In connection with the relocation of equipment and materials to other bases, 49 stilt housing units were relocated to Subic Bay by a detachment of Seabees. On-the-job-training sessions were conducted for Philippine naval personnel to ensure the safe and proper operation of all base industrial facilities. On 1 September 1971, the base was officially turned over to the government of the Philippines, ending 73 years as a U.S. Naval facility. It is currently used as a facility of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force. William J. Mitzel and his wife Barbara were the last US personnel to occupy quarters on the installation. Mr. Mitzel was responsible for the final turn over and lived on the installation with his wife, when the turn over was completed.Stiegelmar, Loren (2001), A Brief History of Sangley Point  Sangley Point in present day = Danilo Atienza Air Base, Philippine Air Force = The air base was renamed Major Danilo Atienza Air Base in honor for Major Atienza's actions during the 1989 coup attempt in which he destroyed several T-28 Trojan belonging to the rebels.

It would involve the reclamation of about 1,500 hectares of land, and would have its first runway opened by 2022 if construction started by 2019. This would support 25 million passengers per annum. A second runway would be finished by 2025 under its phase 2 to serve 75 million passengers a year. The second phase would cost $5.5 billion. In February 2020, the Sangley Point Airport opened for small commercial aircraft and started hosting regular domestic passenger and cargo flights.

Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process, and each subset of k individuals has the same probability of being chosen for the sample as any other subset of k individuals. This process and technique is known as simple random sampling, and should not be confused with systematic random sampling. A simple random sample is an unbiased surveying technique. Simple random sampling is a basic type of sampling, since it can be a component of other more complex sampling methods. The principle of simple random sampling is that every object has the same probability of being chosen. For example, suppose N college students want to get a ticket for a basketball game, but there are only X < N tickets for them, so they decide to have a fair way to see who gets to go. Then, everybody is given a number in the range from 0 to N-1, and random numbers are generated, either electronically or from a table of random numbers. Numbers outside the range from 0 to N-1 are ignored, as are any numbers previously selected. The first X numbers would identify the lucky ticket winners. In small populations and often in large ones, such sampling is typically done \\"without replacement\\", i.e., one deliberately avoids choosing any member of the population more than once. Although simple random sampling can be conducted with replacement instead, this is less common and would normally be described more fully as simple random sampling with replacement. Sampling done without replacement is no longer independent, but still satisfies exchangeability, hence many results still hold. Further, for a small sample from a large population, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement, since the probability of choosing the same individual twice is low. An unbiased random selection of individuals is important so that if many samples were drawn, the average sample would accurately represent the population. However, this does not guarantee that a particular sample is a perfect representation of the population. Simple random sampling merely allows one to draw externally valid conclusions about the entire population based on the sample. Conceptually, simple random sampling is the simplest of the probability sampling techniques. It requires a complete sampling frame, which may not be available or feasible to construct for large populations. Even if a complete frame is available, more efficient approaches may be possible if other useful information is available about the units in the population. Advantages are that it is free of classification error, and it requires minimum advance knowledge of the population other than the frame. Its simplicity also makes it relatively easy to interpret data collected in this manner. For these reasons, simple random sampling best suits situations where not much information is available about the population and data collection can be efficiently conducted on randomly distributed items, or where the cost of sampling is small enough to make efficiency less important than simplicity. If these conditions do not hold, stratified sampling or cluster sampling may be a better choice.  Algorithms  Several efficient algorithms for simple random sampling have been developed. A naive algorithm is the draw-by-draw algorithm where at each step we remove the item at that step from the set with equal probability and put the item in the sample. We continue until we have sample of desired size k. The drawback of this method is that it requires random access in the set. The selection-rejection algorithm developed by Fan et al. in 1962 requires single pass over data; however, it is a sequential algorithm and requires knowledge of total count of items n, which is not available in streaming scenarios. A very simple random sort algorithm was proved by Sunter in 1977 which simply assigns a random number drawn from uniform distribution (0, 1) as key to each item, sorts all items using the key and selects the smallest k items. J. Vitter in 1985 proposed reservoir sampling algorithm which is often widely used. This algorithm does not require advance knowledge of n and uses constant space. Random sampling can also be accelerated by sampling from the distribution of gaps between samples, and skipping over the gaps.  Distinction between a systematic random sample and a simple random sample  Consider a school with 1000 students, and suppose that a researcher wants to select 100 of them for further study. All their names might be put in a bucket and then 100 names might be pulled out. Not only does each person have an equal chance of being selected, we can also easily calculate the probability (P) of a given person being chosen, since we know the sample size (n) and the population (N): 1\\\\. In the case that any given person can only be selected once (i.e., after selection a person is removed from the selection pool): : \\\\begin{align} P &= 1 - \\\\frac{N-1}{N} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{N-2}{N - 1} \\\\cdot \\\\cdots \\\\cdot \\\\frac{N-n}{N - (n - 1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &\\\\stackrel{\\\\text{Canceling:}}{=} 1 - \\\\frac{N - n}N \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac nN \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\frac{100}{1000} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= 10\\\\% \\\\end{align} 2\\\\. In the case that any selected person is returned to the selection pool (i.e., can be picked more than once): : P = 1-\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\right)^n = 1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{999}{1000}\\\\right)^{100} = 0.0952\\\\dots \\\\approx 9.5\\\\% This means that every student in the school has in any case approximately a 1 in 10 chance of being selected using this method. Further, all combinations of 100 students have the same probability of selection. If a systematic pattern is introduced into random sampling, it is referred to as \\"systematic (random) sampling\\". An example would be if the students in the school had numbers attached to their names ranging from 0001 to 1000, and we chose a random starting point, e.g. 0533, and then picked every 10th name thereafter to give us our sample of 100 (starting over with 0003 after reaching 0993). In this sense, this technique is similar to cluster sampling, since the choice of the first unit will determine the remainder. This is no longer simple random sampling, because some combinations of 100 students have a larger selection probability than others – for instance, {3, 13, 23, ..., 993} has a 1/10 chance of selection, while {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} cannot be selected under this method.  Sampling a dichotomous population  If the members of the population come in three kinds, say \\"blue\\" \\"red\\" and \\"black\\", the number of red elements in a sample of given size will vary by sample and hence is a random variable whose distribution can be studied. That distribution depends on the numbers of red and black elements in the full population. For a simple random sample with replacement, the distribution is a binomial distribution. For a simple random sample without replacement, one obtains a hypergeometric distribution.

Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States between the World Wars. The global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the Vespa and Lambretta models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation (engines from ). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from have been developed for Western markets. Scooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with kick scooter, but can then be confused with motorized scooters, another distinct kind of scooter.  Description  The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter as a motorcycle similar to a kick scooter with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels. The US Department of Transportation defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step- through architecture. The classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet. This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer retro models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar. Scooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50 cc single- cylinder to 850 cc twin-cylinder models. Traditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a spare wheel. Many recent scooters use conventional front forks with the front axle fastened at both ends.  Regulatory classification  Some jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. Though some jurisdictions classify smaller engine scooters (typically 50cc maximum) as moped class vehicles rather than motorcycles, meaning these scooters often have less stringent regulations (for example, 50cc scooters can be driven with a normal car drivers license in many jurisdictions, and might pay less road-tax and be subject to less stringent roadworthiness testing). For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term motor scooter from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter. =California= the US state of California has a regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles. It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories: * Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs. Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate. Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver. Helmets are mandatory. * Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30 mph. It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways. Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \\"scooters\\". * Moped: a moped (or \\"motorized bicycle\\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30 mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) with built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross brake horsepower (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds). There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same. *Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30 mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less. * Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15 mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating. They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25 mph. A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet. Passengers are prohibited. They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk. If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian. * Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle. A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20 mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20 mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28 mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer. No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \\"motor vehicle\\" by the state.  Emissions  The emissions of mopeds and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that two-stroke 50 cc mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated Euro 3 automobile standards. In the same study, four-stroke mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emitted three to eight times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the Euro 3 automobile standards. Approximate parity with automobiles was achieved with NOx emissions in these studies. Emissions performance was tested on a g/km basis and was unaffected by fuel economy. the United States Environmental Protection Agency allowed motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine displacements less than 280 cc to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO than the median Tier II bin 5 automobile regulations. An additional air quality challenge can also arise from the use of moped and scooter transportation over automobiles, as a higher density of two-wheeled vehicles can be supported by existing transportation infrastructure. In Genoa, the home of the Vespa scooter, 2-stroke engine scooters made before 1999 are banned since 2019. 'Anti-Vespa' law announced in Italian birthplace of the iconic scooter In some cities, such as Shanghai, petrol scooters/mopeds are banned and only LPG or electric scooters are allowed to be used in the city due to air pollution.  History =Predecessors= Scooter-like traits began to develop in motorcycle designs around the 1900s. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller in Munich, Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase. Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It was water-cooled and had a radiator built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was . The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of steam locomotives. Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the venture a financial failure for both Wolfmüller and his financial backer, Hildebrand. In France, the Auto-Fauteuil was introduced in 1902. This was basically a step- through motorcycle with an armchair instead of a traditional saddle. Production continued until 1922.

They were followed that year by the Autoped, whose engine was engaged by pushing the handlebar column forward and whose brake was engaged by pulling the column back. Autopeds were made in Long Island, New York from 1915 to 1921, and were also made under license by Krupp in Germany from 1919 to 1922, following World War I. The number of scooter manufacturers and designs increased after World War I. The British - ABC Motors Skootamota, the Kenilworth, and the Reynolds Runabout debuted in 1919, with Gloucestershire Aircraft Company following with its Unibus in 1920. The Skootamota was noted for being practical, popular, and economical, the Kenilworth for its electric lights, and the Reynolds Runabout for its advanced specifications, including front suspension, a two-speed gearbox, leg shields, and a seat sprung with leaf springs and coil springs. The Unibus also had a two-speed gearbox, but it is more notable for its full bodywork, similar to that which would appear of second- and third-generation scooters. The reputation of first-generation scooters was damaged by a glut of unstable machines with flexible frames, and more substantial examples like the Reynolds Runabout and the Unibus were too expensive to be competitive. The first generation had ended by the mid-1920s.

Foster Salsbury and Austin Elmore developed the Salsbury Motor Glide, which was a division of Northrop Aircraft, a scooter with a seat above an enclosed drivetrain, and began production in 1936 in California. In 1938, Salsbury introduced a more powerful scooter with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). This was the first use of a CVT on a scooter. It was such a success that Salsbury attempted to license the design to several European manufacturers including Piaggio. The Motor Glide set the standards for all later models. It inspired production of motor scooters by Powell, Moto-scoot, Cushman, Rock-Ola, and others. The Cushman Company produced motor scooters from 1936 to 1965. Cushman was an engine manufacturer that started making scooters after Salsbury found their offer to supply engines to be unacceptable. Cushman and Salsbury competed against each other, with both companies advertising the economy of their scooters. Cushman claimed an efficiency of at . Cushman introduced a centrifugal clutch to their scooters in 1940. The Cushman Auto Glide Model 53 was designed to be dropped by parachute with Army Airborne troops, and was eventually called the \\"Cushman Airborne\\". Cushman scooters were also used around military bases for messenger service. Salsbury continued manufacturing scooters until 1948, while Cushman continued until 1965. Small numbers of the Harley-Davidson Topper scooter were produced from 1960 to 1965 using the engine from their line of light motorcycles based on the DKW RT 125. It had a fiberglass body, a continuously variable transmission, and a pull-cord starting mechanism. 1956 Allstate Scooter 2.jpgalt=Sears Allstate scooter, made by CushmanTypical Cushman scooter, this one sold by Sears under the Allstate brand Scooters.Assisi002.jpgalt=The Model 85 was much bigger and sleeker than the early Motor Glides1948 Salsbury Model 85 scooter (middle) 1948_Moto- Scoot_145.jpg1948 Moto-Scoot 145 manufactured in Chicagohttp://nzclassicmotorcycles.webdog.me/collection/1948-motoscoot-145/ Early postwar Japan After World War II, wartime aircraft manufacturers were forbidden from making aircraft, and had to find other products to make in order to stay in business. Fuji Sangyo, a part of the former Nakajima Aircraft Company, began production of the Fuji Rabbit S-1 scooter in June 1946. Inspired by Powell scooters used by American servicemen, the S1 was designed to use surplus military parts, including the tailwheel of a Nakajima bomber, re-purposed as the front wheel of the S1. Later that year, Mitsubishi introduced the C10, the first of its line of Silver Pigeon scooters. This was inspired by a Salsbury Motor Glide that had been brought to Japan by a Japanese man who had lived in the United States. Production of the Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon and the Fuji Rabbit continued through several series until the 1960s. Some series of the Fuji Rabbit were developed to a high level of technological content; the S-601 Rabbit Superflow had an automatic transmission with a torque converter, an electric starter, and pneumatic suspension. Mitsubishi ended scooter production with the C140 Silver Pigeon, while Fuji continued production of the Rabbit until the last of the S-211 series was built in June 1968. Fuji Touring 150 - Side View.jpgalt=S-402: Fuji Rabbit Touring 150Fuji Rabbit Touring 150 (S-402) Mitsubishi_Silver_Pigeon.jpgMitsubishi Silver Pigeon =Third generation (1946–1964) and beyond=Italy - Vespa and Lambretta 1952 Lambretta 125 D In post-World War II Italy the Piaggio Vespa became the standard for scooters, and has remained so for over 60 years. Patented in April 1946, it used aircraft design and materials. D'Ascanio's scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The gear shift lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the belt drive. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic. The name originated when Piaggio's president, upon seeing the prototype, remarked \\"Sembra una vespa\\", \\"It looks like a wasp\\". Months after the Vespa, in 1947, Innocenti introduced the Lambretta, beginning a rivalry with Vespa. The scooter was designed by Innocenti, his General Director Giuseppe Lauro and engineer Pierluigi Torre. The Lambretta was named after Lambrate, the Milanese neighborhood where the factory stood. It debuted in 1947 at the Paris Motor Show. The Lambretta 'A' went on sale on December 23, 1947, and sold 9,000 units in one year. It was efficient, at a time when fuel was severely rationed. It had a top speed of from a fan-cooled engine of . The first Lambretta designs had shaft drive and no rear suspension, later designs used various drive and suspension systems until Lambretta settled on a swingarm-mounted engine with chain drive. Also other Italian firms manufactured scooters in 1950s and 1960s, like Italjet and Iso. Germany Germany's aviation industry was also dismantled after World War II. Heinkel stayed in business by making bicycles and mopeds, while Messerschmitt made sewing machines and automobile parts. Messerschmitt took over the German license to manufacture Vespa scooters from Hoffman in 1954 and built Vespas under from 1954 to 1964. Heinkel designed and built its own scooters. The Heinkel Tourist was a large and relatively heavy touring scooter produced in the 1960s. It provided good weather protection with a full fairing, and the front wheel turned under a fixed nose extension. It had effective streamlining, perhaps thanks to its aircraft ancestry. Although it had only a four stroke motor, it could sustain speeds of . Heinkel scooters were known for their reliability. Glas, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, made the Goggo scooter from 1951 to 1955. Glas discontinued scooter production to concentrate on its Goggomobil microcar. Several manufacturers in the German motorcycle industry made scooters. NSU made Lambrettas under license from 1950 to 1955, during which they developed their Prima scooter. Production of the Prima began when NSU's license to build Lambrettas ran out. Zündapp made the popular Bella scooter in the 1950s and 1960s. It was in production for about ten years, in three engine sizes, , and . They could perform all day at a steady speed of . Extremely reliable and very well made, many of these scooters still exist today. Maico built the large Maicoletta scooter in the 1950s. It had a single cylinder piston-port two-stroke engine, with four foot-operated gears and centrifugal fan cooling. The Maicoletta had a choice of engine sizes, approximately , , or , The tubular frame was built on motorcycle principles, with long-travel telescopic forks and wheels. The Maicoletta had a top speed of which was comparable with most motorcycles of the time. Other German scooters made by motorcycle manufacturers included the DKW Hobby, the Dürkopp Diana, and the TWN Contessa. 20061018 Fertig montiert 04.JPGalt=Goggo scooter, the first road vehicle made by GlasGoggo scooter, made by Glas Heinkel IMG 1249.jpgalt=The Heinkel Tourist was noted for its touring abilityHeinkel Tourist ZweiRadMuseumNSU NSU Prima.JPGalt=NSU developed the Prima from the Lambretta it had previously built under license1957 NSU Prima Zündapp Bella R 154 (2008-05-21) Seitenansicht ret.jpgalt=The Zündapp Bella was the most popular German scooter in the 1960s1958 Zündapp Bella R 154 Maicoletta (33).JPGalt=One of the largest scooters of the classic ageMaicoletta scooter ZweiRadMuseumNSU DKW Hobby.JPGalt=DKW Hobby1954 DKW Hobby Dürkopp Diana 1955.jpgalt=Dürkopp Diana1955 Dürkopp Diana United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, Douglas manufactured the Vespa under license from 1951 to 1961 and assembled them from 1961 to 1965. BSA and Triumph made several models of scooter including the BSA Dandy 70, the Triumph Tina, and the Triumph Tigress. The Tigress was made from 1959 to 1964 and was sold with a 175 cc 2-stroke single engine or a 250 cc 4-stroke twin; both versions used a foot-operated four- speed gearbox. The 250 twin had a top speed of . The BSA Sunbeam was a badge engineered version of the Tigress. Eastern Bloc In Eastern Bloc countries scooters also became popular in the second half of 1950s, but their production was a result of planned economy rather than market competition. The Soviet Union started in 1957 with producing reverse engineered copies of 150 cc Vespa and 200 cc Glas Goggo as Vyatka and Tula T-200 respectively.Vorontsov, A., Pevzner, Ye., Dolnikov, D., Popov, A., Sazonov, R. (2003) Entscyklopediya mototsyklov. Moscow: Za rulom. . p. 130, 499 They and their developments were manufactured in big numbers into the 1980s. In East Germany, IWL manufactured several own design 125 cc and 150 cc scooters (most notably SR 59 Berlin) from 1955 to 1964, when the authorities decided to switch the production to trucks.Vorontsov, A., Pevzner, Ye., Dolnikov, D., Popov, A., Sazonov, R.

The Chetak and Legend were based on the Italian Vespa Sprint. It was discontinued in 2009. Another Vespa partner in India was LML Motors. Beginning as a joint-venture with Piaggio in 1983, LML, in addition to being a large parts supplier for Piaggio, produced the P-Series scooters for the Indian market. In 1999, after protracted dispute with Piaggio, LML bought back Piaggio's stake in the company and the partnership ceased. LML continues to produce (and also exports) the P-Series variant known as the Stella in the U.S. market and by other names in different markets.

Advertising campaigns in the USA featured popular stars like Michael Jackson (Suzuki), and Grace Jones and Lou Reed (Honda),http://www.openculture.com/2014/09/iles-davis-grace-jones-adam-ant- devo-in-honda-ads.html and sales of Japanese scooters peaked there in the 1980s.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-30/-monkey-bike-nears- extinction-as-japan-cuts-tailpipe-emissions Both 2-stroke and 4-stroke plastic bodied scooters have been mass-produced in East Asia, with engine and transmission designs being either local designs or license built versions of European engines (eg Minarelli or Morini). A popular 4-stroke engine in Chinese production is the GY6 engine, but electric motor-scooters are constantly increasing in the Chinese home market share.

High-end scooter models now include comprehensive technological features, including cast aluminium frames, engines with integral counterbalancing, and cross-linked brake systems. Some of these scooters have comfort features such as an alarm, start button, radio, windshield, heated hand grips and full instrumentation (including clock or outside temperature gauge). =Three-wheeled scooter= Piaggio MP3 During World War II, Cushman made the Model 39, a three-wheeled utility scooter with a large storage bin between the front wheels. They sold 606 to the US military during the war. The Piaggio MP3 is a modern tilting three-wheeled scooter. Unlike most motorcycle trikes, it is a reverse trike, with two front wheels which steer, and a single driven rear wheel. The front suspension allows both front wheels to tilt independently, so that all three wheels remain in contact with the ground as it leans when cornering. =Maxi-scooter= Honda CN250 Helix A maxi-scooter or touring scooter is a large scooter, with engines ranging in size from , and using larger frames than normal scooters with longer wheelbases. Typically, the dash is fixed & is not mounted on the handlebars The trend toward maxi- scooters began in 1986 when Honda introduced the CN250 Helix / Fusion / Spazio. Many years later, Suzuki launched the Burgman 400 and 650 models. Honda (), Aprilia/Gilera (), Yamaha (), Kymco () and others have also introduced scooters with engine displacements ranging from . Honda's PS250 (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork. A new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage. Examples include the Aprilia Mana 850 automatic-transmission motorcycle and the Honda NC700D Integra, which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform. =Enclosed scooter= Some scooters, including the BMW C1 and the Honda Gyro Canopy, have a windscreen and a roof. The Piaggio MP3 offered a tall windscreen with roof as an option.Enclosed scooters =Four-stroke engines and fuel-injection= Piaggio XEvo 250ie, four-stroke Maxi-scooter With increasingly strict environmental laws, including United States emission standards and European emission standards, more scooters are using four-stroke engines again. Aprilia SR50 In 2001, Aprilia released the SR50 Ditech with direct injection. The SR50 has a listed fuel consumption of and meets the Euro 3 standard with a two-stroke engine. Later on, more brands, including Derbi and Peugeot, started using direct injection systems for their scooters. Catalytic converters are now common in two-stroke and four-stroke engines sold in the E.U. and the U.S. =Electric scooter= Generally, the source of power for the electric motor has been batteries, but development in fuel cell technology has created several prototypes. Some examples are: the ENV from Intelligent Energy, Honda's scooter using the Honda FC Stack, and the Yamaha FC-AQEL. Also, petroleum hybrid-electric motorcycles are available. Some examples are the Ecycle, and Yamaha's Gen-RYU. Electric motorcycles and scooters are rising in popularity because of higher gasoline prices. Battery technology is gradually improving making this form of transportation more practical.Technology Review: Making Electric Vehicles Practical Underbone Kymco Activ underbone. This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter. An underbone is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the head stock to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \\"step- throughs\\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters. Underbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter. The engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its swingarm. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central centre of gravity than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more unsprung mass than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter. The engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter. An underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter. While the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the Suzuki Choinori, which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame. File:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg1956 Heinkel Tourist. This scooter had a frame-mounted engine and a swingarm with an integral chain enclosure. File:Honda NC50 1980 rear.jpg1980 Honda NC50. This underbone had its engine mounted on its swingarm. File:Choinori.jpgSuzuki Choinori. Introduced in 2003, this scooter has no rear suspension. Both its engine and its rear axle are bolted to its frame.  Popularity  Bangalore couple on LML Vespa Rider looking for a place at parking lot in Trieste, where use of a scooter in city transport is among highest in Italy. Motor scooters are popular in most parts of the first world, Europe (particularly Italy and the Mediterranean), Japan and Taiwan, but not the US. They are even more popular in most parts of the developing world, particularly in countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and China where there is local manufacturing. Parking, storage, and traffic issues in crowded cities, along with the easy driving position make them a popular form of urban transportation. In many nations, scooter (and other small motorcycle) sales exceed those of automobiles, and a motor scooter is often the family transport. Motor scooter parking lot In Taiwan, road infrastructure has been built specifically with two wheelers in mind, with separate lanes and intersection turn boxes. In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, fuel-efficiency, weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle. In many localities, certain road motor scooters are considered by law to be in the same class as mopeds or small motorcycles and therefore they have fewer restrictions than do larger motorcycles. According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, sales of motor scooters in the United States have more than doubled since 2000. The motorcycle industry as a whole has seen 13 years of consecutive growth. According to council figures, 42,000 scooters were sold in 2000. By 2004, that number increased to 97,000. Scooter sales in 2008 in the United States were up 41% on 2007, and represented 9% of all powered two-wheeler sales. However, there was a decrease in US scooter sales in 2009 of 59% against 2008, compared with a 41% fall for all powered two-wheelers, while the scooter's contribution to total US powered two-wheeler sales in 2009 fell to 6%. After a two-year slump, scooter sales in the US rebounded in the first quarter of 2011. =In popular culture= A common reference for the glamorous image of scooters is Roman Holiday, a 1953 romantic comedy in which Gregory Peck carries Audrey Hepburn around Rome on a Vespa. Mods on a scooter Scooter rally at Smallbrook Stadium, Isle of Wight In the 1960s mod subculture, some members of this British youth cult used motorscooters for transportation, usually Vespas or Lambrettas. Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the Ace of Herts. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming chrome. For young mods, Italian scooters were the \\"embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing\\". They customized their scooters by painting them in \\"two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights\\", and they often put their names on the small windscreen. Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome. Scooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, public transport stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available hire purchase plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. The cover of The Who's album Quadrophenia, which includes themes related to mods and rockers, depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached. The album spawned a 1979 motion picture of the same name. Scooterboy magazines include the British monthly magazine Scootering and the American quarterly magazine Scoot!.

Garfield Case, (September 23, 1898 – September 22, 1959), was a Canadian politician who served as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament and Mayor of Owen Sound, Ontario. He is best known for his upset victory over Defence Minister General Andrew McNaughton in the Grey North federal by-election held on February 5, 1945.  Early years  Case was raised on a farm in York County and schooled in Aurora, Ontario before attending the Ontario Agricultural College. He enlisted in the Army during World War I but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. He was discharged after being seriously injured. Before becoming a politician, he worked as a farmer and insurance broker.  Political career  Case was first elected mayor of Owen Sound in 1942 and was re-elected in 1943 and 1944.Canada at War: THE DOMINION: Vital By-Election, Time, January 15, 1945 He also served as president of the Ontario Mayor's Association. He unsuccessfully ran in Grey North in the 1940 federal election as a \\"National Liberal Progressive\\" against both the Liberal and Conservative candidates, placing third. He had earlier, in 1930 federal election, been an unsuccessful Liberal candidate in Dufferin—Simcoe and was a former president of the Owen Sound Liberal Association.  Grey North by-election  During World War II the Liberals and Conservative parties agreed not to run candidates against each other in by- elections and to allow whichever party had held the riding before the by- election to run without opposition. This pact was strained in 1942 when William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals allegedly backed Joseph Noseworthy of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (which had refused to agree to the \\"truce\\") in his candidacy against new Conservative leader Arthur Meighen who was attempting to enter the House of Commons via a by-election in York South. Noseworthy upset Meighen in the vote leaving the Tories leaderless. On November 1, 1944, General McNaughton was appointed to Mackenzie King's cabinet as Minister of Defence replacing James Ralston who had resigned as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1944. Ralston, who was pro-conscription, had quit because the King government refused to go as far as he wanted in sending conscripts overseas and was also encouraged to quit as he was distrusted in Quebec where conscription was unpopular. McNaughton had been a believer in an all volunteer military and was appointed to replace Ralston but soon found himself under pressure from the government to enact a limited conscription policy. By constitutional convention, McNaughton, as a minister of the crown, needed to seek a seat in parliament as soon as possible. The sitting Liberal MP, William P. Telford, had been unable to attend sittings of the House of Commons for a year due to illness and was persuaded to resign in order to enable McNaugton to contest a seat in a by-election. The Tories, who had renamed themselves the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada decided to stand Wilfrid Case against McNaughton in the by-election. In June 1944, Case was nominated as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the projected 1945 federal election and when the incumbent Liberal MP resigned his seat in favour of General McNaughton, the Tories decided to run Case in the by-election after party leader John Bracken decided to not run as a candidate himself. During the campaign, Case charged that the former Liberal MP had been forced to resign to make way for McNaughton despite the fact that there were several other vacancies in the House of Commons that needed to be filled. He also accused all of his opponents of being outsiders and parachute candidates and used the slogan \\"Send a Grey North man to Ottawa, not an Ottawa man to Grey North\\" in order to press the point. However, the principal issue of the campaign was conscription.\\"W. Garfield Case – Upset McNaughton in Conscription Row\\", The Globe and Mail, September 24, 1959 The rationale the Conservatives used when deciding to run a candidate against McNaughton was that it had opposed, in the House of Commons, McNaughton's policy of \\"limited conscription\\" calling instead for a \\"full conscription\\" policy in order to address the shortage of Canadian troops fighting in the war. Thus, the February 5, 1945, by-election became a test of the government's military policy.\\"The Issue in Grey North\\" (editorial), The Globe and Mail, December 14, 1944\\"'Is Not For Sale'\\" (editorial), The Globe and Mail, January 10, 1945 Case, however, was viewed as a weak candidate and it was thought that McNaughton would easily carry the riding, not having to face the Leader of the Opposition.\\"I don't choose to run, Bracken says it too\\", Toronto Daily Star, December 15, 1944 Despite calls from some quarters of labour that they should not contest the by-election, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation also stood a candidate, retired Air Vice-Marshal Albert Earl Godfrey, a World War I flying ace. The CCF shared McNaughton's policy of \\"limited conscription\\" thus, arguably, Godfrey acted as a spoiler in the vote. Case defeated McNaughton in an upset victory, the margin of which was smaller than the number of votes received by the third place CCF candidate. After his defeat in Grey North, McNaughton attempted to enter the House of Commons from a Saskatchewan riding in the June federal election but was again defeated. He resigned as Minister of Defence in August 1945.  Later political career  Case was re-elected in the 1945 federal election held in June 1945, three months after his by- election victory. While in Parliament, Case advocated that the position of Governor General of Canada should be filled by individuals from various countries in the British Commonwealth in order to strengthen ties and also advocated improving the status of aboriginal peoples in Canada. After Progressive Conservative leader John Bracken resigned, Case announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party and ran on a policy of abolishing income tax. He withdrew from the race before the convention to support George Drew, who succeeded in winning the party's leadership. Case remained in the Canadian House of Commons until his defeat in the subsequent 1949 federal election by Liberal Colin Emerson Bennett. He attempted to return in the 1953 federal election but was again defeated in Grey North.  Death  Case was admitted to Toronto's Sunnybrook Military Hospital on July 29, 1959, for psychiatric treatment. He remained a patient until his death on September 22, 1959.

Her history is probably commingled with another Cera (alternately Ciar, Ciara) who lived in the 6th century. However, some authors maintain that monastic mistakes account for references to Cera in the 6th century or that a single Cera had an exceptionally long life span.Dunbar, Agnes Baillie Cunninghame: A Dictionary of Saintly Women, Volume 1, page 171. George Bell & Sons, 1904.Lanigan, John: An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, from the First Introduction of Christianity Among the Irish, to the Beginning of the Thirteenth Century, Vol. III., 2nd Edition, pages 129-131. Simpkin and Marshall, London, 1829.  Life  There are two stories connected with the saint(s). In the first story, Cera's prayers saved an Irish town from a foul smelling fire. When a noxious blaze broke out in \\"Muscraig, in Momonia,\\" St. Brendan instructed the inhabitants to seek Cera's prayers. They followed his instructions, Cera prayed in response to their supplications, and the fire disappeared.Smith, William Anasi and Harry Wace: A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Lynne Cherry, page 543. Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1877. Since St. Brendan died in 577, this story likely refers to an earlier Cera. \\"Muscraig, in Momonia\\" may refer to Muskerry, an area outside of Cork. \\"Momonia\\" refers to southern Ireland in at least one ancient map. The other story relates how St. Cera established a nunnery called Teych-Telle around the year 625. Cera was the daughter of Duibhre (or Dubreus) reportedly in the blood line of the kings of Connor (or Conaire). She, along with 5 other virgins asked Saint Fintan Munnu for a place to serve God. He and his monks gave the women their abbey in Heli (or Hele). Heli may have been in County Westmeath. He blessed Cera, and instructed her to name the place after St. Telle who had given birth to four children, matthew mark luke and john in the plain of Miodhluachra that day.O'Hanlon, John: Lives of the Irish Saints, Volume VI, page 801. James Duffy and Sons, Dublin, 1873.Baring-Gould, Sabine: The lives of the saints, Vol. 12 page 558. John Hodges, London, 1877. St. Cera eventually returned to her own province and founded another monastery, Killchree, which she governed until her death in 679. The later Franciscan Kilcrea Friary stands about a mile west of where her monastery stood, and claims to have taken its name, Kilcrea, in her honor: \\"Kilcrea (Cill Chre) means the Cell of Cere, Ciara, Cera or Cyra.\\"  Remembrance  St. Cera's feast day is March 15, and a festival on July 2 also commemorated her. Both dates are reported to have been the day of her death. Statements also show December 15.

(1998) Dixonia: a bio-discography of Bill Dixon, Greenwood Publishing Group, pg. 66 Reception Leroi Jones wrote that the B side of the album \\"really contains some serious business... Archie [Shepp] sounds lovely throughout the entire date... He combines a big wide elegant bluesiness with a rhythmic force that often has people trying to connect him with Ben Webster... which is no bad connection... But Archie has something to say which is new and powerfully moving. John Tchicai makes music of a very different nature than Shepp's, but it is also a very moving music. Tchicai's playing, his approach to the horn, really fascinates me. His tone is dry, acrid, incisive; his line spare and lean, like himself; and his phrasing at times reminds one of Mondrian's geometrical decisions, or lyrical syllogisms. Where Shepp's intentions are usually immediately apparent, sweety or nasty blues, though of a very wild contemporary persuasion, Tchicai's ear leads him into subtleties of expression where the 'pure' blues feeling is replaced by a constantly complicating musical/emotional tension which is 'soulful' because the player has a great deal of soul.\\" Ekkehard Jost wrote that the two Shepp compositions performed by the NYCF on the B side (\\"Where Poppies Bloom (Where Poppies Blow)\\" and \\"Like a Blessed Baby Lamb\\") \\"show that [Shepp's] compositional conception is by no means static... [the pieces] are marked by polyphonic voicings in the ensemble passages, by changes of tempo and rhythm, and by dynamic differentiation. Without being in any way imitative, they contain echoes of Ellington and Mingus, overlaid on one side by the tonally disoriented sound of the Cecil Taylor groups... and on the other, by a coarse folksiness, a quality also occasionally present in later Shepp compositions.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section I, Letters A, B, C, D\\" (Bill Dixon) - 1:30 # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section II, Letter E\\" (Dixon) - 0:47 # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section III, Letter F\\" (Dixon) - 9:17 # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section IV, Letter G\\" (Dixon) - 0:46 # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section V, Letter H Played Three Times\\" (Dixon) - 1:49 # \\"Coda\\" (Dixon) - 0:31 # \\"The 12th December\\" (Dixon) - 3:20 # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section III, Letter F\\" [alternate take] (Dixon) - 7:25 Bonus track on CD reissue # \\"Winter Song 1964: Section III, Letter F\\" [alternate study] (Dixon) - 9:46 Bonus track on CD reissue # \\"Where Poppies Bloom (Where Poppies Blow)\\" (Archie Shepp) - 7:47 # \\"Like a Blessed Baby Lamb\\" (Shepp) - 9:27 # \\"Consequences\\" (Don Cherry) - 4:55 :Recorded at Savoy Studios, Newark on March 4, 1964 (tracks 1-9) and New York City on February 5, 1964 (tracks 10-12).

Other major cast members are Claude Rains, Carla Balenda and Philip Dorn. Andrews' brother Steve Forrest has a small, uncredited part, one of his earliest screen roles. The movie was based on the novel The Gaunt Woman by Edmund Gilligan. Plot In 1943, at the height of the World War II Battle of the Atlantic, Captain Pat Bannon, skipper of the fishing trawler Daniel Webster, unloads his catch in his home port of Gloucester, Massachusetts. He reluctantly agrees to transport Margaret McLean to Trabo, a small community in Newfoundland. Shorthanded, he hires Danish sailor Konrad, and the Daniel Webster sails for the Grand Banks fishing grounds. Once at sea, another Dane, Holger, reports that the radio has been sabotaged. As Bannon knows all of the crew well except for Konrad and fellow Dane Holger, he suspects one of them or even Margaret of being a German agent. Sailing at night in heavy fog, they hear gunfire. They search for survivors and come upon the damaged Den Magre Kvinde (Danish for The Gaunt Woman), a Danish square-rigged sailing ship. She appears to have been damaged in a storm and then shelled. Aboard, they discover only the dazed Captain Skalder and a dead body. He claims that his crew abandoned ship in a storm, and that he was subsequently attacked by a U-boat. The Daniel Webster tows the stricken Kvinde to Trabo. Konrad is suspicious: he notes that the German gunfire hit above the waterline (rather than below it, where a gunner intending to sink a ship would aim), and that while the tarpaulin covering the ship's boat is riddled with bullet holes, the boat itself is undamaged. Bannon and Konrad separately sneak below decks to search the hold. When they meet, Konrad has a pistol, but he gives it to Bannon to prove where his loyalties lie. They accidentally discover a second, hidden hold containing rack upon rack of torpedoes — the ship is a tender, covertly resupplying the U-boat \\"wolfpacks\\". They watch undetected as Holger enters the hold and uses a radio to signal the Germans. However, before the pair can alert the military, Skalder's crew arrives in boats, so they pretend they know nothing. Skalder plans to resupply the U-boats at Trabo. A Canadian flying boat lands in the harbor, and an officer inspects Skalder's papers. Finding nothing wrong, he informs Skalder that a corvette will arrive the next day to inspect his cargo. Bannon offers to leave one of his two Danish crewmen as a witness, allowing him to rid himself of the spy Holger without arousing suspicion. Bannon leaves port, but once out of sight, one man remains aboard to sail to the nearest radio station, while Bannon and the rest take to the dories and return. Bannon sets up a night ambush; when the Germans come to take the villagers prisoner, the invaders are wiped out. Bannon and his men then set fire to the Kvinde under cover of darkness. In the resulting confusion, they board, overpower or kill the remainder of the crew, and free Margaret, who had been taken as a hostage. Skalder claims to have set the ship to blow up in twenty minutes. Bannon does not believe him, but takes the ship out to sea, intending to destroy her safely away from the village. He and his men rig some of the torpedoes to explode. The Kvinde is approached by two U-boats seeking supplies. Skalder manages to get a gun and wounds his guard, Konrad, before he is killed. As a third U-boat surfaces, Bannon and another man help Konrad into a boat and row away under German gunfire. When the ship explodes, the resulting wave swamps the submarines, sinking them.

The structure was built by the architect's brother, Theodore Linfield Wolfe, in 1916 for $13,212, and had offices, at least four classrooms, and an auditorium. During the three years of construction, school was held in a building on a nearby ranch. The building was used as a school until 1956, a few years after the city was incorporated in 1954. The current Milpitas High School traces its roots to the school. Afterward the building served various roles including as Milpitas City Hall, Police Department, library and the Milpitas Senior Center. The city conducted a restoration in 1990.

Geography The county was located in the northeastern part of the Greater Romania, in the eastern part of the historical region of Bessarabia, at the border with the Soviet Union. At present, its territory is part of the Republic of Moldova. It is bordered to the northwest by the counties of Soroca and Bălți, to the northeast and the east by the Soviet Union and to the south by Lăpușna County. Orhei County was the successor of the Orhei District of the Principality of Moldavia or the Russian Empire in the central part, bordering on the north with the Soroca District, in the east by the river Dniester, in the west by the Bălţi District, and in the south by Lăpuşna District. The northernmost of the settlements was Poiana, in Plasa Rezina, and the southernmost was Criuleni. The capital of the county was the Orhei, and the total area of Orhei county was . The county had four cities: Orhei, Rezina, Telenești, and Șoldănești, and 235 villages. Administrative organization Map of Orhei County as constituted in 1938. Originally, the county was administratively divided into four districts (plăși):Portretul României Interbelice - Județul Orhei #Plasa Bravicea, headquartered at Bravicea #Plasa Ciocâlteni, headquartered at Ciocâlteni #Plasa Măscăuți, headquartered at Măscăuți #Plasa Rezina, headquartered at Rezina Subsequently, two more were established: #Plasa Criuleni, headquartered at Criuleni #Plasa Orhei, headquartered at Orhei As of 1938, the county was administratively divided into six districts: #Plasa Bravicea, headquartered at Bravicea #Plasa Chiperceni, headquartered at Chiperceni #Plasa Criuleni, headquartered at Criuleni #Plasa Orhei, headquartered at Orhei #Plasa Telenești, headquartered at Telenești #Plasa Rezina, headquartered at Rezina History After the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, the county belonged to Romania, which set up the county formally in 1925. After the 1938 Administrative and Constitutional Reform, this county merged with the counties of Lăpușna, Cetatea Albă and Tighina to form Ținutul Nistru. The area of the county was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became part of the Moldavian SSR. The area returned to Romanian administration following the Axis Powers' invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. A military administration was established and the region's Jewish population was either executed on the spot or deported to Transnistria, where further numbers were killed. As the Soviet Union's offensive pushed the Axis powers back, the area again was under Soviet control. On September 12, 1944, Romania signed the Moscow Armistice with the Allies. The Armistice, as well as the subsequent peace treaty of 1947, confirmed the Soviet-Romanian border as it was on January 1, 1941.United States Department of State.

It is a terrestrial, primarily transform, left-lateral strike-slip fault. The slippage rate along the Chaman fault system as the Indo-Australian Plate moves northward (relative to the Eurasian Plate) has been estimated at 10 mm/yr or more. In addition to its primary transform aspect, the Chaman fault system has a compressional component as the Indian Plate is colliding with the Eurasian Plate. This type of plate boundary is sometimes called a transpressional boundary.\\"Earthquakes Pose a Serious Hazard in Afghanistan\\" Fact Sheet 2007–3027, April 2007, United States Geological Survey From the south, the Chaman fault starts at the triple junction where the Arabian Plate, the Eurasian Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate meet, which is just off the Makran Coast of Pakistan. The fault tracks northeast across Balochistan and then north-northeast into Afghanistan, runs just to the west of Kabul, and then northeastward across the right-lateral-slip Herat fault, up to where it merges with the Pamir fault system north of the 38° parallel.Fig.2 Chaman fault System associated with Indian Plate Boundary (April 2008) \\"Chaman Fault System (CFS) – a Prominent Seismo-tectonic Feature In Pakistan\\" Cowasjee Earthquake Study Centre Ned Newsletter 8(1): pp. 2–3, p.2 The Ghazaband and Ornach-Nal faults are often included as part of the Chaman fault system. South of the triple junction, where the fault zone lies undersea and extends southwest to approximately 10°N 57°E, it is known as the Owen Fracture Zone. While there is general agreement that the fault is slipping at a rate of at least 10 mm/yr, there is a report of volcanic rocks in Pakistan dated to 2 m.y.

After graduating from GAMP, he attended college at Philadelphia University. He left Philadelphia to live and work in Hollywood, California where he was offered talent representation with The David Wilder Agency. While promoting his music career in Hollywood, he met and began working with his first record producer, George Reich, while hanging out pushing song demos on dance club dj's at various Hollywood night spots. George Reich is credited with discovering Rosati musically in Hollywood. The two began working out of Reich's recording studio on a song demo for Rosati's first radio played pop single titled \\"Fast & Nasty Girl\\".South Philadelphia Public Record. http://www.phillyrecord.com/S-Philadelphia/2007/1101/0-article-06.htmlMaximum Freestyle. http://www.maximumfreestyle.com/richierosatibio.htm Both Reich and Rosati began shopping the completed song demo to Los Angeles and New York City record labels. Hollywood DJ's started playing the song demo in dance clubs. The demo caught the attention of DJ Vinny Lombardi back in Rosati's hometown Philadelphia. Lombardi was a radio DJ for WPWT 91.7 FM Dance Radio and the first radio station dj to spin Rosati's music on commercial radio airwaves. When Rosati's talent agency relocated their offices to New York City, Rosati headed back east with the agency. While promoting out of New York, he met and started working with another record producer named Robert Federici. Federici asked Rosati to reconstruct the song more commercially so that commercial radio stations could air the song. With the help of Program Director Glenn Kalina and Music Director Pam Grund at WIOQ FM RADIO, the commercial version of Fast & Nasty Girl made it onto the airwaves of Philadelphia’s most popular dance radio station WIOQ. Rosati began doing promotional club performances for the station to promote the song. From the airplay Rosati received on that station, and with the help of Woody Dyer and Nate DeLego, Rosati landed a distribution deal with Universal Records Distribution. As Rosati's first single continued to be played on Q102 FM, other radio stations began airing the song, putting Rosati into the mainstream spotlight. It was during this time that Rosati landed a part in the film titled \\"Home Of Angels\\" opposite Sherman Hemsley and Abe Vigoda.IMDB. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741135/ Rosati then recorded the single \\"Metropolis\\", which caught the attention of Henry Stone and Paul Klein who owned the internationally distributed dance record label HOT Records, based in Miami, Florida. The executives at HOT Records paired Rosati with another Producer named Bobby LaSerra, who owned and operated the HOT Records sub label Strong Island Records. LaSerra, Rosati, and the executives at HOT Records released several remixes of the single \\"Metropolis\\" worldwide.

In 1906, working as athletics trainer at the University of Washington, he accepted the post of rowing crew coach even though he had no rowing experience and knew nothing about the sport. Experiments convinced him that the traditional Oxford style of rowing, involving a long stroke, was both unsound and uncomfortable, and he developed the new, shorter style with which his name became associated. Under his coaching the university crew became, in 1913, the first Western crew to compete by invitation in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Washington crew members went on to achieve success at subsequent regattas and at national and Olympic level using the technique developed by Conibear.

In his clandestine bioprospecting piracy, he worked without official papers and would have been ruthlessly treated had he been caught. He succeeded in naturalizing the insect and the prickly pear (Opuntia) \\"nopal\\" cactus on which it depended in the French colony of Saint-Domingue.His exploit is briefly recounted by Londa L. Schiebinger, Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World (Harvard University Press) 2004, pp 39–44. His colorful Voyage à Guaxaca (Oaxaca) narrates his adventure, in which he played upon the smugness and venality of the colonial Spanish. After arriving in Saint Domingue, he obtained papers identifying him as a botanizing physician and declared himself in search of the botanicals necessary for his treatment of gout. He herbalized in Havana, awaiting transport to Mexico, and on his arrival in Veracruz in January 1777, endeared himself locally by identifying the \\"true\\" jalap – a useful drug that was imported expensively, even though locally abundant. Sensing that something was wrong, the viceroy ordered him to leave, unwilling \\"to open to strangers the secrets of the country\\". Thiéry de Menonville, with the image of Jason and the Golden Fleece constantly in his mind's eye, slipped over the ramparts of Veracruz one evening and set out, in the guise of a Catalan in order to account for his Frenchified Spanish and his dress, for Oaxaca where the best cochineal was produced. In Oaxaca, he purchased from Indians and blacks the insects and the cacti they parasitize, and some pods of vanilla, which he jumbled among commonplace herbal specimens in his collecting case. Once safely ashore in Saint Domingue he established a plantation of the nopal cactus in the botanical garden, the jardin du roi that he established at Port-au-PrinceTraité,, \\"Préface\\" p. xx. and sent further cactus pads and cochineal insects to the scientific academy at Cap Français. With the success of the adventure he was rewarded with the title of Botaniste du roi and an annuity of 6000 livres.

Beginning his career in 1945 he art-directed well over 200 films. He was one of Japan's best known art directors, most famously for his collaborations with cult director Seijun Suzuki through the 1960s at the Nikkatsu Company, exemplified by Tokyo Drifter (1966). Other directors with whom he frequently worked include Toshio Masuda, Kazuo Kuroki, Kei Kumai and Kaizo Hayashi. At age 90 he made his feature film directorial debut with Dreaming Awake (2008). He had also worked as a critic, writer, painter, photographer and teacher. Career Kimura was born in Tokyo on April 1, 1918. A graduate of Aoyama Gakuin University with a background in theatre, Kimura joined the Nikkatsu Company's scenography department in 1941. The same year, the government ordered the ten major movie studios to consolidate into two. A counteroffer of three was accepted and Nikkatsu merged with Daito and Shinko, the first shutting down their film production unit, and the new company was named Daiei. Kimura continued as an assistant with Daiei after World War II and was promoted to art director in 1945. His debut film was Masanori Igayama's Umi no yobu koe (1945). When Nikkatsu opened a new studio and resumed film production in 1954, Kimura transferred there. At Nikkatsu he worked with many of the studio's directors, including top action director Toshio Masuda, and showed a propensity for realistic set design. However, Kimura became frustrated in doing the same types of films repeatedly and had ambitions to work on films where the art direction was a major focal point. He found an ideal collaborator in the like-minded Seijun Suzuki, a director of primarily B action movies. They first collaborated on The Bastard (1963) which Suzuki considered a turning point in his career. The two became good friends and Kimura became his permanent art director. They worked to refine their style which consisted of more artistry and symbolism than studio bosses generally preferred to see in their action films. Among their best known collaborations are Gate of Flesh (1964) and Tokyo Drifter (1966), on which The Japan Times' Mark Schilling wrote, \\"Who can forget the all-white nightclub in the latter film, with the huge donut-shape, color-shifting mobile – like nothing in real life but expressive of the film's go-go-era, anything- can-happen world.\\" Suzuki considered the art director and cinematographer key collaborators and rewrote the scripts he was assigned over extended discussions with Kimura or cinematographers Katsue Nagatsuka or Shigeyoshi Mine. They would add characters and scenes or expand simple lines into elaborate shots. For his contributions to The Flower and the Angry Waves (1964) Kimura received his first screenwriting credit. He was also included in Hachirō Guryū, the joint pen name for the writing group which formed around Suzuki in the mid-1960s, along with six assistant directors, most prominently Atsushi Yamatoya and Chūsei Sone. The Japanese film industry lost much of its viewership to television through the 1960s and, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Nikkatsu shut down regular productions in August 1971, and in November began producing low cost Roman Pornos, romantic softcore pornography films. Kimura left Nikkatsu a couple years later in 1973 to work freelance. He has continued to work steadily outside of the studio system and has since worked with a wide selection of directors including auteur Mitsuo Yanagimachi and multiple collaborations with Kazuo Kuroki and Kaizo Hayashi. Stylistically, he continues to vary between the surrealistic, as in his subsequent collaborations with Suzuki, and the realistic, including his films with Kei Kumai. Kimura directed two short films in 2004, and the release of Mugen Sasurai (2004) afforded him the oldest directorial debut at age 86. Following a third and four short film, he directed his first feature-length film at age 90, Dreaming Awake (2008), for which he was recognized by Guinness World Records for \\"the oldest debut as a feature film director\\". The film was based on his own novel, which touches on autobiographical elements, and more closely resembles his surrealistic collaborations with Suzuki—who appears in the film as an actor—than his more realistic art direction. He remained among Japan's best known art directors, most famously for his work with Suzuki through the 1960s. In addition to film, Kimura had worked as a film and art critic, painter, writer, photographer, teacher and on the lecture circuit. He died of interstitial pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital on March 21, 2010, at the age of 91. FilmographyAwards Kimura has been nominated for nine Japanese Academy Awards for his art direction and won twice. At the 2nd annual ceremony in 1979, he was nominated for the Outstanding Achievement in a Technical Field for Love and Faith. He won the 1981 award for Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction for An Ocean to Cross, Zigeunerweisen, A Long Way for a Motor Car and The Woman. The following year, he was nomination in the same category for Kei Kumai's Willful Murder, and again in 1983 for the international co- production The Go Masters and Yukko no okurimono: Cosmos no yō ni. At the 12th annual ceremony in 1989, he was co-nominated with Noriyoshi Ikeya for their work on Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis. Kimura received another nomination in 1990 for Kumai's The Death of a Tea Master. His second win came in 1991 for Mt. Aso's Passions, Childhood Days and Hong Kong Paradise. Bandō Tamasaburō's Yearning earned Kimura his last nomination at the 1994 ceremony. He won three Mainichi Film Awards for Best Art Direction. At the 9th annual ceremony in 1955, he won for A Certain Woman, made at Daiei, and Black Tide, made after he had moved to Nikkatsu. He again won in 1982 for Kumai's Willful Murder. Finally, at the 1987 ceremony he won for The Sea and Poison, House of Wedlock and To Sleep So as to Dream. Additional awards include Best Artistic Contribution for Mt. Aso's Passions, at the 1990 Montreal World Film Festival, and Best Art Director for The Soul Odyssey, at the 2003 Yokohama Film Festival.

It is recognizable by its deep funnel-shaped, scarlet-colored fruit bodies bearing white hairs on the exterior. Found in the United States and Asia, it grows on partially buried sticks and twigs of oak trees. Description The diameter of the cup- or funnel-shaped fruit bodies is in diameter; the margins of the cup are curved inwards when young. Both the interior and exterior surfaces of the cup are scarlet red. The exterior surface is covered with stiff white hairs. Details of the hair structure may be seen with a magnifying glass: they are up to 1 mm long or more, translucent, thick-walled, rigid and more or less sword-shaped with simple, sharply diminishing bases. They are connected to the fruit body at the junction of internal tissue layers called the medullary and ectal excipulums. When the hairs come in contact with an alkali solution of 2% potassium hydroxide, the thick walls of the base of the hair first swell in size and then dissolve, releasing the contents of the internal lumen. The stem is cylindrical, and about long by 1–2 mm thick. =Microscopic characteristics= The spores are 20–30 by 14–16 µm; the asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300–350 by 18–20 µm. The paraphyses (sterile, upright, basally attached filaments in the hymenium, growing between asci) are thin, slightly thickened at the tip and contain many red granules. Varieties One variant species has been described, M. floccosum var. floccosum, found in China and Japan, has larger spores than typical. The fungus originally described as Microstoma floccosum var. macrosporum was recognized as an independent species in 2000 and renamed to Macrostoma macrosporum. It differs from M. floccosum by fruiting season, asci and ascospore size, and the ultrastructure of the hairs. Similar species Microstoma apiculosporum is a species from Taiwan that has spores with short, sharply pointed tips. Scutellinia scutellata has a shallow red cup, no stalk, and black hairs on only the edge of the cap margin. The stalked scarlet cup, Sarcoscypha occidentalis, has a shape, size and color that somewhat resemble M. floccosum, but it lacks any surface hairs, and the cup is not as deep. Habitat and distribution A saprobic species, Microstoma floccosum grows scattered to clustered together, attached to wood that is typically partially buried in the earth. A preference for both oak and Shagbark hickory has been noted. Microstoma floccosum has been collected from the United States, India, China, and Japan.

The SM465 can be found in Chevrolet and GMC full-size trucks, Blazers, Suburbans, among other models. Some applications beyond one-ton pickup trucks came with larger input shafts. Favored by off-road drivers, the SM465 has a very low first gear suitable for rock-crawling. The SM465 has developed a reputation as a highly durable transmission. For the 1992 model-year, the SM465 was replaced in 3/4- and 1-ton pickup truck applications by the New Venture Gear 4500 transmission. The \\"SM\\" in the transmission's designation does not stand for Synchro-Mesh, contrary to popular belief. \\"SM\\" stands for \\"SAGINAW MUNCIE\\". GM literature also often referred to this as a CH465, referencing Chevrolet.

The 1988-91 versions have an aluminum top with improved shift feel. The 1985 and newer versions utilize a hydraulic clutch release, replacing a mechanical linkage in older versions. A common wear factor in the form of abuse leads to having to manually hold the gear selector in third. There have been three different output shafts for pickup trucks. Early four-wheel drive was a short 10 spline, late 4WD was long 32 spline, and all two-wheel drives were 35 spline. Early 4WDs came mated to New Process 205 transfer cases.

It was originally a single room laboratory at the Pasteur Institute, Coonoor, Tamil Nadu for the study of Beriberi, and was called the Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit. McCarrison was invalided to Britain from 1920–1922, and in 1923 the enquiry was axed on financial grounds. It was restored two years later as the Deficiency Disease Inquiry, which McCarrison headed from 1925–1929. The scope of the laboratory expanded to include all deficiency diseases, and around 1928-29 became the Nutrition Research Laboratories (NRL), with McCarrison as its first Director, until his retirement in 1935, when he was succeeded by Dr. W.R. Ackroyd. The facility moved to Hyderabad in 1958 and in 1969 was renamed the National Institute of Nutrition.

The land under the structure was purchased by Mountain View in 1929 for $10 from Wallace and Alice Angelo; it was used for a pump station and reservoir and served as the town's primary water source. Several years later, the city wanted to create a meeting place between downtown Mountain View and the Navy's Moffett Field; the land's location at the corner of Moffett Boulevard and Central Expressway proved ideal.Candice Shih, Adobe Building makes historic list, Mountain View Voice, February 7, 2003, Accessed July 30, 2009. The structure was built in 1934 as a New Deal, Civil Works Administration project during the Great Depression, and was constructed by local laborers using adobe bricks.Brandon Hong, Now earthquake-safe, Adobe Building reopens its doors, Mountain View Voice, September 28, 2001, Accessed July 30, 2009. The project also involved the time and money of members of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, one of the building's first tenants. Once World War II broke out, the building was also used as a serviceman's club and hospitality house for veterans. After the war, the structure took on many more civilian events, and was renamed the Eagle Shack teen center as it hosted high school dances and numerous weddings in the late 1940s. In 1949, the first National Guard leased it for four years as its armory. It then served city programs, including housing the Mountain View Recreation Division and the preparation of a senior lunch program. Over the years, the building had been altered and worn down to the point that it was commonly referred to as the \\"Adobe Shack\\". Courtyard view of Historic Adobe Building In 1987, new seismic building regulations forced the city to close it. As the structure sat abandoned over several years, a community- driven, \\"Save the Adobe\\" campaign began in 1995. As a result, the building was restored to its 1935 appearance and reopened for public use on September 29, 2001, at a cost of $1.2 million. The building is now rented by the city as an event center, and includes a modern catering kitchen, office and great room with space for 100 in indoor dining. The building was designated a California Historical Landmark on August 2, 2002. It was nominated to the NRHP based on its use as a community hall and its method of construction.Bill D'Agostino, Feds will likely say Adobe building a historic place, Mountain View Voice, August 16, 2002, Accessed July 30, 2009. It was placed on the NRHP primarily in recognition of its historic value as a Works Project Administration project; it was also noted for its aesthetic value in Spanish Revival architecture.

Two were built. Development Having demonstrated the watertightness and corrosion resistance of duralumin monocoque flying boat hulls with the Short Cockle, Shorts became leaders in the design of metal floats for seaplanes. The floats for both the Supermarine S.4 and Gloster III Schneider Cup seaplanes were built by Shorts. They had built their own hydrodynamic testing canal at their Rochester base to explore the performance of floats on the water and decided to build a small aircraft to test them in flight. This was the Short S.7 Mussel; the name was a natural complement to the Cockle but also a nod to \\"Mussel Manor\\", the clubhouse on Shorts' first airfield at Sheppey. It was a two-seat, single-engined low-winged monoplane, mounted originally on twin floats. Like the slightly earlier Short Cockle, Satellite and Springbok, it had a duralumin monocoque fuselage of oval cross section.Flight 11 March 1926 pp. 141-5 There were a pair of tandem open cockpits over the wing fitted with dual controls. Contemporary commentators regarded the mounting of the upright four cylinder ADC Cirrus I engine as particularly neatly done, in a U-shaped extension of the monocoque which initially left the top of the engine exposed. This engine was changed for an Cirrus II in January 1928. The fuel tank was immediately behind the fire wall, high enough to gravity feed the carburettor. There was a direct reading fuel gauge above the tank, just in front of the forward cockpit, enclosed a in variety of fairings over the Mussel's lifetime. The constant chord wings were gimbal mounted to the lower fuselage, with pairs of streamlined compression struts from about 30% span to the upper fuselage just ahead of each cockpit. The wing spars were duralumin structures, though the first of the two Mussels had spruce ribs. The wing section was the untried, thick RAF 33. The wings and empennage were fabric covered; the fin and unbalanced rudder had a shape not unlike the de Haviiland vertical tail and the horizontal tail was externally braced from below. The all-important floats were similar to those Shorts had made for the Gloster III, single stepped, small heeled and long enough that the Mussel sat in flight position on the water, not on a tail float like their many earlier seaplanes. This first set of floats was mounted with two pairs of struts to the lower fuselage fore and aft, with a pair of cross bracing struts between the floats. The Mussel also had a built in tail skid in anticipation of a landplane configuration. The performance of the Mussel on its first flight, piloted by John Lankester Parker on 6 April 1926 was disappointing, but the problem was traced to wing-root interference and solved with fabric root fillets.Flight 26 August 1926 pp. 538-9, where the fillets can be clearly seen Thereafter it seems to have been a pleasant machine to fly and one that met its original objectives. The first Mussel was lost when Eustace Short flew clipped a mast in August 1928; Short was unhurt but the Mussel was damaged beyond economic repair. Its replacement, the Mussel II first flew on 17 May 1929. It was similar to the first machine, but had metal ribbed wings of NACA M.12 section; a flat sided fuselage near the wing roots to avoid the need for filleting and water rudders on the floats. It was powered by a Cirrus III engine until August 1930, when it was replaced with a de Havilland Gipsy II. Operational history On its first flights the Mussel I was configured as a seaplane, then spent a fortnight at the end of September 1926 as a landplane, appearing unsuccessfully in the Grosvenor Challenge Cup. In October it was back on floats of a different design. This pattern repeated through to the final accident; during that time the Mussel flew with floats for the Short Crusader Schneider Trophy racer and for the de Havilland Moth. Shorts set up a production line for the successful Moth floats. The Mussel II also spent time as both landplane and seaplane. Until March 1930 both Mussels had used what was in the UK at least the standard two float configuration. In that month a single long central float arrangement, similar to one built by Shorts for a de Havilland Gipsy Moth the previous summer. The single float required wing tip stabilising floats, and these were strutted to the outer wing and braced with another pair of struts inboard, meeting the underside of the wing at the same point as the wing compression struts above, so running almost co-linearly with them and giving a shallow cross like look to the aircraft from the front.Flight 4 April 1930 p. 384 In its original form this undercarriage was amphibious, with main wheels mounted on a streamlined cross piece on the float, as on the Moth.Flight 11 July 1929 pp. 628-30 The main axle could be rotated from the cockpit by turning a handwheel and hence raising or lowering the mainwheels. The water rudder on the float was reinforced to act as a small tailskid for use on land. In June 1932 the Mussel II began flying as a landplane again with a central single wheel undercarriage, with wing tip and tail skids. It flew, but was hard to handle on the ground and reappeared in October with the central float but no land wheels. During 1933 it gained attention in races against speedboats. Its last flight was in September 1933. One other significant event in Short Brothers' history involved the Mussel. Eustace Short had come to fixed wing flying quite late in life, and he learned on the Mussel I and continued on the Mussel II. One day he landed tidily on the Medway, but failed to turn the engine off, crossed the river and slid gently into the mud. It seems he died of a heart attack moments after touching down.

Polemical and partly autobiographical, the book contends that the British political right and left no longer hold firm, adversarial beliefs, but vie for position in the centre, while at the same time overseeing a general decline in British society. Hitchens depicts the right in particular as a confused and spent political force that has supposedly been subsumed by the centre-left, particularly Fabian social democracy. As a result of these factors, he suggests that \\"there is no longer any debate between the political parties about issues that have divided thinkers down the ages, and divide the population even now\\". Hitchens concludes that, since the compass is broken, the time has come in British politics for the re-establishment of a proper adversarial system and for principles to be rediscovered. In the media, The Broken Compass received mostly negative reviews from left-leaning outlets and some other newspapers, and was largely ignored by the conservative press. It was reissued as The Cameron Delusion in March 2010, two months before David Cameron became the British Prime Minister. Background Hitchens sets out his stall in the preface \\"The Lost Frontier\\", stating: \\"conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. By the time it has become conventional, it has ceased to be wisdom and become cant. Its smug cousin, received opinion, is just as bad. The aim of this book is to defy these two enemies of thought and reason\\", and \\"conventional wisdom's biggest single mistake is its thought-free, obsolete idea of Left and Right\\". Synopsis=Part I: The New Permanent Government of Britain= In The Broken Compass Hitchens criticises the media's portrayal of Gordon Brown. In Chapter 1, \\"Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry\\", Hitchens claims that opinion polls are a device for influencing public opinion and not measuring it, and that political parties and newspapers are responsible for this manipulation, whose purpose is to \\"bring about the thing it claims is already happening\\". The author cites contemporary examples of the media attacking Gordon Brown and the expected win of the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election. Hitchens begins Chapter 2, \\"The Power of Lunch\\", by asserting, based on his time as a reporter at Westminster, that political journalists are uninterested in serious political debate; propagate received centre-left standpoints on issues; and consult with each other and politicians about media stories. Chapter 3, \\"Time for a Change\\", describes how a media reporting bias is attempting to facilitate a Tory general election win. Hitchens states one of his motivations in writing the book was to frustrate this exercise. Hitchens claims in Chapter 4, \\"Fear of Finding Something Worse\\", that Labour has reached \\"the most significant moment in its history – the complete acceptance of its programme by the Conservatives\\". The author invokes the closing image of George Orwell's Animal Farm to illustrate how close the two parties have become.i.e., in reference to the line \\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from man to pig again; but already it was impossible to say which was which\\". Hitchens also quotes this line at the beginning of the book's preface Chapter 5, \\"The Great Landslide\\", discusses how a number of left-leaning writers and newspapers have allegedly begun describing the Conservatives in favourable terms, and how this no longer constituted \\"a form of treason\\". =Part II: The Left Escapes to the West= Chapter 6, \\"Riding the Prague Tram\\", describes Hitchens's experience of travelling in Communist Bloc countries before the fall of the Soviet Union and how this, combined with the behaviour of certain left-wing organisations in the UK, led to his becoming disillusioned with the British Left. He also carries out a lengthy critique of the Western Left's apologist stance towards Soviet Communism, including views held by Fabian Society members Beatrice and Maurice Webb; the attempt to exonerate and romanticise Lenin and Trotsky; and intellectual resistance to the works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Robert Conquest. In Chapter 7, \\"A Fire Burning Under Water\\", Hitchens describes the final stage in his becoming disenchanted with the British Left – the British Trades Union Congress's (TUC) alleged failure to support the Gdańsk shipyard workers challenging the Soviet-aligned government. =Part III: Britain Through the Looking Glass= Chapter 8, \\"Racism, Sexism and Homophobia\\", examines how the modern ideology of race and the term racist differ from the previous concept of \\"racialism\\", and how the sexual revolution represents \\"seeking the existing order's permission to pursue pleasure at all costs\\", which undermines Christian principles of marriage, and has its roots in events in 1968. In Chapter 9, \\"Sexism is Rational\\", Hitchens states that the Left's taking up feminist causes since the 1960s has led to the damage and exploitation of women, as well as a decline in marriage. Hitchens says this process is part of revolutionaries' seeking to \\"destroy and expunge the restraints placed on human selfishness by the Christian religion. The permanent married family is the greatest single obstacle to this\\". Hitchens concludes that in Britain there is an emerging citizenry \\"prepared for enslavement, ignorant of its origins, past, rights, traditions, and duties\\" and that \\"only in a wholly broken political system could there be such a need for reform, and no reformers ready to address it\\". In Chapter 10, \\"Equality or Tolerance\\", Hitchens examines how the Left have since the 1960s taken up the cause of equal rights for homosexuals. Hitchens claims supporters of Leo Abse's 1967 law reform on homosexuality are now accused of intolerance if they do not support homosexual civil partnerships or discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality. Hitchens concludes by stating, \\"the atrophy of religion and patriotism in the Labour party, like the atrophy of the same things in the Tory Party, is the deep problem beneath all others\\". Chapter 11, \\"The Fall of the Meritocracy\\", examines falling standards in British education. Hitchens cites the abolition of grammar schools as one of the main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in social mobility. Hitchens claims egalitarians deny these consequences and that comprehensive education has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study, which asserted that \\"the general lowering of standards and rigour since the end of selection is one of the main reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations\\". Hitchens asks why, \\"the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education\\". Chapter 12, \\"'The age of the train'\\", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the \\"Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor\\". The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass car ownership, saying that \\"roads destroy and distort established ways of living\\", while \\"the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced\\". In Chapter 13, \\"A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus\\", Hitchens explores how since the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, certain commentators on the left realigned with an American neoconservative position, which, \\"delivers him [the leftist commentator] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion\\", and allows \\"political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home\\". =Conclusion: The Broken Compass= Hitchens asserts that political mismanagement, facilitated by an abandonment of the adversarial system, has resulted in an overall decline in British society. He identifies the end of the Cold War (which \\"made many of the old political positions meaningless overnight\\") as one cause of this, as well as the implementation of the ideas of Fabian social democracy and the ideology of the 1960s. Reception On publication the book was reviewed in The Guardian, The Observer and the New Statesman, was the occasion of two interviews with Hitchens with Hannah Pool in The Guardian, and a discussion with the author on BBC Radio 4. The reviews in the left-leaning press were generally unfavourable; Peter Wilby's review in The Observer was dismissive towards much of the book's contents. Wilby wrote \\"As Hitchens sees it, 'the broken compass' is chiefly the Conservatives' fault. Even under Thatcher, they accepted too many of Labour's social democratic and liberal reforms. So we have a permanent government of the centre and one of Labour's main aims is to stop a genuinely Conservative party emerging that may attract working-class votes on such issues as \\"immigration and disorder\\" and getting Britain out of Europe. 'It was greatly in Labour's interest, once the Tory party had accepted so much of Labour's programme as unalterable, that the Tory party should be preserved against the danger of dissolution,' Hitchens writes. There is a grain of truth in all this, but on the left most would reverse the argument. The postwar consensus was destroyed in the Thatcher years and Labour failed to restore it, accepting, at least until the credit crunch, unrestrained neoliberal capitalism. New Labour's appeal to business and the City was that it closed off, perhaps forever, the possibility of a genuinely socialist alternative\\". Writing in the New Statesman, Anthony Howard saw the book as \\"a hotchpotch of separate essays\\" and that, though Hitchens mounts a spirited defence of his beliefs, he nevertheless resembles \\"some faintly out-of-date figure searching the kitchen for any pot or pan he can hurl against the spirit of the age\\". In a review in The Guardian, Steven Poole described Hitchens as being \\"in general exhilaratingly good when attacking the hypocrisies and stupidities of specific individuals\\", and wrote that the \\"best parts\\" of the book describe \\"scenes of foreign reporting, such as an alarming visit to Vilnius in 1991, where Soviet forces massacred Lithuanian nationalists\\". However, Poole also added that the book resorted too much to cultural generalisation. Revised edition, published as The Cameron Delusion Conservative newspapers and magazines, which had consistently reviewed Hitchens's previous books, largely ignored The Broken Compass. An exception to this trend was the Shadow Education Secretary Michael Gove referring at length to the book in his column in The Times, where he wrote that it \\"has some passages of quite brilliant writing and it is at its best when Peter reflects on his own life and his disillusionment with the left-wing ideology of his youth\\" and that the book \\"makes some telling points, which are discomfiting reading for conservatives who value grace and civility in our national life\\". Release details The book was first published in the UK on 11 May 2009 by Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., and in the US on 20 June 2009 by Continuum, with the altered subtitle How Left and Right Lost Their Meaning. In anticipation of the 2010 general election, a revised paperback edition with the new title The Cameron Delusion was released in the UK on 17 March 2010. Index Steven Poole in his Guardian review wrote that \\"Hitchens should at least be applauded for taking the trouble to provide an amusing index, a duty shirked by too many authors.\\" The index was the subject of a full-page parody by Craig Brown in the magazine Private Eye.'Peter Hitchens: the index', 'as told to Craig.

The relatively high percentage of butterfat present in their milk is due to the breed’s efficiency in converting animal feed into butterfat; the Bhadawari buffaloes’ unique, advantageous profile therefore attracts farmers of many developing countries to interbreed them with one of the best meat and milch breed of buffaloes, the Murrah breed. Increasingly important in the livestock industry of countries with agricultural-based economies such as Bulgaria, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Nepal, the resulting hybrid breed of the Bhadawari and Murrah enhances the milk production of other low-yielding breeds and creates a better market for liquid milk.Saifi, H.W., Bharat, Bhushan, Sanjeev, Kumar, Pushpendra Kumar, Patra B.N. and Sharma Arjava (2004). “Genetic Identity between Bhadawari and Murrah Breeds of Indian Buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) Using RAPD-PCR” Asian-Austrian Journal of Animal Sciences, Vol. 17 : 603-607. Print. India has a population of 105 million buffalos, and 26.1% of the population lives in Uttar Pradesh. India also has nine well-recognized breeds based on their phenotypic characteristics (Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Surti, Jaffarabadi, Bhadawari, Mehsana, Nagori, Toda, and Pandarpuri), distributed over several agroclimatic zones.Joshi, J., Salar, R. K., Banerjee, P., Upasna, S. S., Tantia, M. S., & Vijh, R. K. (2013). Genetic Variation and Phylogenetic Relationships of Indian Buffaloes of Uttar Pradesh. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences: 26(9): 1229. doi:10.5713/ajas.2012.12669  Conservation  The pure Bhadawari breed has dwindled to a population of only several thousand because of crossbreeding with the Murrah buffalo. In the area of Uttar Pradesh, India, Murrah buffalo traits are becoming more common. Many view the germplasm of the Bhadawari extremely valuable for conservation.Binoy Chandra Naha, Jmas Vol 1 Issue 1 2013. \\"BUFFALO GENETIC RESOURCES IN INDIA AND THEIR CONSERVATION.\\" The Journal of MacroTrends in 1.1 (2013): 61-66. Web. 10 Oct. 2014  Physical characteristics  The Bhadawari buffaloes are medium- sized, copper-colored and grayish black animals, with two white lines at the lower side of the neck, which is a distinct feature of these buffaloes. The horns are curled slightly outwards, parallel to the neck with the tips curled upwards. They are known to be more resistant to disease and the effects of heat than other buffalo breeds, which makes them ideal for a domesticated draught animal.1- Arora, R., Vijh, R., Lakhchaura, B., Prasad, R., & Tantia, M. (2004). Genetic diversity analysis of two buffalo populations of northern India using microsatellite markers. Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics, 121(2), 111-118. doi:10.1111/j.1439-0388.2004.00451.  Diet  The Bhadawari mainly subsists on coarse feed, straw, corn products, roughage such as barley or wheat straw, cornstalks, sorghum, and sugarcane residuals. Under dire circumstances, the Bhadawari can survive on low-quality crop residues and green forage.  Calving patterns  A 2011 study in the Bundelkhand region of India was performed with the objective of documenting the calving pattern of Bhadawari (and the closely relate Murrah) buffaloes. Areas like Bundelkhand are found throughout India, as heavily dependent on livestock economics due to drought and monsoons, as a whole India has 95 buffaloes per 1,000 human beings; information on calving is detrimental to this region of the world. At the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute in Jhansi, a herd of Bhadawari was intensely managed under a standardized system of nutritional requirements, and was done so over a period of 8 years (starting in 2002). All the while, birth rate was kept in the view of climatological data. Results indicated that rainy (July-Sept) and autumn (Oct-Nov) seasons yielded the highest calving rate, at more than 70%, whereas the lower calving rates were in the winter season at 15.48% and the summer season at 4.88%. Results were then cross-referenced with calving patterns across India and around other parts of the world such as Egypt. The seasonality in the Bhadawari calving indicates that reproductive desire is more dependent on climatic changes than diet.Kushwawa, B.P., Sultan Sighn, and S.B. Maity. \\"Seasonality of Calving Bhadawari and Murrah Buffaloes in Bundelkhand, India.\\" Buffalo Bulletin 30.4 (2011): 256-261. Print.  Milk composition  Overall, buffalo milk has greater nutritional properties and values than cow milk. Buffalo milk has higher levels of fat, lactose, protein, calcium, and vitamins A and C, with lower levels of vitamin E, riboflavin, and cholesterol. An absence of carotene exists, and bioactive pentasaccharides and gangliosides occur that are not present in cow milk. Fat globules are larger, but contain less membrane material than cow milk. However, specific breed of buffalo does affect milk composition. In a 2008 comparison of four Indian buffalo breeds, the Bhadawari was shown to have more solids not fat than the Murrah, which had the highest performance for fat, total protein, and casein contents.El-Salam, Mohamed H. Abd, and Safinaz El-Shibiny. \\"A comprehensive review on the composition and properties of buffalo milk.\\" Dairy Science & Technology 91.6 (2011): 663-699. Print.

It is derived from ἐρέσσω eresso, and therefore originally signifies a rower, but in later times the word was, with the exception of the soldiers or marines, applied to the whole body of persons who performed any service in a vessel. In a still wider sense it was applied to any person who acted as the assistant of another, and performed manual labour for him, whether in sacred or profane things, whence the word is sometimes used as synonymous with slave. Hence also the name was sometimes given to those men by whom the hoplites were accompanied when they took the field, and who carried the luggage, the provisions, and the shield of the hoplites. The more common name for this servant of the hoplites was skeuophoros. At Athens it seems to have been applied to a whole class of officers. Aristotle (Politics vi. 5) divides all public offices into three classes, archai or magistracies, epimeleiai or administrations, and hyperesiai or services. Cities and administrations had their own hyperetae in the Hellenistic world. In Jewish Greek texts the term hyperetes has the meaning of religious servant (deacon).

The film, produced by Vikram Krishna, stars his brother Vishal Krishna in the lead role along with Neetu Chandra, Tanushree Dutta making her debut in Tamil cinema, and Sarah-Jane Dias who makes her acting debut. Santhanam, Sathyan Sivakumar, Mayilsamy, and T. S. B. K. Mouli play supporting roles while Sneha and Mallika Kapoor make special appearances and Prakash Raj in a guest role. Film is dubbed into Hindi as Ek Khiladi 3 Hasina The film follows the story of Karthik, a happy-go-lucky youth and only child, who is also rich and spoilt. Karthik believes in trying out and choosing the best of everything in his life. When he decides to adopt the same practice in choosing his wife and selects three potential candidates of totally different shades and social stratifications, who he simultaneously woos, problems emerge and he gets into trouble. How he manages to overcome all problems and who he finally chooses to marry forms the crux of the story. The film, featuring music scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography by Arvind Krishna and editing by T. S. Suresh, was distributed by Sun Pictures on 12 February 2010, while its dubbed Telugu version, titled Khiladi. The film opened to mixed reviews and became a commercial success. The film was an inspiration for the 2019 Odia movie Mr. Majnu starring Babushan. The background music was adapted from Rajinikanth's Netrikkann.  Plot  Karthik (Vishal) is a lazy, jobless, upper middle-class guy and the only son of his father, who is a bank manager (T. S. B. K. Mouli). Karthik is always hanging around with his friends: an auto rickshaw driver named Kumar (Santhanam), a tea shop owner named Shekar (Mayilsamy), and a traffic constable named Vishnu (Sathyan). Over-ambitious in his life, he always wants the best of everything in his life, from pens and clothes to every other accessories, and has made it a rule to try out everything before zeroing in on one. Now wanting to choose his best life partner, he applies the same method and decides to select three girls, whom he would romance at the same time and make to fall in love with him, then reject two of them and finally marry the third one. Karthik comes across Jyothi (Tanushree Dutta), an athlete living in the poorer area of Chennai, who has reservations against men and slaps a guy for touching her inappropriately and is Karthik's first choice. Karthik later attends a marriage, where he meets Priya (Sarah-Jane Dias), a girl who strongly believes in traditional and cultural values and has the policy of loving and marrying only one boy in her life, and she is Karthik's second candidate. The third one whom Karthik selects is Tejaswini (Neetu Chandra), a rich and arrogant girl and the heir to Rs. 1,500 crores, who once had a failed love attempt in her life. Karthik enters their lives, woos them with lies, and finally wins their hearts. The girls do not know the fact that Karthik is romancing three girls simultaneously and entirely trust him. One day, thanks to her caring and understanding father Ranganathan (Jayaprakash), who does not want his daughter to sustain one more love failure, Tejaswini gets to know about Karthik's plans and intentions and confronts him. Karthik dumps her and continues to romance Jyothi and Priya, while Tejaswini vows to take revenge on him. Without revealing her own and Karthik's true identity and intentions, she befriends the other two girls and gives advice to each, how to quicken the progress to get married soon, trying to put Karthik under pressure and blow his cover. Soon Jyothi gets to know the truth, wherefore he also rejects Jyothi and settles down with Priya as his future wife, who was responsible for Karthik's change of mind as he has now learnt the value of true love and realizes his mistakes. However, as Jyothi's rowdy brother Anbalazhagan (Prakash Raj) confronts Karthik that he has betrayed Jyothi, Karthik reveals the truth about himself, his intentions, and the other girls to Priya, who was with him. Downheartedly, she leaves Karthik, who is being beaten up by Anbalazhagan and his gang. Karthik then causes a traffic accident, getting himself tangled and injured in the accident, and gets admitted in a hospital, where Dr. Ramya (Sneha) comes for his treatment. He pretends to have lost his memory due to the accident in order to arouse compassion in Priya and also with the intention to change his behavior to be more loyal to Priya, eventually indeed succeeding in his plan as Priya returns and reunites with him. The film ends with Karthik comically telling the audience about he plans to \\"live as a new man and love Priya only\\". The film ends with him asking, \\"You believe me, right?\\" to the audience, after which his future is left for the audience to predict.

Rajasekhar in the 2008 police story Sathyam, that also starred Vishal Krishna would direct Vishal after the actor had completed his Thoranai. The film was to be produced by Ramesh Babu, who earlier produced Vijay's blockbuster film Pokkiri. However, as the producer later walked out of the project, Vishal's brother Vikram Krishna along with his wife Sriya Reddy eventually took up the project and decided to produce it under their home banner G K Film Corporation. The film was titled Theeratha Vilaiyattu Pillai, after a poem by Subramania Bharathi.http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/south- tamil-music-review-theeradha-vilayattu-pillai/20100208.htm The film, during pre-production was billed up to be a remake of the 2007 Hindi film Bachna Ae Haseeno, which also starred three actresses in lead roles, but the claim proved to be false. Vishal also denied this, stating that the script is original. In January 2010, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Sun Pictures, which started its promotion campaign on 2 February 2010, ten days prior to the film's theatrical release. = Casting = After Vishal was confirmed as the lead actor in the film, Thiru and Vishal were looking for three actresses to play the lead fimale roles. Several actresses including Bipasha Basu, Reemma Sen, Priyamani, Tamannaah Bhatia and Shriya Saran were approached or even confirmed, before ultimately opting out again. Finally, Bollywood actress Neetu Chandra, who starred in the horror film Yavarum Nalam opposite Madhavan and another Bollywood actress Tanushree Dutta, a former Miss India Universe, making her debut in the Tamil film industry, were confirmed for the roles. For the third female role, a newcomer Sarah-Jane Dias, a former Miss India World, was signed. Additionally, reports claimed that the film would also have two lead actresses appearing in guest roles as well. In December 2009, Sneha was roped in to appear in one of the two cameo roles, whilst the other actress' identity was not revealed until the film's release. = Filming = The shooting started on 3 August and was held in several locations as Chennai, Hyderabad, the Maldives and Kochi. The title song of the film was shot in Mumbai at sets and choreographed by Bosco-Caesar, a popular choreographer duo that has worked for over 300 films in Bollywood, made their debut in Tamil with this film. For the same song, which was picturized in Vishal and the three leading actresses, Neetu Chandra is said to have soaked in a bathtub full of red chillies, which is considered one of the highlights of the entire film. Other songs were filmed in Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, other songs were shot across Australia, in both urban and natural backgrounds.  Soundtrack  Film score and soundtrack are composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The album was released on 16 December 2009 at Devi Theatres which Sify called the \\"grandest affair of the season\\". Initially actors Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth were said to the chief guests of the function, which, however, turned out to be untrue. The album features five songs plus one introduction track by composer Yuvan Shankar Raja, while an additional song, not included in the soundtrack release, featured in the film as part of the film score. Lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay and Vaali. Not in the soundtrack Other music featured in the film includes: # Theriyamale, composed and performed by Yuvan Shankar Raja  Reception  The general consensus was that the character of Karthik displayed male chauvinism. Santhanam's comedy track was well appreciated in the movie.http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/feb/12/review-theeradha-vilayattu- pillai.htm Sify Movies gave the movie a more lenient review,.http://sify.com/movies/tamil/review.php?id=14931319&ctid;=5&cid;=2429  References  External links  * 2010 films Indian films Tamil-language films 2010 romantic comedy films Films directed by Thiru (director) Films scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja 2010s Tamil-language films Indian romantic comedy films Films shot in Chennai Films shot in Kochi Films shot in Hyderabad, India Films shot in the Maldives Films shot in Australia Films shot in New Zealand 2010 directorial debut films 2010 comedy films ","title":"Theeradha Vilaiyattu Pillai"},{"id":"23810746","text":"Grevillea gariwerdensis is a species of the plant genus Grevillea.

He represented the Aydın Province in the 10th and 11th Turkish parliaments from 1954 to 1960. He was sentenced to death in the Yassıada trials undertaken after the 1960 Turkish coup d'état, but his sentence was later commuted to life in prison. He was given a six-month release in September 1964 due to health problems, and in 1965, he was released from the Kayseri prison along with the rest of the Democratic Party MPs remaining in prison.  Family background and education  Çelim was born in Köşk in 1909 to Hafız Ahmet and Muhsine Hanım. He comes from the family of Posacılar, an old Turkoman family with roots in Western Turkestan who settled originally in Karahayıt, Aydın during the Ottoman Interregnum (1402–1413). Necati Çelim, 1920s He did not initially attend secular school but was educated in religion instead. His father, who owned the Posacılar Farm, wanted him to focus on their large farming and trading businesses instead of getting further education. In protest, Çelim escaped from home with the financial help of his mother. He studied in cities where he had relatives, since at that time, there were no middle or high schools in Aydın. He took and passed primary school exams, as he had not been able to go to school during the years that spanned World War I and the Turkish War of Independence. Next, he went to Manisa and graduated from middle school. Later, he went to Istanbul and graduated from Kabataş High School. Upon graduation from high school, he entered the Medical School at Istanbul University, one of the cornerstones of President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's new educational institutions that was at the time heavily staffed by German and Austrian scientists who the Nazi regime in Germany had considered racially or politically undesirable and thus exiled. He graduated from the Medical School in 1934. His family supported him until the Great Depression, when his family's business was heavily hit, forcing him to complete the remainder of his studies with a scholarship from a family friend. He completed his residency at Zeynep Kamil Women's and Children's Diseases Education and Research Hospital and became a gynecologist. In addition to his native Turkish, he could read and write in French, Arabic, and Persian.  Career as a government-appointed doctor  Çelim was first appointed as a doctor to Cizre in Şırnak Province, working there four years. Then, he was appointed to Çukurova in the Mersin Province with a focus on fighting malaria. In the 1930s in Çukurova, it was determined that malaria cases were much more frequent around paddy fields. As such, a law was passed in 1935 to administer the wet- field cultivation in Turkey. In every region, a committee was formed for this purpose with a government administrator, a doctor, and a producer on board. Çelim helped significantly to eradicate malaria from around Çukurova during this time. However, some large land owners, unhappy with losing too much farming land to malaria prevention efforts, asked the government to transfer him out of Mersin. Subsequently, he was appointed to Söğüt in Bilecik Province. His final post was at Bayındır in İzmir Province, once again with a focus on fighting malaria. This was to be his last government post, and after his service in Bayındır, he returned to Aydın Province to operate his private practice.  Political life  During his time as an MP (1954–1960), he focused on legislative efforts to increase the amount of money allocated to the Ministry of Education as well as improving the living standards of teachers. He proposed the legislation that eventually led to the formation of the investigation committee on relations between the Turkish Army and Republican People's Party (CHP), which had established the Turkish Republic and had remained in power from the founding of the Republic through 1950. The committee was founded in April 1960, just one month before the 1960 Turkish coup d'état. The 15-person investigation committee had mostly focused on the relationships between the CHP and the Army but they were also looking into international connections of the upcoming coup d'état. Nevertheless, the committee could not stop the coup. After to the 1960 Turkish coup d'état, the generals took control of the country and prime minister Adnan Menderes, along with two of his ministers, were executed by hanging for violating the constitution, and many Democratic Party members were imprisoned and banned from political life. Furthermore, the Turkish military declared its allegiance to NATO and CENTO, received over a billion dollars in aid from the United States, and later forced more than half the officer corps of the Turkish Military into retirement. As a result, about 90 percent of the generals, 75 percent of the colonels, 50 percent of the lieutenant colonels and 30 percent of the majors were discharged from the army.http://www.timeturk.com/yazardetay.asp?Newsid=12997http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=1021927  Contributions to Aydın during his political career  Necati Çelim is one of the founding members and also one of the original Board of Directors of the Aydın Textiles Factory. Aydın Textiles Factory is the first textiles factory of the city of Aydın and for over 25 years was the largest employer in the region. Çelim also wrote and submitted the legislation that made Kuşadası part of Aydın Province instead of Izmir Province. Çeşme, part of Izmir Province, was the favorite vacation spot of almost all the Izmir Province MPs. Furthermore, the distance between Izmir and Kuşadası was far greater than the distance between Aydın and Kuşadası. Due to these reasons, Kuşadası often did not get much attention from the Turkish Parliament. As a result of the legislation that Necati Çelim spearheaded, Kuşadası started to receive significant investments from the government and started to become an important destination for tourism. This change has also greatly increased Aydın Province's tax revenues. Çelim was also key to securing the government investment for building the first passenger port in Kuşadası.  1960 Turkish coup d'état and after the coup  After the 1960 Turkish coup d'état, Çelim was first imprisoned in Yassıada and stood trial in the mock \\"Breach of the Constitution\\" trial.http://yenisafak.com.tr/diziler/amenderes/index.html Afterwards, he was kept as a prisoner in Kayseri until 1964. The generals, now lifetime senators, banned him from practicing medicine upon his release. This ban was overturned in 1966 by the Justice Party, the successor to the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, his political activity were curbed for over ten years, until the late 1970s, although even then he even could not vote in the parliamentary elections or take part in politics. He returned to practicing medicine until his retirement at 73. He moved to the Izmir Province where his daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren resided and was treated there for his severe respiratory disease. He died in 1986 and is buried in Kuşadası, the hometown of his wife.

The story is centered on corporate \\"downsizer\\" Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his travels. Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, and Danny McBride also star. Filming was primarily in St. Louis, Missouri, which substituted for a number of other cities. Several scenes were filmed in Detroit, Omaha, Las Vegas and Miami. Reitman promoted Up in the Air with personal appearances at film festivals and other showings, starting with the Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2009. The Los Angeles premiere was at the Mann Village Theater on November 30, 2009. Paramount scheduled a limited North American release on December 4, 2009, broadening the release on December 11, 2009, with a wide release on December 23, 2009. The film was met with critical acclaim, for Reitman's screenplay and the performances by Clooney, Farmiga and Kendrick. National Board of Review and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association named Up in the Air the Best Picture of 2009. It received eight Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations and garnered a win for Adapted Screenplay, six Golden Globe Award nominations, earning a win for Best Screenplay, and three Screen Actors Guild nominations. It received six Oscar nominations and recognition from numerous critics' associations. Plot Ryan Bingham works for a human resources consultancy firm specializing in termination assistance. His work constantly takes him around the country, conducting company layoffs on behalf of employers. Ryan also gives motivational speeches, using the analogy, \\"What's in Your Backpack?\\" to extol living free of burdensome relationships and material possessions. A frequent flyer, Ryan aspires to earn ten million frequent flyer miles with American Airlines. While traveling, Ryan meets Alex, a professional woman who also flies frequently. They begin a casual relationship, meeting up in various cities as schedules allow. Ryan is recalled to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. Natalie Keener, a young, ambitious new hire, promotes cutting costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan, unwilling to give up traveling, raises concerns that the new system could be impersonal and apathetic, and argues that Natalie lacks understanding about the firing process and how to handle emotionally vulnerable people. Ryan's boss, Craig, has Natalie accompany Ryan on his next round of terminations to observe the process. Ryan tutors Natalie on traveling more efficiently using smaller luggage and moving quickly through airport security. As they travel together, Natalie challenges Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly regarding relationships and love, but Ryan defends his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie's boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message. Natalie, shattered, is comforted by Ryan and Alex. On a video termination test run, Ryan's earlier concerns prove valid; when one laid-off person breaks down on camera, Natalie is unable to properly console him. Another employee threatens suicide. Natalie later castigates Ryan for refusing to commit to Alex, despite their obvious compatibility. In turn, Ryan criticizes Natalie for lacking empathy and never appreciating her surroundings. Soon after, they are ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. Before returning home, Ryan, taking Alex along, heads to Wisconsin for his sister Julie's wedding. He has a strained reunion with his semi-estranged family who resent his absence. When Jim, the groom, gets cold feet just before the ceremony, Ryan's older sister, Kara, asks Ryan to talk to Jim. Although it runs counter to his personal philosophy, Ryan uses his motivational skills to persuade Jim to proceed with the wedding. Ryan begins questioning his lifestyle and philosophies, and doubts what he lectures others about. Ryan has strong feelings for Alex and impulsively flies to Chicago. Arriving at her home, he is stunned to discover she is married and has children. She later phones him, saying that her family is her real life; he is merely an escape. On Ryan's flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten million mile mark. American Airlines' chief pilot is aboard to personally congratulate Ryan and notes he is the youngest person to achieve the milestone. Back in Omaha, Ryan transfers flyer miles to Julie and Jim so they can have a honeymoon. Ryan's boss informs him that a woman he and Natalie laid off has killed herself, the woman having earlier threatened to do so while being laid off (which Ryan did not take seriously). Natalie, upset, has quit via text message. The remote-layoff program is put on hold and Ryan goes back on the road. Natalie applies to the same San Francisco company where she previously declined a position, having followed her boyfriend to Omaha. The interviewer hires her, impressed by her qualifications and Ryan's glowing recommendation. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage.

Reitman noted that Reitman also later stated that \\"the movie is about the examination of a philosophy. What if you decided to live hub to hub, with nothing, with nobody?\\". Production Author Walter Kirn in 2015 =Background= Walter Kirn wrote Up in the Air, the book on which the film is based, during a snowbound winter on a ranch in rural Montana, while thinking about airports, airplanes and first-class passengers he had met who would strongly resemble Ryan Bingham. The novel was published in 2001 and, shortly after, Sheldon Turner discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Turner can be seen in the film sitting beside Ryan at the initial meeting in Omaha. Director Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. Reitman persuaded his father, Ivan Reitman, to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted Griffin and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some Turner inventions that were used in the film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech (\\"Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now ...\\"), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as a man). Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit, after Turner's contribution to the final product was made clear. At a press screening, Reitman also said that his father Ivan had written \\"the best line in the movie.\\" =Casting= Though Reitman has claimed in countless interviews that he wrote the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice of Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk a fine line between aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, \\"If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes.\\" Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin \\"his Lost in Translation.\\" Duration: 1:04:34 Approximately 4,600 people applied to be extras in the film during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009, at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri. Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor speaking roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. They were used for filming inside and outside the terminal at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney acted out most of his scenes inside the terminal. While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified \\"documentary\\" in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been. The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film. The interviews ran for about ten minutes on what it was like to lose their job in a poor economy, and after that the interviewer would \\"fire\\" them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded. =Filming= Filming was mostly done in the St. Louis area. Several scenes were filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at Detroit Metro Airport in late February 2009 with minimal filming in Omaha, in Las Vegas and in Miami, Florida. Missouri and St. Louis leaders provided $4.1 million in tax credits for the $25 million film. Producers set up a St. Louis production office on January 5, 2009. Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009, and continued through the end of April. The film includes 80 different sets at 50 locations throughout the St. Louis area, including St. Louis Lambert International Airport Concourse C and Concourse D (which played the part of several airports across America), the Mansion House apartments in downtown St. Louis, Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark, Hilton St. Louis Airport, DHR International building (8000 Maryland Ave.), the Cheshire Inn, the GenAmerica building (700 Market), Renaissance Grand Hotel, Maplewood United Methodist Church, and Affton High School. The film shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day. In October 2008, Production Services of Omaha scouted locations for three days of filming in late April with Clooney. Some of the scenes were shot inside the Visitor's Bureau and in a condo in the Old Market area of downtown Omaha and at the south end of the main terminal at Eppley Airfield. Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than expected. He was unable to use material from three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the Space Shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots. The film features heavy product placement, with American Airlines, Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels all featured prominently. Competing brands are displayed as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands did not pay for the exposure; rather, they waived the fees for the producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting. =Editing= The post-production schedule for Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule. Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. \\"In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on,\\" editor, Dana E. Glauberman said. \\"There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes ... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after.\\" Soundtrack Up in the Air: Music from the Motion Picture is the official soundtrack to the film, released by Warner Music on November 9, 2009, and composed by Rolfe Kent, who recorded his score with a 55-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. It was orchestrated by Tony Blondal. Kevin Renick wrote the song \\"Up in the Air\\" two years prior to knowing that Reitman was working on a film adaptation to the book. He had been laid off at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. \\"The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition,\\" Renick explained. \\"It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go.\\" He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at Webster University. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was given the song. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity. Release=Strategy= Anna Kendrick at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival for a panel on the film. Reitman heavily promoted Up in the Air with personal appearances at film festivals and other showings. He stated that he could relate to and enjoys the idea of Ryan Bingham's lifestyle. \\"Yesterday [October 28, 2009] I took my 10th flight in 10 days so I live that life myself and I kinda enjoy it,\\" Reitman said, \\"I think when you're in an airplane it's the last refuge for the people who enjoy being alone and reading a book.\\" Reitman documented his experiences promoting the film. He took photos of everyone who interviewed him and recorded videos in every city he visited. He edited these images into a short video titled Lost In The Air: The Jason Reitman Press Tour Simulator.

The sneak preview of Up in the Air was the highest profile hit during the Telluride film festival. The film also tied for third place in the Toronto International Film Festival Indiewire poll. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Up in the Air makes it look easy. Not just in its casual and apparently effortless excellence, but in its ability to blend entertainment and insight, comedy and poignancy, even drama and reality, things that are difficult by themselves but a whole lot harder in combination. This film does all that and never seems to break a sweat.\\" Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman agreed, rating the film an A as a \\"rare and sparkling gem of a movie, directed by Jason Reitman with the polish of a master.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the film's sense of timeliness, writing, \\"It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity ... Reitman emerges as a modern-day Frank Capra, capturing the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience.\\" Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, \\"It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films.\\" Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, \\"Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, \\"This isn't a comedy. If it were, it would be hard to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job.\\" Calling the film \\"a slickly engaging piece of lightweight existentialism,\\" Todd McCarthy wrote in Variety that \\"Clooney owns his role in the way first-rate film stars can, so infusing the character with his own persona that everything he does seems natural and right. The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis.\\" The New York Times Manohla Dargis especially appreciated the film's strong female roles, noting that \\"the ferocious Ms. Kendrick, her ponytail swinging like an ax, grabs every scene she's in,\\" but wrote that the film \\"is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama ... and the mope rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses.\\" The Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips wrote, \\"Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [It] feels tailor-made for George Clooney, who is very good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns to be a little less the man he was.\\" Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, \\"There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying.\\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, \\"Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes ... [the film] warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can.\\" Shave Magazine Jake Tomlinson gave the film four out of five stars and wrote, \\"There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments. As a moviegoer, this film provides a satisfying experience where one can take a step back to ponder some of the finer points in our daily lives, but don't expect to find all the answers here.\\" =Accolades= Up in the Air earned various awards and nominations, in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its screenplay, direction and editing, to the performance of the three primary actors – George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick.

The angle of the critical taper is a function of the material properties within the wedge, pore fluid pressure, and strength of the fault (or décollement) along the base of the wedge. In geodynamics the concept is used to explain tectonic observations in accretionary wedges. Every wedge has a certain \\"critical angle\\", which depends on its material properties and the forces at work.Chapple (1978)Davis et al. (1983) This angle is determined by the ease by which internal deformation versus slip along the basal fault (décollement) occurs. If the wedge deforms more easily internally than along the décollement, material will pile up and the wedge will reach a steeper critical taper until such a point as the high angle of the taper makes internal deformation more difficult than sliding along the base. If the basal décollement deforms more easily than the material does internally, the opposite will occur. The result of these feedbacks is the stable angle of the wedge known as the critical taper. When natural processes (such as erosion, or an increase in load on the wedge due to emplacement of a sea or ice cap) change the shape of the wedge, the wedge will react by internally deforming to return to a critically tapered wedge shape. The critical taper concept can thus explain and predict phases and styles of tectonics in wedges. An important presumption is that the internal deformation of the wedge takes place by frictional sliding or brittle fracturing and is therefore independent of temperature.Davis et al. (1983) Mechanical quantification plate) by a force \\\\sigmax. At mechanic equilibrium, the resisting force parallel to the base slope (indicated by a red arrow) will equal the pushing force. The material properties and magnitude of the forces determine the critical angle \\\\alpha + \\\\beta of the wedge. The critical taper concept assumes mechanical equilibrium, which means the compressional force (the tectonic push) that created the wedge will be equal to the resisting forces inside the wedge. =Resisting forces= These forces resisting the tectonic force are the load (weight) of the wedge itself, the eventual load of an overlying column of water and the frictional resistance at the base of the wedge (this is the shear strength at/of the base, \\\\tau_b). Mechanical equilibrium thus means: :load of wedge + load of water + \\\\\\\\!\\\\tau_b = tectonic push The first term in this formula stands for the resisting force of the load of the wedge along the base of the wedge. This force is the density of the wedge material (\\\\rho) times the gravitational acceleration (g), working on a surface with dimensions dx and dy (unit vectors). This is multiplied by the sine of the angle of the base of the wedge (\\\\beta) to get the component parallel to the base: :load of wedge = \\\\\\\\!\\\\rho g H sin\\\\beta The second term (\\\\rho_w * g * D * sin(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)) is the resisting force of the load of an eventual water column on top of the wedge. Accretionary wedges in front of subduction zones are normally covered by oceans and the weight of the seawater on top of the wedge can be significant. The load of the water column is the hydrostatic pressure of the water column, multiplied by a factor \\\\alpha + \\\\beta (the angle between the top of the wedge and the base of the wedge) to get the component parallel to the base of the wedge. The hydrostatic pressure is calculated as the product of the density of water (\\\\rho_w) and the gravitational acceleration (g): :load of water = \\\\\\\\!\\\\rho_w g D sin(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta) The third term (\\\\tau_b, the shear strength at the base of the wedge) can be given by the criterion of Mohr- Coulomb: :\\\\\\\\!\\\\tau_b = S_0 + \\\\mu(\\\\sigma_n - P_f) In which S0 is the cohesion of the material at the base, \\\\mu is a coefficient of internal friction, \\\\sigma_n is the normal stress and Pf the pore fluid pressure. These parameters determine the resistance to shear at the base. =Mechanical equilibrium= Mechanical equilibrium means the resisting forces equal the push. This can be written as: :\\\\rho g H sin\\\\beta + \\\\rho_w g D sin(\\\\alpha + \\\\beta) + \\\\tau_b = \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\int_{0}^{H}\\\\sigma_x dz The pushing force is here assumed to be working on the total height of the wedge. Therefore, it is written as the integral of the force over the wedge height, where z is the direction perpendicular to the base of the wedge and parallel to vector H.

First a trained mechanic, he acquired the Swiss federal maturity degree and pursued academic studies, while in employment. The circumstances led him to become an efficient saviour of Swiss ailing companies throughout his career  Training  Thomke first completed an apprenticeship as a mechanic at the factory of ETA SA in Grenchen Canton of Solothurn. Between 1961 and 1967, he studied natural sciences, mainly chemistry at the University of Bern and University of Lausanne. Then he pursued medical studies in Berne, while working full-time. He was promoted to doctor in 1975. He completed his education with management studies and marketing at the (INSEAD), Fontainebleau.  Professional Activities  He worked from 1970 to 1977 in research for the British pharmaceutical group Beecham, mainly at their Swiss laboratories, but also at the pharmacological institute of Gothenburg, Sweden. Imperceptibly he was taken to focus on the tasks of economic management. He was appointed head of marketing and regional marketing director in the Europe division of the group.  Return to ETA SA  In 1978, at the peak of the Swiss watch industry crisis, facing the global onslaught of Japanese watches, mainly those with Quartz, Thomke was called to the rescue of ETA SA. In order to end the prevailing destructive internal competition within the Swiss Ebauches manufacturers, Thomke was convinced that only a maximum of concentration of all those companies scattered around, could finally save the Swiss watch industry. 1978, ETA SA merged with its former rival A. Schild SA (AS). The new ETA, with 2,200 employees, introduced gradually improved new technology in the manufacturing of quartz movements and full automation throughout the production. Thomke integrated as much as possible the administrative and production areas of the other Ebauches factories since long owned by Ebauches SA. In 1982 he became CEO of Ebauches SA and was appointed on the Board of Directors of the ASUAG, the holding company of ETA SA.  SMH  On the advice of the Hayek Engineering AG of freelance consultant Nicolas G. Hayek, both big watch groups ASUAG and SSIH merged between 1983 and 1984 in the Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie (SMH), now called Swatch Group. Thomke was its first CEO, from 1984 to 1991. In this period, the company won universal major consideration for the successful integration of all the Ebauches factories into Eta SA and the regain of prestige of exclusive brands Omega, Longines, Tissot. The Microméchanique acquired the necessary top technology for the manufacture of integrated circuits and chips. In 1989, the consolidated turnover of SMH was CHF 2.1 billion. Thomke left in 1991: At that time, Hayek, as Chairman of the Board had then already become the only person of reference. Saviour of companies  Thereafter, Thomke consolidated its reputation as a corporate saviour by interventions met with success in the watch industry. He however always took several assignments simultaneously outside the watch industry: = Motor Columbus = Thus, between 1992 and 1995, as CEO of Motor Columbus, on a mandate from its majority shareholder, the Union Bank of Switzerland, now known as UBS, he transformed this eclectic group by restoring its activity in the most profitable primary energy sector, under the new name of ATEL. = Oerlikon-Bührle Holding (OBH) = In addition he was active until 1997 for the Oerlikon-Bührle Holding (OBH). As Chairman and CEO between 1991 and 1997of both * Pilatus AG-Flugzeugwerke and Stans * Bally International AG. However, after an effective restructuring and streamlining of the latter company, plans to bring it to the Stock Exchange were rejected by the holding company. This negative decision led Thomke to withdraw from any activities within either company. = Saurer AG = In 1995, he had already taken the leadership of Saurer AG in Arbon as Chairman of the Board. To restructure this conglomerate, he had previously abandoned his position with its major shareholder: BB Industrie Holding AG (22%). The previous major shareholder, Tito Tettamanti, of the conglomerate, founded in 1853, specialized in textile machinery and \\"Antriebstechnik\\", had acquired the main competitor in each field, Schlafhorst, with a large manufacturing capacity excess and Ghidela . Thomke led Saurer AG until 1996, when he retired to the direction of the Board until 1999. In his years he promulgated transparency at all levels, flexible working hours, optimized the production and refined accounting systems. In 1996, Saurer SA went back into financial results showing profits. More than half of the revenues originating from Schlafhorst, upon its positive restructuring.  Other Directorships and shareholdings  Thereafter, while remaining in the background of the Swiss economic scene, Thomke agreed to other terms as Administrator. In the medical industry sector, he invested in shares of the company BB Biotech, promoting the development of innovative medicines.

It acts as an intermediary between independent takeaway food outlets and customers. According to their website, it is headquartered in London, England and operates in 13 countries in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Founded in Kolding, Denmark, the platform enables customers to search for local takeaway restaurants, place orders and pay online, and to choose from pick-up or delivery options. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Takeaway.com in February 2020, the two companies were merged into Just Eat's parent company, Just Eat Takeaway.com, which replaced Just Eat's listing on the London Stock Exchange. History Five Danish entrepreneurs, including Jesper Buch, founded Just Eat in Denmark in 2000 and launched the service in August 2001. In 2005 the technology entrepreneur Bo Bendtsen (co-founder) bought out all the founders and initial investors apart from Jesper Buch and moved the company to the UK. Jesper Buch moved to the UK as part of the buyout in 2006 and hired Welsh executive David Buttress to join as CEO and co-founder of Just Eat UK in March. The international expansion from the UK headquarters, starting with the Netherlands, launched in July 2007 and was followed by Ireland in April 2008. In January 2011, Just Eat established a joint venture in India. In February, the Group raised £30 ($48) million from their Series B investment, enabling it to make 7 acquisitions in the next year: * 4 partnerships to launch new countries with local operators: Eat.ch in Switzerland in April, ClickEat in Italy in May, RestauranteWeb in Brazil in June and Alloresto in France in December; * 3 acquisitions to solidify its presence in the UK (Urbanbite to get into the corporate market) and Canada (YummyWeb purchased in April to cover the region of Vancouver and GrubCanada in October for the Ontario and British Columbia markets). In April 2012, Just Eat further consolidated its position in the UK by acquiring fillmybelly.com. A week later, Just Eat announced its £40 ($64) million Series C funding round. The funds were partly used to launch the Don't Cook rebranding campaign in the UK and to acquire in October its main competitor in Spain, SinDelantal. After nearly five years at the helm of Just Eat, the group CEO Klaus Nyengaard stepped down in February 2013 and was replaced in May by former UK MD, David Buttress. On 3 April 2014, Just Eat floated on the London Stock Exchange. In July, Just Eat increased to 80% its stake in Alloresto. In September, Just Eat merged its Brazilian business, RestauranteWeb, with one of its competitors, iFood, to form the joint venture IF-JE in which Just Eat had a 25% stake. In February 2015, Just Eat sold to FoodPanda its investments in their Indian JV, and continued its expansion in the Americas by launching in Mexico, via a 100% acquisition of SinDelantal, and increased its stake in IF-JE, the Brazilian JV with iFood. In May 2015, Just Eat announced that it would buy Menulog, an Australian food ordering company for $855 million Australian dollars, and would fund the deal by issuing new shares. In July 2015, Just Eat acquired Orderit.ca, a Canadian online food ordering company, further solidifying its presence in Canada. In August 2016, Just Eat sold its operations in the Benelux (The Netherlands & Belgium) to its Dutch competitor Takeaway.com for €22.5 million. In December 2016, Just Eat announced that it was acquiring hungryhouse from Delivery Hero for £200m (with the possibility of a further £40m if the company hit performance targets) and Canada's SkipTheDishes for CAD 110M (£66m). On 12 October 2017, the Competition and Markets Authority gave its preliminary approval for the deal. In February 2017, Buttress announced he would be leaving as CEO after four years, due to \\"urgent family matters\\". He continues on the company's board as a non executive director, and has since taken up a role with Newport, Wales based rugby side Dragons as their CEO. His departure was noted by industry commentators as a \\"significant loss\\" for the business, with Buttress having been \\"one of the UK's stand out entrepreneurs of the last decade\\". On 29 July 2019, it was announced that Just Eat and Takeaway.com had agreed the terms for a merger of the companies in a deal worth £9bn. On 10 January 2020, 80.4% of Just Eat shareholders approved Takeaway.com's deal to acquire Just Eat. Although Just Eat became a subsidiary of Takeaway.com on 3 February 2020, the Competition and Markets Authority ordered on 4 February 2020 that no integration should take place and that the brands should be kept separate until their investigation is completed. Just Eat partnered with McDonald's in January 2020 to deliver food in the United Kingdom, ending the monopoly which Uber Eats had previously exercised in the country. On 22 April 2020, The UK's Competition and Markets Authority announced it was unconditionally approving Just Eat's merger with Takeaway.com, following an investigation. =Ireland= Merrion Square S - Just Eat Street, Dublin, Ireland Just Eat Ireland launched in April 2008. In November, Just Eat acquired 250 restaurants from Eatcity.ie. Just Eat Ireland recently commissioned economic consultants DKM to carry out research on the Irish restaurant industry and found that nearly €1.5bn was spent on takeaway/delivered food by Irish consumers in 2015. DKM said that takeaway services currently account for 57% of restaurant sales and the sector is likely to grow by 17% in the next four years. =North America= Just Eat entered into the North American market in July 2009, bolstering its Canadian operations with the acquisition of YummyWeb (Vancouver) in April 2011, GrubCanada (Ontario) in October 2011 and OrderIt.ca in July 2015. In December 2016, Just Eat acquired SkipTheDishes for an initial, C$110 million. A further cash amount of up to C$90 million may also be payable, subject to certain financial targets being met in 2018 and 2019. Just Eat's existing Canadian operations were subsequently folded into the SkipTheDishes brand. SkipTheDishes operates a food delivery service that allows customers to order from a variety of local and national chain restaurants using the SkipTheDishes website or mobile phone app. The service is widely available across most larger centres in every province in Canada. Skip was present in a limited number of American cities including St. Louis, Omaha, Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, but exited the US market in 2019. SkipTheDishes is headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. =India= Just Eat India was founded on 26 July 2006, as HungryBangalore, by Ritesh Dwivedy. In August 2008, HungryBangalore was renamed as HungryZone. HungryZone received a first round of funding raised from the Indian Angel Network. On 17 January 2011, HungryZone announced a partnership with Just Eat. Just-Eat bought a 60% stake in HungryZone. Just Eat disposed of its shares in its India business in January 2015. Investment In July 2009 Just Eat received their first Series A investment funding. Index Ventures and Venrex Capital invested £10.5 millionIndex Ventures into Just Eat Holdings Ltd. The new investment capital enabled Just Eat to increase their expansion into other markets and further develop the business. In March 2011 a second round of investment saw two leading US venture capitalists, Greylock Partners and Redpoint Ventures invest £30 million. Greylock Partners have previously invested in Facebook, LinkedIn and Wonga. In April 2012, a third round of investment saw Vitruvian Partners and existing backers, Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Redpoint Ventures, invest a further £40 million in Just Eat Holdings Ltd. In January 2019 the company bought Flyt, the startup with software for restaurants and food suppliers. The acquisition cost £22 million. Brand In 2016, Just Eat UK rebranded (including a new logo) by tweaking their branding completely, with a vision to \\"create the world’s greatest food community\\". =TV advertisements UK= In late 2009, Just Eat UK began their first television marketing campaign. The adverts starred Just-Eat's mascots ‘Belly’ and ‘Brain’ and were narrated by Bernard Cribbins. The first two adverts entitled “Attention Please” and “Down and Up” ran throughout 2010. At the start of 2011, a second wave of ‘Belly and Brain’ TV adverts were created, entitled “Listen and Learn” and “Boxing Clever”. Following a complete overhaul of their global brand positioning and launch of the Don't Cook Just Eat brand campaign in September 2012, Just Eat launched a new series of TV ads. The adverts introduce audiences to Mr Mozzarella AKA “The Mozz”, Ms. Neilly, Mr Basmati, Mr Sweet and Mr Sour, Mr T-Bone, Mr Sashimi and Mr Halloumi – a hapless, motley crew of rebellious takeaway chefs, who will stop at nothing to prevent amateur chefs from cooking at home. The ads, including \\"Leave Cooking to Professionals\\", \\"Cooking is Dangerous\\", \\"Cookbooks,\\" \\"Turn back, Cicciolina\\" and \\"The Fridge\\" will also air. =Sponsorship= In May 2014, it was announced that Just Eat would be the primary shirt sponsor for Derby County Football Club for the 2014–15 season. The sponsorship lasted for three years until the end of the 2016–17 season. On 1 July 2015, Just Eat became the primary shirt sponsor for Oud-Heverlee Leuven for the 2015–16 season. In spite of the relegation of the team to the Belgian First Division B, Just Eat and OH Leuven announced on 19 May 2016 that they would continue their partnership, although Just Eat would no longer feature on the front but rather on the back of shirts for the 2016–17 season. Just Eat sponsored the fourteenth and fifteenth series of the UK version of the X Factor, replacing TalkTalk. Just Eat also sponsors the official Edinburgh cycle hire scheme, which was named Just Eat Cycles from its start in September 2018. Business model In the UK, Just Eat charges restaurants £699 to join the service, and for each order placed through the website or mobile app, a 13-14% commission. Over 90% of the company's revenue comes from the commissions. Although Just Eat requires restaurants to provide evidence of registration with their local council when joining the service, a 2017 audit found 35 unlicensed restaurants with no hygiene rating. In October 2018, a BBC investigation had found that half of the takeaway outlets in England rated zero for hygiene by the Food Standards Agency in Manchester, Bristol and London appeared on the Just Eat app. Markets As of July 2020, Just Eat operates in 11 countries in Europe, Australasia, North America and South America.

Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection The fountain as it appeared in 1791 when the French constitution was proclaimed on the Marché des Innocents Fontaine des Innocents today (detail) The Fontaine des Innocents is a monumental public fountain located on the place Joachim-du-Bellay in the Les Halles district in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, France. Originally called the Fountain of the Nymphs, it was constructed between 1547 and 1550 by architect Pierre Lescot and sculptor Jean Goujon in the new style of the French Renaissance. It is the oldest monumental fountain in Paris.Marion Boudon, \\"La fontaine des Innocents\\", in Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance à nos jours, see bibliography. History The fountain was commissioned as part of the decoration of the city to commemorate the solemn royal entry of King Henry II into Paris in 1549. Artists were commissioned to construct elaborate monuments, mostly temporary, along his route, from the Port Saint-Denis to the Palais de la Cité, passing by le Châtelet, the Pont Notre-Dame and the Cathedral. The fountain was placed on the site of an earlier fountain dating to the reign of Philip II of France, against the wall of the Saints Innocents Cemetery, at the corner of rue Saint Denis (where the King's procession passed) and rue aux Fers (today's rue Berger), with two façades on one street, one façade on the other. It was to serve as a fountain as well as a grand reviewing stand for local notables; it resembled the walls of a large residence, with water taps along the street at the street level, and a stairway to the loggia on the upper level, where officials stood on the balcony to greet the King. Its original name was the Fountain of the Nymphs.Carved placed on the pilasters have the inscription, 'fontium nymphis'. See Marion Boudon, \\"La fontaine des Innocents,\\" in Paris et ses fontaines, p. 53 Once the procession had passed, the structure became a simple water fountain for the neighborhood, with taps, ornamented with lion heads, permanently trickling water.Boudon, p. 54 The upper floor of the fountain was eventually turned into a residence, with windows and a chimney.See Quatremere de Quincy, op. cit. In 1787, for sanitary reasons, the cemeteries of Paris were moved outside the city walls, and the former cemetery of the Church of the Saints-Innocents, against whose wall the fountain stood, was transformed into a market square, le Marché des Innocents. The fountain was scheduled for destruction. It was saved largely by the efforts of writer Quatremère de Quincy, who wrote a letter to the Journal de Paris urging the preservation of \\"A masterpiece of French sculpture.\\"Cited by Marion Bourdon, p. 54 The fountain was moved to the middle of a large basin in the market, raised on a stone pedestal decorated with four lions and four basins. The sculptor Augustin Pajou was commissioned to create a fourth façade for the fountain, in the same style as the other three, so that it could be free-standing. Because of the poor water supply system of Paris, the fountain produced only a small flow of water. Under Napoleon Bonaparte, a new aqueduct was constructed from the River Ourcq, and finally the fountain gushed water, in such abundance that it threatened the sculptural decoration. The smaller bas-reliefs at the base of the fountain were removed in 1810 and placed in the Musée du Louvre in 1824. In 1858, during the Second French Empire of Louis Napoleon, the fountain was again moved, to its present location on a modest pedestal in the middle of the square; and six basins of pouring water, one above the other, were added on each façade.Jacques Hillairet and Pascal Payen-Appenzeller, Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris, Éditions de minuit, Paris, 1985 Architecture Pierre Lescot (1510–1578), the architect of the fountain, was responsible for introducing classical models and French Renaissance architecture into Paris. Francis I named him chief architect of the Palais du Louvre, and over the following years he transformed the building from a medieval castle into a Renaissance palace. He worked with Jean Goujon on the decoration of two façades of the Cour Carrée of the Louvre. The fountain's architecture was inspired by the nymphaeum of ancient Rome, a building or monument decorated with statuary of nymphs, tritons and other water deities, and usually used to protect a fountain or spring. Sculptural decoration In 1547, Jean Goujon (1510–1572) became the court sculptor for Henry II, and this fountain was one of his first important commissions. In the same year he made illustrations for the French translation of the book of architecture by Vitruvius, a major classical source of the architecture of the Italian Renaissance and the French Renaissance. Later he worked again with Pierre Lescot on the bas-reliefs for the Cour Carrée of the Louvre Palace. Though he was the court sculptor of Henry II, Goujon was a Protestant, and he fled to Italy during the French Wars of Religion, when Henry II began serious persecution of French Protestants. Goujon was one of the first French sculptors to draw inspiration from the sculpture of ancient Rome, particularly the bas-relief sculptures on Roman sarcophagi. The nymph and triton on one of the fountain panels (see illustration) resembled a Roman sarcophagus in Grottaferrata, which was on display when Goujon was in Rome, and which had been the subject of several 16th century artists. The Triton’s hair resembled that in an ancient statue of The River Tiber, which had been discovered in Rome in 1512. Goujon’s work on the fountain was also inspired by the Italian artists who had come to work for Francis I at the Château de Fontainebleau, Rosso Fiorentino (1495-1540) and Francesco Primaticcio (1504-1570). The nymph and sea dragon on the fountain had the same pose as the nymph of Fontainebleau, by Rosso, in the Galerie François I of the chateau, and the female forms of the nymphs, with their elongated bodies, narrow shoulders, and small, high breasts, resembled the idealized female figures of Primaticcio. Goujon’s personal contribution was a decorative swirling movement in the sculptures, with undulating drapery and curling scrolls made of sea shells and the tails of sea creatures.

The primary star HD 16760 (HIP 12638) is a G-type main sequence star similar to our Sun. The secondary, HIP 12635 is 1.521 magnitudes fainter and located at a separation of 14.6 arcseconds from the primary, corresponding to a physical separation of at least 660 AU. Announced in July 2009, HD 16760 has been confirmed to have a substellar object orbiting it. Whether or not this object is a brown dwarf or an extrasolar planet is currently not understood. Substellar companion The companion object was discovered independently by the SOPHIE extrasolar planets program and the N2K Consortium. It has a mass exceeding the lower limit required for fusion of deuterium in its interior. This criterion is sometimes used to distinguish between brown dwarfs, which lie above the limit, and planets which lie below the limit. However its orbit is nearly circular, indicating that it may have formed in the same way as planets do, from a circumstellar disc. The formation of massive planets up to 20–25 Jupiter masses has been predicted in some models of the core accretion process. The identity of this object as a brown dwarf or a massive planet was thus unclear. However, recently data analysed from direct imaging, using ground-based telescopes fitted with adaptive optics, on the companion object has revealed that it is aligned in a much more face on orbit than previously realised. Consequently, its mass has been revised upwards.

Plot In 1950s, Dr. Kevin Carlson and his girlfriend Faith are busy fixing their car in the desert outside the hamlet of Beaumont, when they spot a meteor crash behind a nearby hill. Investigating the scene, Kevin and Faith are amazed to find out that this isn't a meteor, but a flying saucer from outer space, crewed by ant-headed aliens with hostile intentions. Avoiding their laser beams, the couple flees to Beaumont, intending to notify the authorities. Once there, Dr. Carlson alerts the local sheriff, who calmly convinces him it's an army jet which crashed and lets Dr. Carlson accompany him to the crash scene, where a group of military personnel is overseeing the crash site. The sheriff introduces Dr. Carlson to the army officer in charge of this operation, an ordinarily looking fellow, except for the odd handshake method (done extending the pinky finger) which unsettles Dr. Carlson. At this point, a photo camera flash accidentally reveals that those aren't humans but aliens, making Dr. Carlson carefully withdraw to his car and drive back to Beaumont. Dr. Carlson tries to convince the local telegraphist H.G. Orson to alert the press, but Orson refuses, claiming the story is insane and that nobody would believe him. When Dr. Carlson realizes that both Orson and the owner of the local diner are aliens, due to the fact that they both have their pinky finger similarly extended, he bolts the diner and escapes the town with Faith, decided to warn the world himself. The aliens chase them with their flying saucer, and eventually tractor-beam their car to their ship. There, Kevin and Faith learn the truth: they are all aliens who are only simulating an invasion scenario. They are both reprogrammed. The story cuts to the diner from the beginning, where a young man frantically runs inside it to warn the sheriff of a meteor which crash landed nearby, only that the sheriff is now Dr. Carlson. Note The name of the town is an homage to Charles Beaumont, writer of many of the original Twilight Zone episodes. There are also other references scattered throughout the episode, such as saying the meteor was near Willoughby, which is a reference to an original Twilight Zone episode. There's another reference to a town named Matheson, for Richard Matheson, a noted science fiction author and frequent contributor to the original Twilight Zone. The term \\"Bradbury rays\\" honors sci-fi author Ray Bradbury, and a line about \\"giant ants and tarantulas\\" brings to mind the movies Them!, Tarantula and Earth vs. the Spider. Them! is referenced again in the name of the general store: Johnson's; in Them!, Gramps Johnson was an early victim of the giant ants. Other classic alien-invasion movie tropes abound: as they depart their saucer, the aliens are carrying large seed pods, an obvious reference to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. As the couple enter the diner, the sign reads \\"It's been a pleasure...serving you,\\" a reference to the classic Twilight Zone episode \\"To Serve Man.\\" When in human form, their inability to bend their pinky finger is reminiscent of the 1960s television series The Invaders. Even the character of the astronomer Dr. Carlson could be taken to refer to the astronomer John Putnam played by Richard Carlson in It Came from Outer Space (who also witnessed a UFO crash-landing in the desert). The character H.G. Orson is a reference to H.G. Wells and Orson Welles, who wrote the novel and created the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds, respectively. The part is played by Jeff Morrow who starred in This Island Earth; this was Morrow's final acting role.

While the terms of the capitulation were unfavourable for the Duchy of Pomerania already, occupation became even more burdensome when the occupation force did not adhere to the restrictions outlined in Franzburg.Langer (2003), pp.403-404 Stralsund resisted with Danish, Swedish and Scottish support, another Danish intervention failed. Imperial occupation lasted until Swedish forces invaded in 1630, and subsequently cleared all of the Duchy of Pomerania of imperial forces until 1631.Langer (2003), p.406 Franzburg, Western Pomerania, in 1618 Background Location of the Duchy of Pomerania (\\"Pommern\\") within the Upper Saxon Circle (rose) of the Holy Roman Empire (white) The Duchy of Pomerania adopted Protestantism in 1534.Theologische Realenzyklopädie II (1993), p.44 With the Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618, the Thirty Years' War started as a primarily Catholic-Protestant conflict between Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and the Catholic League on the one side and Protestant nobility and states on the other. Pomerania was a member of the internally divided Protestant Upper Saxon Circle,Nicklas (2002), p.214 that most prominently included the electorates of Saxony and Brandenburg, and had declared neutrality in 1620.Nicklas (2002), p.205 Facing a victorious Catholic League, the Saxon electorate switched to the emperor's side in 1624, while Brandenburg and Pomerania kept resisting imperial demands.Nicklas (2002), p.220 Aware of the League's military superiority however, they refused an alliance offered by Protestant Denmark.Nicklas (2002), p.222 In 1625, imperial forces led by Albrecht von Wallenstein occupied the Lower Saxon prince-bishoprics of Magdeburg and Halberstadt, thereby also occupying and looting the Upper Saxon counties of Honstein and Wernigerode. Wallenstein's army had been raised to support the League's forces commanded by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly.Kohler (2002), p.99 As a countermeasure, Danish forces led by Ernst von Mansfeld occupied the Brandenburgian regions Altmark and Prignitz southwest of Pomerania also in 1625, but were defeated by the Imperial troops in the Battle of Dessau Bridge in 1626. Except for The Electorate of Saxony, which was treated by Wallenstein as a de facto member of the Catholic League, the Upper Saxon states, bare of sufficient military means for self-defence, were subsequently occupied and devastated by the imperial forces after Denmark had been neutralized. Formally, the circle maintained neutrality.Nicklas (2002), p.226 In November 1626, the Swedish Empire recruited troops in Pomerania even though the duke had disapproved.Heitz (1995), p.217 In February 1627, Swedish troops crossed the duchy for Poland, an imperial ally Sweden was at war with. In July, imperial troops crossed into the duchy near Pyritz (now Pyrzyce).Heitz (1995), p.218 To prevent the pending occupation, duke Bogislaw XIV offered 60,000 Talers in October, later raised to 200,000 Talers. Unimpressed Albrecht von Wallenstein instead ordered Hans-Georg von Arnim to occupy all Pomeranian ports and to confiscate all vessels. The occupation of Pomerania was a strategical measure rather than punishment for prior disobedience. It was implemented to secure the southern coastline of the Baltic Sea for the empire against Christian IV of Denmark, whose land forces were operating on imperial soil until the Treaty of Lübeck in 1629, and whose naval dominance in the Baltic Sea the empire was unable to challenge. Provisions Hans Georg von Arnim, signed for the empire The treaty ruled on the conditions of the billeting (\\"hospitatio\\") of the Imperial troops. Sources vary on whether Bogislaw XIV obliged himself to the intake of eightKrüger (2006), p.171Porada (1997), p.23Langer (1998), pp.293-299 or tenHinz (1994), p.15 regiments (approximately 24,000 soldiers). According to Herbert Langer, twenty multi- ethnic regiments with a total of 31,000 infantry and 7,540 cavalry were actually counted. To this number added military staff and civilian baggage of unknown number. In general, all towns and villages were required to quarter the troops, exempted were specified domains of the House of Pomerania, estates of knights, houses of clergy, councillors and academics, as well as the ducal residences Damm (now Szczecin-Dąbie), Köslin (now Koszalin), Stettin (now Szczecin) and Wolgast. The capitulation also included restrictions on the army, in particular it forbade among others the interference with trade, traffic and crafts; holdups and robberies which would harm towns, burghers, peasants or travellers; looting and extortion; rape of decent women;The German original reads \\"Verbot von Notzucht und Schändung 'redlicher Weibsbilder'\\". Langer (2003), p.404 quartering of soldiers' families and servants; and frivolous use of arms.Langer (2003), p.404 Contributions, which were to pay to the imperial forces by the duchy, were fixed at a weekly 407 Reichstalers per company and an additional 2,580 Reichstalers per respective staff. Implementation and consequences Albrecht von Wallenstein The towns of Anklam, Demmin, Greifswald and Kolberg (now Kolobrzeg) were made seats of a garrison each, while in other towns, smaller units took quarter.Langer (2003), p.403 Cavalry was stationed primarily in villages due to both the easier handling of the horses and the lower proportion of desertion compared to infantry. Although not ruled out verbatim in the capitulation's text, the conditions of quartering in Pomerania followed established practice: House and estate owners were to provide the soldier with bed, vinegar and salt, and also share kitchen and heatable living room at no cost. In theory, food had to be paid for; the soldiers were to either compensate their hosts or buy their victuals in special depots set up by the military. Wallenstein had promised Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor to fund his army himself.Beier (1997), p.151 In practice, this meant that the army was fed and paid by contributions of the occupied territories and war loot. Since the higher ranks often kept the already small fraction of war loot and contributions thought to pay the lower ranks for themselves, the soldiers satisfied their needs at the expense of the local population instead (bellum se ipsum alet). In addition to noncompliance with the capitulation's provisions by the military, hardship resulted from more frequent epidemics caused by the quartering, and by shrinking natural resources. By 7 May 1628, Pomerania had already paid 466,981 Reichstaler as contributions – twice as much as the whole Upper Saxon Circle’s annual output. Suffering in Pomerania was \\"undescribable and became proverbial\\".Nicklas (2002), p.229 John George I, Elector of Saxony, who still perceived the Upper Saxon Circle his sphere of influence and anticipated imperial occupation of his thitherto spared electorate, sharply criticized Wallenstein’s practices, yet without result. Alexander Leslie Stralsund was the only town in the Duchy of Pomerania to resist imperial occupation, resulting in the Battle of Stralsund.Theologische Realenzyklopädie II (1993), p.45 Unwilling to surrender the considerable independence it had long enjoyed as a Hanseatic town, Stralsund ignored the duke's order to adhere to the capitulation, instead turned to Denmark and Sweden for support and was aided in her defense by both.Press (1991), pp.212-213 Christian IV of Denmark deployed a Scottish force raised by Donald Mackay, and the Scots Alexander Seaton and Alexander Leslie were in charge of the defense when the former colonel, Holke, retired to seek reinforcements.Mackillop (2003), p.16Scotsman Seaton, in command of the Scottish-Danish forces, was relieved by Leslie, future Earl of Leven, a Scot in Swedish service. Salmon (2003), p.32 Wallenstein laid siege to the town, and in July 1628 commanded several unsuccessful assaults in person.Heckel (1983), p.143 When Stralsund turned out to become his first serious misfortune in the war, he lifted the siege to win a last battle against Christian IV near Wolgast. Christian IV, who had already destroyed Wallenstein's naval facilities in Greifswald,Lockhart (2007), p.169 had intended to secure another Pomeranian port besides Stralsund there, but was utterly defeated and retreated to Denmark.Guthrie (2002), p.143 Stralsund however signed an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, providing him with a bridgehead on imperial territory manned with a Swedish expeditionary force and thus ultimately marking the Swedish entrance into the Thirty Years' War. In February 1629, Bogislaw XIV pledged to ease the occupation, and though Ferdinand II re-assured the duke, he took no action.Heitz (1995), p.219 Instead the imperial Edict of Restitution of March advertised the re- Catholization of the empire’s Protestant states. The Treaty of Lübeck, which ended the hostilities between the Danish king and the emperor in May, likewise did not result in a relief or a lift of the occupation, even though the capitulation of Franzburg had been justified with the emperor's right to recruit military support from his subjects to their own and the empire's protection. After France had mediated a truce between the Swedish Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in September 1629, Sweden was ready for an invasion of the Holy Roman Empire. The invasion was started when Gustavus Adolphus' troops landed on Usedom island in the spring of 1630, while simultaneous assaults on Rügen and the adjacent mainland by the Stralsund garrison cleared his flank.Langer (2003), p.401 As a consequence, the capitulation of Franzburg was replaced by a Pomeranian-Swedish alliance confirmed in the Treaty of Stettin.Buchholz (1999), p.233 Legacy Gustavus Adolphus, memorial plaque at the Greifswald cathedral (Swedish Pomerania until 1815) The capitulation of Franzburg marked the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in the Duchy of Pomerania. The severe plight the capitulation inflicted on the people only foreshadowed the utter devastation of the duchy by the end of the war, when two thirds of the population were left dead.Buchholz (1999), pp.263,332 The successful resistance of Stralsund to the terms of the capitulation granted the Swedish Empire a foothold in the Holy Roman Empire - especially after Denmark withdrew her forces following the Treaty of Lübeck. The Swedish garrison in Stralsund was the first on German soil in history. A Riksdag commission had approved of Gustavus Adolphus' plans to intervene on the empire's soil already in the winter of 1627/28, and in January 1629, the Riksråd approved of an offensive war, put into effect in the following year.Theologische Realenzyklopädie I (1993), p.172 Swedish forces invaded Pomerania in 1630 and by 16 June 1631 had cleared the last imperial stronghold, Greifswald.Langer (2003), p.406 With short war-caused interruptions, Sweden kept her continental foothold in what became known as Swedish Pomerania until the Congress of Vienna of 1815. Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania, who had just part by part inherited the previously internally partitioned duchy to become her sole ruler in 1625,Hildisch (1980), p.97 issued a paper called Dreijährige Drangsal (\\"three years of distress\\") after the Swedish take-over, which read that the capitulation in Franzburg had been forced upon him by the military. At the same time, he wrote a letter to the Holy Roman Emperor apologizing for the Swedish alliance, saying he had no choice but to obey Swedish demands, and included a passage in the Treaty of Stettin stating the alliance be for the empire's best.Sturdy (2002), p.59 Bogislaw did not survive the war: He died without issue in 1637, terminating some 500 years of rulership of the House of Pomerania.Dubilski (2003), p.25 The town of Franzburg, where the capitulation was signed, fell victim to the war, too: It was devastated completely. In 1670, a mere 70 people lived in the town. Only in 1728 was Franzburg resettled.

The first issue of Land Values announced that: > \\"though the name is changed to suit the requirements of the present > political situation - a situation the paper has done its best to create - we > leave our readers to judge whether we swerve from the principle and policy > hitherto advocated, namely, that the value of the land is the reflex of the > presence and industry of the whole people, and that it should be taken in > taxation for public purposes\\".Land Values, vol. IX, no. 97, Glasgow, June > 1902, p. 1 The paper inherited its one and only editor, John Paul, from its predecessor publication, in turn passing him on to its successor. Until 1904, Paul and his associate Fred Verinder had responsibility for publication, after which responsibility passed to Paul alone. In that same year the paper’s proprietor, the Scottish Single Tax League, passed its ownership over to the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values (both organisations Glasgow-based). The SLTLV in turn, in 1907 - signalling the publication's move to London - handed proprietorship over to the United Committee for the Taxation of Land Values. In its seventeen years of publication, ninety-six issues of the periodical appeared (nos. 97 to 300, in twelve volumes, vols. IX to XX (part)). In 1919 (its twenty-fifth year from launch of The Single Tax) the publication changed its name to Land&Liberty; (incorporating Land Values) - with the suffix dropped in January 1924 - the new title to \\"bring it more into line with the new forces and aspirations making for social justice and freedom.

While delivered during the Thatcher era, it was commissioned by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. The report viewed Universities as enterprises not unlike a factory, and in which students were the customer. Concomitantly, academics were viewed less as a self-governing group seeking to expand knowledge and more as shop-floor deliverers of education, subject to performance indicators. Organizational-functions, similarly, were viewed as need dedicated managers, with transfer of these roles from academics to these managers. The adoption of the report led to the abolition of academic tenure. It has been argued that the report thus laid the ground for the increase of managerialism in the academy.

Adams House, is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Prairie School home that was constructed in Highland Park, Illinois. The Adams House is a two-story home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms with a light stucco exterior and wooden trim that emphasizes the horizontal. The National Park Service recognized the house with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on September 29, 1982 as part of the Highland Park Multiple Resource Area. The Highland Park Historic Preservation Commissionhttps://www.cityhpil.com/government/boards_and_commissions/historic_preservation_commission/index.php named it a local landmark in 2011. The current owners received the Highland Park 2012 Historic Preservation Award for Restoration. History Widowed Mary W. Adams, who was a teacher in the Christian Science movement, hired architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design her a house in 1905. Adams was 73 years old, making her Wright's oldest client.http://www.eiflerassociates.com/Mary%20Adams.htm Disciples of the Christian Science movement wanted to be seen as innovative, therefore Mrs. Adams chose an innovative architect, 38-year-old Wright. Wright submitted an initial plan which had porches at the extremities, but Adams rejected it as too costly. Adams approved of a second draft, which removed the south porch and made the dining room an open view and the house reflects this design.http://www.eiflerassociates.com/Mary%20Adams.htm An interesting feature of the building is its diagnol corner 'buttresses' which are not structural, but serve to dramatically emphasize the extension of the roof. The exterior is stucco with cypress wood trim and the interior wood is southern yellow pine with quarter-sawn white oak floors. The original tan Roman brick fireplace has been restored. Wright designed a small storage building for the house which has also been restored. The house had rooms for a maid and servant. It was designed with a call system so that Adams could request help from anywhere in the house, even the porch. (Storrer, 108) The building sits on a corner lot, four houses from Lake Michigan. It is reminiscent of what would become Wright's A Fireproof House for $5000 design. Adams lived in the house for only three years before her death and is buried with her husband in Lowell, Massachusetts.http://www.triblocal.com/highland-park- highwood/2011/02/16/highland-park-names-frank-lloyd-wright-home-as-a-local- landmark/ The house was listed as a short sale in the 2000s and its fate was uncertain.

Life He was son of John Hall, vicar of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, and Anne his wife, and was born at his father's vicarage on 29 January 1633. His extended family held presbyterian views; an uncle, Thomas Hall, was an ejected minister in 1662. His brother-in-law, John Spilsbury, held the vicarage of Bromsgrove under the Commonwealth, and also was ejected; his nephew John Spilsbury, a dissenting minister at Kidderminster, became his heir. John Hall was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in June 1644, and went on to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was under the tuition of another uncle, Edmund Hall. Hall became a scholar of Pembroke in 1650, and graduated B. A. in 1651, and M.A. in 1653, when he was also elected fellow.

It originally aired on CBS on November 20, 1996.  Plot  Fourteen-year-old high school student Amy Dustin becomes an object of romantic affection to Pete Nash, the school's biology teacher and football coach. They take a sudden interest in each other, and begin sending each other notes and talking on the telephone. Although Pete has a family, the two begin a secret relationship. People then begin to suspect that Pete and Amy are having an affair. It is revealed that another reason for the students' gossip is that Pete had trouble in the past concerning an affair with student Missy Ross the previous year, and student Donna Barns the year before that. He denies these allegations when Amy confronts him about the rumors. One night she spends the night at Pete's house because Pete convinced his daughter, Cassie, to invite Amy to a sleepover. During the middle of the night, Pete wakes Amy up and then convinces her to sleep with him. This upsets her but she still feels that she is in love with him. Meanwhile, Kimberly Jones, one of her best friends, worries about their relationship, thinking it isn't healthy. She reports it to the principal who dismisses her allegations because the principal thinks that Kimberly is telling falsehoods because she is jealous of her friend. Amy is constantly being pursued at school by Pete, who often takes her to a closet in the classroom in order to kiss her. She doesn't like what he is doing and starts spending time with student Cory Wilkins. One night, she accompanies Cory to the local Founders Day Festival and dances with him. Pete observes her behavior and is infuriated. In front of a crowd of people, he drags Amy away from Cory. Although his actions attract the attention of all the people at the party, no one intervenes. Amy then tries to break off their affair because she is uncomfortable with the manner in which things are moving, but Pete is able to win back her trust. The next day, her father is informed about what happened at the party. Norm confronts him, but Pete convinces him that he was only acting in Amy's best interests because Cory has a bad reputation. Norm is placated somewhat. While on a camping trip, Amy's friend Kelly catches Pete and Amy kissing. Upon confronting her, Amy tells her about her relationship with her teacher and states that she is in love with Pete. Things become even more difficult and uncomfortable for Amy when her mother, Betty Ann, finds a love letter to her daughter from Pete. She immediately reports it to the high school principal. Matters are complicated because Amy and Pete both deny an affair. For this reason, the principal is unable to do anything about it. When Amy decides to break off the affair, Pete will not leave her alone and his actions become even more irrational and possessive than they were before. Amy then admits everything to her parents and Pete is arrested. He receives a jail sentence of five months at the local state detention center as well as a 10-year period of probation. Betty Ann decides to sue the school as well, because the school failed to act in spite of convincing evidence that supported the fact that an affair between a teacher and a student took place. Instead of the students showing sympathy towards Amy, they act hostile towards her because Coach Nash was suspended from his job before an important football game. The fact that her friends think that she was just as much to blame as Pete increases Amy's feelings of rejection and isolation. When the Dustin house is vandalized, Amy considers dropping the case because she feels that the trouble she and her family have had to endure is not worth it. In the end, she changes her mind and decides to go through with it. She is motivated by her strong feelings that she does not want someone else to experience what she endured.

The development consists of 60 L-shaped houses based upon the design of traditional Danish farmhouses with central courtyards and those of Chinese and Islamic dwellings.John Pardey: \\"Poetry from materials – Jørn Utzon’s brickwork beginnings\\" in Brick Bulletin, Spring 2009 . Retrieved 24 September 2011. History The design of the Kingo Houses was based on a competition project Utzon had developed for the south of Sweden in 1953. Although he did not obtain a commission in Sweden, the mayor of Helsingør liked his idea and provided land for Utzon to realize his project.\\"Jørn Utzon, 2003 laureate, Biography\\" , PritzkerPrize.com. Retrieved 25 September 2011. Named after the developer Boligselskabet Kingo, the housing is currently known as Romerhusene (English: Roman houses).Romerhusene, , Retrieved 17 September 2011. Design The development is based on Utzon's additive approach, starting modestly with one unit and proceeding from there, taking into account the lie of the land and the surroundings. Utzon described the arrangement of the houses as \\"flowers on the branch of a cherry tree, each turning towards the sun.\\" Each unit has an area of , enclosed on two sides by the L-shaped house, and by walls on the other two sides. The small size of the units makes them not only economical but also easily adaptable to the natural terrain. The limited size of the private area is compensated by the provision of a large landscaped communal space.Møller, Henrik Sten and Udsen, Vibe: Jørn Utzon Houses, Living Architecture Publishing, Copenhagen, Each house has a courtyard with two wings, one for living, the other for sleeping. Utzon set the exact amount of bricks to be used for the courtyard walls but he told the bricklayers they should build each house individually, catering for privacy, shade, view and enclosure. Built with state funding, the houses were limited to per three-bed unit. Influence Utzon drew inspiration for the Kingo Houses from traditional Nordic architectural sensibilities. The design of the dwellings were predicated on traditional Danish vernacular farmhouses. Furthermore, their design formed a prototype for Utzon's second courtyard housing project, the Fredensborg Houses, one of the most perfect 20th century brick-built housing developments. They have been called the finest Scandinavian example of humane housing.Adrian Carter, \\"Between Earth and Sky: The work of Jørn Utzon, as an exemplary phenomenological approach to modern architecture made concrete\\".

The song was considered sufficiently similar to \\"32 Miles out of Waycross\\" by Hoagy Lands (also recorded as \\"Mojo Mama\\" by both Wilson Pickett and Don Varner), written by Bert Berns and Jerry Wexler, that Berns and Wexler were eventually given co- writing credits. Essentially the same theme also appeared in late 1959 in the approaching miles section of the lyrics of Jimmie Rodgers' \\"Tucumcari\\". It was Starr's first success following his move from Ric-Tic Records to Motown (as Motown bought out Ric-Tic and all its artists). The song was a huge hit in the US, making the Top Ten on both the Pop Charts (#6) and R&B; Charts (#6). It was also a hit in the UK, reaching the Top 40 and peaking at #36. \\"Twenty-Five Miles\\" proved to be Starr's biggest US hit after his signature song (and #1 smash) \\"War\\". His pair of 1979 disco singles would later outdo the song's performance on the UK Charts, as \\"Contact\\" and \\"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\\" were both UK Top Ten hits. Starr's version was popular on the UK's Northern soul scene. In 1989, Edwin was seen on stage in an appearance of The Cookie Crew's mimed performance on Top Of The Pops - the BBC chart show in the UK, Edwin also miming repeatedly to the lyric 'I Got To Keep On' which was sampled from 'Twenty Five Miles' in the #17 hit 'Got To Keep On' of April that year. In popular culture A shortened remix of this version was used as the theme song for NFL Network's coverage of the 2011 NFL scouting combine. The song was used by Visa in their 2016 global Olympic campaign film. The song also shares strong similarities to the theme song for As it Happens Curried Soul by Moe Koffman Edwin Starr's version appeared in the 1987 film Adventures in BabysittingSoundtrack listing for the film and in the 2016 Visa Commercial \\"Carpool - Road to Rio with Team USA Athletes\\". The song was featured playing after the opening scene of Bad Times at the El Royale, when it transitions to 1969. Michael Jackson version The Jackson 5 recorded a cover version of \\"Twenty-Five Miles\\" in 1969, but it was not heard until its inclusion on the Motown compilation album, The Original Soul of Michael Jackson, in 1987, with Michael Jackson being given sole performer credit for the track. It was not the original recording, however, as it included drum machine overdubs; the original featured a hard-driving drum track by Uriel Jones, one of the Funk Brothers. Jackson's version of \\"Twenty-Five Miles\\" was released as a single in the US to promote The Original Soul of Michael Jackson. The single was backed by the song \\"Up on the Housetop\\". The original recording of the song was included on the 2009 set, Hello World: The Motown Solo Collection. Cover In 1969 Patrick Samson realized a cover in Italian language titled Basta (That's enough) for his album Crimson and clover (Soli si muore) (Carosello Records, PLP 325) published in Italy and Canada.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 1,401. History In 1826, Ugolnaya Bay (lit. coal bay), upon which Beringovsky stands, was first entered by the Russian sloop Senyavin commanded by Fyodor Litke on a mission to map and explore the coast of the Bering Sea.Fute, p. 96 In 1886, an expedition led by Captain A. A. Ostolopov on the clipper Strelok discovered thick layers of coal here. This coal was later used to power the visiting vessels and is the reason why the bay is so named. Geological studies for industrial development of this field began in 1933–1934 by the All-Union Arctic Institute, followed by and exploratory expedition by the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route (Glavsevmorput). Following the discovery of coal, the first settlement was established here to serve the new Bukhtugol mine. In April 1957, Beringovsky District was created within Chukotka National Okrug with the administrative center in the settlement of Ugolny. Due to the establishment of Beringovsky District, Ugolny was renamed Beringovsky in 1966. In 1975, the settlement was moved to a place called Nagorny, which was then renamed Beringovsky to provide continuity for the administrative center. In the late 1990s, Beringovsky had a population of around 3,000 when all heating, water and electricity failed, creating an extremely serious situation in such a remote location. This problem was then further exacerbated by then-Governor Nazarov banning all outside reporters and researchers, both from Moscow and abroad from visiting the area as well as censoring outgoing mail and telegrams from the community.Thompson, Administrative Resettlement and the Pursuit of Economy: The Case of Chukotka, p. 281 Following this incident, sources report that by 2002, under a program of resettlement designed by Roman Abramovich and run by Regionstroy—a private company established by the Okrug administration—nearly the whole of the population of Beringovsky had been resettled by late 2002.Thompson, Migration and Resettlement in Chukotka: A Research Note, pp. 73–81 However, this does not seem to tally with the official census results for 2002. Thompson estimates the population of Beringovsky in the late 1990s as being around 3,000; however, 2002 Census results give a population of just under 2,000. Further confusion is added as Thompson specifically refers to Beringovsky as being \\"in the process of official liquidation\\". However, to date Beringovsky has neither been liquidated nor is it in the process of liquidation and is included in all the relevant legal documentation as an extant settlement on both municipalLaw #148-OZ and administrativeDirective #517-rp levels. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Beringovsky is directly subordinated to Anadyrsky District. As a municipal division, the urban-type settlement of Beringovsky is incorporated within Anadyrsky Municipal District as Beringovsky Urban Settlement. Economy The economy of the settlement has traditionally been dominated by coal mining and the majority of the current residents are involved either in the mining itself or the administrative side of the mining business. As a result of this, the indigenous proportion of the population is comparatively low compared to other settlements in the autonomous okrug, numbering around 350 as of 2006. =Transportation= Beringovsky has got the . There is a sea port at Beringovsky, mainly used for the coal mined. Beringovsky is not connected to any other inhabited locality by permanent roads.

The Bering dialect of the Aleut language is not directly connected with this settlement, though both the dialect's and the settlement's name are derived from Vitus Bering.

Components Squadrons of the 47th Operations Group (Tail Code: XL) are: * 47th Operations Support Squadron * 434th Fighter Training Squadron, T-6 Texan II, Red Tail Stripe, \\"Red Devils\\" * 85th Flying Training Squadron, T-6 Texan II, Yellow Tail Stripe, \\"Tigers\\" * 86th Flying Training Squadron, T-1 Jayhawk, Black Tail Stripe, \\"Rio Lobos\\" * 87th Flying Training Squadron, T-38 Talon, \\"Red Bulls\\" * 96th Flying Training Squadron, T-1A, T-6, T-38 (AFRES) History : See 47th Flying Training Wing for additional history and lineage information =World War II= 125px Douglas A-26C Invader (Later B-26C) flown by the 47th Bomb Group from early 1945 into the postwar era, before being replaced by the B-45 in 1948 Constituted as 47th Bombardment Group (Light) on 20 November 1940, and activated on 15 January 1941. Operational squadrons of the group were: * 84th Bombardment Squadron 1941–1949 * 85th Bombardment Squadron 1941–1949 * 86th Bombardment Squadron 1941–1949 * 97th Bombardment Squadron 1941–1946 Initially based at McChord Field, Washington, the group's mission was to perform anti-submarine patrols along the Pacific coast with the Douglas B-18 Bolo its primary aircraft. This was a short-lived mission, however, as after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the group began training for duty overseas when it was assigned Douglas A-20Cs which were taken over by the USAAF from Lend-Lease contracts. Training at several bases in the midwest and southeast, it was first believed that the 47th would be sent to the South Pacific. However shortly after Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942, the 47th became the first USAAF A-20 group to participate in large-scale combat in the North African Campaign, being assigned to Twelfth Air Force. Flying to a former Vichy French Air Force base at Mediouni, French Morocco. the aircrews used ferry tanks on their A-20s to cross the North Atlantic. The group began operations by flying low-level missions against the enemy in North Africa flying its first combat mission from Youks-les-Bains, Algeria on 13 December 1942. 47th Group A-20s provided valuable tactical support to US and British ground forces, especially during and after the allied defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Though undermanned and undersupplied, the group flew eleven missions on 22 February to attack the advancing Nazi armored columns and thus to help stop the enemy's offensive-an action which helped save the day, and eventually the Germans were forced back into a small perimeter in Tunisia. For these actions, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. The 47th remained active in combat during March and April 1943 while training for medium level bombardment. In 1943 the group was upgraded to the A-20G, which increased their forward firepower during low-level strafing missions. Moving to Malta, the group participated in the reduction of Pantelleria and Lampedusa (Operation Corkscrew) in June 1943 and the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) in July. The group also bombed German evacuation beaches near Messina in August. The group supported the British Eighth Army during the invasion of Italy in September. Moving to Italy as part of the Italian Campaign, the group assisted the Allied advance toward Rome, September 1943 – June 1944 at the battles of the Bernhardt Line, Monte Cassino, and Operation Shingle. The 47th began flying numerous night intruder missions after June 1944, and supported the invasion of Southern France from bases in Corsica and also in France during August–September 1944. Returning to Italy, the group attacked German communications in northern Italy, 1 September – 4 April 1945. Received a second DUC for performance from to 21–24 April 1945 when, in bad weather and over rugged terrain, the group maintained operations for 60 consecutive hours, destroying enemy transportation in the Po Valley to prevent the organized withdrawal of German forces. After January 1945, the 47th received some new Douglas A-26Cs which flew alongside its A-20s during the last four months of the war for specialized night attacks. The group flew support and interdictory operations attacking such targets as tanks, convoys, bivouac areas, troop concentrations, supply dumps, roads, pontoon bridges, rail lines, and airfields. The A-26 was regarded as being the USAAF's best twin-engined bomber, and plans were being made for the conversion of the 47th to the type. The 47th Bombardment Group returned to the United States in July 1945 and was reassigned to Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina. Its mission was to prepare for redeployment to the Pacific Theater for night pathfinder operations against Japan. Its black-painted A-26Cs were equipped with radar however the surrender by Japan in August 1945, cancelled all redeployment plans. =Postwar era= 125px With the closing of Seymour Johnson in August 1945, the group was reassigned to Lake Charles Army Air Field, Louisiana and was equipped with the Douglas A-26 Invader.Renamed B-26 in June 1948 The A-26 was selected as the standard light bomber and night reconnaissance aircraft of the postwar USAAF, primarily as the main offensive light bomber of the Tactical Air Command which was created in 1946 out of the remnants of the wartime 9th and 12th Air Forces. At Lake Charles, the unit trained in night tactical operations, conducted firepower demonstrations, and participated in tactical exercises. The group was moved Biggs Field, Texas in October 1946 when Lake Charles became a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base. At Biggs, the Group was reduced from four to three tactical squadrons when the 97th Bombardment Squadron was inactivated. In August 1947, as the Air Force reorganized under the wing base organization, which placed tactical and support organizations on a base under a single wing commander, the group was reassigned to the 47th Bombardment Wing. On 1 February 1948, Biggs was also turned over to SAC, forcing a relocation of the group to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana in November. In the fall of 1948 North American B-45 Tornado bombers began to be delivered to the group, which became the first in the Air Force to fly the aircraft. The 47th was inactivated at Barksdale 2 October 1949 as a result of budgetary reductions. However the 84th and 85th Squadrons continued with the B-45's and moved to Langley AFB, Virginia where they were attached to the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. =Cold War= RB-45C 48-022, 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron On 12 March 1951, the 47th Bombardment Group was reactivated at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, with tactical squadrons the 84th and 85th. The group was the only Jet-Medium Bomber Group in the Air Force. After becoming proficient in the handling and use of nuclear weapons, moved to RAF Sculthorpe, United Kingdom where it began operations there on 1 June 1952. For nearly three years, the 47th Bombardment Group provided an in-place Atomic Air Strike Force to back up NATO Ground Forces in Europe. Operational missions of the group were training for tactical bombardment training operations, including participation in exercises and firepower demonstrations in support of NATO. Owing to the small size of Sculthorpe, the group operated two B-45A jet bomber squadrons (84th and 85th) from Sculthorpe. In March 1954, a third B-45A jet bomber squadron (86th) was assigned to the wing, but operated from RAF Alconbury in order to accommodate the additional aircraft. A few months after moving to England that year, the group ceased operations and remained a paper organization until inactivation again in 1955 as a result of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization. =Modern era= The group was reactivated on 9 December 1991 as the 47th Operations Group and assigned to the 47th Flying Training Wing as part of the \\"Objective Wing\\" concept adapted by the Air Force. The 47th OG was bestowed the lineage, honors and history of the 47th Bombardment Group and its predecessor units. The 47OG was assigned the flying components of the wing, and since its reactivation has USAF and Allied pilots using various types of trainer aircraft.

Thus the expeditor makes sure that the required goods arrive at the appointed date in the agreed quality at the agreed location. Purpose Expediting is especially needed in large scale projects, for example, in shipbuilding or when a refinery is being erected, because a delay caused by late delivery or inferior quality will increase expense and could lead to unsatisfied clients, thus the loss of a project or reputational damage. To save these unnecessary costs and minimize potential risks, the supplier and customer may agree on the use of a third party expeditor. These are experts from companies specializing in this field who keep track of the deadlines, supervise progress on site and check whether the components are properly packed.Expediting for industrial projects. Retrieved on Sep. 18, 2012. After inspection they notify the involved parties and banks about their findings; if everything is as agreed the bank will initiate the transfer of the price of the goods to the supplier. In this way, the supplier secures his liquidity as he is paid immediately when the components leave his factory (letter of credit) and the customer/bank knows that the goods will be delivered correctly. Expediting is relevant for many industries, such as the oil and gas industry, the general energy industry and the infrastructure industry. Expediting exists in several levels: * Production control: The expeditor inspects the factory whether the production is up to the standards of the country the goods are destined for. This is especially necessary for food or engineering equipment like power plant components. He or she controls as well whether the regular audits for ISO 9001 etc. have been made. * Quality control: The components are tested whether they function as required and whether they are made to the measurements and standards of the customer. A part of this quality control can be the testing for compliance with standards of the destination country, e.g. ASME. * Packing/transport survey: This is the lowest and most used level of expediting, as the goods are only counted and the packing is controlled whether it will withstand the adversities of transport (pre-shipment inspection). * Project management: At a large-scale project, not only goods are controlled. The expeditor also keeps an eye on the deadlines and milestones of the project and whether the supplier will be on time. This way he or she monitors the crucial procurement parts of the project. As the different levels of expediting require different skills, specialists and laboratories, many third party expeditors specialize in only one or several of these levels, while few offer expediting services on all levels. Larger companies normally have their own expeditors who can perform all four levels. Third parties then are only used when in-house capacity is overstretched or a neutral third party is needed. Most of the time companies use third party inspector expeditors who are responsible for inspection of critical items as well as expediting. In strict quality control conditions, those quality inspector expeditors will give importance to quality work, rather than to expediting work, which may not be a useful technique to get expediting work completed. Field expediting Field expediting provides clients with a comprehensive review of the precise standing of their order and any on site action to rectify any potential problem areas. Field expediting means the inspection and control of the expeditor on site. This gives clients a comprehensive review of the exact current status of their order and an educated projection of the future planning and status. Furthermore, while being on site, experts for expediting can identify possible problems and bottlenecks that could lead to potential delays. Desk expediting Desk expediting is also known as telephone expediting. It is an important tool for producing companies to monitor order progress with manufacturers. Especially at milestone of a project, desk expediting can be helpful to check whether the project is still within the agreed schedule. Although desk expediting is a quick and easy way to be informed about the current status of a project, it should always be conducted in combination with field expediting to securely verify the actual status.Desk expediting Telephone expediting Desk/Phone expediting provides a valuable tool for monitoring the progress of orders with a manufacturer. Contact is established at specific milestones within the order fabrication method and a brief outline of status standing obtained throughout the following conversation. associate experienced expeditor will very quickly assess whether the order is progressing consistent with plan or whether alternative measures are needed to verify and presumably improve the order progress. desk / phone expediting is best used as a tool to supplement field expediting. it's additionally a helpful approach of making the vendor aware that delays on the order won't be accepted by their shopper.

Background Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck was appointed the military commander of the German colonial forces known as the Schutztruppe protection force in German East Africa on 13 April 1914. When World War I broke out in August 1914, he ignored orders from Berlin and his governor, and seized the initiative to attack the British city of Taveta. After repulsing General Aitken's attack on Tanga and Longido in November 1914, he gathered his forces and supplies and moved to harass the British rail communications in East Africa, helping the German war effort by tying down as much British troops possible in East Africa. Lettow-Vorbeck eventually managed to gather a force of about 12,000 soldiers, most of them native Askari, led by a highly motivated officer corps of both German and Askari descent. In 1916, Lettow- Vorbeck had managed to successfully harass the British Central Railway to Uganda without being forced in an engagement, which he would certainly lose being hopelessly outnumbered. After leaving Dar es Salaam to the British, he withdrew to a position in the easily defended Uluguru Mountains. Lettow- Vorbeck was planning to make a stand there, allowing his supplies to move south before going there with the main force himself. General Jan Smuts, detached the 3rd Infantry Division, led by Coen Brits and the 1st Mounted Brigade, led by Nussey from the main South African force on the Central Railway and had planned that the mounted division would be available to flank the German forces while the 3rd Infantry division engaged the enemy, but he failed to take the rugged terrain into consideration.The First World War in Africa, Hew Strachan. Oxford University Press, 2004. . The battle The German Schutztruppen prepared defensive positions outside the town of Kisaki. 200 troops were stationed around the town, 1,000 were kept as a mobile reserve to the west while another 1,000 were kept in reserve on the other side of a mountain. On 7 September 1916, the 3rd Infantry Division conducted a frontal assault on the defensive positions of the Schutztruppen. German Field Artillery and 4.1 inch (100 mm) guns, salvaged from the SMS Koenigsberg, blasted the South African formations. The 1st Mounted Brigade attempted to maneuver around the flank and prepared to assault on the German positions. However, the treacherous terrain, and loss of the radio linking them to 3rd Infantry Division, caused them to arrive on 8 September. Lettow-Vorbecks reserve was positioned in a good position to strike the cavalry with guns and rifles and the South Africans were routed. Smuts called off the attack on 11 September and withdrew his forces to the Central Railway. Lettow-Vorbeck had gained some breathing space from the British forces pursuing him, and on 14 September he abandoned Kisaki and marched his forces south to establish a new base at Beho-Beho.

As a judge he was noted \\"for inflexible impartiality and great strength and soundness of judgement\\".Sir John Nicholl The National Library of Wales online Early history Nicholl was born in 1759, the second son of John Nicholl of Llan-maes, a small village near Llantwit Major in Wales. He was educated at Cowbridge and Bristol Grammar Schools, before gaining entry to St John's College, Oxford, in 1775. He graduated as Bachelor of Civil Law in 1780 and as Doctor of Civil Law in 1785. He was called to the bar of the Doctors' Commons in 1785. Professional career Nicholl built an extensive practice and on 6 November 1798 he succeeded Sir William Scott as King's Advocate and was knighted as was custom for the position. Within this role, Nicholl would often brief the Privy Council and Secretary of State on international law. In 1802, Nicholl was elected to Parliament holding the seat of Penryn in Cornwall. After a brief period as Member of Parliament of Hastings from 1806 to 1807, he was elected to the seat of Great Bedwyn, and remained the member of the constituency until the Reform Act of 1832, upon which time he retired.Sir John Nicholl Hansard 1803-2005 Nicholl was a staunch Tory throughout his political career and steadily opposed parliamentary reform and Roman Catholic emancipation. In 1809 he was appointed Dean of the Arches, was admitted to the Privy Council and became a judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. In this capacity, he decided the much quoted case of White v Driver. In 1833 Nicholl was appointed as Judge of the High Court of Admiralty and held the post until his death in 1838;Sir John Nicholl (1759-1838) Bridgend.gov.uk though he resigned his offices as Dean of Arches and in the Prerogative Court after he was made vicar-general to the Archbishop of Canterbury's court in 1834. For his work during the Napoleonic Wars, as a member of the volunteer movement, he was awarded the rank of lieutenant- colonel. Nicholl was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. A monument to Sir John Nicholl is to be seen in the Dyfrig chapel of Llandaff Cathedral. Personal life Despite spending much of his time in London, linked to his parliamentary and judicial duties, and the fact that Nicholl held all his political seats in England, he continued to foster and support links with his home country of Wales. In 1787 he married Judy Birt, the youngest daughter of Peter Birt of Wenvoe Castle, and spent his time during his political career split between his London town house and Tondu House in South Wales. Nicholl and Judy had one son and three daughters. Nicholl's only son, also John Nicholl, would later follow his father's political career, becoming a Member of Parliament for Cardiff. =Merthyr Mawr House= Merthyr Mawr House Nicholl had amassed several estates throughout his lifetime, mainly through inheritance. He had gained an interest in property in Llantwit Major from his godfather, the Rev John Nicholl in 1770 and when Edward Powell died in 1771, he too left estates to Nicholl in five local parishes, including Tondu House. But despite these holdings, when Nicholl came to building his own family home, he chose the area of Merthyr Mawr. When Charles Bowen died in 1797, Nicholl was a trustee appointed to effect the will. Bowen owned large estates within Merthyr Mawr, but they were heavily mortgaged and there were additional debts and legacies to be honoured. Nicholl took this opportunity to purchase of the estate, eventually agreed at £18,000. Nicholl initiated plans to construct a country house on the estate in 1806, demolishing the old residence, a 16th/17th century hall of the Stradling family, and hiring architect Henry Wood to build Merthyr Mawr House. Wood and Nicholl parted company in 1808, but Nicholl pushed through with his plans and moved into the incomplete building in 1809. When the mansion was completed it was notable for its library, which was reported as holding 30,000 articles. Maerthyr Mawr house is a five bay, two-storey classical mansion faced in white local carboniferous limestone, with a hipped roof and a sash windows, and central single-storey porch with Tuscan columns in the north front.012 - Merthyr Mawr Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust The mansion and its outlying stables are presently classed as Grade II* listed buildings.

Once belonging to the fortification section called Marian Walls () it is located in K Brusce Street in the Hradčany neighbourhood, not far from Hradčanská metro station. Other sights in the vicinity include Royal Summer Palace or Villa Bílek. Nowadays Písek Gate is the only preserved gate of the city proper and one of four remaining of the whole fortification system (Tábor, Leopold and Chotek (Brick) gates are part of Vyšehrad Fortress). The name has nothing in common with town of Písek in Southern Bohemia but it derives from a previous medieval gate which used to stand several hundred steps away, at Písek, a defunct suburb of Lesser Quarter (located approximately where Valdštejnská Street is today). This suburb together with the old gate was demolished in the 1620s in order to make space for then newly built Wallenstein Palace. The alternative name derives from the Brusnice (Bruska) stream, a tiny tributary of the Vltava River running along northern side of Prague Castle. The gate was situated between bastions of St George and St Ludmilla. It was built as one of latest parts of Baroque fortification in 1721 by architect Giovanni Battista Alliprandi after a design by František Vogot. Písek Gate serving northbound traffic was one of three city gates in the left bank part of Prague (the other were westbound Imperial Gate () located in what is now Dlabačov Street and southbound Újezd Gate () in Újezd Street). During the War of the Austrian Succession in 1741 understaffed and weakly defended Písek Gate was where troops of Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria and claimant to the throne of Bohemia, entered Prague. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 it was decided that fortified cities were no longer necessary and the fortification ring of Prague started to be gradually dismantled. The Marian Walls survived until the turn of the 20th century when only fractions, including Písek Gate, were left. Thanks to a new road bypassing it, the gate was no longer considered an obstacle for growing traffic and remained standing. In 2000 - 2002 Písek Gate underwent restoration and was turned into a café and gallery; wedding ceremonies are held there as well.

When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create a gap between the two rings. Dry gas seals are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process. These seals are typically used in a harsh working environment such as oil exploration, extraction and refining, petrochemical industries, gas transmission and chemical processing. Machined-in lift profiles on one side of the seal face direct gas inward toward an extremely flat portion of the face. The gas that is flowing across the face generates a pressure that maintains a minute gap between the faces, optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing the highest possible degree of protection against face contact. The seal's film stiffness compensates for varying operations by adjusting gap and pressure to maintain stability. Design and use  Grooves or machined ramps on the seal direct gas inward toward the non-grooved portion. The action of the gas flowing across the seal generates pressure that keeps a minute gap, therefore optimizing fluid film stiffness and providing protection against face contact. The use of these seals in centrifugal compressors has increased significantly in the last two decades because they eliminate contamination and do not use lubricating oil. Non-contacting dry gas seals are often used on compressors for pipelines, off- shore applications, oil refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants. Types There are many dry gas seal configurations based on their application: * Single seal * Tandem seal - Broadly used in the petroleum industry ** Tandem seal with intermediate labyrinth * Double opposed seal - Used when the processed gas is abrasive (like hydrogen) and lower pressure designs. All designs use buffering with \\"dry\\" gas, supplied through control and purification systems. All Dry Gas Seals need additional protection from the process and the bearing lubrication sides of the seal History The first dry gas seal for a compressor was patented by Kaydon Ring & Seal in 1951 when it was known as Koppers Corporation. Field applications of dry gas seal designs were completed in 1952. The original patent was for Kaydon's \\"Tapered Ramp\\" lift geometry, a constant diameter / variable depth dynamic lift design. From that first dry gas seal ever manufactured for a centrifugal compressor in 1951, Kaydon Ring & Seal has been instrumental in developing the dry gas seal into one of the most reliable and maintenance free sealing solution available today. John Crane Inc. issued a patent for dry gas seals in 1968 with field applications beginning in 1975, though the technology is now widely available among seal manufacturers. When the technology is aimed at correcting the problems with dry gas film environments by eliminating friction. Soon, the technology became a common replacement for other lubricated seals. The patented spiral-groove (constant depth / variable diameter) technology of the dry gas seal allows for easy lifting and separation of seal faces during operation. Also the dry gas seal lift geometry can be unidirectional or bidirectional, depending on the specific design of the lifting geometry.

It produces condiments such as mayonnaise, mustard, salad dressings, tomato puree and cooking oil. Background In 1907, Helvetia became the first company to produce mustard on an industrial scale in Switzerland. Its mustard was sold in bulk in large stoneware pots under the Langenthaler Senf brand. Subsequently renamed Thomi’s Langenthaler Senf, the brand was eventually registered under the name Thomy’s Senf in 1930, with the ‘i’ being replaced with a ‘y’ in Thomy to make it a more internationally marketable name. Hans Thomi, the founder of Thomi & Franck SA also decided to sell his mustard in a tube to set it apart from that of his competitors. In 1951 Thomy began mayonnaise production as well, while in 1976 they expanded to introduce bottled salad dressings. Thomy was acquired by Nestlé in 1971. The Thomy man character, or “Thomymännli”, was the product of a competition held in 1931 in which the company asked its consumers for submissions. The competition received 20,000 responses, and the name Senf- Thomy was chosen along with the famous tube shaped character. The character has been the main icon for Thomy since the early 1990s. Thomy is currently only produced in Switzerland, Serbia and Germany, where production begun in 1956, although it is exported throughout Europe. Thomy currently runs operating plants in Karlsruhe and Neuss in Germany, and in Basel, Switzerland. Popularity in Switzerland Thomy has been voted among the twenty most popular Swiss brands for the last ten years, demonstrating its popularity in Switzerland. It also enjoys a 99% recognition rate in Swiss households, and is consumed in over 2.3 million households. An average Swiss household consumes about five Thomy mayonnaise tubes a year as well as three Thomy mustard tubes. The per capita consumption of mayonnaise and mustard in Switzerland is 1 kg and 500g respectively.

Compare the socialist heraldry of the Soviet period of Russian history (1917–1991). History=Precursors= Seal of Ivan the Terrible Before conventional heraldry was introduced to Russia, rulers of ancient Rus' principalities – precursors to the modern Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian states – used a variety of symbols to represent their authority. Up until the 13th century, the Rurikids, rulers of Kiev, used unique stylised symbols, resembling tridents, on seals, coins and weapons that belonged to them. These were inherited from father to son in one way or another – although each descendant tweaked the symbol somewhat – but were not heraldic in the traditional sense of the word, and were closer to Turco-Mongolian tamgas. Other Rus principalities frequently used mythical animals, or human figures, such as knights, in their seals. Byzantium's influence in Rus culture was often felt in these emblems, some of which featured Byzantine elements, such as angels, perhaps due to princes employing Greek seal-stampers. In the seal of the Grand Principality of Moscow, the usage of a Byzantine symbol – the two-headed eagle – was also a sign of pretense, as its rulers, after Ivan III's marriage to Sophia Palaiologina, could trace their ancestry to the empire's ruling house. While not actually heraldic, many of these early Rus symbols would later become the foundation for true coats of arms in Russia and other East Slavic countries. The two seal designs used in Moscow – the aforementioned double-headed eagle and the \\"yezdets\\", a horseman (or more specifically Saint George) killing a dragon – became the two main elements in the modern-day coat of arms of Russia, as well as the arms of the Russian Empire before that. A symbol similar to the yezdets, known as \\"Pahonia\\", was the coat of arms of the Grand Principality of Lithuania (where the majority of citizens were East Slavic, ancestors of the modern Belarusian people), as well as the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic, Belarus (from 1991 to 1995), and modern-day Lithuania. =Imperial heraldry= True armorial bearings were not used in Russia until the 17th century, although some have speculated about times earlier than this. Early arms were at least partly inspired by Western designs, and this was made more great by the acquisition of Ukraine, which had already been influenced by western heraldry. Early designs did not follow the usual rules of heraldry. By 1689, there was some legal status of arms, helped by the nobility reforms of 1682, and the ideas of Peter the Great. He oversaw the first officers of arms, the turning of state symbols into true heraldry, and started to protect certain families' rights to particular arms.Russian Heraldry: A Brief Survey. Russian heraldry as it is. Accessed 31 July 2009. =Soviet heraldry= The Soviet Union, created after the 1917 revolution, required insignia to represent itself in line with other sovereign states, such as emblems, flags and seals, but the Soviet leaders did not wish to continue the old heraldic practices which they saw as associated with the societal system the revolution sought to replace. In response to the needs and wishes, the national emblem adopted would lack the traditional heraldic elements of a shield, helm, crest and mantling, and instead be presented more plainly. This style was followed then by other socialist and communist states, which wished to also focus attention on the nation's workers and diverge from feudalism and all of its associations. Coat of arms of Russia Coat of arms of Russia since 1993 The coat of arms of the Russian Federation derives from the earlier arms of the Russian Empire, as restored in 1992/3 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Though modified more than once since the reign of Ivan III (1462–1505), the current coat of arms is directly derived its medieval original. The general chromatic layout corresponds to the early-15th-century standard. The shape of the eagle can be traced back to the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1725), although the eagle in the modern arms is gold instead of the imperial black. It is similar to the national emblems of the Russian Empire. The current coat of arms was designed by artist Yevgeny Ukhnalyov; it was adopted officially on November 30, 1993.. Accessed 31 July 2009. A horseman, considered to be Saint George, killing a dragon, is the second of the two main Russian symbols. It is the coat of arms of Moscow and used on the flag of Moscow (which is a banner of arms) and as an inescutcheon (smaller shield) on the coat of arms of Russia.. Accessed 31 July 2009. The state coat of arms of the Soviet Union (Russian: Государственный герб СССР Gosudarstvennyiy gerb SSSR) was adopted in 1923 and was used until the break- up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Although it technically is an emblem rather than a coat of arms, since it doesn't follow heraldic rules, in Russian it is called герб (transliteration: gerb), the word used for a traditional coat of arms. Regulation In Imperial Russia, the use of coats of arms was not regulated – although comparatively common among the upper classes, arms of non-nobles were rare, although they were not banned. However, since they were not condoned, they were rare. In modern times, use has become more common. There has been no change in regulation, although the use of traditional noble indicators (certain types of helms, and supporters, for example) is restricted.The Commoners. Russian heraldry as it is. Accessed 31 July 2009. When the Soviet regime took over in Russia, it abolished all titles of nobility (although at that time they did not control the whole of Russia).Nobility. Russian heraldry as it is. Accessed 31 July 2009. However, this failed to abolish their heraldic lineage, which continued. There are, therefore, a large number of noble arms, complete with supporters and helms. In the Russian Empire, arms were actively used as a symbol of one's nobility. Unlike coats of arms in other countries (such as in English heraldry), they were largely granted to the family as a whole.The Commoners. Russian heraldry as it is. Accessed 31 July 2009.

The group consisted of multicultural wrestlers, representing various countries around the world. Created by Canadian wrestler Eric Young, the group had a mainly anti-American stance. History=Formation= The first seeds for World Elite were planted in March 2009, when Japanese wrestlers Kiyoshi and No Limit (Naito and Yujiro) aligned themselves with Sheik Abdul Bashir, forming an (unnamed) Anti- American faction. No Limit later left the company. In May, The British Invasion attacked Team 3D during an interview, much to the pleasure of Bashir and Kiyoshi, who were looking on. On the July 23, 2009, edition of Impact!, Eric Young joined the team of A.J. Styles, Daniels and Beer Money, Inc. to face the British Invasion, Kiyoshi and Bashir in a ten-man tag team match. However, in the conclusion of the match, Young turned on the TNA originals by hitting Styles with a spike piledriver and allowing him to be pinned. Eric Young then became leader of a new faction named World Elite, consisting of himself (representing Canada), Bashir (representing Iran), Kiyoshi (representing Japan), and The British Invasion (representing the United Kingdom). The following week, Young debuted a new look that included a shaved head and wearing new attire, as went on to defeat Daniels before helping Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus win the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Team 3D. =Alliance and feud with the Main Event Mafia= On the August 6 episode of Impact! it was revealed that Kurt Angle and Eric Young had made a deal to turn the Main Event Mafia and the World Elite factions into one super faction. On the September 10 edition of Impact!, World Elite recruited Homicide (representing Puerto Rico) into their group, turning him heel in the process. On the October 1 edition of Impact! the alliance between World Elite and Main Event Mafia came to an end in an all out brawl between the two factions. At Bound for Glory Young pinned Kevin Nash in a three-way dance, which also included Hernandez, to win the TNA Legends Championship. In a four way Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match, the British Invasion lost the IWGP tag titles but won the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the October 29 edition of Impact! Young renamed the Legends Championship to the \\"TNA Global Championship\\" and claimed he wouldn't defended it on U.S. soil or against any American wrestler. On the same night, after Angle announced the death of the Main Event Mafia and turned face, Kevin Nash also became a face as he began feuding with Eric Young and the World Elite. However, the following month at Turning Point Nash helped World Elite members Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus retain their TNA World Tag Team Championship, thus once again becoming a heel. On the following edition of Impact!, Nash congratulated Young on outsmarting him at Bound for Glory and aligned himself with the World Elite, ironically becoming the faction's American representative in the process despite the faction's anti-American leanings. At Final Resolution Young, Bashir, Homicide, Kiyoshi, Terry and Nash took part in the \\"Feast or Fired\\" match, with Nash, Terry and Bashir coming out of the match with briefcases despite Young ordering them not to get the briefcases. After the match it was revealed that Nash had earned himself a shot at fellow World Elite members Brutus Magnus & Doug Williams TNA World Tag Team Championship and Terry a shot at the X Division Championship, while Bashir had gotten a pink slip and was as a result fired from TNA. On January 17, 2010, at Genesis, Williams and Magnus lost the World Tag Team Title to Matt Morgan and Hernandez. On January 27, 2010, Eric Young lost the Global Championship to World Elite team mate Rob Terry at a house show in Cardiff, Wales. On the following day's Impact!, Williams used Terry's \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase to get a shot at Amazing Red's X Division Championship and quickly defeated him for the title. =Dissolution and Aftermath= Soon after, the members of The World Elite began to focus on separate goals. On the January 4, 2010, edition of Impact! Homicide turned on Kiyoshi, after which both of them left World Elite. After months of abuse, Terry finally turned on Magnus and left World Elite on the February 18 edition of Impact. After being defeated by Terry at Destination X, Magnus to left World Elite, while Williams moved on to wrestling in the X Division. Eric Young and Kevin Nash ended World Elite to join Scott Hall to re-form The Band.

The Voodoo Macbeth is a common nickname for the Federal Theatre Project's 1936 New York production of William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Orson Welles adapted and directed the production, moved the play's setting from Scotland to a fictional Caribbean island, recruited an entirely Black cast, and earned the nickname for his production from the Haitian vodou that fulfilled the role of Scottish witchcraft. A box office sensation, the production is regarded as a landmark theatrical event for several reasons: its innovative interpretation of the play, its success in promoting African- American theatre, and its role in securing the reputation of its 20-year-old director. Background The Works Project Administration provided economic stimulus during the Great Depression, and under its aegis was Federal Project Number One, responsible for generating jobs in the arts for which the Federal Theater Project was created. The Negro Theatre Unit was split into two halves, the \\"Contemporary Branch\\" to create theater on contemporary black issues, and the \\"Classic Branch\\", to perform classic drama. The aim was to provide a point of entry into the theater workforce for black writers, actors and stagehands, and to raise community pride by performing classic plays without reference to the color of the actors. Concept Shakespeare's play is about the downfall of a usurper in medieval Scotland, who is encouraged in his actions by three witches. The central idea behind Welles's production was to perform the text straight, but to use costumes and sets that alluded to Haiti in the 19th century, specifically during the reign of the slave-turned-emperor Henri Christophe. Although the main reason for this choice was that it was an appropriate setting for an all-black cast, Welles felt that it also enhanced the play's realism: he thought the production's popularity was partly due to the fact that the idea of voodoo was more credible to a contemporary audience than was medieval witchcraft. In many productions, the character of Hecate, the Queen of the Witches, is often cut. Instead, Welles turned the character into a pivotal figure. Performed by Eric Burroughs as a huge man with a bullwhip, Hecate presides over events as a ringmaster of magicians, and often closes scenes. Hecate ends the play with the line, \\"The charm's wound up\\", repeated from Act 1. Welles's 1948 film version of Macbeth, in which Hecate does not appear, also ends with this line. The production used a single, unchanging set of a castle in a jungle. The backdrops featured stylized palm trees and skeleton imagery. It is not certain whether the production removed references to Scotland from the text. Welles's promptbook keeps them intact, but in the surviving film record of the production's climax, the line \\"Hail, King of Scotland\\" is truncated to \\"Hail, King\\". Production The Negro Theatre Unit of the Federal Theatre Project was formed in 1935, under the distinguished actress Rose McClendon. She advised national director Hallie Flanagan that the project should begin under experienced direction and selected producer John Houseman as co-director of the unit. Their partnership was never realized; it was soon apparent that McClendon was not well, and she made only a few formal appearances before she became critically ill in December 1935. Regarding the unit's name, Houseman later wrote, \\"the word 'black' was taboo. 'Negro' was in official and general use though there was some ideological disagreement as to whether it should be spelled with a small or a capital N.\\" Houseman had established his credentials as general manager of the all-black production, Four Saints in Three Acts (1934). On the advice of composer Virgil Thomson, Houseman divided the unit into two sections, between which the project members themselves could choose and could switch between from one production to another. One section was devoted to original black-themed contemporary drama. \\"The other,\\" Houseman wrote, \\"would devote itself to the performance of classical works of which our actors would be the interpreters, without concession or reference to color.\\" \\"For this fine scheme to work,\\" Houseman wrote, \\"there was one essential condition — that the quality of these 'classical' productions be exceptionally high. It would be fatal to undertake the risky and difficult business of producing Shakespeare in Harlem until I had found a director of whose creative imagination and power I was completely confident.\\" Houseman invited his recent collaborator, the 20-year-old Orson Welles, to join the project. Welles declined at first, since the work would cut into his lucrative radio career and he feared being put back into insolvency, but his young wife Virginia persuaded him to take the job. In the autumn of 1935, Welles called Houseman after he and Virginia had an inspiration. Welles proposed staging an all-black production of Macbeth, transposed from Scotland to a mythical island setting inspired by 19th-century Haiti and the fantasy world of The Tempest. The idea offered creative advantages in music, costumes and settings — and the ability to make the role of witchcraft credible to modern audiences by substituting Haitian voodooism. The production was universally known as the Voodoo Macbeth in advance of its presentation. At Welles's request Houseman stayed away from early rehearsals, leaving him able to concentrate on the first two Negro Theatre Unit productions, both from the contemporary wing. Walk Together Chillun, written and co-directed by actor Frank Wilson, was the modestly received first production, presented in February 1936. The second was Rudolph Fisher's Conjur' Man Dies, a comedy-mystery starring Dooley Wilson (and directed by Joseph Losey) that was a smash hit. The settings and costumes were designed by Nat Karson. Welles and Karson researched Directoire style, uniforms of the Napoleonic era, and tropical vegetation. The sets and costumes were executed by the Federal Theatre Workshop at a cost of $2,000. The lighting was created by Abe Feder, later regarded as a founder of lighting design profession. Feder had a difficult relationship with Welles, whom he believed was too young and ignorant of the practicalities of theatre; he continued to hold this opinion when interviewed decades later. Welles also faced some difficulties in asserting authority with the black cast and crew, but he won them over with his energy and warmth, and pleased everyone by cramming the rehearsal space with food and drink. Black cast and crew members interviewed decades later said that Houseman and Welles had their full confidence. \\"I never would have amounted to anything in the theatre if it hadn't been for Orson Welles,\\" Canada Lee recalled. \\"The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right — and it was a wonderful sensation, knowing it was right. Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it could say. I had the ambition — I caught it from Orson Welles — to work like mad and be a convincing actor.\\" The production opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem. A free preview two days before drew 3,000 more people than could be seated. \\"By all odds my great success in my life was that play,\\" Welles told BBC interviewer Leslie Megahey in 1982. \\"Because the opening night there were five blocks in which all traffic was stopped. You couldn't get near the theater in Harlem. Everybody who was anybody in the black or white world was there. And when the play ended there were so many curtain calls that finally they left the curtain open, and the audience came up on the stage to congratulate the actors. And that was, that was magical.\\"Estrin, Mark W., and Orson Welles. Orson Welles: Interviews. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2002. Macbeth played for ten sold- out weeks at the Lafayette Theatre (April 14–June 20, 1936). The production then moved to the Adelphi Theatre (July 6–18). On July 15, Jack Carter completed only the first act, and the performance was completed by understudy Thomas Anderson. Beginning July 16 Maurice Ellis played the role of Macbeth, with Charles Collins succeeding Ellis in the role of Macduff. The production then toured WPA venues throughout the country, beginning with engagements in Bridgeport (July 21–25) and Hartford, Connecticut (July 28–August 1). Macbeth was performed in Dallas beginning August 6, and the production was featured at the Texas Centennial Exposition August 13–23. Performances were presented in the new bandshell and 5,000-seat open-air amphitheatre, where integrated seating was a unique experience for Dallas theatergoers. The production was one of the most talked-about features of the exposition and drew large, enthusiastic audiences. For many it was their first opportunity to see a professional dramatic performance by African American actors. Welles was sent to join the company during the play's run in Indianapolis (August 25–29), to soothe inter-company quarrels that threatened the production after racial tensions escalated during the segment of the tour through the segregated South. Incognito, he performed the role of Macbeth at one performance there, when Ellis became ill. The 4,000-mile tour continued to Chicago, (September 1–13) Detroit and Cleveland, finishing in Syracuse, New York (September 23–25). \\"Syracuse will be the last stop for the touring 'Macbeth' production … closing a 4,000 mile jaunt with a three-day run at the Civic University, opening Sept. 23.\\" After the company's return to New York, the final performances of Macbeth were presented October 6–17 at the Majestic Theatre in Brooklyn. The production was invited to London by impresario Charles B. Cochran, but Welles declined because he was trying to secure his career in New York. The closing four minutes of the production are preserved in a rare 1937 film, We Work Again, a WPA documentary that is in the public domain and can be viewed online. Maurice Ellis and Charles Collins appear as Macbeth and Macduff, indicating that the filming took place after July 16, 1936. Houseman produced only one more play for the Federal Theatre Project's Negro Theatre Unit. After ten months as the project's director he assured Hallie Flanagan that the unit was viable and should be directed by a triumvirate comprising West Indian intellectual Harry Edward, Carlton Moss and Gus Smith. He and Welles were authorized to create a new Classical Theatre unit that became known as Federal Theatre Project 891. Its first production, Horse Eats Hat, opened in September 1936. Cast King Duncan arrives at Macbeth's palace The cast of Macbeth numbered 150 people, but only four were professional actors: Jack Carter, Edna Thomas, Canada Lee and Eric Burroughs. Juano Hernandez was first cast as Macbeth, but he left the production after just three rehearsals to play the lead in an NBC radio series. Jack Carter, who played Crown in the original stage production of Porgy, was chosen for the role. Rose McClendon was to have portrayed Lady Macbeth, but when she became critically ill Edna Thomas inherited the role. Both Carter and Thomas were light-skinned and wore dark makeup in order to avoid looking different from the rest of the cast. Thomas played Lady Macbeth as a mother figure to Macbeth. Carter was a former criminal and an alcoholic, but Welles cast him despite being warned of his habit of disappearing for weeks on binges. Carter understood the importance of the production to his career and kept his drinking under control during the Harlem run. Welles expended a great deal of time on helping Carter channel his adrenalin into his performance. The two men bonded and hit the nightspots of Harlem together after rehearsals. His behavior became so troublesome during the Broadway run that he was replaced by Maurice Ellis, who had held the role of Macduff. Canada Lee played Banquo. Lee met Welles prior to his involvement with the production, at a performance of Stevedore. The audience had been whipped into a frenzied shouting match, and Lee rescued Welles from being attacked by another audience member wielding a knife. The role of Hecate, which Welles changed from the witch queen of the original to that of a male Voodoo priest, was played by Eric Burroughs, trained at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The New York Times noted that Burroughs' concluding line, \\"The charm’s wound up!\\" at the fall of the closing curtain prompted a 15-minute frenzy of cheering throughout the 1200-seat Lafayette Theatre. Despite the fact that few professional African-American actors were available and many of the cast members had never acted in Shakespeare before, Welles believed that they showed a better understanding of the rhythm of the iambic pentameter than many professionals. Welles also hired African drummers and dancers, led by Sierra Leonean drummer and choreographer Asadata Dafora. Dancer Abdul Assen, a member of Dafora's Shogola Aloba dance troupe who is credited only as \\"Abdul\\" on the program, was widely praised by reviewers in his role as the Witch Doctor.Marguerite Rippy, \\"The Death of the Auteur: Orson Welles, Asadata Dafora, and the 1936 Macbeth\\" in Orson Welles in Focus, eds. James N. Gilmore and Sidney Gottlieb. IU Press, 2018, p. 16-17 Dafora and Assen's presentation of voodoo practices and musical accompaniment of the witches' speeches with drumbeats were popular with audiences, critics, and with Welles himself. The involvement of Assen, Dafora, and diasporic African musical and dance tradition added a powerful feeling of authenticity to the Haitian setting that became part of the folklore surrounding the production. =Cast list= The cast and crew of Macbeth are credited in the original production notebook and in The Theatre of Orson Welles by Richard France. * Court Ladies — Helen Carter, Carolyn Crosby, Eveyln Davis, Ethel Drayton, Helen Brown, Aurelia Lawson, Margaret Howard, Olive Wannamake, Evelyn Skipworth, Aslean Lynch * Court Gentlemen — Herbert Glynn, Jose Miralda, Jimmy Wright, Otis Morse, Merritt Smith, Walter Brogsdale, Harry George Grant * Soldiers — Benny Tattnall, Herman Patton, Ernest Brown, Ivan Lewis, Richard Ming, George Spelvin, Albert Patrick, Chauncey Worrell, Albert McCoy, William Clayton Jr., Allen Williams, William Cumberbatch, Henry J.

The theatre was picketed throughout rehearsals. One man attempted to slash Welles's face with a razor, but Canada Lee, a former boxer, stopped him. According to Welles, the anger was suddenly replaced \\"for no reason at all\\" by widespread excitement and pride in the community as the opening night approached. The \\"Voodoo Macbeth\\" defied all expectations, becoming a box office sensation. Seventh Avenue had to be closed for 10 blocks on either side of the theatre on opening night. Most reviewers, including those from The New York Times and the New York Daily News, loved the production, praising its energy and excitement. However, Carter was criticized for poor verse delivery, and for seeming more interested in displaying his physique than acting. One reviewer, Percy Hammond of the Herald Tribune, was negative about the entire cast, accusing the actors of being inaudible and timid. In response, one of the African drummers created a voodoo doll of Hammond, stuck pins in it, and encouraged Welles to take responsibility for any torments Hammond suffered as a result. Welles says he found this amusing, until Hammond died shortly afterward.

In 2001, Lenwood Sloan created the Vo-Du Macbeth, inspired in part by the 1936 Federal Theatre production. The National Black Arts Festival announced their plans to revive the play in 2012 in Atlanta, with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The American Century Theater produced the play in 2013. Influence In 2017, Bob Devin Jones directed a production of Voodoo Macbeth inspired by Welles's version, but different from it.http://www.thestudioat620.org/events/the-macbeth-project-2017 ReferencesExternal links *Macbeth at the Internet Broadway Database * Preserved Films: Footage of Orson Welles's Voodoo Macbeth (1937) — National Film Preservation Foundation *Macbeth, New York City, April 14 – June 20, 1936 Production notebook, playscript, and related documents from the digital collection The New Deal Stage at the Library of Congress *Macbeth playscript at George Mason University African-American theatre Harlem Macbeth Macbeth All-Black cast Broadway shows Federal Theatre Project Works by Orson Welles Articles containing video clips 1936 plays ","title":"Voodoo Macbeth"},{"id":"23812464","text":"Kazakhskaya Pravda (Казахская Правда) is a semi-monthly Russian-language newspaper printed in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with a print run of 5,000. , the editor in chief was Aldan Aimbetov, a graduate of the Kazakh State University (Al-Farabi University). He has held that position since 1993. The United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices describes their political position as \\"nationalist\\". Pal Kolsto of the University of Oslo's Institute of East European and Oriental Studies goes as far as to call them \\"extremist\\". They are unusual among Kazakh nationalist-oriented newspapers for publishing in Russian rather than the Kazakh language. Political conflicts Kazakhskaya Pravda was shut down by the General Prosecutor's office in April 1995 under the charge of \\"inciting ethnic tension\\". By September, according to the Minister of Press and Mass Media, the paper was allowed to resume publication. In 2000, Kazakhskaya Pravda was again in court, bringing charges against Irina Savostina of the Pokoleniye political movement, over comments she made during a television interview on KTK and which were also printed in the newspaper Soldat, in which she accused Aimbetov of being connected to the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan. An article in Kazakhskaya Pravda published in January 2004, \\"Kazakhs face a hidden threat\\", written by a non- staff writer of the paper, claimed that Uyghur immigrants in Kazakhstan were separatists and terrorists; it drew severe criticism from the Society for Uyghur Culture of Kazakhstan as well as the Kazakh government, and Kazakhskaya Pravda eventually printed a retraction, pointing out that their paper had always shown strong support for the Uyghur \\"national liberation movement\\". Conflicts with other newspapers In 1998, an article in the newspaper Karavan accused Aimbetov of using his paper as a platform to publish antisemitic materials; Kazakhskaya Pravda filed suit against Karavan in response and won ₸260,000 in compensation. The April 2002 edition of Kazakhskaya Pravda featured in-depth content on another Kazakhstani newspaper Megapolis, accusing them of defaming the country's honour; Megapolis responded in an editorial soon after entitled \\"With such a patriot, Kazakhs need no enemies\\" (С таким патриотом казахам и врагов не надо).

The magazine contains major features, editorial and comment, news and reports, reviews, interviews and readers' letters.  Nature and focus of the magazine  Land&Liberty; has no political alignment in the conventional sense. However the magazine is not editorially neutral on issues. Land&Liberty;'s key concern is how the global common wealth should be used, and it aims to demonstrate that this question is key to effective and just public policy—to the sustainable bridging of private life, the public sector and common resources.Statement of Values, Land&Liberty;, vol. 116, no. 1224, summer 2009, p.3 Land&Liberty;'s focus therefore is radical justice in property rights and taxation.

A housing crash is coming.\\"Land&Liberty;, vol. 111, no. 1210, late summer 2004, p. 2 Its 'Crash' cover story issue was published in the first week of September 2007, just days before the events at Northern Rock that caught the economic establishment unawares.Land&Liberty;, vol. 114, no. 1219, autumn 2007 Since the 1980s Land&Liberty; has been an influence on the political opposition within Zimbabwe.Land&Liberty;, vol. 115, no. 1222, autumn 2008, p. 5 In August 2008, the Movement for Democratic Change presented their political programme for the coalition government that they had entered into with the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party. It included a policy for raising public revenue from a tax on land values, as advocated by Land&Liberty;: \\"the MDC will through an Act of Parliament establish a Land Commission whose mandate is to…[i]ntroduce an equitable Land Tax\\". The party’s Policy Coordinator General, Eddie Cross, wrote in a 2009 article in Land&Liberty; that his party’s new policies would help ensure that \\"secure communities will become free communities with the capacity to confront and control those in charge of the state\\".Land&Liberty;, vol. 116, no. 1224, summer 2009, p. 10-11  History  Land&Liberty; is the world's longest- running periodical advocating the social reform advanced by Henry George\\"Land and Liberty is now the longest-lived Georgist project in history, but still it struggles to gain the attention of an unheeding world.\\" The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, vol. 62, 2003, p. 615—of whom Albert Einstein once said: \\"one cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness, artistic form and fervent love of justice\\".

IV, no. 48, May 1898, p. 8. \\"The eighth annual meeting of the Scottish Land Restoration Union was held on 22 April 1898…. in Glasgow\\"] out of the complex reorganisation that year of the Scottish Land Restoration League [’The Story of Land Values’ by John Paul, in Land Values, vol. XVII, no. 253, June 1915, p. 10.] The family tree of the Scottish land reform movement in this period is complex, and here, inter alia, the author concedes: \\"In my experience the Glasgow group of Single Taxers were never much addicted to formalities….\\" Republished, with further material, on the death of John Paul [Land&Liberty;, vol. 40, no. 468-469, May–June 1933, p. 219-220]. The 1890 reorganisation also spawned the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values, which later was to take over the magazine. The Union and its antecedents were a contemporary political force in Scotland, launching the career of Keir Hardie, the first socialist elected to the UK Parliament, who went on to become the Labour Party's first leader. Inspired by Henry George, the Union's activism helped deliver—through its publication The Single Tax: \\"an American impulse behind the Scottish labor movement, which became historic in making the modern Labour party, and in forging the character of twentieth-century Britain.\\" Yet within its first year—recording historic shudders in the evolution of British socialism and the birth of the Labour party—the magazine was writing: \\"what have the Labour Party to offer us?

It has provided analyses of, among other things, the 'Irish Problem', the Scottish crofting movement and the Highland Clearances, the genesis of two World Wars, the creation of the United Nations and the other global institutions, the formulation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Europe's withdrawal from empire’s colonial project, and the middle east conflict. The paper reported extensively the events surrounding the 1909 UK People’s Budget, and the resultant House of Lords reform—contributing a major voice in the contemporary public debate. The paper's reporters recorded a unique archive of speeches by Lloyd George,'Mr Lloyd George at Limehouse' (Limehouse speech, 30 July 1909, Land Values, vol.

He received his Phd in Social Sciences at the University Paul Cézanne (Aix- Marseille) in France, where he also received a master's degree in Public Law and a master's degree in Political Science. Other degrees include a degree in Philosophy from the University of Provence, and a Masters of Science (MSC) by Research in Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Liogier has also studied social sciences as a visiting undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley. He is a University Professor at the Institut d'études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence, where have studied major French figures and international prominent leaders like the current head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde. He has also been appointed to lecture at the International College of Philosophy (CIPh) in Paris (Academic and Research Institution created by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida to promote new ideas). Liogier ran the Observatoire du religieux from 2006 to 2014, which is the first European Social Sciences Research Center to have studied both the rise of the new Salafism (new Islamic fundamentalism) among young western Muslims and the rise of new groups of young people using Islam as an anti-social flag in order to justify violent behavior. Liogier was the first expert to be interviewed by the French Parliament after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in January 2015. He is also a research scholar attached to the University of Paris 10 (Paris-Nanterre). He serves as a board member on the scientific journal Social Compass, and is one of the twelve members of the International Commission for Peace Research at UNESCO.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/houphouet-boigny-peace-prize/about-the- prize/international-commission-for-peace-research/ He has been invited as a visiting professor by several universities, mainly in North America, Europe, India and Australia. In 2015 he had a one-year appointment as visiting professor at the University of Louvain in Belgium in the Academic Chair of Prospective Anthropology (title of the course : « The Evolution of Mankind Narrative in the 21st Century related to the development of Technosciences »). Liogier wrote his thesis on Buddhism under the direction of Bruno Étienne, a professor at the Institut d'études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence, and has among other things published a book on secularism in 2006. He works particularly on the issues related to Islam and cults and wrote many articles on religious topics including Pentecostalism, Catholicism and Soka Gakkai. He also criticizes the work made by MIVILUDES.Raphaël Liogier, \\"Révolution culturelle dans la lutte antisectes\\", Le Monde, 4 March 2008 His work can be divided into three main areas of study: # Why do we need to believe? Where does the desire to believe come from ? Is science possible without any belief? What is the difference between \\"knowing\\" and « believing » ? # The construction of new mythologies in our current global world (the importance of the Internet for sharing dreams, desires and anguish). The global circulation of images, desires and frustrations (related to new global forms of violence : cyber- terrorism for instance). # The impact of technoscience over human narrative (the significance of human technological enhancement) and on human concrete reality (the evolution of the desire to work ; the evolution of the relation with our natural environment). Liogier co-authored several articles on the theme of religion. He has published more than a hundred scientific articles and sixteen books. He has recently published a book on violence and the evolution of religious and cultural identity in a global world (La guerre des civilisations n’aura pas lieu. Coexistence et violence au XXIème siècle, 2017 : The War of Civilizations will not take place. Coexistence and Violence in the 21rst Century\\"\\") ; and a book about the necessity to radically transform our social and economic system due to the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet (Sans Emploi. Condition de l’homme postindustriel, 2017. Unemployed. The Postindustrial Man Condition). He appears regularly on French national TV and radio shows. He has published numerous articles in national and international mainstream newspapers. One of his article published in Le Monde was later translated and published in English on the Blog of the London School of Economics (LSE). His analysis of the 2017 French election appeared in an op-ed in the New York Times International. Some of his scientific work is published in English, including the International Social Science Journal. The Stanford University review Occasion published his article after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in 2015. In 2011, The Harvard International Review published a summary of his study on the \\"Myth of Islamization and European Decadence\\". Some of his more recent work on hypermodern identities (artificial intelligence and human identity ; transhumanist imaginary structure) has been published in the international academic journal Social Compass. Review in English of his book on French \\"laïcité\\", see Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 39,3, pp. 319-320 (author of the review : Margarita Mooney) There was a review in English of his book Souci de soi, conscience du monde. Vers une religion globale (Self care, World Awareness. Towards a Global Religion ?). Commentary in English on his work can be found on the internet site World Religion Watch. One book, by British anthropologist Jonathan Benthall, has been explicitly inspired by Liogier’s work, according to the author himself.(I.B.

NRL astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated: \\" ... the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, ...\\". There are a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients. In the sense of traveling as a transient, the only stellar X-ray source that does not belong to a constellation is the Sun. As seen from Earth, the Sun moves from west to east along the ecliptic, passing over the course of one year through the twelve constellations of the Zodiac, and Ophiuchus. Exotic X-ray transients Hubble's field of view. The lower image quadrant represents a zoomed in view. SCP 06F6 is (or was) an astronomical object of unknown type, discovered on February 21, 2006, in the constellation Boötes during a survey of galaxy cluster CL 1432.5+3332.8 with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel. The European X-ray satellite XMM Newton made an observation in early August 2006 which appears to show an X-ray glow around SCP 06F6, two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of supernovae. Nova or supernova Most astronomical X-ray transient sources have simple and consistent time structures; typically a rapid brightening followed by gradual fading, as in a nova or supernova. GRO J0422+32 is an X-ray nova and black hole candidate that was discovered by the BATSE instrument on the CGRO satellite on Aug 5 1992. During the outburst, it was observed to be stronger than the Crab Nebula gamma-ray source out to photon energies of about 500 keV. Transient binary X-ray source XTE J1650-500 is a transient binary X-ray source located in the constellation Ara. The binary period is 0.32 d. Soft X-ray transient \\"Soft X-ray transients\\" are composed of some type of compact object (probably a neutron star) and some type of \\"normal\\", low mass star (i.e. a star with a mass of some fraction of the Sun's mass). These objects show changing levels of low-energy, or \\"soft\\", X-ray emission, probably produced somehow by variable transfer of mass from the normal star to the compact object. In effect the compact object \\"gobbles up\\" the normal star, and the X-ray emission can provide the best view of how this process occurs. Soft X-ray transients Cen X-4 and Apl X-1 were discovered by Hakucho, Japan's first X-ray astronomy satellite. X-ray burster X-ray bursters are one class of X-ray binary stars exhibiting periodic and rapid increases in luminosity (typically a factor of 10 or greater) peaked in the X-ray regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. These astrophysical systems are composed of an accreting compact object, typically a neutron star or occasionally a black hole, and a companion 'donor' star; the mass of the donor star is used to categorize the system as either a high mass (above 10 solar masses) or low mass (less than 1 solar mass) X-ray binary, abbreviated as LMXB and HMXB, respectively. X-ray bursters differ observationally from other X-ray transient sources (such as X-ray pulsars and soft X-ray transients), showing a sharp rise time (1 – 10 seconds) followed by spectral softening (a property of cooling black bodies). Individual bursts are characterized by an integrated flux of 1039-40 ergs. Gamma-ray burster A gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a highly luminous flash of gamma rays — the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation. GRB 970228 was a GRB detected on Feb 28 1997 at 02:58 UTC. Prior to this event, GRBs had only been observed at gamma wavelengths. For several years physicists had expected these bursts to be followed by a longer-lived afterglow at longer wavelengths, such as radio waves, x-rays, and even visible light. This was the first burst for which such an afterglow was observed. A transient x-ray source was detected which faded with a power law slope in the days following the burst. This x-ray afterglow was the first GRB afterglow ever detected. Transient X-ray pulsars For some types of X-ray pulsars, the companion star is a Be star that rotates very rapidly and apparently sheds a disk of gas around its equator. The orbits of the neutron star with these companions are usually large and very elliptical in shape. When the neutron star passes nearby or through the Be circumstellar disk, it will capture material and temporarily become an X-ray pulsar. The circumstellar disk around the Be star expands and contracts for unknown reasons, so these are transient X-ray pulsars that are observed only intermittently, often with months to years between episodes of observable X-ray pulsation. SAX J1808.4-3658 is a transient, accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that is intermittent. In addition, X-ray burst oscillations and quasi- periodic oscillations in addition to coherent X-ray pulsations have been seen from SAX J1808.4-3658, making it a Rosetta stone for interpretation of the timing behavior of low-mass X-ray binaries. Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs) There are a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (~ tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB supergiants and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). XTE J1739–302 is one of these. Discovered in 1997, remaining active only one day, with an X-ray spectrum well fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung (temperature of ∼20 keV), resembling the spectral properties of accreting pulsars, it was at first classified as a peculiar Be/X-ray transient with an unusually short outburst. A new burst was observed on Apr 8 2008 with Swift. The Sun as an X-ray transient The quiet Sun, although less active than active regions, is awash with dynamic processes and transient events (bright points, nanoflares and jets). A coronal mass ejection (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs. The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production. The first detection of a Coronal mass ejection (CME) as such was made on Dec 1 1971 by R. Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory using the 7th Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 7). Earlier observations of coronal transients or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing. The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a \\"prehistoric\\" CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare, in 1859. The flare was observed visually by Richard Christopher Carrington and the geomagnetic storm was observed with the recording magnetograph at Kew Gardens. The same instrument recorded a crotchet, an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by Roentgen) and the recognition of the ionosphere (by Kennelly and Heaviside). Transient X-rays from Jupiter Image of Jupiter's northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the interaction with Jupiter's natural satellites Unlike Earth's aurorae, which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (< 1000 km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellite auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting their ionospheres with the ionosphere of Jupiter, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. The auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3 keV). Detecting X-ray transients The X-ray monitor of Solwind, designated NRL-608 or XMON, was a collaboration between the Naval Research Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The monitor consisted of 2 collimated argon proportional counters. The instrument bandwidth of 3-10 keV was defined by the detector window absorption (the window was 0.254 mm beryllium) and the upper level discriminator. The active gas volume (P-10 mixture) was 2.54 cm deep, providing good efficiency up to 10 keV. Counts were recorded in 2 energy channels. Slat collimators defined a FOV of 3° x 30° (FWHM) for each detector; the long axes of the FOVs were perpendicular to each other. The long axes were inclined 45 degrees to the scan direction, allowing localization of transient events to about 1 degree. The PHEBUS experiment recorded high energy transient events in the range 100 keV to 100 MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germinate (BGO) crystal 78 mm in diameter by 120 mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5 MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 σ (standard deviations) in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 channels over the energy range. Also on board the Granat International Astrophysical Observatory were four WATCH instruments that could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180 keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% FWHM at 60 keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180 keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 s per 36 s. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) carries the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) which detects in the 20 keV to 8 MeV range. The WIND satellite is the first of NASA's Global Geospace Science (GGS) WIND was launched on Nov 1 1994. At first, the satellite had a lunar swingby orbit around the Earth. With the assistance of the Moon's gravitational field Wind's apogee was kept over the day hemisphere of the Earth and magnetospheric observations were made. Later in the mission, the Wind spacecraft was inserted into a special \\"halo\\" orbit in the solar wind upstream from the Earth, about the sunward Sun-Earth equilibrium point (L1). The satellite has a spin period of ~ 20 seconds, with the spin axis normal to the ecliptic. WIND carries the Transient Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (TGRS) which covers the energy range 15 keV - 10 MeV, with an energy resolution of 2.0 keV @ 1.0 MeV (E/delta E = 500). The third US Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3) was launched on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability. SAS 3 was the first to discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the soft X-ray background (0.1-0.28 kev). Tenma was the second Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched on Feb 20 1983. Tenma carried GSFC detectors which had an improved energy resolution (by a factor of 2) compared to proportional counters and performed the first sensitive measurements of the iron spectral region for many astronomical objects. Energy Range: 0.1 keV - 60 keV. Gas Scintillator Proportional Counter: 10 units of 80 cm2 each, FOV ~ 3deg (FWHM), 2 - 60 keV. Transient Source Monitor: 2 - 10 keV. India's first dedicated astronomy satellite, scheduled for launch on board the PSLV in mid 2010,PTInews.com Astrosat will monitor the X-ray sky for new transients, among other scientific focuses.

Accordingly, both were established on 19 March 1833 by letters patent. The Executive Council initially consisted of the British Governor (the president of the council) and five other senior British officials: the General Officer Commanding, the Colonial Secretary (Principal Secretary), the Kings's Advocate, the Treasurer and the Government Agent for the Central Province. The governor had to consult the Executive Council in the discharge of his duties but he could over rule the council's advice. In 1840 the Auditor-General replaced the Government Agent for the Central Province on the council and in 1883 the Queen's Advocate post was renamed Attorney General. The Second Manning Reforms of 1924 added four unofficial members to the Executive Council. The 1927-8 Donoughmore Commission recommended that Ceylon be given limited self-government and the replacement of the Legislative Council and Executive Council with the State Council and Board of Ministers respectively.

The game is episodic and the first installment was released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store in December 2009. The entire \\"season\\" of the game, Blue Toad Murder Files: The Mysteries of Little Riddle, includes six separate episodes. The Windows version was available to download from online games distribution sites as well as from the official website in November 2010. Support for PlayStation Move was added in December 2010 (update 2.0). An iOS version was released in April 2013. Gameplay The game is for one to four players and leans towards TV murder mysteries such as Agatha Christie's Poirot, Midsomer Murders and Jonathan Creek with \\"witnesses, alibis [and] motives\\" rather than being a logic puzzle like Cluedo. The game sees the player investigate murders and interrogate residents in the country village of Little Riddle. Aspects of the game have been compared to the Professor Layton series of games, regarding its setting and puzzle solving game mechanic, but it differs from the Layton games in that the puzzles in Blue Toad are more closely linked to the game's storyline. At various points the game questions the player about their investigation and key plot points to check that they were paying attention. Actor Tom Dussek voiced all the 22 characters (+dog) in the game. Characters=Blue Toad detective agents= At the beginning of the game, the player(s) choose(s) between these four characters (excluding Watson): *Lambert Vanderbosh was one of the first members of the agency. He is 50-something years old and is keen, kind and caring. Vanderbosh has grey hair and a large mustache. He is dressed in a brown business suit with a red (white polka-dots) scarf tucked in. *Miss Marjorie Maple looks like a helpless old lady, but is actually a well-seasoned detective. She is understanding, loyal, and respective to others in the agency. Maple, like Vanderbosh, has grey hair which she wears in a bun. She wears a purple twin-set and half-moon eyeglasses. *Richard \\"Dick\\" Dickens is a credit to British schools everywhere and has a dazzling career ahead of him. He is tutored by the other agents and is very hardworking. Dickens has brown hair which is always neatly combed to one side of his head. He wears a green, sleeve-less sweater (over a lime green shirt) with puffy brown pants and also wears round glasses. *Hannah Dakota is the newest addition to the Blue Toad team and received her invitation when she solved the Dilemma of the Discordant Debutant. She is smart and very attractive, too. Hannah is a blonde-headed detective and has side bangs which are tucked back. She wears a yellow sweater with a green tie and a green skirt. Like Dickens, she also wears round glasses. Episodes=Episode 1: Little Riddle's Deadly Dilemma= The Four Suspects (from Left to Right) The Miller, The Jeweler, The Doctor, and The Station Master. The episode begins with the narrator explaining how the player is on vacation. Mother, the head of The Blue Toad Agency, is said to have sent the player to Little Riddle, a village described to be quite peaceful and comfortable. When the player arrives at the station via train, they see a member of the station staff (the Station Master) locked in a rather one-sided conversation with an old lady. The Station Master notices the player’s approach and seems to recognize the player from the newspaper, as a picture of the Blue Toad Agency members is on the front. The player then has to explain to the Station Master who is who by completing a puzzle. After finishing the puzzle, the player goes to the town hall, where the player meets the Mayor. Halfway through the conversation, the Mayor is shot and his body falls in front of the player. The player notices that the Mayor dropped a diary and picks it up. Soon, a constable arrives at the scene, shocked to see that the Mayor is dead. The player then plays a puzzle to decipher the diary, and learns that the Mayor had been in heated arguments with four people: The Doctor, The Jeweler, The Miller, and The Station Master. After this, the player visits the suspects (the order of which may vary); from the Doctor, it is learned that the chemist misread his prescription, which is why the Mayor was given the wrong pills; from the Jeweler, it is learned (after calculating how much the Mayor paid) that the Mayor still owed the Jeweler money; from the Miller, it is learned that the Mayor had forgotten his appointment with the Miller, in which the Miller had wanted to get his Mill repaired; and finally, from the Station Master, it is learned that he and the Mayor had argued about a tea room, but the Mayor had promised to look into the matter again. The player leaves to try to talk to the Town Hall Clerk, but finds Inspector Bragg, an officer who dislikes the player’s investigation, already questioning her. Tired, the player then checks into the Little Riddle Hotel (after completing a puzzle) before going to the pub. At the pub, the player helps the barmaid fix the pub's pipe problem, then chases down a shadowy figure who the player believes is spying on them. The figure is revealed to be the Constable, sent by Inspector Bragg to keep an eye on the player. In the morning, the player thinks that the old lady that was seen at the station might reveal more about the Mayor. The player learns from the Hotel Manager that her name is Mrs. Gossip. However, the player’s visit to Mrs. Gossip's cottage is of no help. When the player meets the Town Hall Clerk, she tells the player about each of the four suspect's conversations with the Mayor and also points out that the Miller had no appointment. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the Miller was the Mayor's murderer. As the player and Inspector Bragg question him, he is shot before he can reveal his allies. =Episode 2: The Mystery of Riddle Manor= The episode begins with the narrator giving a brief review of the previous episode. The player is shown at the police station, listening to Inspector Bragg, who is blaming the player for the death of the Miller. Bragg says that if the player hadn't alerted the Miller's allies, they wouldn't have shot him. Soon, the Constable arrives, out of breath, and states that there has been a robbery at the Riddle Manor. Riddle Manor is said to have been owned by a woman named Lady Snobbish. The Inspector lets the player go, and the player heads to the Mill to see if they can find anything linked to the Miller's death. After finishing a puzzle, the player finds an old photograph under some sacks. The player then heads to Riddle Manor, where the Constable doesn't allow them to enter through the front, but gives hints that there is an entrance in the back. To do so, the player must go through the Manor's Maze (a puzzle). There, Lady Snobbish and Inspector Bragg are having tea on the veranda. Lady Snobbish tells the Inspector that two people visited her that day: The Vicar and The Colonel. Suspicious, the player pays visits to the two men; at the Vicar's church, the Vicar states that he saw nothing of the unusual at the Manor, but leads the player to Moses, the Vicar's groundskeeper; at Moses's shack, all Moses says is that he saw weeds at the manor; finally, at the pond, the Colonel runs off to see Lady Snobbish once the player tells him that the Manor was robbed. At the Police Station, Inspector Bragg seems quite happy to tell the player that he found the items stolen from the Manor. The Constable corrects him and says that someone else found them, but Bragg does not allow him to reveal who. Outside, though, the Constable tells the player (via hidden message) that the Butcher found the items. When the player arrives at the Butcher's, he describes the items that he found: a walking stick, a Chinese Puzzle Box, and an old writing box. Back at Little Riddle Hotel, the player looks at the photograph that they found and discovers that the young girl in it (along with a lady and a young boy) is Mrs. Gossip. The Hotel Manager then informs the player that a parcel has arrived for them and is at the Post Office. The player goes to the Post Office and retrieves a letter sent by Mother, opening it (and finding a newspaper clipping inside) in privacy at the pond. After doing so, the player heads to the Manor, where Lady Snobbish gives the same description of the missing items as the Butcher, with the exception of one item: an old Prometheus Statue with its hands down. Hopeful, the player visits Mrs. Gossip once again, but like before, the visit is pointless. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Moses was the thief, as when the player visited him, the Prometheus Statue was on his night table. When Inspector Bragg questions him, Moses says that he can't reveal anything because a certain \\"someone\\" would want it that way. =Episode 3: The Mystery of the Concealing Flame= (From L-R) The Colonel, The Doctor, The Librarian, and The Jeweler. Once again, the episode begins with the narrator giving a review of each event in the previous episodes. The Constable, Moses, Inspector Bragg, and the player are shown at the Police Station, with Bragg trying to get Moses to speak the truth. The Inspector soon notices that something outside is on fire. The smoke leads the player to the Town Hall. After extinguishing the fire, the player is informed by the Town Hall Clerk that the fire started in a cabinet in one of the archives. She also gives the player the names of the four visitors who visited the Town Hall that day: The Colonel, The Doctor, The Librarian, and The Jeweler. Upon return to the Little Riddle Hotel, the player learns that Watson—a smart dog and a loyal Blue Toad agent—has also arrived in Little Riddle. Determined to discover something, the player pays visits to the four suspects; at the Doctor's Surgery, it is learned that the Doctor was just researching at the archive, but before that, the player encounters Mrs. Bothersome, who is at first thought to be Mrs. Gossip but is later learned to be her twin sister; at the Library, the Librarian says that she was at the Town Hall to sort out the filing system; the Jeweler states that she was in the archives researching information about a pearl necklace; and the Colonel says that he was \\"doing a bit of reconnaissance\\". After hearing that something is happening at the Antique Shop, the player goes there. The cashier tells the player that someone (wearing a hat pulled down low) was trying to steal a Prometheus statue (one that bears a strong resemblance to the one Moses stole). The cashier also tells the player that there are three of these statues, but then Inspector Bragg arrives and asks the player to leave immediately. The player then visits the Town Hall, where the Town Hall Clerk says that Inspector Bragg has told her not to grant the player permission to look at the archives, but she also says that she is off-duty this evening. At Mrs. Bothersome's cottage, the player finds out that the Doctor is arranging assignations with the Librarian. In the Hotel, the player looks at the newspaper clipping received from Mother’s letter and notices the photo on the back; it is a portrait of Lady Snobbish's grandmother and grandfather, with the grandmother wearing a familiar pearl necklace and a Prometheus statue set on a table behind the couple. When the player visits Riddle Manor and asks Lady Snobbish if she sold the pearl necklace, she states that her father took it when he \\"left\\". Since it is now evening, the player sneaks into the archives, where they find an empty paraffin canister and an intact box of matches. After Watson sniffs the evidence, the player knows who used the two items and goes to the police. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the Librarian was the one who set the fire in the archives. When the Constable and Bragg question the Librarian, she states that she did it for love, but says it wasn't for the Doctor. After her confession, she is hit by a car and dies. =Episode 4: Death From Above= After a brief review of previous events, the Librarian's (whose name is revealed to be Margaret Tess Madding) funeral begins. At the end, the Vicar asks the player to investigate on Moses's behalf, as the Vicar does not believe Moses would do such a heinous crime without a strong motive. As the player stands outside the Church's doors with the Vicar, the Colonel appears and says that he found something. Before he can say what, though, a block falls from the belfry and hits the Colonel, killing him. In the bell tower, the player finds Mrs. Gossip polishing the bells, saying that with Moses in jail, “someone needs to do the cleaning around here”. She also mentions that she thought she saw the Doctor (“a lovely man”, she says) in the belfry. When the player visits the Doctor, he says that Mrs. Gossip's mental state degenerates daily and says that Mrs. Gossip said that she saw him because \\"when she saw him at the funeral, she must have carried the image with her\\". At the Police Station, the Constable informs the player that Moses escaped, as someone knocked down the wall and took Moses with them. In the Colonel's house, there is a lot of information on Lady Snobbish; however, in the safe, the player finds notes on the secret research the counterfeit Colonel was conducting. Apparently, the Miller had been a Snobbish, and had a child. At the Church, the player finds out that the Vicar helped Moses escape, as Moses is in the Church. The Vicar says that \\"he\\" claims it is his son, but the Vicar fears a darker force. At Riddle Manor, the player shows Lady Snobbish the newspaper clipping that Mother sent the player. Lady Snobbish then says that the man in the portrait is her late husband's grandfather, and as she married into the family, she bears no resemblance. When she is asked if there are any other members of the Snobbish family, she heatedly says no. The player visits Mrs. Gossip and after looking at the photograph found under sacks at the Mill (in Episode 2), she recognizes the woman in the picture as Mrs. Wentworth, the late wife of Moses, and the little boy as Charlie, her son. She mentions that Mrs. Wentworth was into the Miller for some time. At the Doctor's surgery, the Doctor conducts a test on the player before giving them pills to take before bed, saying that the player needs something to relieve the pressure on them. He says to come back tomorrow, but not in the morning, as he has an appointment with Lady Snobbish. At night, the player retires to their room in the Hotel, and after taking the pills the Doctor gave them, the player has a dream that leads them to fitting the pieces together in their mind. At the end of the episode, the player puts their suspicions on the Doctor, and thinks that the Doctor is going to murder Lady Snobbish too. When Bragg checks on the Doctor at Lady Snobbish's house, everything is fine. Frustrated, and thinking that he was made a fool of, the Inspector puts the player in prison.

The construction and operation of Swiss railways during the 19th century was carried out by private railways. The first internal line was a 16 km line opened from Zürich to Baden in 1847. By 1860 railways connected western and northeastern Switzerland. The first Alpine railway to be opened under the Gotthard Pass in 1882. A second alpine line was opened under the Simplon Pass in 1906. In 1901, the major railways were nationalised to form Swiss Federal Railways. During the first half of the twentieth century they were electrified and slowly upgraded. After the Second World War, rail rapidly lost its share of the rail market to road transport as car ownership rose and more roads were built. From 1970, the Federal Government has become more involved in upgrading the railways, especially in urban areas and on trunk routes under the Rail 2000 project. In addition, two major trans-alpine routes — the Gotthard Railway and the Lötschberg approach to the Simplon Tunnel — are being rebuilt under the NRLA project. Early railways The first line in Switzerland, the extension of the French Strasbourg–Basel Railway (French: Chemin de fer de Strasbourg à Bâle) from Mulhouse to Basel, reached a temporary station outside Basel's walls on 15 June 1844 and the permanent station on 11 December 1845. (The Chemins de fer de l'Est took over the company in 1854.) The Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway's Rhine Valley Line reached the original Basel Baden railway station in 1855. Despite constant discussion, it took some time before these lines extended into Switzerland. The first internal Swiss line, the 16 km long Swiss Northern Railway (German: Schweizerische Nordbahn, SNB) opened from Zürich to Baden in 1847. Private companies - led by Swiss entrepreneurs, industrialists and bankers - built the next wave of railways. In 1850 the Swiss Federal Council invited two British engineers, Robert Stephenson and Henry Swinburne, to draw up plans for a railway network for the Swiss Confederation. They proposed a 645 km network along the valleys, avoiding any Alpine crossings, all of which was eventually built. Although the Constitution of 1848 gave the federal government powers in relation to railways, it initially decided to decentralise rail policy. The first Railway Act of 1852 gave responsibility for administering policy in relation to the construction and operation of railways to the cantons, including licensing of companies, coordination of lines, technical specifications and pricing policy. Railways were to be built by private limited-liability companies, with contributions to be provided by the municipalities and cantons that stood to benefit from projects. Despite the lack of overall planning and the rivalry among the companies, a rail network similar to that proposed by Stephenson and Swinburne soon formed in northern and western Switzerland, with the completion of a link from the French border in the far west near Geneva to the Austrian border in the far northeast at St. Margrethen on 10 December 1860. original Basel-Olten line opened in 1858 In 1853 the Swiss Central Railway (German: Schweizerische Centralbahn, SCB) began to build the Basel-Olten line through the Hauenstein pass, with branches from Olten to Aarau, Lucerne, Bern and Thun and from Herzogenbuchsee to Solothurn and Biel. At the same time the Swiss Northeastern Railway (German: Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) concentrated on eastern Switzerland in the cantons of Zürich and Thurgau; its network covered the lines from Zürich to Lake Constance and to Schaffhausen and later to Lucerne. The United Swiss Railways (VSB) built lines from Winterthur to Rorschach and from Wallisellen to Rapperswil, Sargans and Chur. There were contracts for sharing the interlinked VSB line between Weesen and Glarus and the NOB line between Ziegelbrücke, Näfels, Glarus and Linthal. During the same period, railways were built in western Switzerland along Lake Geneva from Geneva to Lausanne and Bex and from Morges to Yverdon. A steamship connected Geneva with the line from Le Bouveret to Martigny. The main developer in the inner part of Vaud was the West Switzerland Company (French: Compagnie de l'Ouest-Suisse, OS) and in the Valais the Company of the Line of Italy (French: Compagnie de la Ligne d'Italie, absorbed by the Simplon Company [French: Compagnie du Simplon] in 1874). The Jura–Neuchâtel Railway emerged from lines from Le Locle and Les Verrières along Lake Neuchâtel to La Neuveville. The Canton of Fribourg delayed the construction of the line from Bern to Lausanne in a bid to have it run through the city of Fribourg rather than on flatter land further west; in 1857, the Swiss government, the canton of Vaud and the West Switzerland Company gave in, allowing construction to commence on the line, which opened in 1862. The Canton of Bern attempted to make its own policy in relation to its railways. At the initiative of its Federal politician Jakob Stämpfli the Swiss East–West Railway (German: Schweizerische Ostwestbahn, OWB) started building a line in 1857 - to compete with the Swiss Central Railway - between La Neuveville (on Lake Biel) and Zürich via Bern, Langnau im Emmental, Luzern and Zug, but without raising sufficient finance to guarantee its completion. In June 1861 it went bankrupt; the Canton of Bern took over the completed section from La Neuveville and Langnau and incorporated it as the Bern State Railway (German: Bernische Staatsbahn, BSB), which continued building the line to Lucerne. The missing section from Langnau to Entlebuch and Lucerne was not completed until 1875. The concession for the Zürich–Lucerne line via Affoltern am Albis was taken over by the Zürich–Zug–Lucerne Railway (German: Zürich–Zug–Luzern-Bahn, ZZL), a subsidiary of the NOB. Financial difficulties led to a series of mergers and increased foreign investment in the rail companies. French investment in Switzerland was also stimulated by an interest in Alpine crossings. Many of the original companies merged with the Swiss Northeastern Railway (German: Schweizerische Nordostbahn) and with the United Swiss Railways (German: Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB) in the east and with the Jura–Simplon Railway (French: Compagnie du Jura–Simplon, JS) in the west. Despite the financial difficulties, by 1860 a continuous line extended from Geneva to Lake Constance, and by 1870 other main routes were completed. Steamers connected to the railways across several major lakes: Geneva, Neuchâtel, Thun, Lucerne, and Constance. Connections to the networks of neighboring countries occurred at Romanshorn (by ferries to Lindau and Friedrichshafen), at Basel by rail to the Baden Mainline and to the French Chemins de fer de l'Est, at Schaffhausen to the Baden Mainline and at Les Verrières to the line to Pontarlier and Paris. 1870–1902 The Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) showed up problems of the private railway to cope with the need to move troops quickly, leading to the second Railway Act of 1872. This transferred control of construction, operation, tariffs and accounting of the railways and the licensing of railway companies from the cantons to the federal government. The possibility of federal government nationalisation of the railways also became part of the political agenda. Johann Jakob Sulzer (1806–1883), a Democratic Party politician from Winterthur, founded the Lake Constance–Lake Geneva Railway (German: Bodensee-Genfersee-Bahn), later renamed the Swiss National Railway (German: Schweizerische Nationalbahn, SNB) to overcome shortcomings of the existing railways in providing an adequate and co-ordinated network. It planned to build a line from Lake Constance and Singen to Lausanne via Winterthur, Aargau, Solothurn, Lyss, Murten and Payerne. Construction started in 1875 but it went bankrupt in 1878 and its assets were acquired by the NOB and SCB. =Alpine railways= Contemporary drawing showing a construction locomotive on the Gotthard Railway Before the construction of the Gotthard Railway there were no north-south rail connections to Italy. The railroad lines ended at the foot of the Alps - the VSB reached Chur in 1858, the SCB reached Lucerne and Thun in 1859, and in 1878 the Simplon Railway (part of the Western Switzerland–Simplon Company from 1881) reached Brig. The Swiss railway companies and regions competed to build a railway though various Swiss Alpine passes: the Lukmanier, the Splügen, the Gotthard and the Simplon. In view of the completion of the Brenner Railway to the east in 1867 and the commencement of construction of the Fréjus railway line in 1857 (completed in 1871) in the west, it was decided to build the Gotthard railway and contracts were signed with Swiss, German and Italian contractors in 1869. Despite financial difficulties the line was opened in 1882. In 1878, the Swiss approved in a referendum federal subsidies for an eastern and a western Alpine rail crossing. In 1913 a western Alps was completed, the Lötschberg railway line, but it was not a federal project, but instead it was an initiative of the canton of Bern. No eastern rail crossing has ever been built. Instead the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) opened the Albula line in 1903 and the Bernina Railway completed the Bernina line in 1910, providing a link to Italy. These lines were initially built for tourists, but they were later also used for freight. = Branch lines = In the 1870s, branch lines began to be built. Two-thirds of them were built as narrow gauge lines to reduce costs. Fifty branch lines were built in the period from 1874 to 1877, including the Gäu Railway (German: Gäubahn) between Solothurn and Olten (completed in 1876) and the Broye valley lines near Freiburg (1877), both originally planned by the SNB. Also built during this period were the Emmental railway (German: Emmentalbahn) from Solothurn to Burgdorf and Langnau im Emmental (opened 1875-81) and the Wädenswil–Einsiedeln railway (\\"pilgrim railway\\", opened 1877). Also opened between 1874 and 1881 was the Aargau Southern Railway, from Rupperswil to Rotkreuz, which later became a freight feeder line to the Gotthard railway. The Lake Constance–Toggenburg Railway (from Romanshorn to Nesslau and Swiss Southeastern Railway (German: Schweizerische Südostbahn) connected the east- central to southern Switzerland. The Railway Act of 1852 mandated . The reform of 1872 allowed local and mountain railways to be built with different gauges. The Swiss Company for Local Railways planned a narrow gauge network in the Alpine region, but only succeeded in building the Appenzeller Bahn (Appenzell Railway) because of financial problems. In the Jura region of the Canton of Bern, the Jura Bernois Railway (JB) constructed a railway with massive financial assistance from the Canton of Bern. Between 1873 and 1877, the Jura line with the main railway line between Delle and Basel and the lines from Biel to Sonceboz-Sombeval and Delémont and La Chaux-de-Fonds were built. In the 1880s, narrow gauge lines were built to isolated factories and villages in Vaud and the Jura region. Landwasser Viaduct on the Rhaetian Railway By 1880, railways had been built in the Alpine regions to a few valleys and tourist areas. In the Graubünden, the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), founded in 1889, had developed lines by the outbreak of World War I along the valleys of the Hinterrhein, Vorderrhein, the Albula, the Engadine and the Poschiavo. In the Bernese Oberland, railways were built to connect to the tourist region around Lake Thun. Narrow gauge lines were built in the western Alps, such as the Montreux-Oberland Bernois railway (MOB), the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) and the Gruyère-Fribourg-Morat Railway (GFM). The tourist-oriented Domodossola–Locarno line—also called the Centovalli (Italian for \\"100 valleys\\") railway—was completed in 1923, connecting Ticino and the Valais via Italy. Early twentieth century=Nationalisation= The 1872 Railway Act gave the federal government broad powers in the railway sector. In 1879 the federal government established a new Department of Post and Railways its powers over the railways together with the postal sector. The bankruptcy of several railway companies during the 1870s, rail strikes and opposition to foreign ownership of the railways led to support for the nationalisation of the railways. In 1891, the nationalisation of the SCB was rejected in a referendum, but it was approved by the Federal Council in 1897. A referendum in 1898 was strongly contested, obtaining the highest level of voting participation to that date and won a two-thirds majority. Between 1900 and 1909, the Swiss Confederation acquired the five big railway companies, Jura–Simplon Railway (JS, 937 km), Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB, 771 km), Swiss Central Railway (SCB, 398 km), United Swiss Railways (VSB, 269 km) and the Gotthard Railway (273 km), forming the Swiss Federal Railways (SFR). In 1903 the SBB network took over the metre gauge Brünig Railway (German: Brünigbahn) opened in 1888 and the Swiss shipping line on Lake Constance. It acquired another four small private railways between 1913 and 1948. The negotiated purchase price of more than Swiss Francs 1 billion was criticised, especially as the owners had stopped investing when the debate over nationalisation started. The cost of the nationalisation was not charged directly to the federal budget, but was instead a debt of the SFR. As a result of the high debt burden, the SBB was significantly impeded in its development of the railways until 1944 when it was relieved of the debt resulting from its nationalisation. =Modernisation= The majority of the railway network was single track and its equipment and rolling stock was mostly in poor condition and unable to cope with increasing traffic. The difficult financial situation during the first half of the 20th century limited the modernisation of the Swiss rail network. The main work carried out was electrification, duplication and safety improvements. Electrification started on an experimental basis in 1888 and was completed in 1960. It was accelerated as a result of coal shortages during the two world wars. Of particular note was the early electrification of the Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon line, which was opened in 1913 with single-phase operation. At the beginning of World War II, 77% of the Swiss rail network had been electrified, while other European railways had a level of electrification of 5%. The construction of tunnels shortened distances and improved gradients, allowing the improved handling of traffic growth. The Simplon tunnel between Brig and Iselle, Italy, was opened in 1906. The Mont-d'Or tunnel was opened between Vallorbe and Frasne, France, in 1915 and formed part of the route of the Orient Express between Paris and Istanbul from 1919 to 1962. The Hauenstein base tunnel was opened between Olten and Basel in 1916. =Private railways= Private railways were built to connect cities with suburbs, beginning with the metre gauge Bern-Muri-Worb Railway opened in 1898, now part of Bern-Solothurn Regional Transport. Additional standard gauge suburban lines were built to connect Bern with Thun via the Gürbe Valley (the Gürbe Valley Railway) and with Schwarzenburg and the metre gauge lines were extended to Zollikofen and Solothurn. The Great Depression of the 1930s hit the private railways hard, leading to operating deficits which prevented the renewal of equipment and rolling stock. Under the 1939 Private Assistance Act, the federal government provided financial support to the private railways in return for technical renewal and electrification and the reorganization of the private railways into regional networks. Post World War II Intercity train on the Mattstetten–Rothrist new line Zürich Stadelhofen station on the Zürich S-Bahn 2016: Inauguration of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the first flat route through the Alps After years of heavy investment in roads in the postwar years, the share of rail in the total passenger market in Switzerland had been significantly reduced by the end of the 1960s. At this time, Swiss Federal Railways decided that changes were necessary to increase rail patronage. More trains were operated in order to increase frequencies; this led to a 75% increase in passengers between 1971 and 1983 on the Bern–Zürich route. In the 1970s, the Swiss government and SFR decided to make further improvements in rail services. In 1972, the SFR introduce a regular interval timetable (German: Taktfahrplan). Under this timetable, trains arrive and leave each station at the same minute past every hour. Services at Zurich station were reorganised so that trains arrived on each line before the hour or half-hour and left after the hour or half-hour, making it easier to change to trains on other lines.Kräuchi (2004), p14 =Rail 2000= In the late 1960s, the SFR developed a proposal for a new east-west trunkline (German: Haupttransversale, NHT). This was considered by the Swiss Transport Commission (German: Schweizerischen Gesamtverkehrskommission, GVK). In 1977, after almost six years work, the GVK submitted a 400-page report, which recommended the construction of a new railway between Geneva and Lake Constance and between Basel and Olten. On these routes, a total of 120 kilometres of new line would allow operation of trains at up to 200 kilometres per hour, similar to the French TGVs.Kräuchi (2004), p12Kräuchi (2004), p13 A Federal Government committee supported SFR's proposal but considered that investment should be initially concentrated on the sections of route between Basel, Olten and Bern. This proposal was widely seen as too narrow in its benefits and in mid 1984 the SFR established an expert group under the name Rail 2000 to develop a broader approach. This group developed a plan to improve rail transport throughout Switzerland based on the approach of co-ordinated regular interval trains. The federal parliament voted to approve Rail 2000 in May 1986. In particular, it granted CHF 5.4 billion for the Mattstetten–Rothrist new line between Olten and Bern and for a connection from near Herzogenbuchsee to Solothurn. This was endorsed by a referendum in 1987 with a majority of 57.0%.Kräuchi (2004), p15 =Zürich S-Bahn= After years of debate, a referendum of Zürich Canton agreed, on 29 November 1981, to the borrowing of CHF 520 million for the construction of the main lines for the Zürich S-Bahn, based around a tunnel from the Zürich main station (connecting to the west, south and north) to Zürich Stadelhofen station (connecting to the southeast) and Dietlikon (connecting to the northeast) and Dübendorf (connecting to the east). On 27 May 1990, the S-Bahn was put into operation and then expanded in several phases into the current 380 kilometre long network. =Alpine crossings= In 1996, funding was approved for the upgrading of the two major alpine rail crossings, the Gotthard Railway, including the 57 km long Gotthard Base Tunnel and the Lötschberg Base Tunnel on the approach to the Simplon Tunnel. The Lötschberg Base Tunnel was opened in 2007, but most of its second line has been indefinitely deferred.

Kahn, was a dwarf performer for P. T. Barnum. Biography He was born in 1859 or 1863 in San Francisco to Gabriel Kahn and his wife Caroline. His mother had given birth to ten children, of which three survived. His two dwarf brothers were known as Major Atom and General Pin (born 1881). Their mother was declared insane and jailed after trying to drown General Pin when he was two years old. Barnum wrote: \\"During the week we spent in seeing San Francisco and its suburbs [in 1869], I discovered a dwarf more diminutive than General Tom Thumb was when first I found him, and so handsome, well-formed and captivating, that I could not resist the temptation to engage him. I gave him the soubriquet of Admiral Dot, dressed him in complete Admiral's uniform, and invited the editors of the San Francisco journals to visit him in the parlours of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Immediately there was an immense furore, and Woodward's Gardens, where \\"Dot\\" was exhibited for three weeks before going east, was daily thronged with crowds of his curious fellow citizens, under whose very eyes he had lived so long undiscovered.\\" Starting in 1877 he performed with the American Lilliputian Company. In the 1890s he toured with Adam Forepaugh's circus. He married dwarf Lottie Naomi Swartwood on August 14, 1892. They had two children a daughter Hazel Kahn Golden (1892-1918) and a son Gabriel Kahn (1896-1982). He died of the 1918 influenza pandemic at his home in White Plains, New York on October 28, 1918, aged 59 years.

It received royal assent on 7 November 2002. This Act created a number of changes to the law including:  British Nationals with no other citizenship  The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has also granted British Overseas Citizens, British Subjects and British Protected Persons the right to register as British citizens if they have no other citizenship or nationality and have not after 4 July 2002 renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality. Previously such persons would have not had the right of abode in any country, and would have thus been de facto stateless.  Overseas born children of British mothers  The Act has also conferred a right to registration as a British citizen on persons born between 8 February 1961 and 31 December 1982 who, but for the inability (at that time) of women to pass on their citizenship, would have acquired British citizenship automatically when the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force. In adding a section 4C to the British Nationality Act 1981, a person is entitled to registration if: *the person was born after 7 February 1961 but before 1 January 1983; *the person was born to a mother who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies at the time and the person would have been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent if it had been possible for women to pass on citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies to their children in the same way as men could; and *had the person been a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, they would have had the right of abode in the United Kingdom under the Immigration Act 1971 and would have become a British citizen on 1 January 1983. Registration under both these categories confers British citizenship by descent and hence those with permanent residence in the United Kingdom, or those with the right to take up permanent residence in the United Kingdom, may prefer to apply for naturalisation or section 4 registration instead. Both of these registration categories give British citizenship otherwise than by descent.  Deprivation of British nationality  Under amendments made by the Act, British nationals can be deprived of their citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied they are responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory. This provision applied to only dual nationals-—it is not applicable if deprivation would result in a person's statelessness. Prior to this law, British nationals who acquired that status by birth or descent (as opposed to registration or naturalisation) could not be deprived of British nationality.  Citizenship ceremonies  All new applicants for British citizenship from 1 January 2004 who are aged 18 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and take an Oath of Allegiance and a Pledge to the United Kingdom before their grant of British citizenship can take effect * the requirement for a citizenship ceremony applies to applicants for registration as well as naturalisation * prior to 1 January 2004, British overseas territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British subjects and British Nationals (Overseas), as well of citizens of countries sharing the Queen as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada) were exempt from taking the oath of allegiance. This exemption was abolished. Similar requirements are imposed on applicants for British overseas territories citizenship, with the exception that the Pledge is based on the relevant territory rather than the United Kingdom. It is unusual for adults to acquire British Overseas citizenship or British subject status (application must be made before age 18 and is very rarely granted); however, in such a case only an Oath of Allegiance would be required.  English language requirements  From 28 July 2004, English (or Welsh or Scottish Gaelic) language requirements for naturalisation applicants were increased: * the language competency requirement was extended to those applying for naturalisation as the spouse of a British citizen * evidentiary requirements were increased.  Life in the United Kingdom test  From 1 November 2005, all new applicants for naturalisation as a British citizen must (unless exempted) prove they have passed the Life in the United Kingdom test. * The test must be passed before application is made to the Home Office * Those who pass the test do not need to provide separate evidence of language competency * Those aged 65 or over may be able to claim exemption * Those who attend combined citizenship and English (or Welsh) classes may be exempted from the test Neither the language nor Life in the UK test requirements apply to those seeking registration (as opposed to naturalisation) as a British citizen. Note that passing the test is also required for anyone wishing to remain indefinitely in the UK, whether or not they apply for citizenship. E.g., a husband or wife of a British citizen will be deported if they do not pass the test in time.  Children of unmarried British fathers  With effect from 1 July 2006, children may acquire British citizenship automatically from an unmarried British father (or a British permanent resident if the child is born in the United Kingdom). Proof of paternity must be shown. Children born to unmarried British fathers before 1 July 2006 are not included in this provision. However they can be registered as British citizens upon application to the Home Office (if not British some other way), provided the child is aged under 18 and would have been British had the father been married to the mother. However, the agreement of the mother is needed. If the mother refuses then policy is for the home office to enquire of her reasons for refusal. If her reasons are deemed unreasonable registration may still be granted. Also, the minor can apply in his own right on reaching the age of 17. (As of 6 April 2015, a person over 18 years of age who was born out of wedlock before 1 July 2006 to a British father is entitled to register as a British citizen by descent under the Immigration Act 2014 using form UKF. Such child must also meet character requirements, pay relevant processing fees and attend a citizenship ceremony. However, if the applicant has a claim to register as a British citizen under other clauses of the British Nationality Act 1981, or has already acquired British citizenship after being legitimised, the application will be refused.)

Sokol, a Czechoslovakian immigrant who arrived in Chicago in 1889, entered the food business and by 1902, owned four grocery stores. In 1905, Sokol launched a wholesale coffee, tea and spice business and incorporated the name Sokol & Company in 1907. After World War I, Sokol helped found the Czechoslovak-American Chamber of Commerce and also established European importing contacts to enable his Chicago-based company to purchase herbs and spices. This move helped create the Solo line of food products which was introduced in the 1920s. Canned cake and pastry fillings made from prunes and European-imported poppy seeds became a success. Later the company expanded into dehydrated foods, imported spices and other fruit-based Solo dessert fillings.

Murray, Ph.D., is the Benjamin Peirce Professor of Technology and Public Policy at, and former dean of, the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). In October 2014, she announced via an email to the Harvard community that she would be stepping down from her post at the end of the year, with an interim dean to be named by FAS Dean Michael Smith and a permanent dean following a formal search. She was the 2009 President of the American Physical Society (APS) and Chair of the Division of Engineering and Physical Science of the National Research Council. Biography=Early life and education= Born in Fort Riley, Kansas, and the daughter of a diplomat, Murray lived in the United States, Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, and Indonesia as a child. Murray completed her undergraduate science degree in physics in 1973 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from where she was awarded her Ph.D. in physics in 1978. She then conducted postgraduate and post- doctoral research on ultrahigh-vacuum and surface physics, studying the surface phonons of porous vycor glass with Professor Thomas J. Greytak from 1974 to 1978. During this time, she was awarded with an IBM Graduate Fellowship from 1975 to 1977. =Career= Murray has published more than 70 papers in peer-reviewed journals and holds two patents in near-field optical data storage and optical display technology. Her current primary research focus includes the use of light scattering, soft condensed matter, and complex fluids. Prior to her appointment at SEAS on July 1, 2009, Murray was Principal Associate Director for Science and Technology at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and previously has held numerous research and leadership positions at Bell Laboratories (the last as senior vice president for physical sciences and wireless research). A celebrated experimentalist, Murray is well known for her scientific accomplishments using light scattering, an experimental technique where photons are fired at a target of interest. Scientists can then gather insights into surface physics and photonic behavior by analyzing the spray of photons in various directions from such collisions. She is also a leader in the study of soft condensed matter and complex fluids, hybrid materials that show properties of different phases of matter. The control of suspensions, foams, and emulsions has application for the development of everything from novel drug delivery systems to \\"lab-on-a-chip\\" devices. Murray has served on more than 80 national and international scientific advisory committees, governing boards, and National Research Council (NRC) panels. Murray has also been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. She is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the California Council on Science and Technology. In 2002, Discover magazine recognized Murray as one of the 50 most important women in science. Furthermore, in 1989, Murray won the APS’s Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award for outstanding achievement by a woman physicist in the early years of her career, and in 2005, she was awarded APS’s George E. Pake Prize in recognition of outstanding work combining original research accomplishments with leadership and development in industry. On June 14, 2010, Murray was appointed by Barack Obama to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Murray was a keynote speaker at the 2015 Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders. On December 18, 2015, Murray was sworn in as the Director of the Office of Science at the Department of Energy. She served until January 13, 2017.

He has been listed among the top 8 young economists in the world by The Economist. He holds a B.A. in Mathematics from the Ecole Normale Supérieure, as well as a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University. Gabaix mostly researches asset pricing, behavioral economics, and macroeconomics. He has many notable and highly original research contributions on a number of subjects in financial economics, including the level of compensation of corporate executives, and behaviorally influenced decision making and its influence on asset market behaviour. In some of his work, he has made use of axiom-based models of the shapes of the tails of probability distributions. A hallmark of Professor Gabaix's research style is his propensity to take unexpected directions. He previously held a position as Associate Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bounded Rationality Gabaix continues to work on bounded rationality. His paper A Behavioral New Keynesian Model was called \\"...the most interesting macroeconomic theory paper in years\\" by Bloomberg View in an article titled Answering The Hardest Question In Economics. The article goes on to suggest that the work \\"heralds a sea change in the way macroeconomic theory gets done.\\" Recognition Gabaix was awarded the American Finance Association Fischer Black Prize, 2011. The award is given to a young researcher whose body of work \\"best exemplifies the Fischer Black hallmark of developing original research that is relevant to finance.\\" He was the winner of the 2010 Bernacer Prize to the best European economist under 40 working in macro-finance for his original research contributions in financial and behavioral economics, including the consequences of seemingly irrational behavior on asset markets, and his analysis of the level of compensation of corporate executives. In 2011, he was awarded the Prix du meilleur jeune économiste de France, a prize awarded yearly to a French economist under forty years of age \\"who has combined recognized expertise with active participation in public debate\\". In 2012, he was one of the recipients of the Lagrange Prize for research on complex systems, together with Lada Adamic, a specialist in social networks analysis.

This history can be divided into the military history of China before 1911, when a revolution overthrew the imperial state, and the period of the Republic of China Army and the People's Liberation Army. Pre-modern period Although the traditional Chinese Confucian philosophy favored peaceful political solutions and showed contempt for brute military force, the military was influential in most Chinese states. The Chinese pioneered the use of crossbows, advanced metallurgical standardization for arms and armor, early gunpowder weapons, and other advanced weapons, but also adopted nomadic cavalryH. G. Creel: \\"The Role of the Horse in Chinese History\\", The American Historical Review, Vol. 70, No. 3 (1965), pp. 647–672 (649f.) and Western military technology.Frederic E. Wakeman: The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China, Vol. 1 (1985), , p. 77 In addition, China's armies also benefited from an advanced logistics system as well as a rich strategic tradition, beginning with Sun Tzu's The Art of War, that deeply influenced military thought.Griffith (2006), 1 Modern period=People's Liberation Army= Chinese military history underwent a dramatic transformation in the 20th century, with the People's Liberation Army beginning in 1927 with the start of the Chinese Civil War, and developing from a peasant guerrilla force into what remains the largest armed force in the world. =Republic of China Army= The National Revolutionary Army during World War II The Republic of China Army was founded as the National Revolutionary Army, the armed wing of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang (KMT) in 1924. It participated in the Northern Expedition, the Second Sino-Japanese War (during World War II) and the Chinese Civil War before withdrawing with the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. After 1949, the ROC Army has participated in combat operations on Kinmen and the Dachen Archipelago against the PLA in the Battle of Kuningtou, and in the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. In addition to these major conflicts, ROCA commandos were regularly sent to raid the Fujian and Guangdong coasts. Until the 1970s, the stated mission of the Army was to retake the mainland from the People's Republic of China. Following the lifting of martial law in 1988 and Taiwanese democratization of the 1990s, the mission of the ROC Army has been shifted to the defense of Taiwan, Penghu (the Pescadores Islands), Kinmen and Matsu from a PLA invasion. With the reduction of the size of the ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to emphasize the importance of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. After this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. See \\"Reforming the Armed Forces\\", page 5. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, advanced attack helicopters and armored vehicles, multiple launch rocket systems and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force. See also * List of Chinese wars and battles ReferencesFurther reading * Fravel, M. Taylor.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the appointment of the sitting National Conservative MP, Owen Temple-Morris, as a county court judge. Candidates=Government= The by-election took place during the Second World War. Under an agreement between the Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties, who were participating in a wartime coalition, the party holding a seat would not be opposed by the other two at a by-election.P Addison, By- Elections of the Second World War in C Cook & J Ramsden (eds.) By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 p130 Accordingly, it fell to the Cardiff East Conservatives to choose the successor to Temple-Morris and they unanimously selected Sir James Grigg at the request of Conservative Central Office.The Times, 21 March 1942 p4 Grigg had been a career civil servant, had served at the Treasury and in India and had risen to become Permanent Under- Secretary of State at the War Office. In this role he worked closely and effectively with Sir Alan Brooke the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and in 1942, in an unorthodox move, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill appointed Grigg Secretary of State for War as a replacement for David Margesson whom he dismissed after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese.H F Oxbury, Sir Percy James Grigg in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-09 The timing of Temple-Morris’ appointment as a judge, albeit to replace one who had died,The Times, 14 March 1942 p2 thus creating a vacancy in Cardiff East, the appointment of Grigg as War Secretary necessitating his finding a seat in the House of Commons and the ease with which the Cardiff Tories selected Grigg as their candidate at the behest of party headquarters even though, as he admitted himself, he had no previous connection with the constituency or the Conservative Party The Times, 15 April 1942 p4 strongly suggests that the whole process was engineered by the government. Underlining his lack of party political credentials, Grigg stated that he intended to stand in the by- election as a National candidate without other party label. He said that as a civil servant of 30 years standing it would be unfair to the service to adopt a party affiliation and he said he had none. He declared that he wanted to be the party of national unity at a time of national emergency and that the war had to be won as a nation not by any party ticket.The Times, 30 March 1942 p2 =Independent Labour Party= In accordance with the wartime electoral truce, the Labour and Liberal parties declined to stand candidates but Grigg was opposed by a representative of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Fenner Brockway.The Times, 6 April 1942 p2 Brockway was originally a journalist but became active on the left of British politics. He had been a pacifist and was imprisoned during World War I for opposing conscription and later for being a conscientious objector but his anti-fascism, particularly his support for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War softened his anti-militarism. He had been Labour MP for Leyton East from 1929-1931 but after the 1931 general election the ILP disaffiliated en masse from the Labour Party and formed a separate political party.David Howell, Archibald Fenner Brockway in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-09 Brockway also fought elections unsuccessfully for the ILP at West Ham, Upton in 1934 in a by-election; at Norwich in the 1935 general election and at Lancaster at a by-election in 1941.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 pp 206, 275 & 399 Issues The main election issue was the prosecution and conduct of the war. Grigg declared his support for the armed forces and his plans to improve equipment and training and he promised to continue to develop new weapons and devices by involving scientists in the war effort. He urged the press to cease attacks on the military leadership and the performance of the armed forces, accusing those parts of the media who did so of doing Hitler’s work. In his election address Grigg wholeheartedly associated himself and his candidacy in the by-election with the fight to rid the world of Nazi and Japanese domination and to build from the wreck of the old world a better and more just new one with equality of opportunity for all.The Times, 9 April 1942 p2 Grigg also fired a similar salvo at Brockway, claiming that he was opposed to Britain's fighting the war and warned that unless Brockway was defeated decisively, Britain's enemies would be encouraged.The Times, 13 April 1942 p2 In his election address, Brockway stated that the policy of a socialist Britain would not be to negotiate with Hitler but to appeal to the peoples of Europe to overthrow him.The Times, 11 April 1942 p2 The ILP campaign emphasised the importance of socialism and the need for solidarity with the Soviet Union. However the Communists were said to be supporting the National candidate and they accused the ILP of trying to sabotage the united front against fascism.The Times, 10 April 1942 p2 The Labour movement through the local organising secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, John Dooley, also made clear their support of Grigg in line with official Labour Party policy. The result Grigg was returned comfortably with 75% of the poll, albeit on the relatively low turnout of 33%. The by-elections of the Second World War showed evidence of the role of the war in initiating a leftward swing in British politics Addison, By-Elections of the Second World War in C Cook & J Ramsden (eds.) p148 so pointing the way towards the coming electoral landslide for Labour in 1945. They also offered voters an opportunity to rebel against the electoral truce as the success of Common Wealth and Independent candidates in a number of wartime by-elections showed.P Addison, The Road to 1945: British Politics and the Second World War; Quartet Books, 1977 p249 However, Cardiff East was not one of these elections. A genuine cross party backing for the non-partisan figure of Sir James Grigg, a patriotic desire to support Grigg in his vital position of Secretary for War and the perception of the ILP as an extremist and anti-war organisation, all combined to ensure that Cardiff East bucked the anti-government trend of a number of mostly later by-elections.

The Maldives first established a mission in Sri Lanka in July 1965, and today has a High Commission in Colombo. Sri Lanka has an embassy in Malé. Both countries were founding members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in December 1985. History The earliest settlers in the Maldives were probably from southern India. Indo-European speakers followed them from Sri Lanka in the fourth and fifth centuries BC. In the 12th century AD, sailors from East Africa and Arab countries came to the islands. Today, the Maldivian ethnic identity is a blend of these cultures, reinforced by religion and language. According to Maldivian legend, a Sinhalese prince named KoiMale was stranded with his bride, daughter of the king of Sri Lanka, in a Maldivian lagoon and stayed on to rule as the first sultan. The Maldivians speak Dhivehi, closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka. The Maldives became a British Protectorate in the 19th century and the Maldivian monarchs were granted a good measure of self-governance. The Maldives gained total independence in 1965, and soon after established formal diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka. Both the Maldives and Sri Lanka were part of the British Empire. The Sultan of the Maldives would pay tribute to their British suzerains in an annual ceremony every November whereby an envoy would present tribute and gifts to the Governor of Ceylon at the Queen's House in Colombo. This was notable as the only diplomatic function held in Colombo prior to independence. Both the Maldives and Sri Lanka are Commonwealth republics. Official relations In July 1976 the governments of the Maldives, Sri Lanka and India reached an agreement fixing the trijunction point between the three countries in the sea beyond the Gulf of Mannar. In April 2006 officials including the Ministers of Education from the two countries participated in a 5-day workshop sponsored by UNESCO to establish plans for measuring progress towards EFA (Education for All) goals. In February 2007, the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa made a three-day official visit to the Maldives, expected to further consolidate the existing bilateral links between the two countries, and to strengthen cooperation in trade, tourism, education, and fisheries. At a January 2009 meeting of energy ministers and senior officials of SAARC countries in Colombo, the two countries discussed closer collaboration in joint energy policies. In June 2009, the then President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed made a two-day official visit to Sri Lanka where he met with the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and discussed issues of bilateral and regional interest. Mr. Nasheed congratulated Mr. Rajapaksa on eliminating LTTE terrorism. Defence Maldives Defence Forces trained by Sri Lanka Military. Specially Special Forces of the MNDF were trained at the Sri Lanka Army Commando Regiment regiment school and Sri Lanka Army Special Forces Regiment training academy in Maduru Oya, Sri Lanka. Maldivian Coast Guard fleet consists of vessels made by Colombo Dockyard. Economic relations Until the early 1970s, 65% of the Maldives imports from South Asia came from Sri Lanka, compared to 32% from India. The economy of the Maldives is heavily dependent on tourism, with tour operators often based in Sri Lanka and packages including both countries. In 2006 Sri Lanka Telecom and the Maldives state-run telephone company Dhivehi Raajjeyge Gulhun commissioned a US$20 million joint venture to lay an undersea fibre-optic cable connecting Male to Colombo, Sri Lanka, with Japan’s NEC Corp as the main supplier. In 2005, the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank, launched the US$10 million Sri Lanka-Maldives Enterprise Development Program to assist small and medium enterprises in the two countries. Environmental issues The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which occurred on December 26 that year, caused great damage in both Maldives and Sri Lanka, as well as other Indian Ocean nations. In response, with assistance from the United States, the US$16.6 million Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS) was established in 2005 to set up monitoring systems and share information between the nations at risk. Global warming is a severe threat to the Maldives, with most of the islands less than above sea level. The then President, Mohamed Nasheed had said he planned to set aside some of the US$1 billion a year it receives from tourism to buy a new homeland. He had approached the government of Sri Lanka, among others, and was said to have received a favourable reception.

On 3 November 2007, then-President Pervez Musharraf declared a Provisional Constitutional Order, which declared a state of emergency and suspends the Constitution of Pakistan. Under this emergency law, all High court judges, including the Supreme Court justices, were asked to take oath under this Provisional Constitutional Order. Those who didn't were placed under effective house arrest. A seven-member bench issued a restraining order on the same day, barring the government from implementing emergency rule and urging other government officials to not help do so. The Provisional Constitutional Order Judges case has been examining the constitutionality and legality of the steps taken by Musharraf in declaring a state of emergency, and considering contempt of court charges against justices who took oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order in violation of the restraining order. Background On 3 November 2007, Musharraf declared a Provisional Constitutional Order, which suspended the Constitution of Pakistan and declared a state of emergency. High court judges were asked to take oath under the new Provisional Court Order. Approximately 100 judges refused to take this oath, and were placed under house arrest. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was one of these judges. He was dismissed and replaced by Chief Justice Dogar. On 3 November 2007, a restraining order was issued by a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court to bar the government from implementing emergency rule. In a statement smuggled out of Chaudhry's residence, Chaudry said: Dogar almost immediately declared void Chaudry's ruling that the emergency state and Provisional Constitutional Order were unconstitutional. Case=July 2009= In July 2009, the then- Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khawaja Muhammad Sharif referred to the Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan a list of names of justices who took oath under the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order, stating that doing so went against the restraining order issued on 3 November 2007. By taking this oath, the judges swore to abide by the 2007 Proclamation of Emergency, the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order No. 1, and the Code of Conduct established by the Supreme Judicial Council. This referral caused the Supreme Court to first decide it could begin contempt of court charges against many of the higher court justices who took the oath. It also caused President Asif Ali Zardari to issue orders declaring that the 76 judges that had taken the oath would no longer hold office until the decision on 31 July 2009. These judges were spread throughout the Pakistan Supreme Court, Lahore High Court, Sindh High Court, Peshawar High Court, and the Islamabad High Court. =After 31 July 2009 verdict= Justices Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon and Anwarul Haq Pannun filed petitions to review the 31 July 2009 verdict. The two justices' complaints included: *They had not been heard before being condemned *They had taken oath, but did not take oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order. *Dogar had taken oath, along with four other judges, which violated the 3 November 2007 restraining order *This violation made both his appointment and all appointments by his recommendation unconstitutional *Dogar had taken oath as Chief Justice while another Chief Justice was in office *The decision was retroactive to the 3 November 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order, but not to that of the 1999 Pakistani coup d'état *There were those who took oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order who were not being prosecuted *The judgement didn't follow Article 209 of the Constitution, which says that judges must refrain from deciding cases involving their own interests *The oath administered by Dogar to President Zardari should not be considered to be valid if the oaths administered to other judges are not After the 31 July decision, contempt of court notices were issued to the judges who took the Provisional Constitutional Order oath. On 9 November 2010, a four-member Supreme Court bench took up the contempt of court charges against the nine justices who have not apologised for taking the oath. Although these judges petitioned the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court rejected the petitions and will go on with the contempt of court proceedings. Objections to the composition of the bench were raised by Justice Abdul Baist against the presence of Justices Sair Ali, Tariq Pervez, and Shahid Siddiqui. Following these objections, Ali refused to be part of the bench and requested Chaudhry create a new bench to hear the case. On 11 December 2010, Dogar also challenged the bench presiding over the case, on the grounds that two of the judges making up the bench had been appointed per his recommendation. However, this challenge was rejected. On 3 March 2011, Dogar and Zahid Hussain apologised to the Supreme Court. Chaudhry accepted their apologies. The Supreme Court has asked Attorney General Maulvi Anwar ul Haq to provide a statement on behalf of the government detailing the legal status of the judges who took the oath. The Supreme Court has supposedly also issued contempt of court notices to Musharraf, former premier Shaukat Aziz, the former corps commanders, and the current Chief of Army Staff Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. However, this has been denied by Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan president Asma Jahangir. She blames this mistake on the media for misinterpreting the Court's decision. Decisions=31 July 2009= On 31 July 2009, after hearing constitutional petitions concerning PCO judges, the appointment of judges, and the steps taken in declaring the 2007 Pakistani state of emergency, the Pakistan Supreme Court decided the declaration of emergency rule by Musharraf to be unconstitutional under Article 279 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The Supreme Court also declared the steps taken in declaring the state of emergency to be null and void, and specifically stated that the removal of judges was unconstitutional and illegal. This included the removal from office of the Chaudhry and other justices. The appointment of Dogar and of all justices between 3 November 2007 and 24 March 2008 was deemed unconstitutional. Musharraf's increase to the number of justices, accomplished through a finance bill, was declared unconstitutional, and the number of justices was set at seventeen. The verdict did not change the legality of the new government, nor that of the presidential oath taken by Zardari. The verdict also referred the issue of the Provisional Constitutional Order judges to the Supreme Judicial Council. Reaction=31 July 2009 verdict= The 31 July 2009 verdict was warmly received outside of the Supreme Court and across Pakistan. Candy was distributed after the announcement, and people were chanting slogans in support of the decision. The verdict was also welcomed by the spokesperson to Zardari, Farhatullah Babar, who said that \\"The Supreme Court short order today declaring the November 3, 2007 actions of General Pervez Musharraf as unconstitutional is a triumph of the democratic principles, a stinging negation of dictatorship and is most welcome.\\" Jahangir, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, spoke out strongly against the issuance of contempt of court notices to the judges, saying that the Supreme Judicial Council, not the Supreme Court, should not be hearing the case. Jahangir was subsequently asked by the Supreme Court Bar Association to keep from issuing statements on the matter, and to not suggest that her personal opinion reflected the opinion of the Supreme Court Bar Association.

In 1898 Zacharka was mobilized to the Russian army and was demobilized in 1902. By that time he already was member of a large Belarusian national organization, the Belarusian Socialist Assembly.

In exile  Grave of Vasil Zacharka in Prague With the Bolshevik invasion of Belarus in 1919, the government of Belarus had to evacuate to Vilnius and then to Hrodna. Zacharka was among the creators of appeals to the League of Nations, Great Britain, France, USA and other countries by the Belarusian government.Імёны Свабоды: Васіль Захарка On June 2, 1920 Zacharka was appointed chief of the Belarusian diplomatic mission to Moscow where he held negotiations with the Russian foreign minister Georgy Chicherin. Zacharka tried to convince the Soviets to recognize the independence of Belarus and to liberate Belarusian political prisoners held in Russian jails. After the Peace of Riga in 1921 the Belarusian government in exile passed resolutions criticizing it and supporting the Slutsk defence action. In 1925 Zacharka managed to prevent the government of the Belarusian People's Republic to abandon its authority in favour of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, despite the fact that many members of the democratic government were advocating this idea. Zacharka served as deputy president of the Belarusian People's Republic Piotra Krecheuski and became president upon his death in early 1928. As president he protested against the transferral of Vilnius from the Belarusian SSR to the Republic of Lithuania in October 1939. On 20 April 1939 Zacharka sent together with Ivan Yermachenka a seventeen-page memorandum to Adolf Hitler personally asking him to take into account the interests of Belarus in any future developments.Leonid Rein: The kings and the pawns.

The director, Éric Guirado, had previously made television documentaries about traveling grocers in rural France. The film, released in France as Le Fils de l'épicier, was first presented as part of the 2007 Namur Francophone Film Festival. It was sufficiently successful that in 2008 subtitled versions were released internationally. Synopsis It concerns Antoine (played by Nicolas Cazalé), who must leave Lyon to help his mother (Jeanne Goupil) who runs the family grocery store in a village in Southern France. His father (Daniel Duval), stricken with a heart attack, can no longer drive the grocery truck that supplies the isolated hamlets around the village. Antoine discovers the charm of these people, \\"bons vivants\\" (good living) ways and gradually comes to love his eccentric customers and finds the country of his childhood. He also discovers the joy of living and perhaps the joy of love with Claire (played by Clotilde Hesme). The film uses the beautiful landscape of Mont Sainte-Victoire as a regular backdrop. Cast * Nicolas Cazalé as Antoine Sforza (the Grocer's son). * Clotilde Hesme as Claire. * Daniel Duval as Antoine's father, the proprietor of Alimentation Générale (lit. Grocery). * Jeanne Goupil as Antoine's mother and the proprietress. * Stéphan Guérin-Tillié as François Sforza (Antoine's brother). * Liliane Rovère as Lucienne (a customer). * as Le Père Clèment. * as Hassan. * Benoit Giros as Fernand. * Ludmila Ruoso as Sophie. Other credits *Producers - Miléna Poyle and Gilles Sacuto *Music - Christophe Boutin *Production record—TS Production, Rhône-Alpes Cinéma, StudioCanal *Location - Rosans, commune in Provence Reception The film received good reviews from several noted critics writing in English. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"The summer unfolds slowly. Claire goes back to Paris. The father arrives from Paris. The countryside is calm and seductive. The mother soldiers on, keeping the store open late \\"to help people.\\" And Antoine comes of age. That's all the film is, apart from having humor, warmth, kindness, insight and scenery. That's enough.\\" Ebert's statement that the city of the film is Paris is likely incorrect; the city where Antoine and Claire are living at the film's start is Lyon. Nicolas Cazale was nominated for the César Award for Most Promising Actor (the French Academy Award) for his performance as the Grocer's son.

It is a chasmosaurine ceratopsian which lived during the Late Cretaceous period (late Campanian stage) in what is now southern Coahuila in northern Mexico. It is known from the holotype CPC 276, a partial skeleton of an adult individual which includes several skull elements. Another specimen, CPS 277, may represent a juvenile Coahuilaceratops. All specimens of Coahuilaceratops were collected from a single location in the middle strata of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation, which dates to between 72.5 and 71.4 million years ago.Loewen, M.A., Sampson, S.D., Lund, E.K., Farke, A.A., Aguillón- Martínez, M.C., de Leon, C.A., Rodríguez-de la Rosa, R.A., Getty, M.A., Eberth, D.A., 2010, \\"Horned Dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Coahuila, Mexico\\", In: Michael J.

Although based on incomplete remains, Coahuilaceratops is thought to possess among the largest horns of any dinosaur currently known, rivaling in absolute size those of larger chasmosaurines like Triceratops and Torosaurus.

Inc.\\", is a grassroots nonprofit environmental organization based out of the Tampa Bay Area. It was instrumental in bringing the concept of volunteers raising and then planting trees along the interstates, roadways, and in parks of the greater Tampa Bay Area to beautify and preserve the environment. To date, T.R.E.E. Inc. has planted over 28,712 trees. Early years 1983-1987 The organization started out as a small group of friends that wanted to see more trees being planted in the Tampa Bay Area. These friends took that purpose, moved forward on their own time and expense, and on February 8, 1983, T.R.E.E. Inc. was incorporated under Florida law. T.R.E.E. Inc.'s modus operandi throughout most of its existence had been to purchase bare root tree seedlings, container grow them in 1-gallon containers for one growing season, step them up into 3-gallon containers for a second growing season and donate or out-plant them prior to their third growing season. The variety of tree that was most commonly used during this period was the Genetically Improved or Superior North Florida Slash Pine (Pinus elliottii var. \\"elliottii\\"). It was selected due to its adaptability, rapid growth and relative ease of maintenance after establishment. Hardwood trees during that time were typically purchased as 4\\" potted seedlings. Varieties typically used were Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), Pignut Hickory (Carya glabra) and Loblolly Bay (Gordonia lasianthus). Transition years 1988-1989 In January 1988, William Moriaty stepped down as President so that he could relocate to Gainesville, Florida with his wife Karen Cashon as she would be attending the University of Florida later that year. As a result, an almost entirely new slate of Directors served from 1988 to 1989. Vice President Bob Scheible was the only Founding member to serve during this two-year period in the same capacity that he did at the organization's creation. Major program initiatives, 1990-2004 1990 was the major turning point that would set the stage for revised and newly created corporate philosophies that would guide T.R.E.E. Inc. for well over the next decade of its existence. The Genetically Improved or Superior North Florida Slash Pine began to lose favor to the locally indigenous Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris), \\"Ocala\\" Race Sand Pine (Pinus clausa) and South Florida Slash Pine (Pinus elliottii var. \\"densa\\"). The availability of Florida grown bare root hardwood seedlings further broadened the plant palette to include Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), Tulip Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) as well as dependable stand-bys, Sweetgum and Pignut Hickory. Due to a major push by members living in Pinellas County, Florida, the organization's name was changed through Florida law on July 24, 1991 from its original title of Tampa Reforestation and Environmental Effort, Inc. to Tampa Bay Reforestation and Environmental Effort, Inc. On August 9, 1991, T.R.E.E. Inc. was awarded 501 (c) (3) tax exempt status from the United States Internal Revenue Service as an Educational organization. Major sponsors and new programs 2005 to present Beginning in 2005, T.R.E.E. Inc. secured its first major sponsor, Esurance. Esurance is an on-line insurance provider based out of San Francisco, California. Beginning with the esurance St. Pete Beach Tree-Athalon planting on September 24, 2005, T.R.E.E. Inc. has had an additional ten volunteer tree plantings sponsored by Esurance. The Esurance plantings were a radical departure from T.R.E.E. Inc.'s previous plantings which were conducted almost solely through the use of 3-gallon material grown at its own nursery. This gave T.R.E.E. Inc. the unprecedented opportunity to plant large sized 30-gallon trees, affording it the opportunity to finally conduct plantings with a much higher visual impact. In addition, the Esurance projects led to a gradual phasing out of T.R.E.E. Inc. having to depend so heavily upon its own nursery to obtain trees. In addition to the Esurance plantings, T.R.E.E. Inc. began introducing programs such as the Tulip Poplar Repopulation Program, Orange and Seminole Counties, Florida where East Central Florida Eco-Type Tulip Poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) grown from seed of trees native to that area have been planted since that time in Orlando, Winter Park, Altamonte Springs, Sanford, and Casselberry, Florida. Similar programs include the Longleaf Pine Repopulation Program in Temple Terrace, Florida and the Egmont Key Reforestation Initiative at Egmont Key State Park in Hillsborough County, Florida. In December 2008, T.R.E.E. Inc. received a major contribution from The Home Depot Foundation and was also instrumental in assisting the National Football League's Environmental Program and Florida Forest Service with a Super Bowl Trail of Trees planting initiative in April 2009. In August 2017 created a checklist of the \\"Trees and Palms of the Botanical Treasure Gardens of the Plant City Commons Community Garden (Occupying the location formerly known as the Teaching Garden of the University of Florida), Plant City Campus, Hillsborough Community College, 2001 E. Cherry Street, Plant City, Florida\\". In September 2019 received a $1,000 Mini-Grant from C & S Wholesale Grocers of Keene, New Hampshire. On May 18, 2020, a new logo for the organization was adopted and has replaced the pine and oak rendition logo that had been used since 1983. Awards Received \\"Award of Greatest Merit in the Partnership Category\\" in 1991 from the Florida Urban Forestry Conference for its partnering with the Florida Department of Transportation for tree plantings along the Tampa Bay area's interstate highways. Received two major awards in 2019: \\"Organization of the Year\\" from the City of St. Petersburg's Parks and Recreation Department, and \\"Project of the Year\\" from the Hillsborough Soil and Water Conservation District. Mission There are five major components to the organization's Mission: # Beautify and reforest the Tampa Bay area through the planting of native trees. # Further public awareness about the merits of reforesting public lands. # Further public awareness about the planting and preserving of native trees and underutilized trees of special interest. # Work in conjunction with, and in support of, other organizations similar purpose. # Be a clearinghouse of scientific and educational information to the public on the merits of tree species selection for use in the Tampa Bay area in accordance with the intent of its I.R.S. tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. Accomplishments T.R.E.E. Inc. has over the past 37 years: * Conducted 535 reforestation projects. * Furnished the original design, and subsequent installation on November 23, 1996, of what would become the Richard T.

Until 2012, this Centre coordinated the representative health survey of 11- to 15-year-olds in Germany carried out throughout Europe as part of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. Each assessment wave includes more than 6,000 randomly selected school children from all parts of Germany. From 1996 to 2004, he was also Director of the Institut für Bevölkerungsforschung und Sozialpolitik (Institute for Demographic Research and Social Policy). In March 2009, Hurrelmann became Professor of Public Health and Education at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. His main research interest is to develop a comprehensive theory of socialisation, on the theoretical level, and to develop comprehensive intervention strategies for preventing social disadvantage and health impairments in childhood and adolescence, on the empirical research level.

The theoretical approach he developed for these research topics does not only influence sociology but also research projects in the field of pedagogy, psychology, health science, and social medicine. He directed several projects on the role family and school conditions play in the development of personality and achievement, the correlation between socialisation and health, and the prevention of risk behavior, especially violence, addiction and psychosomatic health disorders. = Socialisation research = Central to Hurrelmann's theory of socialisation is the tension between the individual and society. He defines socialisation as the individual's personality development resulting from productively processing internal and external reality. An individual's internal reality is formed by bodily and mental dispositions and traits; the external reality, by the properties of the social and physical environment. The processing of reality is productive because individuals live their lives actively and try to master the developmental tasks they have to face during the entire life course. Most noted and also often discussed at schools and universities, particularly in pedagogy, social sciences and health sciences, is his “Model of Productive Processing of Reality (PPR)”. The core assumption of this model is that “personality does not form independently from society any of its functions or dimensions but is continuously being shaped, in a concrete, historically conveyed life world, throughout the entire space of the life span”.Hurrelmann, K. 1988 Social Structure and Personality Development. New York: Cambridge University Press (reprint 2009), p. 42 The PPR model places the human subject in a social and ecological context that must be absorbed and processed subjectively. The human being as an autonomous subject has the lifelong task to harmonize the processes of social integration and personal individualization. Across the entire life span, individuals master this task in age-appropriate steps matching their level of development.Hurrelmann, K. & Bauer, U. 2018 Socialisation During the Life Course. London/New York: Routledge These “developmental tasks” are: education/qualification, attachment/social contacts, consumption/regeneration, and participation/value orientation. In this sense, socialisation consists in a complex “continuous work on one's own personality.” It may succeed, but, under unfavorable conditions, it may also fail. Failure leads to problems with identity, personality, and health.Hurrelmann, K. & Quenzel, G. 2019. Developomental Tasks in Adolescence. London/New York: RoutledgeSchulenberg, J., Maggs, J. & Hurrelmann, K. (Eds.) 1997 Health Risks and Developmental Transitions during Adolescence. New York: Cambridge University PressHurrelmann, K. & Hamilton, S.F. (Eds.) 1996 Social Problems and Social Contexts in Adolescence. New York: Aldine = Childhood, adolescence, and generation research = Klaus Hurrelmann has concentrated on applying his developmental task concept to the life phases of childhood and adolescence. He identifies the central developmental tasks in infancy and early childhood as gaining a basic emotional trust, developing communication skills and attachment behavior, developing the ability to express oneself verbally, identifying with one's own gender, and building up basic sensory and motor skills. In later childhood from the age of six onward, these tasks are joined by developing female or male role behavior; learning basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic; and forming competencies in dealing with the media and leisure time. This approach understands children as autonomous subjects who are productively engaged in shaping their lives.Neubauer, G. & Hurrelmann, K. (Eds.) 1996 Individualization in Childhood and Adolescence. Berlin/New York: De GruyterAndresen, S., Fegter, S., Hurrelmann, K. & Schneekloth, U. (Eds.) 2017 Well-being, Poverty and Justice from a Child’s Perspective. Cham: Springer International Publishing Hurrelmann conceives adolescence as an autonomous life phase that has inserted itself between childhood and adulthood over the last 100 years. This phase of life generally lasts for about 15 years. Nowadays, it is beginning earlier than ever before in human history, because children reach puberty at an increasingly early age.Hurrelmann, K. (Ed.) 1994 International Handbook of Adolescence. Westport: Greenwood PublishersChisholm, L. & Hurrelmann, K. 1995 Adolescence in modern Europe. Pluralized transition patterns and their implications for personal and social risks. Journal of Adolescence 18, 129-158Hurrelmann, K. & Quenzel, G. 2013 Lost in transition. Status insecurity and inconsistency as hallmarks of modern adolescence. International Journal of Adolescence and Youth doi.org/10.1080/02673843.2013.785440 At the other end, however, adolescence is more open than ever before and has become basically unplannable. This impacts on the mastering of developmental tasks: In the areas of education and qualification the demands are rising; the separation from parents and the development of own attachments are being postponed, and the acquisition of competencies as a consumer, user of media, economic citizen, as well as participation in politics and society are more and more considered as tasks that have to be managed on one's own responsibility. As a consequence, several developmental problems arise.Hurrelmann, K. & Engel, U. (Eds.) 1990 The Social World of Adolescents. Berlin/New York: De GruyterNestmann, R. & Hurrelmann, K. (Eds.) 1994 Social Network and Social Support in Childhood and Adolescence. Berlin/New York: De GruyterHurrelmann, K. & Lösel, F. (Eds.) 1990 Health Hazards in Adolescence. Berlin/New York: De GruyterHurrelmann, K. 1990 Health promotion for adolescents. Preventive and corrective strategies against problem behavior. Journal of Adolescence 13, 231-250 According to Hurrelmann, social background and gender are the main determinants for the successful completion of the developmental tasks to be mastered during this phase of life. In this regard, male adolescents seem to have problems coping with these developmental tasks to an increasing extent. Drawing on the work of Karl Mannheim, Hurrelmann links this approach to generational research. His aim is to work out how technological, economic, and political events shape personality in generation-specific ways. This reveals how the need to deal permanently with unpredictable futures and uncertain life perspectives is leading to a mentality of tentatively probing and pragmatically testing alternatives in the young generation born between 1985 and 2000. Klaus Hurrelmann calls these members of the current young generation, which he also labels “Generation Y,” “ego tacticians.” Recently, research on the youngest generation, born between 2000 and 2015, has been initiated. These young people are usually called \\"Generation Z\\". Hurrelmann argues for the nomination \\"Generation Greta\\", because of the high influence of the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on attitudes and behaviour of the \\"Post-Millennials\\". His theoretical approaches to adolescence have been applied in many empirical studies. Alongside the Collaborative Research Centre “Prevention and Intervention in Childhood and Adolescence,” these particularly include the Shell Youth Studies. Klaus Hurrelmann designed the new generation of Shell Youth Studies that have been carried out since 2002 together with the Infratest-Kantar social research institute.Shell Deutschland (Hg.) 2019 18. Shell Jugendstudie. Coordination M. Albert, K. Hurrelmann, G. Quenzel et al. Weinheim: Beltz Recently, these have been joined by studies on vocational training and career choices in youth and on future pensions and finances of adolescents and young adults. = Educational research = Klaus Hurrelmann's work in educational research focuses on how the starting conditions in families along with the way schools are organized determine academic success and failure. He uses his socialisation theory to explain this in terms of differences in the guidance and support given by parents.Hurrelmann, K. 1987 The importance of school in the life course, Journal of Adolescent Research 2, 111-125Hurrelmann, K., Engel, U., Holler, B. & Nordlohne, E. 1988 Failure in school, family conflicts and psychosomatic disorders in adolescence. Journal of Adolescence 10, 237-249Petersen, A.C., Leffert, N. & Hurrelmann, K. 1993 Adolescence and schooling in Germany and the United States. Teachers College Record 94, 611-629 Klaus Hurrelmann's studies show how the design of the school system in Germany and the teaching process also contribute to the poor performance of children from families with low socioeconomic status. The early tracking of students into the three-tier system of Hauptschule, Realschule, and Gymnasium following elementary school systematically disadvantages children who receive little encouragement to learn in their families. Ever since the 1970s, Klaus Hurrelmann has been calling for Hauptschule, Realschule, and comprehensive schools to be merged into one type of integrated school with its own senior classes oriented toward the labor market and careers that will offer an educational alternative to the academic Gymnasium. This should reduce the pressure on parents and children to decide on the future course of education at the young age of 10 years. All school-leaving qualifications should be possible at both types of school. This approach, which he calls the “two-path model,” was introduced in the East German federal states in 1989/90 following the unification of the two Germanys. Since then, many West German federal states have also adopted this reform. Klaus Hurrelmann emphasizes the need to promote both achievement-related and social competencies in all educational institutes. An important element of such approaches is to integrate the promotion of exercise, good nutrition, and relaxation techniques in school curricula to help children and adolescents to master their age-specific developmental tasks. Klaus Hurrelmann also calls for parents and professional childcare and teaching personnel to cooperate intensively in negotiating their different childrearing concepts. He bases this approach on a “Magical childrearing triangle” with the three poles “Recognition”, “Encouragement”, and “Guidance”. He also supports compulsory parent training and favors the introduction of a symbolic “parenting license.” = Health research = Klaus Hurrelmann's work in health research focuses on the interface between the sociology of health and health education. He has taken a leading role in this field.Hurrelmann, K. & Laaser, U. (Eds.) 1996 International Handbook of Public Health. Westport: Greenwood Publishers His definition of health has been very influential: “Health denotes the state of well-being in individuals when their mental and social situation matches their potentials and goals within the specifically given external living conditions.” Health is accordingly the state of balance between risk and protective factors that emerges when an individual succeeds in mastering both internal (bodily and mental) and external (social and material) demands. It grants the individual well-being and vitality.Hurrelmann, K. 1989 Human Development and Health. New York: Springer, p. 5 This definition is now being viewed as a further development of the traditional definition of health from the World Health Organization (WHO). It is being applied in many disciplines within the health sciences.Hurrelmann, K. & Richter, M. 2020 Understanding Public Health. New York/London: Routledge An important line of research for Klaus Hurrelmann is prevention and health promotion. Many of his research projects have focused on the social determinants of health and illness in children and adolescents. They show how the social inequality among children and adolescents also extends to health.Hurrelmann, K., Rathmann, K. & Richter, M. 2011 Health inequalities and welfare state regimes. Journal of Public Health 19, 3-13 They focus particularly on analyzing the health-related behavior of children and adolescents.Rathmann, K., Bilz, L., Hurrelmann, K., Kiess, W. & Richter, M. 2018 Is being a \\"small fish in a big pond\\" bad for students' psychosomatic health?

In its four years of existence, fifty- two singles on the MTM label charted on the Billboard country singles chart. The label also signed three rock music acts: The Metros from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who were discovered on Star Search; In Pursuit, a New Wave rock group, and The Voltage Brothers, a family R&B; act from Philadelphia. None of those groups' output charted. When MTM's catalogue was purchased by RCA, Becky Hobbs, Paul Overstreet, and Judy Rodman were transferred to RCA's roster. Holly Dunn then signed with Warner Bros. Nashville, and her MTM masters went with her (Warner Bros. re-released the original MTM hit version of Dunn's hit, \\"Daddy's Hands,\\" as the B-side of her 1990 hit single \\"Maybe I Mean Yes\\"). The Girls Next Door signed with Atlantic Records, but their MTM hits are still owned by RCA.

He also wrote four books on economics. Biography=Early life and education= Isaac Harry Scherman was born February 1, 1887 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was the youngest of five children born to Katherine Harris and Jacob Scherman. After his parents separated, Harry and his brothers Louis and William were placed in an orphanage in Atlanta, Georgia, where they lived from 1893 to 1899. He attended Central High School in Philadelphia, where his classmates included Alexander Woollcott, the future Algonquin Round Table member and radio personality, and Ed Wynn, the famous actor. Scherman graduated high school in 1905, and later completed university studies at the Wharton School and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. =Career= His first jobs included working for Louis Lipsky at \\"The American Hebrew\\" newspaper, with the Ruthrauff and Ryan advertising firm, and the J. Walter Thompson Company. In 1916, he established the Little Leather Library and, in 1926, he co-founded the Book of the Month Club. Following the establishment of the Book of The Month Club, Scherman published several works in his own right. In one such work, The Promises Men Live By, published in 1938 he developed an analysis of economic problems in terms of people's beliefs. He was critical of accepted policies relating to the then fashionable Keynesianism. =Marriage and children= Scherman married Bernardine Kielty on June 3, 1914. Kielty was of Irish and Welsh descent and had moved to New York City from a small town in New England where she met Scherman. Kielty was also a writer of non-fiction, juvenile fiction and a book columnist for The Ladies Home Journal.Dust jacket profile of Bernardine Kielty, in relation to Kielty's book, Masters of Painting: Their Works/Their Lives/Their Times.

FTTS was a proposed two vehicle modular family that was to replace the AM General High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV (the Humvee)), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), Oshkosh M977 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Oshkosh Palletized Load System (PLS) (in certain echelons), and all remaining M35, M809 and M939 series of 2.5 and 5 ton trucks. The FTTS-UV (Utility Vehicle) was to replace the HMMWV, while the FTTS-MSV (Manoeuvre Sustainment Vehicle) was to replace all other types. By 2006 work on FTTS was faltering and according to the Foreword of Jane's Military Vehicles and Logistics 2006-2007 by Shaun C Connors and Christopher F Foss (): \\"The U.S. Army’s original intention was that the FTTS (the logistic support for the Future Combat System (FCS)) with just two variants would eventually replace virtually all of the current tactical wheeled vehicle fleet. In a more realistic approach, the current FTTS-MSV/UV Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) efforts (with input from other efforts) will now be used ‘to define requirements’ for future U.S. Army trucks.\\" The Association of the United States Army (July 2006) \\"Army Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Strategy: Meeting Current and Future Needs\\" pdf stated that the ACTD for FTTS was taking a two phase approach; the first phase involved modeling and simulation (M&S;) efforts in which multiple vendors presented concepts for technologies to be incorporated into designs for the UV and MSV variants of FTTS. The second phase included awards to three of the M&S; contractors to manufacture prototype designs: two contractors to produce their UV version with trailer, and one contractor to produce two MSVs with companion trailers. All vehicles and trailers were to be evaluated in a Military Utility Assessment (MUA) at Fort Lewis, Washington. The MUA was scheduled to occur during the first and second quarters of FY07, with the results to fed into the requirements development process, this to define future truck requirements. Elements of FTTS-UV ACTD were fed in to the ongoing Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program, this the replacement for part of the HMMWV fleet. On 24 April 2006, establishment of a Joint Program Office to manage the JLTV effort was endorsed. The AUSA pdf file previously referenced stated that: \\"Following approval, [of the JLTV Initial Capabilities Document by the Secretary of Defense],the Future Tactical Truck Systems Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration, the PSD [Platform Systems Demonstration], EMIP [Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure] and various Office of Naval Research Science and Technology activities will inform the requirements process, thus ensuring requirements are realistic, achievable and relevant to all services. Deliveries of the medium and heavy category trucks in production when FTTS commenced, and to be replaced by FTTS, continue. The FMTV (now with Oshkosh) production contract has recently been extended to September 2016, and award of the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles IV (FHTV) contract, on a sole source basis to Oshkosh, is anticipated in the near future. FHTV contract awards include HEMTT and PLS.

Conventional virtualization technologies allocate resources on an operating system (Windows, Linux...) wide basis. VRP works 2 levels deeper by allowing regulation and control of the resources used by specific transactions within an application. In many computerized environments, a single user, application, or transaction can appropriate all server resources and by that, affect the quality of service & user experience of other active users, applications or transactions. For example, a single report in a data warehouse environment can monopolize data access by demanding large amounts of data. Similarly, a CPU-bound application may consume all server processing power and starve other activities. VRP allows balancing, regulating and manipulating the resource consumption of individual transactions, and by that, improving the overall quality of service, compliance with service level agreements, and the ultimate end user experience. Technology overview VRP is usually implemented in the OS in a way that is completely transparent to the application or transaction. The technology creates virtual resource \\"lanes\\", each of which has access to a controllable amount of resources, and redirects specific transactions to those lanes allowing them to take more or less resources. VRP can be implemented in any OS and is available on Windows, Red Hat, Suse, HP-UX, Solaris, tru64, AIX and others. In any OS, the application communicates with the OS kernel in a specific way which requires a different VRP implementation. A safe implementation of VRP usually combines several resource allocation techniques. VRP implementations depend on rapidly varying transaction type, consumed resource and kernel state. The VRP implementation must adapt to such changes in real-time.

Tadini was ordained as a priest in 1870 and went on to found a religious congregation dedicated to the poor and ill while taking advantage of the Industrial Revolution to support women in work and education. Tadini was disabled due to a lame leg he had after suffering an accident while he studied for the priesthood. He initiated various parish initiatives and a relief fund for the aged and the ill. Tadini's beatification process launched in 1960 and he became titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his heroic virtue in 1998 enabled for him to be titled as Venerable; he was beatified on 3 October 1999 and was later canonized on 26 April 2009. Life Arcangelo Tadini was born on 12 October 1846 in Verolanuova in Brescia as the last of four children born to the nobles Pietro Tadini and Antonia Gadola. His father had previous children with his previous wife Giulia Gadola (Antonia's sister) until her death thus making Tadini the eleventh child his father sired. His father had seven children with his first wife and after her death tried to manage his children from 1829 with his sister-in-law's aid whom he married on 10 July 1838. Tadini was baptized in the San Lorenzo Martire church in his hometown on 18 October 1846 with his godparents being Giambattista Scolari and Caterina Gadola. Tadini's father Pietro was born in Brescia on 15 February 1790 and married his first wife Giulia Gadola on 6 July 1819 and who was born on 28 September 1801. Tadini's own mother Antonia (born in 1806) was 32 upon her marriage to Pietro and in 1848 she became a volunteer nurse. His father Pietro died on 1 January 1860 and his mother died on 23 December 1880. He suffered from a grave illness that almost killed him when he was two but he rallied and survived. He attended school in his hometown until he was ten and in 1855 attended another school where his brothers Alessandro and Giulio attended. His two brothers studied for the priesthood but Giulio became a priest while Alessandro did not due to being expelled due to his political beliefs. Tadini's vocation to the priesthood grew over time but became more concrete when he attended his brother Giulio's first Mass and subsequent exposure to his activities as a priest. Giulio would later die in 1909. Tadini commenced his theological and philosophical studies for the priesthood in Brescia in 1864. He suffered an accident during his studies that left him having a lifelong limp due to the inadequacies of treatment for the accident that saw his knee broken. Tadini received ordination to the priesthood on 19 June 1870 from the Prince-Bishop of Trento Benedetto Riccabona de Reichelfels since the current Bishop of Brescia Girolamo Verzieri was in Rome for the First Vatican Council. Tadini celebrated his first Mass as a priest on 26 June 1870 in his hometown. He was looking forward to his duties as a priest but a serious illness forced him to reside with his relatives from 1870 to 1871 as he recovered. Upon that he was made the curate for Lodrino in Val Trompia (and a schoolteacher for children) and he held that position from 29 June 1871 until 27 May 1873 when he was made the curate for the Santa Maria della Noce shrine near Brescia. It was there that he was noted for his attentiveness to the material and spiritual needs of his parishioners and his care of refugees. It was also there that he organized a soup kitchen that would serve hundreds after intense flooding caused a great deal of people to become homeless. In 1885 he was appointed as the curate for Botticino Sera (arriving there that 29 November) to aid the ailing parish priest Giacomo Coresti and then became its parish priest in 1887 following Cortesi's death on 26 November 1886; he was undergoing treatment for his leg in Albano when he received this news on 20 July 1887. He held that position for the remainder of his life and there organized catechesis lessons for various age groups. He revitalized parish initiatives that all had a pastoral focus at their heart and he founded what became known as the Workers' Mutual Aid Association in 1893 which was a form of social insurance for the ill and injured as well as the aged. He also used his inheritance to build a spinning mill in 1898 that hired women and used the profits to establish a residence for them. Tadini also founded his own religious congregation in 1900 consisted of women and their role was to help the women in factories and also to provide them with an education. This proved a bit scandalous for the time since factories were considered to be immoral and dangerous places. In his parish he allowed the Third Order of Saint Francis to settle there and he also praised Pope Leo XIII for having issued Rerum Novarum. His Jesuit friend and priest Maffeo Franzini helped him revive the Secular Ursulines in his parish and so Franzini sent from Milan the former Canossian religious Leopoldina Paris to aid him in this. But this was short lived as Paris did not share Tadini's vision and so left him. Later in life he was forced to use a cane due to the limp he suffered which became worse over time due to his advancing age; he was later forced to use a wheelchair and was wheeled to a 21 March 1912 Mass that commemorated his entrance as a parish priest for that church. He alluded during the Mass that \\"I will not live much longer\\" as his failing health was getting worse over time on a gradual level. He was celebrating Mass on 8 May 1912 when he was taken ill after being struck with an illness and on 9 May received both the Anointing of the Sick and the Viaticum from his confessor. Tadini died in his bed on 20 May at 5:00am; his funeral as celebrated the following morning. His remains were exhumed on 11 March 1943 and again on 24 May 1999; the remains were exhumed for the final time on 29 October 2009 just after he was canonized and moved to the parish of Santa Maria Assunta in Botticino Sera now made a minor basilica. His order now operates in countries across the world such as Burundi and the United Kingdom. He had died without his order having received full approval; the Bishop of Brescia Giacinto Gaggia issued diocesan approval on 30 November 1931 while Pope Pius XII issued the decree of praise on 12 January 1953. Pope John XXIII issued papal approval a decade later on 16 March 1962. Sainthood=Initial process and Venerable= The informative process opened in the Diocese of Brescia on 13 January 1960 - in which he was given the title of Servant of God under Pope John XXIII - and had been assigned to collecting all documentation available on Tadini. Such documents would be designed to attest to his cause for sainthood. It concluded its work on 19 June 1964. Theologians gathered all his writings in order to ascertain whether or not such texts were in line with the faith and voiced their assent to his publications in a decree issued on 5 March 1970. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process on 27 October 1989 and opened the so-called \\"Roman Phase\\" in which the C.C.S. would begin their own investigation into Tadini's potential saintliness. The postulation sent the Positio to the C.C.S. for further assessments which led to theologians approving its contents on 16 June 1998. The C.C.S. followed suit on 17 November 1998. On 21 December 1998 he was declared to be Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue - both cardinal and theological virtues. =Beatification= The miracle needed for his beatification was reported to the postulation and investigated in a diocesan process that opened in April 1996 and closed one month later. It was validated on 25 October 1996 and sent to a medical board that approved the healing to be a miracle on 17 December 1998. Theologians also voiced their approval on 23 March 1999 while the C.C.S. also approved it on 18 May 1999. The pope himself provided the final approval on 28 June 1999. On 3 October 1999 the pontiff presided over Tadini's beatification. The miracle that led to his beatification was the healing of the nun Carmela Berardi who was a member of Tadini's order. Berardi suffered from tuberculosis that blocked her vocal cords leaving her unable to speak from 1936 until her healing in 1943. Tadini's remains were being exhumed on 11 March 1943 so the order's Superior General asked her to ask for Tadini's intercession. Berardi did this and found that she could speak to the surprise of those present; the damage that the tuberculosis caused also disappeared. =Canonization= The miracle required for his sanctification took place in the Diocese of Brescia and as such was investigated there as soon as the diocesan process opened on 16 June 2006. It concluded one month later and was validated on 24 November 2006. The medical board approved it on 15 November 2007 and theologians did likewise on 22 April 2008. The C.C.S. also approved it on 28 October 2008 while Pope Benedict XVI voiced his approval on 6 December 2008. Tadini was proclaimed as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 26 April 2009. In that Mass the pope said: \\"How prophetic was Don Tadini's charismatic intuition, and how current his example is today, in this time of grave economic crisis!\\" in reference to the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis. The miracle that led to his canonization was the healing of the couple Roberto Marazzi and Elisabetta Fostini who were sterile and unable to conceive despite several attempts from 2000 to 2004.

The phenomenon is named after Vladimir Arnold who was the first to publish a result in the field in 1964. More precisely, Arnold diffusion refers to results asserting the existence of solutions to nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems that exhibit a significant change in the action variables. Arnold diffusion describes the diffusion of trajectories due to the ergodic theorem in a portion of phase space unbound by any constraints (i.e. unbounded by Lagrangian tori arising from constants of motion) in Hamiltonian systems. It occurs in systems with more than N=2 degrees of freedom, since the N-dimensional invariant tori do not separate the 2N-1 dimensional phase space any more. Thus, an arbitrarily small perturbation may cause a number of trajectories to wander pseudo-randomly through the whole portion of phase space left by the destroyed tori. Background and statement For integrable systems, one has the conservation of the action variables. According to the KAM theorem if we perturb an integrable system slightly, then many, though certainly not all, of the solutions of the perturbed system stay close, for all time, to the unperturbed system. In particular, since the action variables were originally conserved, the theorem tells us that there is only a small change in action for many solutions of the perturbed system. However, as first noted in Arnold's paper, there are nearly integrable systems for which there exist solutions that exhibit arbitrarily large growth in the action variables. More precisely, Arnold considered the example of nearly integrable Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian : H(I, p, q, \\\\phi, t) = {1 \\\\over 2 }I^2 + p^2 + \\\\epsilon \\\\cos{( q - 1)} + \\\\mu\\\\cos{(q - 1)}(\\\\sin{\\\\phi + \\\\cos t)} He showed that for this system, with any choice of \\\\epsilon, \\\\delta, K > 0, where K \\\\gg \\\\delta , there exists a \\\\mu_0 > 0 such that for all \\\\mu \\\\in(0, \\\\mu_0) there is a solution to the system for which : I(0) < \\\\delta\\\\text{ and }I(T) > K for some time T \\\\gg 0.

Bulgaria has established traditions in a great variety of sports.  Olympics  An Olympic-standard swimming pool in Varna. Bulgaria participates both in the Summer and Winter Olympics, and its first appearance dates back to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, when the Swiss gymnast Charles Champaud represented the country. Since then Bulgaria has appeared in most Summer Olympiads, and has won a total of 214 medals: 51 gold, 85 silver, and 78 bronze. The most successful participations took place at Munich (21 medals), Montreal (22 medals), Moscow (41), Seoul (35). At the Winter Olympic Games, Bulgaria has a less impressive record: only 6 medals (of which only one gold) out of 19 participations. Some of the most prominent Olympians include Mariya Grozdeva (shooting), Ekaterina Dafovska (biathlon), Armen Nazaryan (wrestling), Stefka Kostadinova (high jump, holder of the world record since 1987), Yordanka Donkova (100 m, holder of the world record since 1988), Yordan Yovchev (gymnastics), Neshka Robeva (gymnastics), Rumyana Neykova (rowing). Wrestling is the most successful discipline. Bulgarian wrestlers have earned a total of 68 medals - 16 gold, 32 silver and 20 bronze. Weightlifting is the second most successful sports with a total of 36 medals. Without doubt this is one of Bulgaria's highest priority sports with around 1,000 gold medals in different competitions, although cases of doping have occurred among Bulgarian weightlifters, which led to the expulsion of the entire Bulgarian team from the 2000 Summer Olympics, and their voluntary withdrawal from the 1988 Summer Olympics. Olympic authorities stripped a number of Bulgarian weightlifters of medals in 2004; and the country's entire weightlifting team withdrew in 2008. Stefan Botev, Nikolay Peshalov, Demir Demirev, Asen Zlatev, Blagoy Blagoev and Yoto Yotov figure among the most distinguished weightlifters. Naim Süleymanoğlu an ethnic Turk, originally trained and competed for Bulgaria before defecting and competing for Turkey. Shooting sports have also proven to be among Bulgaria's strongest disciplines. Mariya Grozdeva and Tanyu Kiryakov have won Olympic gold medals. Ekaterina Dafovska won the Olympic gold in biathlon in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, while Evgenia Radanova is the most successful Bulgarian winter olympian with 3 medals in short track speed skating.  Association football  Association football has become by far the most popular sport in the country. Many Bulgarians closely follow the top Bulgarian league, currently known as the First Professional Football League; as well as the leagues of other European countries. The national team achieved its greatest success with a fourth-place finish at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States.

As of season 2012/2013, he plays for FC Fulham, rejoining with manager Martin Jol who brought him to England. Berbatov also spent four seasons at Manchester United, where he scored his first two goals for the team in their 3–0 win away to Aalborg in the Champions League group stage on 30 September 2008, less than a month after he joined the team. Georgi Asparuhov, nicknamed Gundi (1943–1971), also became extremely popular at home and abroad, having had offers from clubs in Italy and Portugal, and having won the Bulgarian football player №1 award for the twentieth century. \\"Gundi pips Stoichkov to Top Footballer of the century\\" (article in Bulgarian) Hristo Stoichkov has arguably become the best-known Bulgarian footballer of all time. His career peaked between 1992 and 1995, while he played for FC Barcelona, winning the Ballon d'Or in 1994. Additionally, he featured in the FIFA 100 rankings. Three Bulgarians have won the European top scorers' Golden Boot award: Hristo Stoichkov, Georgi Slavkov and Petar Jekov.

Dress Barn and Christopher & Banks eventually moved to the new Orchard Crossing strip center. Despite these losses, occupancy at Jefferson Pointe remains high, with recent additions like Marshalls, Simply Mac (a national chain of Apple Specialists), Petshion Boutique, The Nut House, White House Black Market, a relocated Old Navy, and an art gallery. Jefferson Pointe was home to the first Barnes & Noble, Panera Bread, and ULTA in Fort Wayne.

Jefferson Pointe also features market-exclusive stores for Chico's, Eddie Bauer, Gymboree, White House Black Market, Soma Intimates, Bed Bath & Beyond, LOFT, Charming Charlie, and Talbots. From the center's opening until 2012, Jefferson Pointe had a small food court. However, it was not popular as Jefferson Pointe had many other dining options in and surrounding the center. The food court was replaced by Tucanos Brazilian Grill and a children's play area. Other restaurants at Jefferson Pointe include Biaggi's, Smokey Bones, Flat Top Grill, Cold Stone Creamery, McAlister's Deli, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Eddie Merlot's, and Rosati's pizza.

With help from Sumerian Records and our friends Frankie Palmeri & Mattie Montgomery, it became about a scene that is much like the hallways we walked down as teenagers. We used the iconic lyrics from a song by Bane that changed the scene before bands like us were even around and still holds a place in a lot of hearts. We're all here to connect through music and to be a part of a movement that embraces open minds and open hearts. Unfortunately, some people choose to thrive off negativity, disunion and narcissism. This song goes out to all our peers and friends who live on the road doing it every single year, but more importantly to all the fans who make this all possible. This is not a song off the forthcoming album. It's the closing chapter to [digital_renegade] and the opening track to our digital mixtape release titled \\"Renegades Forever\\".\\" On June 17, 2013, Alternative Press published an exclusive premiere on their website of the first single from New Demons entitled \\"Violent Bounce (People Like ¥øµ)\\".

It was the third and final series of The Chronicles of Narnia that ran from 1988 to 1990. Barbara Kellerman was used again as the Green Lady; Barbara had recently played the Hag and the White Witch in the Narnia miniseries. The six-part series followed the 1953 book in great detail including all key features. It was filmed in various locations including Peak Cavern and Haddon Hall, Derbyshire. Plot=Episode 1= When friends Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole stumble into Aslan's Country when trying to escape bullies at their school, Jill is given a quest by Aslan the Talking Lion. They must save Prince Rilian, son of King Caspian, from the Evil Green Lady. Rilian disappeared 10 years earlier after weeks of searching the woods near Cair Paravel for the serpent who had killed his royal mother, the Queen. However, their task is complicated by the fact that they both got separated on their arrival into Aslan's Country, when Eustace fell from a cliff and was blown to Narnia by Aslan, who soon blows Jill in the same direction. A great ship has just set sail from Cair Paravel, and a talking Owl (Glimfeather) appears and informs Eustace and Jill that the King of Narnia has just departed on his ship. Eustace is horrified to realise that the elderly man boarding the ship was indeed Caspian, who is now decades rather than years older than Eustace himself - as 50 years have passed in Narnia while less than a year has passed on Earth. Caspian, now an elderly man, has just set sail to revisit the places of his youth (where he had voyaged with Edmund, Lucy and Eustace, 50 years earlier), but many believe that he had set out to seek Aslan to find out who should be the next King of Narnia, as he has no other children and fears he will never see Rilian again. They meet the very elderly dwarf Trumpkin, now Lord Regent of Narnia, who has taken over the rule of Narnia while Caspian is at sea. He admits Eustace and Jill to Cair Paravel, and that evening Glimfeather returns to the castle to take Jill to the Parliament of Owls. =Episode 2= Glimfeather's friend in the Parliament of Owls tells the children the story of how Prince Rilian was lost 10 years ago, and the children gather from the story that the serpent who killed the Queen and the mysterious lady that Rilian had pointed out to Lord Drinian on his return to the forest were probably one and the same. Glimfeather and his friend then take the children to a friend of theirs who will act as a guide on their quest to track down the lost prince. To help them on their quest they meet the gloomy but loyal Marshwiggle Puddleglum. Leaving Narnia, they journey deep into the desolate northern lands, where they encounter cold, hunger and hardship, and encounter giants as well as a dragon, who flies away after Eustace (who was briefly a dragon himself once) approaches him and encourages him to go elsewhere. =Episode 3= The children soon begin to bicker among themselves, forgetting the Four Signs Aslan has given them for guidance along the way. One frosty morning, the three travelers encounter a beautiful Green Lady, accompanied by a silent Black Knight. Not realizing that the charming lady is actually the same deadly serpent which enslaved the Prince and killed his mother, the children confide in her eagerly. Sensing their hunger and exhaustion, the sly witch sends them to the Gentle Giants of Harfang. =Episode 4= The giants are kind to the children at first, but in reality they plan to fatten the travelers up with rich foods and then eat them for the Autumn Feast. Discovering the truth after reading a cookery book, Jill and her friends escape from Harfang and go underground, where they realise they have entered the underworld ruled by the Green Lady. =Episode 5= The Warden of the Underworld and his army of gnomes lead the children and Puddleglum to a grand apartment in the Underworld, where they are welcomed by a mysterious masked man who claims to be the Queen's second in command, and will lead her army of gnomes to conquer the \\"overworld\\". Two gnomes later appear and capture him in the Silver Chair, but he soon persuades the travellers to set him free \\"in the name of Aslan\\". He then smashes the Silver Chair to pieces with his sword, and reveals that he is indeed Rilian, heir to the Narnian throne. He recognises Eustace's name from his father's stories, and is keen to find out whether his father is still alive. Puddleglum reveals that Caspian is still living, but is now old and frail, implying that he may not be alive for much longer. The Green Lady then arrives and is horrified to find the Silver Chair destroyed, wrongly believing that one of the three travellers has destroyed it. =Episode 6= Rilian then confesses that he destroyed the Silver Chair, and the Witch then attempts to put all three travellers under the same spell, blotting out any memories of Narnia or Earth, but her magic fails to work on Puddleglum. His defiance enrages the witch, especially after he extinguishes the fire which was placing the children under the spell. She finally loses her temper and takes on her true form as a hideous green snake. Once she is no longer in the distracting shape of a woman, Prince Rilian recognizes who she truly is and kills her. They then make their escape to the overworld, where they are rescued through a hole in the hillside by the Narnians. Rilian then heads off to Cair Paravel while the children and Puddleglum stay overnight with the Narnians. The next day, Glenstorm the centaur takes the children to Cair Paravel to witness the return of King Caspian. However, Caspian is fading fast by the time he returns to Cair Paravel, and dies shortly after meeting Rilian, who is then proclaimed King of Narnia by Trumpkin. Aslan then appears and congratulates the children on succeeding with the task he had assigned them, and they then return to Aslan's Country with him. The children find themselves back at the stream in Narnia where Jill had first seen Aslan, and the dead King Caspian is lying in the stream. On Aslan's orders, Eustace removes a large thorn from a nearby thicket and drives it into Aslan's paw, creating a stream of blood which revives Caspian and restores him as a young boy, who is thrilled to meet Eustace again. Aslan then orders the two children and Caspian to confront the bullies at Jill's school, breaking down a wall which reveals the three warriors with their swords, causing the crowd of bullies to head back to the school in terror. The children then say their goodbyes to Caspian and Aslan.

Marine Corps officer numbers The first one hundred Marine Corps officer service numbers were intended for retroactive presentation to World War I veterans; the Marine Corps issued these early numbers alphabetically and the first Marine Corps officer number was issued to Major James Ackerman. Ackerman was issued the service number \\"01\\" with the policy established that all Marine Corps officer numbers would begin with a zero. The U.S. Army awarded their \\"01\\" to General John J. Pershing. The Marine Corps officer corps in the 1920s was relatively small and, by the start of the 1930s, the Marine Corps had yet to issue more than one thousand officer service numbers. In 1931, the number of possible officer numbers was increased to two thousand with this number not yet reached upon the outbreak of World War II in 1941. During World War II, the officer service number range was extended to 50,000 and, during Korea, extended again to 100,000; this number was not reached by the officer corps until 1966. At that time, the Marine Corps extended the officer service numbers a final time to 125,000. Officer service numbers were then discontinued in 1972. Final distribution of Marine Corps officer service numbers Marine Corps enlisted numbers Marine Corps enlisted service numbers were also issued retroactively; however, numbers 1 through 20,000 were never assigned. Thus, the first Marine Corps enlisted service number was 20,001 and was assigned to a Marine named Alexander Schott. Service numbers upwards to 49,999 were also retroactive and assigned to discharged or retired Marines who had served between 1905 and 1917. The enlisted service numbers between 50,000 and 60,000 were never assigned by the Marine Corps for reasons which are unclear. The next range of numbers, 60,001 to 99,999, were used for retroactive presentation from 1905 to 1919. The first active Marines who were assigned service numbers fell into the range of 100,000 to 199,999 as it was these numbers which were assigned in the 1920s to the enlisted force of the Marine Corps. In 1935, with the service number cap of 200,000 almost reached, the Marine Corps extended enlisted numbers to a new cap of 350,000. It was in this range that service numbers were being issued upon the outbreak of World War II. During the early part Second World War, the Marine Corps extended their enlisted service numbers to the number one million with numbers broken down into sub-sections reserved for particular groups enlisting during World War II. The first group, ranging numbers 350,000 to 670,899, were standard Marine Corps enlistees joining for wartime service. Numbers 670,900 to 699,999 were never issued and 700,000 to 799,999 were reserved for female enlisted personnel. The female enlisted service numbers were also the only numbers assigned a prefix code, as the letter W was used to denote female Marine Corps enlisted. Until the middle of World War II, the remaining service number range of 800,000 to 999,999 was used by regular Marine enlistees. In 1943, the Marine Corps extended enlisted service numbers to 1,699,999 even though the original one million service number cap had not yet been reached. Marine enlisted service number 1,000,000 was issued in 1944 and the cap of 1,700,000 was reached nine years later. Service numbers 1,700,000 to 1,799,999 were set aside for female enlisted personnel of the 1960s and 1970s while 1,800,000 to 2,000,000 was used by male enlistees. In 1965, with male service numbers running out due to a rise of enlistments during the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps extended enlisted service numbers a final time to 2,800,000. The highest Marine Corps service number reached was slightly above 2,699,000 before the numbers were discontinued in 1971. After this point, all Marine Corps service records converted to Social Security numbers as the primary identification means for service members.

The Henry George Foundation describes itself as \\"active on three broad fronts: research, education, and advocacy\\". The Foundation takes its name from Henry George, the 19th Century economist and proponent of the taxation of land values. Activities The Henry George Foundation is the publisher of the magazine Land&Liberty.; The Foundation holds educational courses and organises conferences and other public events focussing on tax reform issues. It has sponsored academic research, published extensively, and advised legislators, civil servants and NGOs on land and tax reform matters. History The Henry George Foundation is the present-day successor of a series of organisations and names that hails back to the United Committee for the Taxation of Land Values.

XI, no. 156, May 1907, p. 237 (a previous 'United Committee' had been formed in 1887Edwards 1909, p. 78) as a coordinating body for a number of organisations with the shared object of promoting the taxation of land values.Barberis, Peter, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, London: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2007. pp.34-35 These organisations continued to exist in parallel with the United Committee, and included a number of regional leagues for the taxation of land values and also the national bodies the English League for the Taxation of Land Values and the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values.Barberis, Peter, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, London: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2007. p.23 In 1969 (the regional leagues mostly having folded, with only the Scottish League in continuing existence) the United Committee launched ESSRA (Economic and Social Science Research Association), a registered charity, and transferred much of its activity to it.Memorandum and Articles of Association Incorporated 23 June 1969, as Amended on 17 April 1996 In 1991 the United Committee changed its name to the Centre for Incentive Taxation.

It is the only theater by architect Frank Lloyd Wright and one of the last completed buildings he designed. It was built in 1959 for Dallas Theater Center who still produces original productions on the revolving stage. Other Dallas theater groups also use the Kalita Humphreys Theater throughout the year, including Uptown Playershttps://www.uptownplayers.org/ and Second Thought Theater.http://secondthoughttheatre.com/ History The Dallas Theater Center committee approached Frank Lloyd Wright to design a theater on land donated by Sylvan T. Baer along the picturesque Turtle Creek. Wright, busy at the time with other projects, suggested that if the committee could use a plan already in his files he would agree to the project. The original design had been created for a West Coast theater in 1915 and later adapted for Hartford, Connecticut. Neither of these theaters were built for various reasons and the design was adapted for Dallas. Construction began in 1955 and was completed four years later and nine months after Wright's death at a cost of over $1,000,000. The Kalita Humphreys Theater opened on December 27, 1959, with a presentation of \\"Of Time and the River\\" by Thomas Wolfe. The theater took its name from an actress who worked with Paul Baker, the first director of the Dallas Theater Center. Kalita Humphreys died in a plane crash in 1954 and her parents donated $120,000 to the theater as a memorial. The theater was recognized as a historic city of Dallas landmark in 2007.https://dallascityhall.com/departments/sustainabledevelopment/historicpreservation/Pages/Kalita- Humphreys-Theatre.aspx In 2009, Dallas Theater Center moved its administrative offices to the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre at the AT&T; Performing Arts Center in the Dallas Arts District, but continues to produce shows in both spaces and continues to manage the Kalita Humphreys Theater. In April 2018, Kalita Humphreys Theater hosted Dallas Theater Center's production of “The Trials of Sam Houston”, a world-premiere play written by Aaron Loeb. The Kalita Humphreys Theater also remains in use as a regional theater space by other local performing arts groups. In 2010, Uptown Players, a growing gay- focused theater company moved to the Kalita Humphreys Theater and occupies the space when not being used by the Dallas Theater Center. In addition, Second Thought Theater performs at Bryant Hall, which adjoins the Kalita Humphreys Theater. Between productions and rehearsals by Dallas Theater Center and these other companies, Kalita Humphreys Theater remains in use as a working theater approximately 50 weeks of each year. Architecture The theater's design was considered bold and innovative. It was based on Frank Lloyd Wright's Organic architecture, which stressed the unification of the building's form and function, the harmony of the building's structure with its natural setting, and the aesthetically pleasing manipulation of space. Because Wright's design was based on nature, and everything in the theater is at a 30/60-degree angle, the only 90 degree angles in the theater are where the walls meet the ceiling and floor. =Main theater= During the design phase the proscenium was eliminated, thereby blending the stage and the auditorium into one unit. This created a more intimate relationship between the actors and the audience. The stage is able to be a revolving stage for some performances. Above the stage is the huge cantilevered , concrete drum. Weighing 127 tons, Wright designed the drum to be counterbalanced by the corresponding weight and structure of the three-flight dressing room area behind the stage. The original color of the walls and seats was sand. The rake of the seats was changed in 1983 to give the audience better sightlines and add additional seats. A row of windows runs along the back of the theater. Window coverings in Wright's design were later requested by Paul Baker because \\"theater was not just performed at night.\\" Originally, stage lights were housed in the ceiling but proved difficult to adjust, and today's lighting system was added later. Texas Instruments donated the first digital soundboard to be used in a theater. =The wings/backstage= Due to rising costs during the construction of the theater, the backstage area was reduced in size. The stage level contains two dressing rooms and the Green Room. The second level has additional dressing rooms. =Basement= Large circular ramps on either side of the stage led down to the basement, which was designed for the building of sets. The sets would be rolled up one ramp to the stage and then down the other ramp after use. Today only one ramp remains in use, and the basement is occasionally used as a black box theater. =Wyly Wing= The Wyly Wing, named for Charles and Dee Wyly, was added in 1969 as a separate building designed in the style of Wright. A porte cochere connected the two buildings. The space today includes the Lay Studio (\\"Frank's Place\\") and Wynne Studio, which serve as education rooms and performance spaces, plus a lounge, kitchen, waiting room and offices. =Lobby= The original lobby ended where today's center wall stands. In 1990 the lobby was expanded and Art Rodgers,http://www.artrogersarchitect.com/ a local architect, worked with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to create new additions to the theater. Stairs next to the auditorium were straightened, a kitchen space was removed and a spiral staircase added to provide additional access to lower level restrooms, which were also enlarged. The porte cochere added in 1969 was enclosed to form additional lobby space needed. It also allowed for the addition of a gift shop and beverage bar, and a large opening was made to help the flow of patrons into the auditorium.https://web.archive.org/web/20091015170032/http://www.dallastheatercenter.org/Page.aspx?WP_ID=330 =Stecker Library= Located off one side of the theater was the library and conference room, named for Mr. Robert D. Stecker, who was an original committee member and the dedicated President of the organization. The library granted graduate degrees in theater from Baylor University and later Trinity University. Today the library has been restored to its original appearance and is used for private functions. =Heldt Administration Building= Northwest of the Kalita Humphreys Theater is this more functional block built in 1990 and designed by Dallas architect Art Rogers. Original design called for it to be disguised entirely by trees so as not to interfere with Wright's design. =Building site= The building is built into a limestone bluff and cantilevered over the heavily wooded site overlooking Turtle Creek. The design is predominantly horizontal interrupted by the towering concrete drum. The entrance to the theater faces Southeast and original plans called for patrons parking on the other side of the elevated railroad tracks (now the Katy Trail). As one passed through a small pedestrian tunnel the grand theater entrance would be revealed. Wright repeats this process of experience throughout the theater in his creative design of the stairways, large terraces and fountains. References * Storrer, William Allin.

Its CEO is Larry Weitzner. Among its best-known political clients are Donald Trump, several governors (including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Chris Christie of New Jersey), the Club for Growth, and the Republican National Committee. Past corporate and governmental clients include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Overview & awards Jamestown Associates is currently headquartered in Philadelphia, with satellite offices in Washington, D.C. and Manalapan, New Jersey. As of the end of the 2010 general election season, Jamestown Associates was the 7th largest grossing Republican consulting firm in the United States. Campaign ads produced by Jamestown have been cited in various media sources among the most notable in various election seasons over the past two decades—by the New York Times in 1998, and by the Washington Post in 2006 (their selection of that year's \\"Best Campaign Commercials\\"). The firm has won a number of Pollie Awards and Reed Awards. In 2016, Jamestown received 9 Pollie Awards and 8 Reed Awards, the most that year of any political consulting group, according to Campaigns & Elections magazine and the American Association of Political Consultants. In February 2017, Jamestown received 7 Reed Awards for ads and mail, again the most of any firm. By Jamestown's count, over the total 2015-16 election cycle and including all clients, the firm produced more than 22 million pieces of mail as well as 398 TV, radio and web advertisements. 2010-16 In 2010, Weitzner and Jamestown worked for several candidates winning election for the first time, as Republicans recaptured control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Among Jamestown clients capturing Democratic seats were Frank Guinta (NH), Richard Hanna (NY), Tim Walberg (MI), Bob Dold (IL) and Joe Walsh (IL). Jamestown also produced ads for businessman Bill Binnie, in his unsuccessful bid for Senate from New Hampshire. In February 2011, Jamestown client Jonathan Perry won a special election for State Senate in Louisiana, which gave the Republicans control of both houses of the Louisiana legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. In a mild controversy, the firm said in October 2010 that a contractor it hired had used the phrase \\"hicky blue collar\\" in describing the actors wanted for a National Republican Senatorial Committee ad to be broadcast in West Virginia. Beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2016, Miller and Jamestown took on several insurgent candidates challenging Republican incumbents. These included Richard Mourdock, in Indiana (who defeated longtime Sen. Richard Lugar in the 2012 primary, losing to Democrat Joe Donnelly in the fall; Congressman Paul Broun, who lost his nomination bid for Georgia Senator; and radiologist Milton Wolf, who nearly upset Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts in the August 2014 primary. They were retained by the Club for Growth PAC, in its challenge to a GOP incumbent in Mississippi and support for a Tea Party conservative (Ben Sasse) in Nebraska. And in early 2015, they were retained by the presidential campaign of Tea Party insurgent Ted Cruz for the GOP nomination. Political reporter Stuart Rothenberg noted in February 2014: \\"New Jersey-based Jamestown [w]as a regional consulting firm that worked mostly with moderate or even liberal Republicans running in the Northeast. Now it has become a national firm (with offices around the country) that will be one of a handful of firms promoting anti-establishment libertarian and tea party hopefuls this cycle. . . .it’s also a fascinating story of how a media firm has evolved and adapted to a changing political environment.\\" At the same time, Jamestown continued to work for more moderate and \\"mainstream\\" Republicans. Their 2012 clients included longtime St. Sen. Joe Kyrillos, who lost his bid for U.S. Senate from New Jersey, and in 2013 they produced ads and direct mail for the successful re-election of Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey. Indeed, Jamestown produced ads for four winning gubernatorial campaigns in four years—Christie in 2013, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker in 2014, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin in 2015 and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu in 2016. Jamestown also produced ads for the losing gubernatorial primary effort of businessman Bruce Lisman in Vermont. Baker, a moderate running in liberal Massachusetts, hired Jamestown in the final months of 2014. His closing 90-second spot, \\"Remarkable State,\\" was dubbed \\"the selfie ad\\" and was described as \\"...one of the best campaign ads I saw . . . featuring clip after clip of the candidate posing for selfies with voters across the state\\" by political author Kristin Soltis Anderson.The Selfie Vote: Where Millennials Are Leading America (And How Republicans Can Keep Up), Kristin Soltis Anderson (Broadside Brooks: New York, 2015), p. 4 in 2013, Jamestown produced ads for Mark Sanford's comeback campaign for the U.S. House, following the former Governor's scandalous affair with an Argentinian journalist and subsequent divorce. Despite being actively shunned by national party committees and major donors, Sanford won the GOP nomination with 56.5%, and then captured the coastal 1st District seat with 54% in the May special election. In 2015, Jamestown was the principal media and communications consultant for Matt Bevin gubernatorial campaign in Kentucky. Bevin, who had lost his insurgent challenge to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a year earlier, was the surprise winner of a three-way fight for the nomination in May—a victory attributed in part to a closing ad by Jamestown, \\"Food Fight.\\" (The ad may be viewed here.) After a hard-fought campaign in which he trailed in most public surveys, Bevin that November posted a smashing 53% to 44% victory against attorney general Jack Conway. 2016 presidential campaign=Cruz, March 2015 to May 2016= Jamestown served as the lead media firm in the presidential primaries for the losing campaign of Ted Cruz, placing second to Trump. Weitzner produced ads, with his then-Executive Vice President Jason Miller serving as a senior media spokesman. One of Jamestown's primary spots, \\"Cruz Commander,\\" was named by Time magazine among the top 10 most notable advertisements of the year. (The spot may be viewed here.) =Trump, June to November 2016= In the fall presidential campaign, Jamestown was the primary media firm producing TV spots for Donald Trump, according to AdWeek magazine. Miller served as Senior Communications Advisor (and frequently chief spokesman), and Larry Weitzner was lead ad creator. The firm's most-seen ads came in the campaign's final two months. Weitzner told the Washington Post, \\"Mr. Trump wanted high-energy, high-impact ads that fit his message, and that is what we gave him. He instantly rejected ads he deemed 'boring.' . . . Mr. Trump is also a pro when it comes to production and lighting. We had to make sure lighting and set-ups were perfect on production shoots. . . . Submitting spots for review was another unorthodox aspect of the campaign. Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale directed me to produce spots for review without approving scripts — they wanted to see our vision. I loved that. It gave us a chance to do some interesting ads without idly waiting around for script approval. One of the closing ads, “Choice” was the result of a brainstorming session at Jamestown Associates’ Philadelphia office, where our team came up with the concept of uniquely focusing on one American voter and the choice she was tasked with making.\\") (The \\"Choice\\" ad may be viewed here. ) \\"Movement\\" (a 30-second TV spot) \\"particularly satisfied Mr. Trump’s desire for high-energy, high-impact, non-boring communication. Steve Bannon and KellyAnne Conway told me we needed an ad capturing the fact that Mr. Trump started 'a movement, not a campaign.'\\", Weitzner related in December. \\"The ad isn’t issue-oriented, but it captures the feeling everyone on the Trump campaign, everyone at his rallies, and everyone supporting his candidacy saw as great enthusiasm for his movement.'” The spot was later honored with the Reed Award for Ad of the Year 2016 by Campaigns & Elections magazine. (The ad may be viewed here.) The two-minute summation piece, \\"Argument for America,\\" had an unusual genesis, Weitzner said. \\"It was originally produced as a web video. After seeing it and sharing it with the Trump team, Parscale — who gets credit for the idea — told me, 'Everyone loves it, we are putting it on TV.' Now, that is unorthodox. Two-minute political commercials don’t usually air nationwide. It blew up on social media, with more than 8 million hits, greater than any TV ad produced by either campaign. So many people have told us that ad was the turning point in deciding to vote for President-elect Trump.\\". (\\"Argument\\" may be viewed here.) After the election, Miller left Jamestown and joined the Trump transition team, serving as its chief spokesman. He was offered, but turned down the job of White House Communications Director, and later took a senior position with Teneo, a corporate advisory and lobbying firm. Miller stated that he wished to spend more time with his family. His decision came after allegations of personal involvement with a Trump campaign staffer,\\"Trump staffer allegedly entangled in sex scandal,\\" New York Post, December 26, 2016, retrieved January 3, 2017. and an earlier report of Miller visiting a strip club with other staffers and members of the press before a presidential debate.\\"Trump advisers went to strip club with members of media,\\" The New York Post, October 22, 2016, retrieved January 2, 2017. He later sold his partnership in the firm. Current management Succeeding Miller as Jamestown's current Executive Vice Presidents are Barney Keller (formerly with Club for Growth); Jon Kohan, who managed Senate campaigns for Joni Ernst and Kelly Ayotte; and Ben Hartman, campaign manager for now-Gov. Matt Bevin. Weitzner remains CEO.

Federal subsidies to the honey industry began in 1950, when demand for honey decreased following the end of World War II. The program was eliminated in 1993, and re-instated in 2002. History In the United States, non-recourse marketing loans had long been available to support honey prices until FY1994, when the funding was suspended by provisions in annual appropriations legislation. During World War II, the United States government encouraged the production of honey, which was used as an alternative sweetener to sugar, which was strictly rationed. After the sugar rations were lifted and demand for honey fell, honey producers turned to the federal government for support. Subsidies for honey producers were included in the Agricultural Act of 1949. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration and the United States Senate unsuccessfully moved to eliminate the program. A report by the General Accountability Office found that the subsidies to beekeepers were no longer necessary to ensure the pollination of American crops. President Bill Clinton proposed ending the honey program as part of his plan to reduce the national deficit. By 1991, over half of honey program subsidies went to fewer than 10% of participating beekeepers. The United States Congress ended the honey program in the 1993 agricultural appropriations bill. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) repealed the statutory authority for the honey program. A Honey Recourse Loan Program was made available for the 1998 crop only through broader emergency spending authority in the FY1999 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 105-277). In 2002, president George W. Bush signed an agricultural appropriations bill reinstating the honey program. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1201) made honey eligible for marketing assistance loans (and loan deficiency payments, LDPs) from 2002 through 2007.

He is a personality and social psychologist who is known primarily for his research on unstructured dyadic interaction. His first major line of research within this tradition concerns the phenomenon of empathic accuracy (\\"everyday mind reading\\"). This research is summarized in his 2003 book Everyday Mind Reading: Understanding What Other People Think and Feel. His second major line of research concerns the influence of personal traits and characteristics on people's initial interactions with each other. This research is summarized in his 2009 book Strangers in a Strange Lab: How Personality Shapes Our Initial Encounters with Others. Background Ickes received his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology in 1973 at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was trained in the social psychology program. His primary research advisor was Robert Wicklund, although Elliot Aronson was also an important professional mentor during this time. Ickes's first academic job was at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he initiated the research on unstructured dyadic interaction that he would continue to do throughout his academic career. After leaving Wisconsin, he taught briefly at the University of Missouri-St. Louis (1979–1982). He returned to Texas in 1982 to begin his employment at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he has been for over 30 years. He was a Visiting Professor at the University of Washington in 1992; a Visiting Erskine Fellow at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1999; and an International Francqui Chair at Ghent University and the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2005. Empathic accuracy (everyday mind reading) Ickes has published widely on the topic of empathic accuracy, both alone and in collaboration with various colleagues. The study of empathic accuracy has become an important subfield at the interface of two larger fields of study: research on empathy and research on accuracy in interpersonal perception. Much of the available research on this topic is summarized in two books: Empathic Accuracy (1997) and Everyday Mind Reading (2003). Ickes's books and articles on empathic accuracy currently comprise about 60 publications. His research has helped to answer several important questions about “everyday mind reading.” Do women display greater empathic accuracy than men? The answer is that on some occasions they do, but primarily because of greater empathic motivation rather than greater empathic ability.Graham, T., & Ickes, W. (1997). When women's intuition isn't greater than men's. In W. Ickes (Ed.), Empathic accuracy (pp. 117-143). New York: Guilford Press., Do friends display greater empathic accuracy than strangers? The answer is yes, because friends have shared more of their experiences—both directly and indirectly via their discussions—than strangers have, and therefore know each other’s minds better.Colvin, C.R., Vogt, D.S., & Ickes, W. (1997). \\"Why do friends understand each other better than strangers do?\\" In W. Ickes (Ed.), Empathic accuracy (pp. 169-193). New York: Guilford Press. Do abusive husbands display an impaired ability to \\"read\\" their wives' thoughts and feelings? The answer is yes, and abusive husbands do not show a similar deficit in “reading” the thoughts and feelings of other men’s wives. Does our empathic accuracy depend more on the words other people use and how they say them, or on their nonverbal behavior such as their facial expressions and body postures? The answer is that when all of these sources of information are available, our empathic accuracy generally depends most on what other people say, next-most on their paralinguistic cues (the pitch, inflection, and amplitude of their voice, for example), and least on their nonverbal behaviors. To explore the motivational aspects of empathic accuracy, William Ickes and Jeffry Simpson proposed their empathic accuracy model, which is perhaps the most influential theory in this area of research.Ickes, W., & Simpson, J. (1997). \\"Managing empathic accuracy in close relationships.\\" In W. Ickes (Ed.), Empathic accuracy (pp. 218-250). New York: Guilford Press.Ickes, W., & Simpson, J. (2001). \\"Motivational aspects of empathic accuracy.\\" In G.J.O. Fletcher & M.S. Clark (Eds.), Interpersonal Processes: Blackwell Handbook in Social Psychology (pp. 229-249). Oxford, UK: Blackwell. In this model, they argued that although greater empathic accuracy usually enhances people’s relationships, there are occasions when people are motivated to be empathically inaccurate and avoid knowing what their relationship partner is thinking and feeling. The phenomenon of motivated inaccuracy that was introduced in the model has been substantiated in a number of studies and has been linked to both avoidant and anxious-ambivalent attachment styles. In another important and long-term collaboration, William Ickes was involved in the series of studies that Lesley Verhofstadt and her Belgian colleagues conducted on the role of empathic accuracy in the social support displayed by married couples. Their findings showed that empathic accuracy is useful in identifying the particular kind of support that one’s partner needs, so that the “right” type and amount of support can be provided.Verhofstadt, L., Devoldre, I., Buysse, A., Stevens, M., Hinnekens, C., Ickes, W., & Davis, M. (in press). \\"The role of cognitive and affective empathy in spouses’ support interactions: An observational study.\\" PLOS ONE. In 2008, Ickes published the chapter \\"Mind-Reading Superheroes: Fiction and Fact\\" in an edited book titled The Psychology of Superheroes.Ickes, W. (2008). \\"Mind-reading superheroes: Fiction and fact.\\" Robin S. Rosenberg, Ed., The psychology of superheroes: An unauthorized exploration (pages 119-134). Dallas, TX: Benbella Books, Inc. After comparing the mind reading that fictional superheroes do with the mind reading that lesser mortals do in their everyday lives, he concluded that \\"For me, science doesn't spoil the wonder of mind reading: it deepens and enhances it. And speaking of life's many wonders, who would have thought that the kid who read so many comics about superheroes back in the 1950s would grow up to be The Man Who Measured Mind Reading? I never would have thought it, but the wonder of it all is that I was that kid!\\" (p. 133) Personality influences on strangers' interactions Using the unstructured dyadic interaction paradigm,Ickes, W., Bissonnette, V., Garcia, S., & Stinson, L. (1990). \\"Implementing and using the dyadic interaction paradigm.\\" In C. Hendrick & M. Clark (Eds.), Review of Personality and Social Psychology: Volume 11, Research Methods in Personality and Social Psychology, (pp. 16-44). Newbury Park, CA.: Sage. Ickes and his colleagues have explored the influences of many personal characteristics and personality traits on the interactions between strangers. More specifically, they have examined the influences of such personal characteristics as the participants' gender, their birth order, their race/ethnicity, and their physical attractiveness. They have also examined the effects of various personality traits such as androgyny, the Big Five personality traits, shyness, and self-monitoring. This research is summarized in Strangers in a Strange Lab (2009). Other contributions In addition to his work on empathic accuracy, Ickes has made a broader contribution to the study of intersubjective social cognition. His 1994 article with Richard Gonzalez was the first to draw a strong distinction between subjective social cognition, which occurs entirely in one person's mind and concerns either imagined, reflected-upon, or anticipated interaction, and intersubjective social cognition, which occurs during an actual, ongoing social interaction and involves the intersubjective experience of the interaction partners. Subsequent papers have elaborated this distinction, which owes much to the existentialist influence of writers such as Alfred Schütz and Maurice Merleau- Ponty. Similarly, Ickes's development of a method for measuring empathic accuracy is only part of his broader contribution in applying innovative methods to the study of naturalistic social cognition. Some of these methods enable the assessment and content analysis of the actual thoughts and feelings that interaction partners report, and they also permit an exploration of the intersubjective themes that characterize the interactions of different dyad types. In addition, by comparing the linguistic content of people's self- reported thoughts with the linguistic content of their self-reported feelings, Ickes and Cheng (2011) were able to delineate several ways in which thoughts differ from feelings. In more recent research, Ickes and his colleagues have studied how latent semantic similarity (LSS) develops in dyadic interactions. Ickes's interest in personality is also evident in the various personality measures that he and his colleagues have developed. These measures assess the constructs of adherence to conventional morality, internal-external correspondence, self-motivation, social absorption and social individuation, and strength of sense of self. More recently, he and his colleagues have developed other measures to assess the constructs of thin-skinned ego- defensiveness, affect intensity for anger and frustration, and rudeness.Ickes, W., Park, A., & Robinson, R. L. (2012). \\"F#!%ing rudeness: Predicting the propensity to verbally abuse others.\\" Journal of Language and Social Psychology.Park, A., Robinson, R.L., & Ickes, W.

They have also published psychometric articles on (a) the pitfalls of using item variance as a measure of \\"traitedness\\"Bissonette, V.L., Ickes, W., Bernstein, I.H., & Knowles, E.S. (1990). \\"Personality moderating variables: A warning about statistical artifact and a comparison of analytic techniques.\\" Journal of Personality, 58, 567-587.Bissonette, V.L., Ickes, W., Bernstein, I.H., & Knowles, E.S.

(in press). \\"Evidence for 'context switching' in the effects of average item length and item-length variability on internal consistency.\\" Journal of Personality Assessment. In collaboration with William Schweinle and other colleagues, William Ickes participated in an extensive study of the psychology of maritally aggressive men. Over the course of four studies, Schweinle, Ickes, and their colleagues found that maritally aggressive men are especially inaccurate when inferring their own wives' thoughts and feelings, and that a major source of this deficit is their biased belief that women harbor critical and rejecting thoughts and feelings about their male partners. This biased perception of women as being critical and rejecting appears to help justify the men's marital aggression in their own minds, and it is a bias that they seek to preserve through tactics such as disattending a women's complaints and reacting to such communications with feelings of contempt rather than sympathy. In general, maritally aggressive men appear to be angry, egocentric individuals. For some of these men, marital abuse is the product of a sudden impulse; for others, it is the product of a built-up resentment that has its origin in the biased perception that women harbor critical and rejecting thoughts and feelings about their male partners. These findings have clearcut implications for the treatment of abusive behavior in maritally aggressive men. Finally, Ickes developed a theory of how people's sex roles (gender roles) affect their behavior and experience in initial interactions.Ickes, W. (1981). \\"Sex-role influences in dyadic interaction: A theoretical model.\\" In C. Mayo and N. Henley (Eds.), Gender and nonverbal behavior (pp. 95-128). New York: Springer-Verlag.Ickes, W. (1985). \\"Sex-role influences on compatibility in relationships.\\" In W. Ickes(Ed.), Compatible and incompatible relationships (pp. 187-207). New York: Springer-Verlag.Ickes, W. (2009). Strangers in a strange lab: How personality shapes our initial encounters with others. New York: Oxford University Press. (Chapter 7) The impact of this theory has so far been quite limited, perhaps because it did not receive much attention when the original version of the theory was published in 1981. Ironically, however, a spin-off article titled \\"Traditional Gender Roles: Do They Make, and then Break, our Relationships?\\" has been read and/or downloaded more than 10,000 times from the ResearchGate website. Ickes has, to date, written or co- authored more than 180 publications, which include books, book chapters, journal articles, commentaries, and reviews. Along with John H. Harvey and Robert F. Kidd, he was a co-editor of the three-volume series New Directions in Attribution Research. Books Ickes has published two single-authored books: *Everyday Mind Reading: Understanding What Other People Think and Feel (2003) *Strangers in a Strange Lab: How Personality Shapes Our Initial Encounters with Others (2009) He has also published several edited (or co- edited) books: * Harvey, J., Ickes, W., & Kidd, R.

In 2004 the Coast Guard began using Employee Identification Numbers, or EMPLIDs, to replace the Social Security Number on official forms. Coast Guard officer numbers Coast Guard officer service numbers were unique amongst the military branches in that the entire range of officer numbers was declared upon the initial creation of the service numbers. The officer range extended from #1 to 100,000 and these numbers had yet to be exhausted by the discontinuation of Coast Guard service numbers in 1974. Like the Navy and Marine Corps, the Coast Guard set aside the early service numbers for retroactive presentations; however, for various reasons, the Coast Guard never enacted this project and never issued retroactive officer service numbers. Thus, officer numbers 1 through 999 remained un-issued with the first Coast Guard officer service number being #1000 which was issued to Joseph F. Farley. The next range of Coast Guard officer numbers, 1001 through 20,000 were reserved for issuance to officers of the Regular Coast Guard. These numbers were typically issued to graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy and other Regular Guard appointees. The Regular Coast Guard officer service number range had yet to be reached in 1974 when service numbers were discontinued. Coast Guard officer numbers above 20,001 were reserved for members of the United States Coast Guard Reserve as well as Coast Guard warrant officers and other \\"non-regular\\" Coast Guardsmen. Officer numbers from 20,001 to 60,000 were used into the 1950s and, by February 1957, non-regular officer service numbers had reached #60,393. The 1960s and early 1970s saw the issuance of service numbers into the 70,000 and 80,000 range while 80 and 90 thousand service numbers had been used since 1948 for special uses such as cadets at the Coast Guard Academy. Final distribution of Coast Guard officer service numbers Coast Guard enlisted numbers The first Coast Guard enlisted service numbers began at #100,000 with a range to 200,000. The purpose of beginning Coast Guard enlisted numbers in this range was to ensure that no enlisted Coast Guardsman would have a number previously assigned to an officer. The first enlisted service number was assigned to Mason B. Herring. Service numbers were issued to enlisted personnel, based on date of entry, through the 1920s and early 1930s. In the mid 1930s, the Coast Guard also began a project to retroactively assign service numbers to former members of the Revenue Cutter Service and Lifesaving Service. These numbers eventually ranged from 149,237 through 200,000. It was also at this point that the Coast Guard began to write enlisted service numbers using the format \\"123-456\\" with an alternate method of replacing the dash with a significant space. At the start of World War II, the Coast Guard expanded the enlisted service numbers into a new range from 200,001 to 250,000. These numbers were used between 1941 and 1945; however, in addition to these basic service numbers, the Coast Guard also activated several \\"special duty\\" service number series between one and eight million. These numbers were written in the format \\"1234-567\\" and were issued as follows: * The one million series (1000 000 – 1999 999) was never issued * The two million series (2000 000 – 2999 999) was not issued during World War, but the Coast Guard began using this series in 1948 and continued to issue these numbers until the discontinuation of service numbers in 1974. * The three million series (3000 000 – 3999 999) was used for special duty enlisted personnel during World War II. The issued numbers of these series were between 3000 000 and 3081 999. * The four million series (4000 000 – 4999 999) was used by female Coast Guard members between 1942 and 1945. Forty one thousand of these numbers were issued, ranging from 4000 000 to 4040 999. * The five million series (5000 000 – 5999 999) was used for special duty enlisted personnel for one year in 1942. In all, issued numbers ranged from 5000 000 to 5801 499. * The six million series (6000 000 – 6999 999) was also reserved for special duty personnel during World War II. Issued numbers ranged from 6000 000 to 6207 999. * The seven million series (7000 000 – 7999 999) was used during the later half of World War II which the first numbers issued in the fall of 1943. In all, twenty eight thousand of these numbers were issued ranging from 7000 000 to 7027 999. The final number of the seven million service number series was the highest (but not the last) enlisted service number of the United States Coast Guard. In addition to the special duty service numbers, regular enlisted service numbers continued to be issued during World War II in the 200,000 to 254,999 range. The Coast Guard also activated a 500,000 range and issued these numbers throughout World War II as well. With a theoretically limit of 999,999, these numbers had reached 708,000 by the end of World War II. After the end of the Second World War, the Coast Guard began a new enlisted service number range from 255,000 to 349,999. These numbers were issued between 1945 and 1962 while also, beginning in 1948, the Coast Guard activated the two million service number series and issued these numbers from 1948 until the discontinuation of service numbers in 1974. The highest two million number authorized was 2199 999 although the highest number issued was most likely well below this number. A final range of Coast Guard enlisted service numbers were between 350,000 and 499,999. These numbers were begun for issuance in 1962 and were issued until 1974. This number series was designed to \\"fit in\\" between the lower service numbers, which had been used prior to 1962, and the higher 500,000 numbers which had been used during World War II. Final distribution of Coast Guard enlisted service numbers Coast Guard enlisted service numbers were completely discontinued in 1974 with the Coast Guard being the last of the military service branches to convert to Social Security numbers as the primary identification means for military personnel. The Coast Guard was also the only branch of the military to never use any form of a service number prefix or suffix code. Employee identification number In June 2004, the Coast Guard completed a program to have only an Employee Identification number (EMPLID) appear on Coast Guard Leave and Earnings Statements and other documents not requiring a Social Security number. The format for all EMPLID numbers is a seven digit number where the first digit is 1 and there are no alpha characters used. The numbers are issued without regard to officer or enlisted status and active and reserve components are in the same sequencing. The purpose of the program was to remove the Social Security number from records for identity theft reasons and to provide each service member with a unique identifier on Coast Guard Intranet programs.

Biography Richtmyer was born on October 10, 1910 in Ithaca, New York. His father was physicist Floyd K. Richtmyer (1881–1939) and mother was Bernice Davis Richtmyer. He studied physics at the University of Göttingen and Cornell University, graduating in 1932 when his father was dean of the graduate school. He received a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1935 under advisor John C. Slater. He taught at Stanford University as an instructor in the physics department from 1936 through 1940. During World War II he worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and became the leader of the theoretical division after the war. A letter sent March 11, 1947, from John von Neumann to Richtmyer outlined a technique for approximating complex problems being studied at Los Alamos by Stanislaw Ulam. Richtmyer used the massive IBM SSEC calculator for some of the first large-scale uses of what would be called the Monte Carlo method. Special Issue dedicated to Stanislaw Ulam In 1953 Richtmyer joined the faculty of Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. In 1956 he published a paper with Peter Lax proving the Lax–Richtmyer equivalence theorem. It is sometimes called the fundamental theorem of numerical analysis. Starting in 1964, he taught mathematics and physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder until his retirement in the early 1980s. He was the author of textbooks including Principles of Advanced Mathematical Physics in 1978. In 1990 he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society for his book Difference Methods for Initial-Value Problems. He also played violin with the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra. Richtmyer died on September 24, 2003 in Gardner, Colorado. He was survived by daughters Anna Degen and Roberta Cookingham. An adopted son, Haile Michael Mezghebe (born 1948), is a physician at the George Washington University Medical Center who helped start the first postgraduate medical education program in his native Eritrea.

He was also a prominent educator and United Nations observer. Early life and education Lowe was born on July 8, 1902, in Madison, South Dakota, the youngest of three children. Lowe graduated from Madison High School, and studied at the University of Wisconsin for one year before transferring to the Normal school at Eastern State Teacher's College, where he graduated in 1929. During his senior year, he wrote the premise for and directed the film Dacotah, believed to be the first full-length motion picture filmed entirely on a college campus. Lowe later received his master's degree from the University of South Dakota; he received an honorary Doctor of Education from Ottawa University in 1942. Career Following his graduation from Eastern State, Lowe served as an educator and superintendent in various places in South Dakota, eventually becoming president of the South Dakota Education Association.National Education Association (1962), 5. In February 1946, Lowe became the dean of the Nebraska State Teachers College in Peru, Nebraska. While helping with a Naval Reserves recruiting drive, Lowe convinced those in charge to emphasize the importance of education by using the slogan \\"Stay in School\\". Lowe was offered the office of Director of Education, first of American Samoa, and later of Guam in the 1950s, but turned down both positions in hopes of obtaining a governorship. After his governorships, Lowe became the United Nations observer for the National Education Association in 1964.The Nation's Schools (1963), 114. Military service During World War II, Lowe served in the United States Navy as the commanding officer of the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of Nebraska and Creighton University.

Life and artwork= Education and early work= Thormeyer was born in the Protestant Kreuzkirche parish, Dresden. He started to study painting in very early years at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts under Giovanni Battista Casanova, but changed to architecture in 1791. Friedrich August Krubsacius and Gottlob August Hölzer were his professors there. Since 1800, he belonged to the royal staff as Hofbaukondukteur. Thormeyer created some well known drawings depicting sights of Dresden and its surrounding, e.g. Dom Meißen, Schloss Pillnitz and Katholische Hofkirche (drawn 1807). Many of them were later etched by Christian Gottlob Hammer. Some neo-classical buildings arose in little towns and villages around Dresden, like the Vorwerk Kleindrebnitz.

Afterwards, Thormeyer went on a study trip, which led him e.g. to Switzerland and Italy, thus avoiding direct involvement in the War of the Sixth Coalition. The portrait above was drawn by Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein during Thormeyer's stay 1813 in Rome.

This reconstruction was finished in 1830, integrating the baroque city center with the surrounding and thus creating room for Dresden to grow rapidly during the following decades. In 1814, Russian governor Nikolai Grigorjewitsch Repnin Wolkonski ordered the long-planned outside-staircase to Brühl's Terrace, Thormeyer's best-known masterpiece. About 1823, Thormeyer accomplished the classicizing tower of the Annenkirche, a church of the late baroque era. Moreover, he initiated a memorial statue of Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, finally designed by Ernst Friedrich August Rietschel.

Background George Stephenson was appointed as engine-wright at Killingworth Colliery in 1812 and immediately improved the haulage of the coal from the mine using fixed engines. But he had taken an interest in Blenkinsop's engines in Leeds and Blackett's experiments at Wylam colliery, where he had been born. By 1814 he persuaded the lessees of the colliery to fund a \\"travelling engine\\" which first ran on 25 July. By experiment he confirmed Blackett's observation that the friction of the wheels was sufficient on an iron railway without cogs but still used a cogwheel system in transmitting power to the wheels. Blücher Drawing of Blucher by Clement E. Stretton Blücher (often spelled Blutcher) was built by George Stephenson in 1814; the first of a series of locomotives that he designed in the period 1814–16 which established his reputation as an engine designer and laid the foundations for his subsequent pivotal role in the development of the railways. It could pull a train of at a speed of up a gradient of 1 in 450. It was named after the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, who, after a speedy march, arrived in time to help defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Stephenson carefully measured its performance and realised that overall it saved little money compared with the use of horses, even though the price of corn was at an all- time high because of the wars. He made one significant improvement by redirecting the steam outlet from the cylinders into the smoke stack, thereby increasing the efficiency of the boiler markedly as well as lessening the annoyance caused by the escaping steam. Blücher's performance was described in the second 1814 volume of the Annals of Philosophy. The item started by recording a rack locomotive at Leeds (probably Salamanca) and continued: \\"The experiment succeeded so well at Leeds, that a similar engine has been erected at Newcastle, about a mile north from that town. It moves at the rate of three miles an hour, dragging after it 14 waggons, loaded each with about two tons of coals; so that in this case the expense of 14 horses is saved by the substitution of the steam-engine\\". The item continues to mention a locomotive without a rack wheel (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam). Blücher did not survive: Stephenson recycled its parts as he developed more advanced models. 1815 locomotive By 28 February 1815 Stephenson had made enough improvements to file a patent with the overseer of the colliery, Ralph Dodds. This specified direct communication between cylinder and wheels using a ball and socket joint. The drive wheels were connected by chains, which were abandoned after a few years in favour of direct connections. A new locomotive constructed on these principles was put into operation. Wellington Half- lap jointed rail patented in 1816 The big impediment revealed by the first two engines was the state of the permanent way and the lack of any cushioning suspension. The track was often carelessly laid and with rails of only in length there were frequent derailments. He devised a new chair and used half- lap joints between the rails instead of butt-joints. Wrought iron replaced cast iron wheels and he used the steam pressure of the boiler to provide 'steam spring' suspension for the engine. These improvements were detailed in a patent filed with the iron-founder Mr. Losh of Newcastle on 30 September 1816. Together with the head viewer, Nicholas Wood, Stephenson conducted in 1818 a careful series of measurements on friction and the effects of inclines, or declivities as they were generally called, using a dynamometer which they developed. These were to stand him in good stead in later developments of the railways. Engines constructed on these principles from 1816 were being used until 1841 as locomotives and until 1856 as stationary engines. One of these was called Wellington and another My Lord. Killingworth Billy Billy at Stephenson Railway Museum The Killingworth Billy or Billy (not to be confused with Puffing Billy) was built to Stephenson's design by Robert Stephenson and Company – it was thought to have been built in 1826 but further archeological investigation in 2018 revised its construction date back by a further decade to 1816. It ran on the Killingworth Railway until 1881, when it was presented to the City of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. It is currently preserved in the Stephenson Railway Museum.
