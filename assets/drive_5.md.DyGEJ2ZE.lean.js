Collins, 2004. classiccrimefiction.com, 2013. Retrieved 11 December 2013. Archived here. Throughout its 64 years the club issued a total of 2,025 first editions of crime novels and reached a high standard of quality throughout. In the field of crime book collecting, Collins Crime Club is eagerly sought, particularly pre-war first editions in dustwrappers with their vivid and imaginative images. Marketing Customers registered their name and address with the club and were sent a newsletter every three months which advised them of the latest books which had been or were to be issued; they did not have to promise to buy a certain number of volumes each year. Collins' intention was to publish three new crime books on the first Monday of every month. All three books were supposedly picked by a panel of experts (only one of whom seems to have been named ‚Äî Cyril Alington) and they chose for each month one book which they termed a Selection and two which were Recommended. As a marketing device, the club seems to have been successful in that Collins boasted 25,000 subscribers in 1934. Certainly the number of books published increased beyond the three promised per month, reaching a pre-war peak of 42 books in 1938. Agatha Christie and other notable authors First edition cover 1932, of The Thirteen Problems written by Agatha Christie. The book cover art copyright is believed to belong to the publisher, Collins Crime Club, or the cover artist (not known). The real reason for the success of the club probably lies in the authors that it had on its list, topped by the best- selling crime writer of all time, Agatha Christie. Under contract to Collins since 1926, all except five of her books were published under the Crime Club imprint from The Murder at the Vicarage onwards and most of her classic titles such as Murder on the Orient Express first appeared as Crime Club books with huge sales. From 1939, the Crime Club also issued all the remaining works of Ngaio Marsh to be published (starting with Overture to Death) as well as many of the volumes of such 'Golden Age of Detective Fiction' writers such as John Rhode and Freeman Wills Crofts. U.S. writers such as Hulbert Footner and, later, Rex Stout were also well represented. World War II Wartime paper shortages hit the Crime Club badly. From 1942, it announced on its dustwrappers that they were no longer able to issue quarterly newsletters. The page count of its books reduced from an average of 252‚Äì280 pages down to 160‚Äì192 with smaller typefaces being used as well as far inferior paper. The number of new books being issued dropped dramatically with an all-time low being reached in 1946 when just 16 new books were issued. After the war After the war, both the number of books and their quality of production increased as shortages ceased. The Crime Club managed to keep up with the times with far more diverse and gritty novels and was able to claim notable 'firsts' throughout the remainder of its existence, publishing the first editions of all of the early Lovejoy novels by Jonathan Gash from 1977 onwards starting with The Judas Pair and the Dalziel and Pascoe books of Reginald Hill starting in 1970 with A Clubbable Woman. The end The end was in sight for the Crime Club when Collins was bought out by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1989. The editor of the Club, Elizabeth Walter, managed to keep the imprint going but upon her retirement in 1994, the Club was brought to an end and the final novels to appear under the Crime Club imprint were published in April of that year. HarperCollins' crime fiction output was much reduced and most of the best-selling authors were absorbed into the main imprint of the publishers.

The film won Outstanding Documentary by the Academy Award Screening Committee and won Best Documentary in the Woman in Cinema Film Festival. Summary \\"Indignation can move mountains. It's the strongest emotion,\\" says Germaine Tillion, an anthropology student and active leader in the resistance movement in France, \\"Face with crime and cruelty, something wells up within you. I call it indignation. It's twofold: Anger and revolution, but also a feeling that justice is on your side and the person before you represents evil.\\" When Germany invaded France in May 1940, a small group of women recognized the threat that the Nazis posed and took a stand to fight on the side of humanity for their nations freedom. Sisters in Resistance follows Jacqueline Pery, Anise Postel-Vinay, Germaine Tillion, and Genevi√®ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz - the niece of Charles de Gaulle ‚Äì through their heroic war-time experiences. At the brink of womanhood, when most of them were not yet twenty-years-old, they let their moral foundation inform their actions. While much of the population stood idly by, these young women made protest fliers, tore down Nazi flags, delivered secret war correspondence, and hid their fellow Jews. All four woman clearly recognized the danger they were putting themselves into, but that didn't stop them from doing what they believed was right. Jaqueline says she remembers the first time she saw a small Jewish child branded by a bright yellow Star of David. She was disgusted and horrified. It was then that she realized, \\"I was ready to lose my life. I had to fight.\\" But their actions had consequences. All four were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, and sent to Ravensbr√ºck, an entirely female concentration camp. There, these Gentiles suffered alongside the Jews. Just as their solidarity gave them courage to fight against German occupation, so too simple acts of friendship and kindness helped them survive in Ravensbr√ºck. Every day Germaine would give her friend a little piece of her bread, saying insistently, \\"Take it. You're young. You'll survive, marry, and have ten children.\\" Although they witnessed death all around them, all four friends survive. They say the inhumanity they experienced during the Holocaust only encouraged them to continue fighting for human rights and justice. After being released from the concentration camp, they went off in different directions, but continued to work in humanitarianism. Jacqueline moved to America and lectured to students about her war-time experiences, Germaine denounced France's military use of torture in the Algerian War for independence, Anise documented the use of poison gas in Ravensbr√ºck, and Genevi√®ve lead an international movement to help the poor. At the end of the documentary, Genevi√®ve quotes French writer Andr√© Malraux, saying, \\"the only response to absolute evil is fraternity.\\" Production Reception See also *Resistance movements *Resistance during World War II *French resistance Other documentaries about Holocaust survivors: *Pola's March *Marion's Triumph *Boys of Buchenwald *A Story about a Bad Dream References External links *PBS's website for Sisters of the Resistance *Women Make Movies page for Sisters of the Resistance *Press Release *'Sisters in Resistance' withstood Ravensbr√ºck *The Jewish Channel's blog about Sisters in Resistance * 2000 films American biographical films American films Documentary films about the Holocaust American documentary films Films about the French Resistance 2000 documentary films Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp Films set in France Films set in Germany ","title":"Sisters in Resistance"},{"id":"12815137","text":"A Choirbook is a large format manuscript used by choirs in churches or cathedrals during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

It is the first-known instance of a \\"press boat\\" dedicated to war correspondence during naval battles. The recent advent of wireless telegraphy meant that reporters were no longer limited to submitting their stories from land-based offices, and The Times spent 74 days outfitting and equipping the ship, installing a De Forest transmitter aboard the ship. The ship sent its first news story on 15 March 1904. While they covered naval manoeuvres in Port Arthur and the Gulf of Pechili, De Forest employee H. J. Brown was careful to only transmit their stories to the British-ruled Weihaiwei receiving office from the waters belonging to neutral countries, or within international waters. The receiving tower was manned by 21-year-old De Forest employee H. E. Ahearn. Nevertheless, the ship's presence during wartime meant that it quickly aroused suspicion, and it was boarded and searched several times by Japanese ships, as well as being shot across the bow by the Russian warship Bayan. On 15 April 1904, the Russian government announced its intentions to seize any ships owned by neutral countries that had the radio equipment that could potentially give away their military positions to enemies, a thinly veiled threat against Haimun. Lord Lansdowne quickly dismissed the Russian announcement as \\"unjustifiable and altogether absurd\\". In the end, faced with the prospect of Russian charges of espionage as well as Japanese indignation at not having been foretold about the receiving station constructed without their permission, James dismantled and abandoned the boat, from which he had sent 10,000 words of copy, and continued his war correspondence the traditional way through Weihaiwei.Robertson, Patrick.

She was responsible for delivering military personnel and equipment to ships and stations in the war zone. Built in 1939 as for the Romanian State Maritime Service by Cantieri Navali Riuniti, Palermo, Italy, was taken over while lying idle at New York City, 25 June 1941, by the U.S. Maritime Commission under the authority of Public Law 101 (77th Congress) and Executive Order 8771; acquired by the Navy on a bareboat charter from WSA, 11 August 1941; renamed Pleiades (AK-46), 3 September 1941; and commissioned 25 October 1941, LCDR Drayton Harrison in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations  Following an abbreviated shakedown, Pleiades loaded cargo at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and on 22 November, got underway on her first convoy run through the U-boat infested waters of the North Atlantic Ocean to Iceland. Returning to New York the day after the United States entered World War II, Pleiades completed ten more convoy runs, six to Iceland and four to the United Kingdom by July 1943.  A very dangerous convoy run  Of those, convoys ON 67 in February and Convoy SC 107, which departed New York 24 October 1942, were the most hazardous. On 1 November, with five ships in each column, 9 column convoy SC 107 took departure from Canada for Iceland, and the United Kingdom. Shortly before 20:00, a wolfpack closed on the convoy, and, for almost 70 hours, struck at the columns, repeatedly scoring hits. At 18:37, 4 November, they sank their last ship and departed, having sunk 15, and damaged one other.  Converted to general stores  Steaming south, 25 July 1943, Pleiades spent August, September, and October on a Brazilian run, then, in mid-November returned to the North Atlantic to ply those waters again until June 1944. Converted to a general stores issue vessel, she joined Service Force, Atlantic, 3 July, and three weeks later departed Lynnhaven Roads for the Mediterranean.  Supporting the invasion of Southern France  She anchored at Naples, Italy, 17 August; discharged cargo there until 2 September; then, acting as flagship for a convoy of LCIs, got underway for southern France. Encountering a mistral en route, she delivered her charges to Saint-Tropez, 4 September. From the 5th through the 23rd, she distributed supplies to U.S. 8th Fleet units at St. Tropez, San Raphael, and Marseilles, then sailed to Bizerte, whence she returned to the United States, mooring at Boston, Massachusetts, 29 October.  Tropical South Atlantic runs  Following alterations, Pleiades steamed to Bayonne, New Jersey, to load cargo for Brazil. She completed that Bel√©m-Recife-Bahia run at New York, 12 January 1945; underwent repairs; and then commenced a series of sugar runs to the Caribbean which continued until after the end of World War II. On 4 November, she arrived at New York to complete her last cargo run as a U.S. Navy ship.

As a State Representative Taub focused on healthcare and education. In particular, Taub sponsored legislation capping malpractice suit contingency fees. =2006 State Senate Campaign= In 2006, Taub campaigned for a seat in the 13th District of the Michigan Senate. Originally, the Republican primary race was supposed to be between former her and former Rep. Robert Gosselin in a moderately safe Republican district. When Democrat Andy Levin entered the race, however, Republicans feared that his name recognition and fundraising ability (as the son of an Oakland County Congressman and nephew of Michigan's Senator) in the County could make the seat much more competitive. After John Pappageorge joined the race, Gosselin dropped out in order to run for County Commissioner in Troy. The competition between Pappageorge and Taub was characterized in the media as fierce. Taub claimed that if she had known that Pappageorge was going to run for the Senate, she would not have run. She put Pappageorge's name as an endorser on about 20,000 fliers that were sent throughout the district. She also claimed that Pappageorge received illegal support from the Senate GOP through the New Century Fund, a political action committee (PAC) without any campaign history that funded campaign material on behalf of Pappageorge. Pappageorge won the August Republican primary 58.5% to Taub's 41.5%. Shelley Goodman Taub was re-elected as Oakland County Commissioner in 2008, winning back her old seat.

The Times always has ‚ÄòGarrett‚Äô. O‚ÄôConnor (1886) has ‚ÄòGarret‚Äô but his indexer has ‚ÄòGarrett‚Äô. Lyons (1977) has ‚ÄòGarret‚Äô. ‚ÄòGarrett‚Äô is used here because it occurs more often. (1829 ‚Äì 3 March 1897) was an Irish nationalist and MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party represented Co. Wexford, 1880‚Äì83, and West Wicklow, 1885‚Äì92. He was a strong supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. Byrne was born at Arklow, Co. Wicklow, in 1829. He was a great-grandson of Garrett Byrne of Ballymanus, a leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.The Times, 6/10/1885; O‚ÄôConnor (1886), p.368; see also Pakenham (1969), pp.97, 315. O‚ÄôConnor refers to the ‚ÄòRebellion of ‚Äò48‚Äô but this is presumably a misprint for ‚Äô98. He was the second son of Joseph Byrne of Ballybrack, Co. Dublin and of Mary Anne Byrne, second daughter of Garrett Byrne of Dungarvstown, Co. Wicklow. He was educated privately and at Leopardstown College. In 1855 he married Sarah Dillon, second daughter of James Dillon, a Wicklow merchant. She died in 1875. At an early age Byrne was overseer for the contractors building the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway. He was then the Liverpool agent for a Dublin brewery. In 1856 he was appointed an officer of Customs and Surveyor to the Board of Trade at Liverpool. He was selected as one of two Irish Home Rule Parnellite candidates for Wexford at the general election of 1880 over the sitting Home Ruler Keyes O'Clery, who was backed by the Catholic clergy. This led to a serious outbreak of violence at a meeting at Enniscorthy on Easter Sunday, 28 March 1880, in which Parnell himself was physically attacked.Lyons 1977, pp.119-21 O‚ÄôClery went on to contest the election the following month, but Byrne was elected by a majority of over 2,000. In the vital vote of 17 May 1880 in which Parnell displaced William Shaw as chairman of the Home Rule League, Byrne voted for Parnell.O‚ÄôConnor (1886), p.372 He took part in the subsequent Parnellite campaign of Parliamentary obstruction.O‚ÄôConnor (1886), pp.441, 492 He resigned in June 1883 after just over three years owing to ill- health, to be replaced in his Wexford seat by another Home Ruler, John Francis Small, who was returned unopposed. Byrne stood for Parliament again for West Wicklow in the general election of December 1885, when he defeated the Conservative candidate by more than 4 to 1. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell's leadership, Byrne supported Parnell. Shortly afterwards he was declared bankrupt, in January 1891, as a result of the insolvency of the estate and mortgage broking business which he had set up in 1885. This had been established with a capital of ¬£10,000 and owned various properties in London, Liverpool and Dublin. It had failed owing to inability to realise property due to depreciation in its value, and losses through bad debts. Byrne's ill-health was also mentioned as a factor. Although the business was insolvent, it had a surplus of assets and after this was realised, Byrne's bankruptcy was discharged in August 1891. Byrne retired from Parliament at the 1892 general election, aged about 63; his West Wicklow seat was contested in the Parnellite interest by Charles Stewart Parnell's brother John Howard Parnell, but was won by an Anti-Parnellite, James O'Connor. Byrne died in Mercer's Hospital, Dublin, on 3 March 1897 of septicaemia contracted as a result of a head wound sustained in an accident on the previous 13 February in Grafton Street, Dublin, when he was run down by a Hackney carriage. The inquest on 4 March was conducted by his former Parnellite Parliamentary colleague Dr Joseph Kenny, by then City Coroner. Footnotes Sources *Irish Times, 5 March 1897 *F. S. L.

Built by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel for the Admiralty of Rotterdam in 1632, the ship was the largest Dutch warship built up to that time. Dimensions The gundeck length of this ship was measured at 132 Maas feet, equivalent to 144 Amsterdam feet or 133 ft 8 in (in English Imperial measurements). The maximum breadth was 32 Maas feet (equal to 35 ft 3 in Amsterdam feet, or 32 ft 6 in Imperial), and the depth in hold was 13¬Ω Maas feet (equal to 14 ft 2 inches in Amsterdam feet, or 13 ft Imperial).

He was a Greek physician who had travelled to M√©rida, where there may have been a Greek expatriate community.Collins, \\"M√©rida and Toledo,\\" in James, 203.Thompson, 21. Certainly enough Greek clergy were travelling to Spain in the early sixth century that Pope Hormisdas wrote to the Spanish bishops in 518 explaining what to do if Greeks still adhering to the Acacian heresy desired to enter communion with the local church. At some point in his episcopate, he performed a Caesarian section to save a woman's life.Collins, \\"M√©rida and Toledo,\\" in James, 196. In gratitude, her husband, the richest senator in Lusitania, left all his possessions as a legacy to Paul, as well as immediately giving him one half.Thompson, 43. Though canon law dictated that all gifts to bishops passed to the Church, Paul kept the legacy as his private possession.Thompson, 44. Paul's sister's son, Fidelis, was hired out as a boy to a trading vessel on its way to Spain. When the merchants arrived in M√©rida, they approached the bishop for an audience, as was customary, and Paul discovered his nephew.Collins, \\"M√©rida and Toledo,\\" in James, 202-203. Paul immediately took Fidelis under his wing. Contrary to canon law, he consecrated Fidelis as his successor in the bishopricHillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, 47. and tried to force the clergy to accept his decision by threatening to withhold his vast private wealth which technically belonged to the Church. Paul offered to leave the wealth to Fidelis and after Fidelis' death to the Church, but the bishops initially refused. They were forced to relent when he threatened to remove all his wealth and dispose of otherwise; the riches made M√©rida by far the richest see in Spain. Fidelis, in accordance with Paul's wishes, left the wealth to the Church at his death. Paul's later biographer, the author of the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium, justified the bishop's transgressions of canon law by saying that the ideas had been relevante sibi Spiritu sancto: \\"revealed to him by the Holy Spirit.\\"Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, 48 and n1.

She is known for paintings and prints that combine the system-based aesthetic of Conceptual art with the painterly approach of Neo-expressionism. Many of her pieces are executed on small, square, enamel-coated steel plates that are combined in grid formations to create very large works. Family and education Bartlett was born Jennifer Losch in 1941 in Long Beach, California, one of four children. Her father owned a construction company and her mother was a fashion illustrator who left the field to raise her children. She grew up in the suburbs of Long Beach, close enough to the ocean that she developed an affinity for water which would reappear in her mature work. She attended Mills College in Oakland, California, graduating with a BA in 1963. During her college years she met Elizabeth Murray who became a lifelong friend. She then moved to New Haven to study at the Yale School of Art and Architecture at a time when Minimalism was the dominant style. She studied with Josef Albers, Jack Tworkov, Jim Dine, and Richard Serra, receiving her MFA in 1965. Bartlett has described the experience of study at Yale as her broadest influence: \\"I'd walked into my life\\". In a 2005 interview with the sculptor Elizabeth Murray, she gave this list of things that she said had been on her mind as a first-year art student: :Being an artist, Ed Bartlett, Bach cello suites, C√©zanne, getting into graduate school, getting to New York, Albert Camus, James Joyce. I‚Äôd drawn constantly since childhood: large drawings of every creature alive in the ocean; Spanish missions with Indians camping in the foreground, in the background Spanish men throwing cowhides over a cliff to a waiting ship; hundreds of Cinderellas on five-by-eight pads, all alike but with varying hair color and dresses. Among Bartlett's early influences were the painter Arshile Gorky, whose drawing she admired, Piet Mondrian, for the sense of stillness in the work, and Sol LeWitt, for his conceptual systematics. After marrying medical student Ed Bartlett in 1964, she commuted between the Soho district of New York and New Haven, where she taught at the University of Connecticut. Following her 1972 divorce, Bartlett moved to New York full-time and began teaching at the School of Visual Arts. In 1983 she married German actor Mathieu Carri√®re, with whom she had a daughter, Alice; they divorced in the early 1990s. Work House with Open Door, oil on canvas, wood paint and steel, Honolulu Museum of Art Bartlett is best known for her paintings and prints in which familiar subjects ‚Äî ranging from houses and gardens to oceans and skies ‚Äî are executed in a style that combines elements of both representational and abstract art; indeed, she has commented that she does not accept a distinction between figurative and abstract art. She often works in serial form or creates polyptychs, and she frequently devises rule systems that guide the variations within a given group of works, requiring us to focus on \\"perception, on process, on the effect of shifting perspective‚Äî and on the leaps that take place in our minds no matter how rational we may think we are\\". In the late 1960s, influenced by the work of John Cage, she started bringing chance elements into her work. Her realistic works favor mundane subjects, such as modest houses.Artnet.com Her installations often consist of multiple canvases as well as three dimensional objects. House with Open Door from 1988, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, consists of an oil paint on canvas diptych and the same house constructed out of wood. The Dallas Museum of Art, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern, and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City) are among the public collections holding work by Jennifer Bartletthttp://www.locksgallery.com/artists/jennifer-bartlett Locks Gallery, Philadelphia Most critics see Bartlett's work as inventive, energetic, wide- ranging, and ambitious, and she has been called one of the two best painters of the Postminimalism generation. One writer has noted that a central paradox of her work is that Bartlett has taken the controlled, rationalist grid favored by Conceptual artists and used it to release an evocative torrent of imagery that has much in common with the Neo-expressionist work of the 1980s and that owes a debt to Impressionism as well. A few critics find her work shallow, overly focused on surface, and weakened by its eclecticism. She has had several retrospectives and survey exhibitions, the first in 1985 originating at the Brooklyn Museum (New York) and more recent ones in 2011 at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and 2014 at the Parrish Art Museum (New York). =Early experiments= Early on, Bartlett made a number of three- dimensional works that she subjected to extreme conditions such as freezing and smashing. She also realized that she wanted something to draw on that was erasable but gridded like the graph paper that she and many other Conceptual artists were using at the time. She came up with what is now one of her signature materials: foot-square steel plates with a plain white baked enamel surface on which was silkscreened a quarter-inch grid. She had these fabricated in large quantities, and later worked with other sizes as well. =Rhapsody (1975‚Äì76)= With her earliest well-known work, Rhapsody, Bartlett reinvented the mural form for Conceptual art. Rhapsody is a painting executed on 987 foot-square enamel-coated steel tiles arranged in a grid 7 plates tall by roughly 142 wide, extending across multiple walls. The subject matter consists of variations on what Bartlett felt were the basic elements of art: four universal motifs (house, tree ocean, mountain), geometric forms (line, circle, triangle, square), and color (25 shades). The seven sections are entitled \\"Introduction\\", \\"Mountain\\", \\"Line\\", \\"House\\", \\"Tree\\", \\"Shape\\", and \\"Ocean\\". Rhapsody has been called an \\"extended portable mural\\" and a \\"post- painting painting\\" that \\"took the American art world by storm\\". According to critic Roberta Smith, Rhapsody is an epic achievement that brought together elements of Photorealism, geometric abstraction, and pattern painting while also prefiguring 1980s Neo-expressionism. It is so large that Bartlett has commented that she never saw the piece as a whole until its first public exhibition. Bartlett has said of Rhapsody that it \\"opened the wall up instead of closing it down. It looks bigger than it really is.... It‚Äôs my way of making edgeless paintings.\\" It has been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (New York). Subsequent series such as In the Garden and Amagansett have become more painterly while still retaining their systematizing rigor. Around 2004, she began including fragments of text ‚Äî phrases, bits of dialogue, dreams ‚Äî in some of her paintings. =At Sea, Japan (1980)= In 1980, Bartlett began to work on a complex print project in collaboration with master printers in Japan. The result was At Sea, Japan, a waterscape printed on paper whose 6 panels span 8 feet in width. The image is built up from 96 screenprints and 86 color woodcuts. =In the Garden series (1979‚Äì83)= In the Garden is a series of over 200 drawings (and later paintings and prints) that all take as their subject the garden behind a villa in Nice, France, where Bartlett stayed in the winter of 1979-1980. Bartlett uses a few major motifs ‚Äî an old swimming pool, a statue of a urinating boy, a row of cypresses ‚Äî to explore perspective, scale, and changing light conditions. The drawings range from pencil sketches to pastels and gouaches executed in a range of styles, and many are diptychs or triptychs. She later made her backyard garden in Brooklyn, New York, the focus of a similar series of diptychs. =Sea Wall (1985)= With Sea Wall, Bartlett brought together oil painting and sculpture. The piece consists of a large painting of houses and boats on a dark ground, in front of which are placed sculptural versions of those same objects. =Air: 24 Hours (1994)= A collaboration between Bartlett and the fiction writer Deborah Eisenberg, Air: 24 Hours first appeared as a book of 24 paintings by Bartlett with accompanying text by Eisenberg. Each painting shows a scene in Bartlett's house at a particular hour of the day. =Amagansett series (2007‚Äì08)= Amagansett is a series of oil paintings that take the ocean, skies, and seaside landscapes of Long Island as their subject. They are painted in a distinctive cross-hatched style in a limited palette favoring blues, greens, grays, and browns. Some pieces are diptychs in which Bartlett explores the shifts visible in a landscape between two moments of time or seen from two slightly different angles of view. Element from the Swimmers Atlanta at the Russell Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, Atlanta, Georgia, 2009. =Commissions= In 1981, Bartlett created Swimmers Atlanta, a 200-foot multimedia mural for the Federal Building in Atlanta, Georgia. She has since completed commissions for Volvo, AT&T;, Saatchi & Saatchi, Information Sciences Institute, and Battery Park. Selected Exhibitions * Paula Cooper Gallery, New York, 1976.

In 1910 the Duluth Fire Department constructed a new headquarters nine blocks away. As the department acquired its tenth gas-powered fire engine near the end of that same decade, response times had decreased to the point that there was no need for another station so close to headquarters. The original Fire Station No. 1 was closed on March 1, 1918. The complex was transferred to the city's public works department as a maintenance and storage facility. No longer needed, the station's original bell tower was removed at this time. Sometime between 1925 and 1940 a second-floor passageway was added between the engine house and the shop building. In 1953 the complex was sold to Duluth Public Schools, which used it as a maintenance and storage facility for the rest of the 20th century.

Incentive programs are particularly used in business management to motivate employees and in sales to attract and retain customers. Scientific literature also refers to this concept as pay for performance. Types =Employee= Employee incentive programs are programs used to increase overall employee performance. While employees tend to approve of incentive programs, only 27% of companies have such programs in place. Employee programs are often used to reduce turnover, boost morale and loyalty, improve employee wellness and safety, increase retention, and drive daily employee performance. =Consumer= Consumer incentive programs are programs targeting the customers of an organization. Increases in a company's customer retention rate as low as 5% tend to increase profits by 25%-125%. Consumer programs are becoming more widely used as more companies realize that existing customers cost less to reach, cost less to sell, are less vulnerable to attacks from the competition, and buy more over the long term. =Points programs= Points- based incentive programs are a type of program where participants collect and redeem points for rewards. Points programs may be used to incentivize both employees or consumers. Depending on the program type and the organizational objectives, points can be awarded on a number of criteria including positive employee behavior, the demonstration of organizational values, repeat customer purchases, the sale of new products, increased overall sales, or even the use of proper safety precautions. In addition to point awarding, the levels at which points can be redeemed can be customized by the organization. Points programs are a way for organizations to motivate behavior over time while improving the organizations‚Äô overall performance. Loyalty programs are a frequently used points-based incentive program in which customers that exhibit a certain behavior are rewarded with points, reinforcing that behavior. =Sales= These programs are primarily used to drive sales, reduce sales costs, increase profitability, develop new territory, and enhance margins. Sales incentive programs have the most direct relationship to outcomes. A sales incentive plan (SIP) is a business tool used to motivate and compensate a sales professional or sales agent to meet goals or metrics over a specific period of time, usually broken into a plan for a fiscal quarter or fiscal year. An SIP is very similar to a commission plan; however, an SIP can incorporate sales metrics other than goods sold (or value of goods sold), which is traditionally how a commission plan is derived. Sales metrics used in an SIP are typically in the form of sales quotas (sometimes referred to as point of sale or POS shipments), new business opportunities and/or management by objectives (MBOs) independent action of the sales professional and is usually used in conjunction with a base salary. SIPs are used to incent sales professionals where total sales are not a precise measure of sales productivity. This is usually due to the complexity or length of the sales process or where a sale is completed not by an individual but by a team of people, each contributing unique skills to the sales process. SIPs are used to encourage and compensate each member of the sales team as they contribute to the team's ability to sell. It is not uncommon for the members of such teams to be located in different physical locations and for the product introduction to happen in one location and the purchase of such a product to occur in another location. Dealer Dealer incentive programs are used to improve performance for dealer, resellers, channel partners and other types of brokers using sales incentive programs. These programs help companies capture market share, launch new products, reduce cost of sales and provide momentum for new launches by incenting an external party to drive additional sales. =Online programs= Incentive programs have gained significant traction online; 43% of companies using incentive programs use the Internet as a channel. According to the Online Incentive Council (defunct), since their emergence in 1996, the number of online incentive programs has almost doubled in size every year. At present, nearly every traditional incentive company offers an online component in programs including employee motivation and recognition, sales performance, channel programs, and consumer promotions. Companies that run their programs online experience efficient communication, reporting, and awards fulfillment. Online incentive programs pose an attractive alternative to traditional offline programs since online programs save money and time and allow organizations to have greater control. Incentive websites A website which pays people in gifts or cash for completing provided offers and referring other people and frequently use an [Affiliate marketingaffiliate] model. These sites are typically sponsored by companies in order to advertise their products. The sites are in turn paid for advertising and attracting new clients. By collecting user data that the user submits, companies can target certain areas of clientele and offer products accordingly. In most cases, incentive sites grant rewards for completing requirements. This usually requires viewing advertisements, signing up for a site, entering a PIN code (through a mobile device), purchasing trial products or full products or completing surveys. This in turn rewards the specified user in cash, points, check, or its equivalent. Alternately, an offer may entail referring website visitors by inviting them to a target site under a referral link (unique to every user). Referrers in turn are either paid for every person they invited or as percentage of resulting revenue. Monetary rewards Selecting the appropriate rewards is vital to any program's success. The goal in choosing rewards is to select items that will spark the participant's interest or feelings, and support the program's objectives. Effective rewards will both motivate short-term behavior and provide motivation over time. There are several types of rewards. =Cash= While incentive program participants often state that they prefer cash to non-cash rewards, research has shown that cash is a poor motivator due to its lack of \\"trophy value.\\" In a recent study conducted by the Center for Concept Development, three of five respondents agree that a cash payment is perceived to be part of an employee's total compensation package and not as part of an incentive program. Additionally, cash is quickly forgotten as many participants tend to spend it on everyday items or use it to pay bills. Given that most people do not generally talk about cash awards, cash programs do little to generate the interest required to create an effective incentive program. Research shows that pay for performance often gives only short term gains, frequently gives no gains at all, and may give reduced performance.Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us-Daniel H. Pink =Non-cash rewards= Merchandise and other non- cash rewards are more often perceived as separate from compensation. Accordingly, non-cash rewards tend to stand out as rewards for performance, which enhances their long-term effect. Branded merchandise and other non-cash rewards have high trophy value, bringing greater recognition to the recipient at the time of the award and possessing a long-term lasting effect that can result in increased engagement in the organization's goals. =Gift cards/certificates= Gift cards/certificates are prepaid retail cards or certificates which are redeemed at a later time at checkout. In general, they are available in two types: (1) cards which carry a major credit card brand, commonly referred to as universal gift cards (UGC), and are redeemable at all merchants accepting the credit card brand; and (2) retailer-specific cards, issued by well-known merchants, redeemable only through the issuing retailer. In the 2005 Incentive Federation Study of Motivation and Incentive Applications, gift cards were ranked as the most frequently used type of corporate reward. Gift cards are also more likely to be used for luxury purchases and can build an emotional bond with the organization. =Merchandise= Merchandise rewards can range anywhere from small branded key chains to high-end electronics. In a 2005 study conducted by the Center for Concept Development, 73% of respondents agreed that more stimulating, memorable incentive programs can be built around merchandise as opposed to cash rewards. =Travel= Travel rewards can best be defined as a face-to- face event designed to motivate, either directly or indirectly. In a 2005 study conducted by the Center for Concept Development, 51% of respondents perceived that travel is remembered longer than other incentive rewards. =Experiential= Experiential rewards provide program participants with an experience. This form of reward gives organizations the ability to offer their employees and customers interesting experiences as incentives. Examples might include a seaplane flight and lunch, a two-hour horse ride on the beach, a day of sailing for two, a chance to meet a star athlete, or the use of a party planner for an occasion of the recipient's choice. Experiential rewards allow participants to share their experiences with others and reinforce the reward and the behavior that led to the giving of the reward. Non-monetary rewards Non-monetary incentives are used to reward participants for highly productive behavior. Non-monetary incentives may include flexible work hours, payroll or premium contributions, access to day care centers, training, health savings or reimbursement accounts, or even paid sabbaticals. If it comes to environmental behavior, often labeling and recognition certificates are used. This may include stickers or T-shirts with banner logos and stationary with a company logo.

Overlapping four provinces and covering 400 km2, Kibira National Park lies atop the mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide. It extends north from the provincial town of Muramvya to the border of Rwanda where it is contiguous with the Nyungwe National Park. Forest It is estimated that around 16% of the park consists of primary montane rainforest (the only montane forest in all of Burundi) and is adjacent to two large tea plantations, one in Teza and the other in Rwegura. The Park exceeds 1,100 m in elevation. Dominant tree species include Symphonia globulifera, Newtonia buchananii, Albizia gummifera and Entandrophragma excelsum. The forest contains areas of montane bog and bamboo stands. A total of 644 plants grown in the park. There are 98 species of mammal in the forest and 200 species of birds have been recorded here. Although the Kibira has not been as thoroughly studied as some of its neighboring protected areas, it still is considered 'the most important site in Burundi for the conservation of montane-forest birds'. Birds Some of the important birds found here include the great blue turaco, mountain buzzard (Buteo oreophilus), white-spotted flufftail (Sarothrura pulchra), grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), bar-tailed trogon (Apaloderma vittatum) and the black- and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus). The Kibira is home to a number of primate species, including chimpanzees and black and white colobus monkeys. The park is managed by the Institut National pour l'Environnement et la Conservation de la Nature (INECN). A black-and-white colobus monkey History Until 1933, this forest was a hunting reserve of the kings of Burundi. The local people respected the forest, investing it with a magical power. Rights of use for livestock grazing and the gathering of forest products were recognized. The sacred character of the forest, even prior to the colonial era, helped to conserve it. Between 1933 and 1980 Kibira was classified as the Congo-Nile Ridge Forest Reserve, first under Belgian rule, then after Burundian Independence in July 1962. Only the extraction of high-value timber was regulated and controlled. =Independence= Between Independence and 1980, the right to allocate new land for cultivation within the defined boundary was abolished, although grazing rights were retained. Despite its status as a National Park, there is much pressure on parts of the forest as a result of felling of trees and cutting of bamboo, fire and poaching, and encroaching subsistence agriculture. Water The water from the forests of the Kibira National Park account for over three-quarters of the water that goes into the country‚Äôs largest dam, which generates half of the hydroelectric energy generated in the country.

With outreach staff working across the state and offices located in Chicago, Lake County, and Central Illinois, Faith in Place inspires faithful people to care for the Earth through our four program areas: Energy & Climate Change, Sustainable Food & Land Use, Water Preservation, and Advocacy. History Faith in Place began in 1999 as a project of the Center for Neighborhood Technology. Our goal was to gather religious leaders in the Chicago region in dialogue, prayer, and action on issues of environmental sustainability. Initially, we worked in seven Chicago locations. In time, our work in the seven communities evolved into a region-wide approach. As communities of faith throughout Illinois began requesting our help, we began to welcome participation more widely. Faith in Place incorporated as an independent organization in late 2003 and moved to our own offices in late 2004. Later that year Faith in Place joined efforts with a national organization by becoming the proud Illinois affiliate of Interfaith Power & Light (IPL). As public consciousness about environmental issues and climate change grew in the early 2000s, religious communities increasingly expressed interest in taking action for better Earth care. Faith in Place continued partnering with more faith communities and inspired projects on a variety of scales, from installing rain barrels, to planting community gardens, to changing light bulbs, to becoming solar-powered houses of worship, and everything in between! We also started our popular summer program to involve youth, particularly young African Americans and Latino/as, in energy conservation and exploration of Cook County nature preserves. Realizing that the actions of faithful individuals and houses of worship alone were insufficient to bring about the significant changes needed at the scale of the crises facing our planet, Faith in Place forayed into the realm of policy advocacy. Our first annual trip to Springfield for Advocacy Day was held in 2007 and continues to grow every year. By 2009, we had expanded greatly as an organization and moved our offices to a more centralized location downtown. In 2010, Brian Sauder, a seminarian with an environmental sciences degree helped start an inter-faith vegetable garden with a Mosque and Mennonite church in Urbana. His actions caught the attention of staff in the Chicago office who were seeking to expand outreach to the Central Illinois region, and joined him in launching the Central Illinois office. Brian became our Policy Director and was instrumental in leading several initiatives for statewide environmental legislation. After fourteen years of dedicated service to the organization, Faith in Place‚Äôs founder and longtime Executive Director, Rev. Dr. Clare Butterfield, transitioned to important philanthropic work. She turned Faith in Place over to the capable and trusted hands of board member Henrietta Saunders to lead the leadership transition in autumn 2013. Rev. Brian Sauder became the Executive Director of Faith in Place in June 2014. We continue to expand our outreach to people of faith across Illinois by increasing staff to connect with communities in Lake County, Central Illinois and Southeastern Illinois. In addition, we continue working with geographically, racially, and socio-economically diverse houses of worship, emphasizing the Green Team approach to encourage people to take meaningful action with their faith communities. As we look to the future, we are always excited to meet new faces and engage more people of faith on the path to better Earth care. We also hope to continue inspiring faith partners with whom we have lasting relationships, and challenge each other to deepen our shared commitment to protecting our common land, water, and air for future generations!

Biography Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a noble family of moderate means and spent his early years in Semyonov, a small provincial town. His childhood impressions, pictures of Transvolga, its common people's ways of life had a strong impact upon his later worldview. In 1834 he enrolled at the Kazan University's philological faculty and graduated in 1837. As a student he became interested in the works of Alexander Pushkin and Nikolai Gogol, as well as Vissarion Belinsky's critical essays. Melnikov was about to embark upon the academic career at the University when for some kind of wrongdoing (the nature of which remains unknown) he was deported to Perm to start work there as a teacher of history and statistics. In 1838 he was transferred to Nizhny where he spent the major part of his life. From his teens, Melnikov's major interests were the economics and history of Russia.The Complete Works of Melnikov-Pechersky. Vol. 12. P. 196. As a writer, Melnikov debuted in 1839 in Otechestvennye Zapiski with the series of sketches called From Tambov Governorate to Siberia: The Traveller's Notes. But his first stab at fiction, a short story \\"About Who Epidor Perfilievich Was and Which Preparation Were Taken for his Birthday\\", published by Literaturnaya Gazeta in 1840, proved to be a failure; critics dismissed it as a poor imitation of Gogol. Dismayed, Melnikov stopped writing fiction for the next 12 years. In 1841 Pavel Melnikov became the associate member of the Russian Archeological society. In 1840-1850 he edited The Nizhny Novgorod Government News (the non- official section of it) where he often published historical and ethnographical materials which he had collected. In 1847 he became the Governor of Nizhny Novgorod's special envoy, then moved to the Russian Interior Ministry to supervise the issues dealing with the Raskol. An 'administrative Don Quixote', as was known, treated his mission with extraordinary zeal which vexed his seniors and got him a bad name in the city. Melnikov became notorious as a cruel destroyer of Old Believers' sketes and made way into Raskolniki's folklore. According to songs and legends about him, Melnikov had sold his soul to the Devil to obtain a special gift of \\"seeing through walls.\\" Portrait by Ivan Kramskoy. Later, having studied the history of Raskol, he changed his attitude. In his special \\"Report on the Current Situation in Raskol\\" (1854) Melnikov argued that the low level of morality among the Orthodox church officials was to blame. After the death of Tsar Nikolai I he was one of the first to demand the maintenance of religious tolerance in Russia (\\"The Note on Russian Raskol\\", a report for Grand Duke Konstantin, 1857; \\"Letters On Raskol\\", 1862). In 1862 he declared that the 200 years of Old Believers' persecution was unnecessary and wrong.Severnaya Pchela. No. 142, 1862. Melnikov was a liberal, calling for reforms and enlightenment of the people. He remained sceptical of the revolutionary movement's true aims but greatly respected Alexander Hertzen. Following his close friend Vladimir Dal's advice, Melnikov resumed writing and in 1852 published the short story \\"Krasilnikovy\\" in Moskvityanin. This and other stories and novelettes that followed (to be published mostly in Russky Vestnik) targeted social and domestic despotism, all-pervading corruption and serfdom. Close to the natural school, they were praised by Russian radical critics of the time. Nikolai Chernyshevsky called Melnikov \\"one of our most gifted storytellers\\" and compared him with Saltykov- Schedrin in terms of having \\"word's denuniciation power.\\"The Complete Works of Melnikov-Pechersky. Moscow, 1948. Vol. 4. P. 736 Nikolai Dobrolyubov too mentioned Melnikov alongside Saltykov-Schedrin as one of the Russia's two most prominent satirists of the 1850s.The Complete Works of Melnikov-Pechersky. Moscow, 1941. Vol. 5. P. 375. In 1858 the collection of stories by Pavel Melnikov was banned by censorship. In 1861 the novel Grisha was published; seen as weaker than previous ones, it contained nevertheless interesting Old Believers' characters. Modest Musorgsky saw one of those, Varlaam, as similar to Pushkin's character of the same name from Boris Godunov, and merged the two, in his opera Boris Godunov, using also the song \\"As in the city of Kazan\\", from Grisha novel. In 1866 Melnikov retired, moved to Moscow and devoted all of his time to literature, using the pseudonym Andrey Pechersky, contributing mostly to Russky Vestnik. Much of this output was motivated by financial issues: his large family relied on the money he earned by writing as their only source of income. His literary friendships were few: Alexei Pisemsky, Apollon Maykov, Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin. He knew well Nikolai Nekrasov, but disliked him. For the last ten years of his life Melnikov lived in Nizhny Novgorod, spending summers on his estate. During his Moscow period Melnikov-Pechersky wrote several historical works (among them \\"Princess Tarakanova and the Princess of Vladimir\\", 1867) and started what proved to be his magnum opus, the dilogy In the Forests (1871‚Äì1874) and On the Hills (1875‚Äì1881). He dictated the last chapters of the latter to his wife while terminally ill. =Legacy= Both In the Forests and On the Hills were immensely popular. Pavel Tretyakov himself commissioned Ivan Kramskoi to paint the author. Maxim Gorky called On the Hills \\"the glorious poem of Russia\\" and urged young authors to take lessons from Melnikov-Pechersky and Nikolai Leskov, learning from them \\"the clarity and richness of language.\\"The Complete Works of Melnikov-Pechersky in 30 volumes. Moscow, 1955. Vol. 29. P. 2 Melnikov-Pechersky's two novels greatly influenced Vladimir Korolenko and especially Pavel Bazhov.The Works of Melnikov-Pechersky in 3 volumes. Vol. 3, P. 287 It was Melnikov-Pechersky's dilogy that inspired Mikhail Nesterov to create pictures like \\"In the Woods\\", \\"On the Hills\\", \\"Nightingale Sings\\" and \\"Beyond the Volga\\".

Stubbington House School was known by the sobriquet \\"the cradle of the Navy\\". The school was relocated to Ascot in 1962, merging with Earleywood School, and it closed in 1997. History Donald Leinster-Mackay, an academic researcher into the history of education, has said that \\"No school had stronger ties with the Royal Navy in the nineteenth century than Stubbington House.\\" The school was founded in 1841 by the Reverend William Foster, who had been born around 1802 and was an alumnus of Trinity College, Cambridge. He had married Laura, a daughter of Rear-Admiral John Hayes, and it is probable that this accounts for the connection with the navy that the school developed. Another factor affecting its primary purpose was the introduction in 1838 of an entrance examination for the Royal Navy: although initially an undemanding test for most, this decision encouraged the development of specialised educational establishments, of which Stubbington House was a very early example. In addition, Hampshire has a historically close connection to the navy, and the closure of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1837, together with the deployment of HMS Britannia as a cadet training ship proved to be timely. The original building was \\"a square Queen Anne house with a mid Georgian fa√ßade of 5 bays and 3 storeys in grey brick with red dressing and an open pedimented porch\\". It was situated in around of parkland, of which half was used by the school. The building had been constructed around 1715, supposedly with proceeds from contracts to supply the army and navy. In due course, it was extended to meet the demands of the school as the number of pupils increased. The site eventually included two separate sanatoria facilities, as well as a gymnasium and various other structures. Beginning with 10 pupils, the school had around 40 a few years later, and 21 in 1871. William Foster died while away from home at Leamington in 1866. He was succeeded by one of his sons, Montagu Henry Foster, and by 1883 the school roll had increased to around 130 pupils. This increase is in part attributable to the efforts of Montagu's brother, the Reverend Courtenay Foster, who opened a department to train boys for entry to the army via Woolwich and Sandhurst, for which aim the boys stayed at the school for a longer time. Charlotte Mitchell, a senior lecturer in English Literature, has analysed surviving bank statements of Charlotte Yonge, the writer. Mitchell has speculated that payments made by Yonge to a Mr Foster may relate to school fees for one of her nephews, Maurice Yonge, who was at Stubbington House when the 1881 census was taken. There were payments in 1880 of ¬£59 12s. 8d. and ¬£59 11s. 9d., followed in 1881 by payments of ¬£61 13s. 5d. and ¬£60 2s. 1d. Finally, in 1882, there was a payment of ¬£66 0s. 2d. Montagu Foster was involved in legal action on at least two occasions during his headmastership. In 1883 he lost an action brought by a former master that related to constructive dismissal, during the proceedings of which several witnesses commented on the lack of discipline at the school. Subsequently, in 1897, The British Medical Journal reported that he had successfully sued a parent in relation to monies owing for out-of-term care of a pupil who had fallen ill. He also found his school among a handful that were subjected to criticism by the Association of Preparatory School Headmasters, who, in 1901, were successful in persuading the Admiralty that the official recognition of this small number as naval entrance examination centres gave an unfair advantage. The school uniform around this period was \\"... an Eton type jacket with long sleeves and a waistcoat. [The] trousers were black and grey striped ‚Äî long or short according to age. Caps bearing the MHF (Montagu Henry Foster) school badge were worn. In winter bowlers were worn for church with boaters in the summer.\\" Montagu died in April 1913, leaving an estate that was valued at ¬£163,140. According to Alumni Cantabrigienses, his son, Montagu Richard William Foster (1870-1935), had taken over as headmaster in 1903 and continued in that role until 1928, the same year that he received a knighthood. However, Leinster-Mackay says that the change of office took place at the time of Montagu's death in 1913. Montagu junior had been born and educated at the school, and subsequently he had taken his degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had taken over running the army department upon the early death of his uncle, Courtenay, but closed it in 1913 and thus reduced the school roll by around 50 pupils. Changes in government policy, which came about primarily because of the escalating naval rivalry between Britain and Germany, also affected the school population. A reduction in numbers came with the closure of the Britannia cadet training facility, causing pupils to leave at an earlier age for the Royal Naval College at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The outcome of these changes was that there were 77 pupils in 1913. The Foster family line of ownership and headmastership continued with Hugh Richard Montagu Foster, who took over from his father in 1928. In 1930, the school was advertising that it had 130 pupils, and Hugh continued in charge until near to his own death in July 1959. Hugh's obituarist in The Times noted that this was the end of the male line, although there were plans to continue the school, and that The arrangement of the business was adjusted in 1958 with the creation of a charitable trust but the Foster family remained as owners until 1963, paying a headmaster to run the school. A combination of death duties demanded from the family and also the high cost of maintaining the buildings caused the school to move to Ascot in 1962. There it merged with the long- established Earleywood School before subsequently closing on 7 July 1997. A limited company, Stubbington House Earleywood Limited, had been formed in 1963. A few of the school buildings still remain in Stubbington, although most became derelict within a year of them being sold to Fareham Council, for ¬£97,000, in 1962. The main school house was demolished in 1967. The site and the surviving buildings are now a community centre. There is a memorial to the family in the 12th-century Rowner Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, PO13 9SU.

Network file management (NFM) is a data storage management-related category that was identified and defined in 2004 by several prominent data storage analysts. The term is used interchangeably with NAS virtualization and file virtualization among data storage industry press, analysts and system administrators. The basic idea of NFM is that the rapid, ongoing growth of file data capacity on enterprise networks has led to massive management complexity and accelerating operating costs. NFM is the concept of creating a virtualization layer between the clients and the file servers (or NAS devices). By creating this abstraction layer, System Administrators may simplify the management of multiple storage devices, including non-disruptive movement of data between servers, preserving the client access path (pathname), policies for automating the placement of data according to its changing needs, and the ability to discover, analyze and report on server and file usage.

Under good conditions in size, shape and internal structure it may be considered a \\"beefsteak\\".Tigerella is generally smaller than the Mr Stripey variety and the colors are less defined, they actually are two distinct different heirloom varieties. Tigerella isn't as sweet or \\"low-acid\\" as the Mr Stripey variety either. Like other heirlooms, Mr. Stripey has an appearance that differs considerably from other tomatoes. In coloration it is generally somewhat more yellow near the stem and more red towards its underside, with gentle stripes of red and yellow blending into each other along the sides. This coloration may extend into the interior of the fruit, which tends to be more yellow than red. When conditions are right and the fruit is fully ripe the taste will be surprisingly sweet and mild, superior to most store bought varieties. The mild character of the tomato flavor is best used where it is intended to blend in with other flavors such as in a pasta sauce or salad. The flavor in good conditions and when fully ripe is pleasingly sweet when sliced raw - excellent for hors d'oeuvres. The ripe flesh is soft, juicy and extremely tender.

The Scrabble variant most popular in English is standard match play, where two players compete over a series of games. Duplicate Scrabble is not popular in English, and High score Scrabble is no longer practised. Although English is a worldwide language, the official list of allowable words and some tournament rules differ between territories.  North America  The sanctioned Scrabble association in North America is the North American SCRABBLE Players Association (NASPA), which has sanctioned official clubs and tournaments since 2009, taking this role over from the National Scrabble Association. Tournaments range from one-day tournaments of less than 10 rounds to the North American Scrabble Championship, which lasts 5 days and 31 rounds. Larger tournaments can also carry significant prize money. The official lexicon is the Official Tournament and Club Word List. When a player challenges a word, if the word is not in the lexicon it is removed from the board with a score of zero. If the word is in the lexicon, the player who challenged the word loses a turn. Scrabble clubs meet on a regular basis, usually weekly or biweekly at the same venue. Players usually play a smaller number of games than they would play at a tournament.  United Kingdom  Match-play Scrabble is also practised at tournaments and clubs in the UK. Tournaments follow a similar structure to American ones, usually at least six games. Weekend tournaments where players play 12 to 16 games are not uncommon. The Association of British Scrabble players sanctions official tournaments with official ratings, which range from about 200 to about 50. The official lexicon is Collins Scrabble Words (CSW19). In contrast to American tournaments, players do not lose a turn if they challenge a valid word. Instead the other player gains points, usually five per challenged word. This means more words are challenged than in North American play.  Hong Kong  There are only Scrabble competitions for primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong. Inter-School competitions are held by companies and organisations such as Mattel and Broadlearning. In May 2015, Hong Kong Student Scrabble Players Association organised the Inter- School Scrabble Championship. Some schools also organise invitational Scrabble competitions every year.  Smaller countries  Many countries have small English-language Scrabble associations. 23 countries have been represented at the World Scrabble Championship, including some where English is not an official language, such as Romania, Thailand and France. Other countries that do not use the Latin script also may play in English if the language is not suitable for Scrabble, such as Japan. The largest tournament in the world, by number of players, is Thailand's English-language Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup, which draws as many as 8,000 players.

Description Small Self-Contained Payload G-616 was managed and owned by Thomas M. Hancock III, a space scientist from Redlands California. G-616 was assigned by NASA to Hancock in 1987. He developed and constructed the primary payload. It was approved for flight by NASA in 1988. G-616 originally consisted of 3 experiments: #A study on the effects of low Earth orbit on sympatic (Space Shuttle External Tank) foam ‚Äì to assess if leaving a Space Shuttle External Tank in space was feasible. #Static Computer Memory Integrity Testing (SCMIT) ‚Äì looking for soft event upsets (bitflips) in static computer media #Cultavor Microgravity Exposure (seeds in space). This experiment was to fly over two million seeds of 57 types from all over the world to orbit. History Preflight testing with the Goddard Space Flight Center demonstrated that 24% of the Space Shuttle External Tank Foam sample outgassed in 24 hours. This was several hundred times over what was allowed for on-orbit operations. In addition, high UV would break down the basic structure of the foam. Based on this information, the experiment was pulled prior to flight. The test answered the basic question: NASA cannot leave Space Shuttle External Tanks in orbit without creating significant debris. The other two experiments passed testing and payload safety data reviews in 1989. In 1989, Hancock offered the Redlands Unified School District the chance to fly floppy disks and received over 1.5 million of the flown planet seeds for student instruction. Hancock worked with every school in the Redlands Unified School District in support of this effort. A contest was held within the Redlands Unified School District for a student to develop a logo for this mission. It was flown on the outside of the payload canister during the mission. The payload was integrated at KSC in early 1990 and was the 1st Shuttle Small Payload constructed and assembled for flight at KSC since the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Hydrogen leaking from the Space Shuttle main propulsion system delayed launch for over 1 year. During this time, the payload was stored on the GAS Bridge Assembly ready for flight at Hangar AF, NASA/KSC. On June 5, 1991, the payload was launched in the Space Shuttle Columbia as part of the STS-40 SLS-1 mission (SpaceLab Life Sciences-1). The payload spent 9 days in orbit before landing at Edwards Air Force Base. The payload was recovered at KSC during the first week of July 1991. The disks flown for the students as part of Hancock's experiment, and over 1.5 million seeds were presented to the Redlands Unified School District in August 1991. Results Papers about the experiments were published in 1988, 1993, and 1999 at the Shuttle Small Payload Symposiums. A presentation on the results from both flights of the SCMIT experiment (STS-40 and STS-87) was presented at the US Naval Academy in 1999 - See also * Getaway Special * STS-40 * Floppy disk References External links * NASA STS-40 mission summary * Mission Detail Kit in PDF format.

Between 1 December 1941 and 10 October 1942, the cargo ship made five round-trip voyages. On 7 November 1942, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, to begin operations with the Naval Transportation Service. The ship's new assignment involved shuttling supplies and personnel between ports in the Eastern, Panama, Gulf, and Caribbean Sea Frontiers.  Post-war decommissioning  Aquila followed this routine until she was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 October 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 24 October 1945, and the ship was returned to the Maritime Commission for disposal. She was then placed under charter by Alcoa Steam Ship Co., at Portsmouth, Virginia, 9 October 1945, renamed MV Bonanza.

A young university graduate, her family expects her to look for work abroad, but in her idealism she takes on a challenging job in the provincial public school, which lacks resources and has corrupt personnel. The heavy monsoon rains and the nearby NPAs also add to her difficulties. Melinda goes about her work with daily diligence though, always having a smile, a kind word for her neatly uniformed charges. But her battles against apathy, corruption, and contempt are constant, further hindered by the volatile political climate in which fathers and sons are constantly recruited to join guerilla forces fighting in the mountains. When a funding opportunity in the form of a regional singing contest presents itself to Melinda, the idealistic teacher must smartly juggle uncooperative school administrators, confrontational parents, and the torn children themselves in order to let their small voices be heard.

It is based on the book by Peter Wyden. The movie was written by David W. Rintels and directed by Joseph Sargent. It starred Brian Dennehy as General Leslie Groves, David Strathairn as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and Michael Tucker as Dr. Leo Szilard. It premiered in the United States on March 5, 1989 on the CBS network. It won the 1989 Emmy award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special.Day One (1989) (TV) - Awards The movie received critical acclaim for its historical accuracy despite being a drama. Plot When Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard leaves Europe he eventually arrives in the United States where, with the help of Albert Einstein, he persuades the Federal government to build an atomic bomb. General Leslie Groves selects physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to head the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where the bomb is built. As World War II draws to a close, Szilard (whose idea was responsible for the progress made) has second thoughts about atomic weapons and debates how and when to use the bomb. The film focuses on the organization and the politics of the whole affair, such as tensions between the scientists and the military, the communist affiliation of many scientists around that time, the (perceived) risks of espionage and the decision whether to use the bomb after Germany is defeated. Concerning the actual scientific work on the bomb, some of it is shown, but not explained, so an understanding of the workings of the bomb is needed to understand what is going on in that respect. The story starts with Leo Szilard fleeing Germany on the last train out and trying to convince the military that a nuclear bomb can be built and that the Germans are already working on it. In England, his idea is filed and ignored, so he travels to the US, but there too, he has to wait a year until something is done with it and Project Manhattan is started. As Germany is being defeated and its scientists interrogated, it is found out that they have not even come close to constructing a nuclear bomb (partly due to bad cooperation by scientists). Despite the fact that no one has the technology now, and the original reason for project Manhattan is gone, work continues. Szilard, who first used Einstein to get his ideas about building a bomb across to the US leaders, now convinces him to join him in writing a letter to the president to do the opposite, namely not to build the bomb, in order to avoid an arms race. 68 scientists sign a petition, but that is held back by the military. U.S. President Truman is faced with four options: peace talks (which would require the Japanese to keep their emperor, as eventually happened), a blockade (which was thought to be cowardly), an invasion (estimated by some to cost up to a million lives, though such numbers have been widely disputed), or dropping the bomb. Another consideration is that the USSR had said they would enter the war against Japan three months after the surrender of Germany and there is a fear that they might not leave. So Truman decides that the best course of action is to drop the bomb on Hiroshima, against the advice of General Eisenhower. Cast Production =Rival project= The film premiered on television in the same year that another film about the subject, Fat Man and Little Boy, starring Paul Newman as General Groves and Dwight Schultz as J. Robert Oppenheimer, was released to theaters. References  See Also  * The Beginning or the End, 1947 docudrama film about The Manhattan Project.

Career Reyes was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 15, 1980 and spent four seasons in the Dodgers farm system before making his major league debut in 1983. He alternated between AAA and the Majors for most of the next five seasons before the Dodgers traded him to the Montreal Expos in March 1989. After two seasons with the Expos, he bounced around the minor leagues for several more seasons before retiring after the 1999 season. His nickname as a player was \\"Onionhead.\\" Early seasons The Dodgers signed Reyes as an undrafted free agent in 1980. At the age of 16 years old, Reyes made his pro debut for the Lethbridge Dodgers of the Pioneer league, appearing in six games. In 1980, he split time between Lethbridge and the Vero Beach Dodgers of the Florida State League. Vero Beach had no shortage of future major league talent. On the team was outfielder R.J. Reynolds, pitcher John Franco, First baseman Sid Bream, and shortstop Dave Anderson. During his time with Vero Beach, Reyes saw action at both first base and catcher.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=d16318db At this point, Reyes still had just a handful games of experience and was still struggling to get his batting average over the Mendoza Line. In order to get him more playing experience, for the 1982 season, the Dodgers farmed Reyes to the Lodi Dodgers of the California League. Three years into his career, and Reyes had struggled to break past the single A level. However, with Lodi, he appeared in 127 games, more games than he'd played in the previous seasons combined. Reyes showed that his bat had some power, as he hit a career high 15 home runs and batted .281.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=reyes-001gil He was the unquestioned starter at catcher. Reyes had a banner year in 1982, and big things were in store for him in 1983. In 1983, Reyes began the season with the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League. San Antonio was the Dodgers double-A affiliate, meaning that finally Reyes had broke above the single A and rookie league levels. With San Antonio, he played alongside Dodgers prospects like first baseman Franklin Stubbs and pitchers Sid Fernandez and Ken Howell. Reyes journey didn't stop there. He soon was promoted to the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes. There he played behind highly touted catching prospect Jack Fimple. At the age of 19, Reyes was one step away from the major league level. With Albuquerque, Reyes played 19 games at catcher and had a.938 fielding percentage and even took part in a double play.https://www.baseball- reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=29929c5a#all_team_fielding_C MLB debut On June 11, 1983, Gilberto Reyes made his debut in a Saturday Night game verses the Cincinnati Reds.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN198306110.shtml The game was played in Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, and Reyes made a little history. Filling in for the veteran Steve Yeager, Reyes went hitless in two at-bats. Reyes was later lifted for pinch hitter Ron Reonicke and Yeager replaced Reyes behind the plate. But history was made. at the age of 19, Reyes was the youngest player ever to play catcher for the Dodgers.https://dodgersyat.com/2017/09/13/the- curious-case-of-gilberto-reyes/ Reyes played in 19 games before being re- assigned to the minors. MLB career and return to the minors Over the course of thenext few season, Reyes would bounce back between the majors and the minors. Playing for San Antonio in 1984, Reyes batted .303, the only time in his career he hit above the .300 mark. he appeared in a hndful of games for the Dodgers in 1984 and 85, but spent the majority of his time playing for Albuquerque. In 1987, he split time in Albuquerque with Orlando Mercado, another young catching prospect who made his MLB debut at a young age. Reyes was 19 when he debuted for the Dodgers in 83, and Mercado was 20 when he debuted for the Seattle Mariners in 1984. However, the most bizarre part of Reyes career happened during the 1988 play offs. Reyes was part of the Dodgers post-season roster, but he was injured. As the Dodgers were facing the Oakland A's in the final game of the 1988 world series, Gilberto Reyes was flying in from his home in the Dominican Republic.

Reyes spent all of 1992 out of baseball, but signed a minor league deal to play for the Colorado Rockies Triple-A team, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. When the season was over, the Rockies did not renew his contract, making Reyes a free agent. Reyes spent the next few season playing for Campeche in the Mexican League before making one last return to states. The Expos brought back Reyes to work with their young pitchers with the Ottawa Lynx. However, after a handful of games, Reyes was released in order to make room for younger catchers. The main reason Reyes did not play any baseball is because while he was a member of the Montreal Expos in 1991, Reyes failed a drug test and was suspended for 60 games. However, this was Reyes first offense but an arbitrator ruled that Reyes should never have been suspended because this was his first offense.https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/08/a-brief- history-of-mlb-drug-suspension-arbitration-or-dont-worry-a-rod/278852/ Reyes spent the 1996 and 1997 seasons playing in Mexico, but returned to the states in 1998 to play for the Madison Black Wolf, an independent team playing in the Northern League. Teams in the Northern League were not affiliated with any of the teams in the majors. Like most teams in the league with was filled with cast offs, and ex stars trying to find their way back to the big leagues. Reyes was the starter for Madison, but he was also 34 years old and struggling at the plate.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=f739579f Reyes spent the 1999 season between playing in Mexico and for the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League, yet another independent league. The team was managed by former Cy Young winner Sparky Lyle featured ex-Cubs star Jerome Walton, who, like Reyes, was trying to find his way back to the big leagues. After the 1999 season was over, Reyes finally hung up his cleats for good and retired.

They act by breaking the beta-lactam ring that allows penicillin-like antibiotics to work. Strategies for combating this form of resistance have included the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics that are more resistant to cleavage and the development of the class of enzyme inhibitors called beta-lactamase inhibitors. Although Œ≤-lactamase inhibitors have little antibiotic activity of their own, they prevent bacterial degradation of beta-lactam antibiotics and thus extend the range of bacteria the drugs are effective against. Medical uses The most important use of beta-lactamase inhibitors is in the treatment of infections known or believed to be caused by gram-negative bacteria, as beta-lactamase production is an important contributor to beta-lactam resistance in these pathogens. In contrast, most beta-lactam resistance in gram-positive bacteria is due to variations in penicillin-binding proteins that lead to reduced binding to the beta-lactam. The gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus produces beta- lactamases, but beta-lactamase inhibitors play a lesser role in treatment of these infections because the most resistant strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) also use variant penicillin-binding proteins. Mechanism of action The Ambler classification system groups known beta- lactamase enzymes into four groups according to sequence homology and presumed phylogenetic relationships. Classes A, C and D cleave beta-lactams by a multi- step mechanism analogous to the mechanism of serine proteases. Upon binding, a serine hydroxyl group in the beta-lactamase active site forms a transient covalent bond to the beta-lactam ring carbonyl group, cleaving the beta-lactam ring in the process. In a second step, nucleophilic attack by a water molecule cleaves the covalent bond between the enzyme and the carbonyl group of the erstwhile beta-lactam. This allows the degraded beta-lactam to diffuse away and frees up the enzyme to process additional beta-lactam molecules. Currently available beta-lactamase inhibitors are effective against Ambler Class A beta- lactamases (tazobactam, clavulanate, and sulbactam) or against Ambler Class A, C and some Class D beta-lactamases (avibactam). Like beta-lactam antibiotics, they are processed by beta-lactamases to form an initial covalent intermediate. Unlike the case of beta-lactam antibiotics, the inhibitors act as suicide substrates (tazobactam and sulbactam) which ultimately leads to the degradation of the beta-lactamase. Avibactam on the other hand does not contain a beta-lactam ring (non beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor), and instead binds reversibly. Ambler Class B beta-lactamases cleave beta-lactams by a mechanism similar to that of metalloproteases. As no covalent intermediate is formed, the mechanism of action of marketed beta-lactamase inhibitors is not applicable. Thus the spread of bacterial strains expressing metallo beta-lactamases such as the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 has engendered considerable concern. Commonly used agents Currently marketed Œ≤-lactamase inhibitors are not sold as individual drugs. Instead they are co- formulated with a Œ≤-lactam antibiotic with a similar serum half-life. This is done not only for dosing convenience, but also to minimize resistance development that might occur as a result of varying exposure to one or the other drug. The main classes of Œ≤-lactam antibiotics used to treat gram- negative bacterial infections include (in approximate order of intrinsic resistance to cleavage by Œ≤-lactamases) penicillins (especially aminopenicillins and ureidopenicillins), 3rd generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Individual Œ≤-lactamase variants may target one or many of these drug classes, and only a subset will be inhibited by a given Œ≤-lactamase inhibitor. Œ≤-lactamase inhibitors expand the useful spectrum of these Œ≤-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting the Œ≤-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria to deactivate them. * Œ≤-lactamase inhibitors with a Œ≤-lactam core:  Tebipenem is the first carbapenem to be administered orally in the form of tebipenem- pivoxil. Structural and kinetic studies of tebipenem is available with M. tuberculosis beta-lactamase (BlaC).  Clavulanic acid or clavulanate, usually combined with amoxicillin (Augmentin) or ticarcillin (Timentin)  Sulbactam, usually combined with ampicillin (Unasyn) or cefoperazone (Sulperazon)  Tazobactam, usually combined with piperacillin (Zosyn and Tazocin) * Œ≤-lactamase inhibitors without a Œ≤-lactam core:  Avibactam, approved in combination with ceftazidime (Avycaz), currently undergoing clinical trials for combination with ceftaroline  Relebactam, used in combination with imipenem/cilastatin (Recarbrio).  Vaborbactam, used in combination with meropenem (Vabomere) Beta-lactamase producing bacteria Bacteria that can produce beta-lactamases include, but are not limited to: * Staphylococcus  MRSA(Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) * Enterobacteriaceae:  Klebsiella pneumoniae  Citrobacter  Proteus vulgaris  Morganella  Salmonella  Shigella  Escherichia coli * Haemophilus influenzae * Neisseria gonorrhoeae * Pseudomonas aeruginosa * Mycobacterium tuberculosis Research Some bacteria can produce extended spectrum Œ≤-lactamases (ESBLs) making the infection more difficult to treat and conferring additional resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams. Boronic acid derivatives are currently under vast and extensive research as novel active site inhibitors for beta-lactamases because they contain a site that mimics the transition state that beta-lactams go through when undergoing hydrolysis via beta-lactamases. They have been found generally to fit well into the active site of many beta-lactamases and have the convenient property of being unable to be hydrolysed, and therefore rendered useless. This is a favorable drug design over many clinically used competing agents, because most of them, such as clavulanic acid, become hydrolysed, and are therefore only useful for a finite period of time. This generally causes the need for a higher concentration of competitive inhibitor than would be necessary in an unhydrolyzable inhibitor. Different boronic acid derivatives have the potential to be tailored to the many different isoforms of beta-lactamases, and therefore have the potential to reestablish potency of beta-lactam antibiotics.

Background Japanese forces had invaded north-west Malaya from southern Thailand on December 11, 1941 and eastern Malaya on December 7 at Kota Bharu. From Thailand they had driven relentlessly down the western coast of Malaya defeating all British attempts at stopping them. By Christmas Day the Japanese held all of north-west Malaya. One of the few moments where British troops managed to inflict any form of effective defense against Japanese tactics occurred near Kampar on the Dipang River. At the Battle of Kampar, in a four-day battle notable for the effectiveness of the British artillery, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. By January 2, though, the Indian 11th Infantry Division was out flanked by seaborne landings south of the Kampar position, out numbered and with Japanese forces attempting to cut the division off from the road to Singapore, they withdrew to prepared positions at Trolak five miles north of the Slim River. =British positions at Trolak= The defenses on the road to Trolak started with a four-mile corridor at the 60 mile post extending through almost impenetrable jungle to the 64 mile post, after the village the road cuts through the more open terrain of the Cluny Rubber estate for five miles before reaching the Slim River rail bridge. The road then bends east and follows the river upstream for another six miles before it crosses the Slim River at a road bridge. The British commander, Acting Major-General Paris (normally commander of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade), had lost one of his three brigades after the fighting at Kampar; the amalgamated 5/16 Brigade, after retreating through the 12th Brigade, had been moved to a coastal defense position further south to defend the western flank of the division and to rest and reorganise. This left Paris with Lt.Col.Ian Stewart's 12th Indian Brigade and Lt.Col.Ray Selby's 28th Gurkha Brigade, both at reduced strengths due to heavy casualties in the earlier battles at Kampar and on the Grik Road, to defend the northern bank of the river. Stewart's battalions were in a line straddling either side of the road and spreading back through the thick jungle part of the corridor to north of Trolak where the Cluny Rubber estate started and where Stewart placed his Headquarters. The 4/19th Hyderabad Regiment held the forward position with anti-tank obstacles and road blocks. The next and last prepared positions were held by the 5/2nd Punjab Regiment. The 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were grouped in a defensive position but without fixed anti-tank obstacles or road blocks. Selby's Gurkhas were spread along the road and railway leading up to both bridges, which had been prepared for demolition. =The Japanese attacking force= The Japanese attacking force came from Colonel Ando's battle group (mainly from the 42nd Infantry Regiment) which had taken over from the chastened Okabe Regiment (41st Infantry Regiment) which had suffered heavy casualties in the artillery ambush at Kampar, both units were from the 5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army). The assault force consisted of about 17 Type 97 medium tanks and 3 Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tanks, under the command of Major Toyosaku Shimada (:ja:Â≥∂Áî∞Ë±ä‰Ωú). Shimada came up with the plan, unusual in World War II, of a night attack using tanks to spearhead the infantry, a dangerous proposition for tanks considering the extremely low visibility factor which would hamper their crews. Battle On the afternoon of 5 January 1942 the rearguard from the 5th/16th Brigade withdrew through the 12th Brigade positions. Soon afterwards the advance guard from Colonel Ando's 42nd Regiment reached the Hyderabad positions and launched a probing attack which was beaten off with the loss of 60 Japanese dead. Ando decided to hold and wait for armor support before launching another attack. On 6 January Major Shimada's tank company arrived and Shimada begged Ando to allow him to attack straight down the road, instead of following the usual Japanese tactics of flanking the British positions. =12th Brigade positions= Maps of the Malayan campaign. At 3.30 am on 7 January 1942, in heavy rain, Shimada's force started a mortar and artillery bombardment on the first of the British positions (occupied by the 4/19th Hyderabad Regiment under Major Alan Davidson Brown, the Hyderabads commanding officer, Lt.Col Eric Wilson-Haffenden, had been wounded in an air attack earlier). The tanks began manoeuvering through the British defensive obstacles under fire from the Hyderabads, who were able to call in some artillery fire which destroyed one tank. The Hyderabads lost contact with their artillery support and without any anti-tank weapons to defend against the Japanese tanks, Ando's infantry from his 3rd Battalion, 42nd Regiment, were able to force a breach in the Hyderabads roadblock. Within fifteen minutes Japanese engineers were dismantling the road block and Ando's infantry were pushing back the Hyderabads who were now reduced to scattered groups. The infantry were immediately followed by Shimada's tanks, which easily broke through the remaining Hyderabads, scattering them into the jungle and by 4 am were headed toward the next British unit. A few Hyderabads fell back to the next battalion (Lt.Col. (Charles) Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles in front of the more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in at this point in the battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment. By 6.30 am, Shimada's tanks were approaching the next battalion, the 2nd Bn, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders under Lt. Col. Lindsay Robertson. The 2nd Argylls were positioned around the village of Trolak itself and protected Stewart's 12th Brigade H.Q. This was a regular British Army battalion and very experienced, considered to be one of the best jungle fighting units the British had in Malaya. The Argylls were in a defensive position but without fixed anti-tank obstacles or mines. They had only a little warning of the rapidly approaching Japanese by the arrival of a few panic-stricken sepoys from the Hyderabads to erect a roadblock. Even with that warning though, the first four of Shimada's tanks were mistaken for Punjab Bren Carriers and drove straight through the Argylls, neatly dividing the battalion. These four tanks then headed for the railway bridge. The arrival of the remainder of Shimada's main force and Ando's infantry soon after, split the Argylls completely and cut them off from the road. The Argylls were reduced to many small groups but they fought ferociously and managed to delay the Japanese infantry longer than either of the other two battalions, holding them up until about 7.30 am. The force east of the road (C and B Companies) under Col. Robertson fought their way into the rubber estate and tried to flank the Japanese advance by heading south through the jungle inland and breaking up into small parties. Six weeks later some of these soldiers would still be in the jungle. A Company (commanded by Lt. Donald Napier, a descendant of British General Charles Napier), west of the road, managed to break out of the encircling Japanese and cross the river before the rail bridge was blown. D Company, further north than Napier's company, suffered the same fate as Robertson's party of Argylls, having to scatter into the jungle and attempt to reach British lines. Most of D Company would be captured before they could reach the river. Only 94 Argylls answered roll call on 8 January, nearly all from Napier's A Company. =Atrocities= Japanese troops crossing a jungle stream.An instance of a Japanese atrocity was committed in the area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into those who said they could walk and those who said they could not. Primrose decided he could walk, which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead and then told to carry the Japanese wounded. =The 28th Brigade positions= Before reaching the 28th Gurkha Brigade Shimada's tanks were offered a perfect target in the form of Lt. Col. Cyril Livesy Lawrence Stokes' 5/14th Punjabis, who were in marching order (long columns of units following each other) on either side of the road to Trolak. Stokes' Punjabis were heading up to reinforce Stewart's brigade. Commanding Shimada's three leading tanks was Lt. Sadanobu Watanabe, who led his tanks straight through Stokes' Punjabis, machine guns firing at the perfect target offered by the lined up soldiers. Lt. Col. Stokes was injured on 7 January 1942 when he and Major Lewis were attacked by tanks when advancing to the front line. Lt. Col. Stokes died in captivity on 15 February 1942. His battalion suffered heavy casualties before Watanabe's tanks carried on toward the road bridge (5/14th Punjabis mustered 146 officers and soldiers by 8 January). By 8:00 a.m. the leading Japanese tanks were within Selby's brigade H.Q. area. The 28th Brigade were completely unaware of what had happened to Stewart's entire brigade and the Japanese tore through them faster, scattering both the 2/2nd and 2/9th Gurkhas, which were spread around Selby's brigade H.Q. Although they suffered heavy casualties many of the soldiers from these two battalions made it across the rail bridge before the main Japanese force got to their position. Like the Punjabis, the last battalion of Selby's brigade, the 2/1st Gurkhas under Lt. Col. Jack Oswald Fulton, were on the march either side of the road as the Japanese tanks reached them. This time though, the marching column of Gurkhas were facing away from the approaching Japanese, and Watanabe's tanks caught them from behind: the death toll was even higher than that of the Punjabis. One officer and twenty-seven other ranks answered roll call the next day. Fulton, wounded in the stomach and taken prisoner, would die in captivity two months later. =The bridges= Shimada's tanks had by now broken through both brigades and were into the rear area of the 11th Indian Division, heading for the two bridges. Leaving the rail bridge for Shimada and the main Japanese force, Lt Watanabe headed toward the more important road bridge six miles away. In this attack Watanabe broke through the artillery, medical, and other support units in front of the road bridge. Two British artillery colonels were surprised and killed while driving on the road in this lightning attack. Upon reaching the road bridge at 8.30 a.m. Watanabe found it defended by a battery of Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns from the Singapore and Hong Kong Artillery Regiment. Although two of the guns managed to lower their barrels quickly enough to fire on the tanks, the rounds did not damage the tanks' armor and the gunners fled. Watanabe himself cut the wires to the demolition charges on the bridge with his sword. It was still only early morning and the Japanese attack had managed to scatter the entire 11th Indian Division, leaving most of its survivors attempting to escape across the Slim River. In the last part of this 25 kilometre (16 mile) Blitzkrieg-like attack Watanabe, now in control of the road bridge, sent a force of three tanks under the command of Ensign Toichero Sato to explore the other side of the river. Sato travelled 4 km (3 miles) before encountering more British artillery, in the form of two 4.5 inch Howitzers from the 155th Field Artillery Regiment, RA. Sato's tank opened fire on the first gun, turning it over and blocking the road. The gunners from the second gun managed to lower their barrels in time to fire on the tanks at point blank range. Sato's tank was hit and destroyed, killing him, and forcing the other two tanks in his force to retreat back to the road bridge. Aftermath It seems that even some of the British, who had suffered so badly in this battle, were impressed by the attack. Lt. Col. Arthur Harrison, a British artillery commander who had narrowly escaped being killed by Watanabe's tank, remarked with obvious admiration; Lt. Col. Stewart, when writing to the official historian after the war, said of the battle; The 11th Indian Infantry Division had suffered huge casualties, although some would eventually make their way back to join in the fight for Singapore, many more would still be in the jungle after the surrender. Large numbers of these survivors would be captured but a few, like Lt. Colonel Lindsay Robertson (who had strong views about surrendering) and his party of Argylls attempted to evade capture, but were unable to keep ahead of the rapid advance of the Japanese. Robertson was killed on 20 January 1942. The remaining survivors from the two brigades were scattered all over the Malayan Peninsula. Some of the Argylls were still at large by August 1945. A Gurkha NCO, Naik Nakam Gurung, was found during the Malayan Emergency in October 1949, he had been living in the jungle since 1942. The 12th Indian Brigade had practically ceased to exist and the 28th Brigade was but a shadow. Stewart's 12th Brigade could muster no more than 430 officers and men, with 94 officers and men from the Argylls. Selby's brigade was slightly better off with 750 answering roll call the next day. In all the 11th Division lost an estimated 3,200 troops and a large amount of irreplaceable equipment. The Japanese had managed to attack through a division along nineteen miles and take two bridges at minimal cost to themselves all before lunch time. General Wavell, after meeting survivors of the battle, was appalled by the condition they were in and ordered the 11th Indian Division out of the front line. This defeat for the British allowed the Japanese to take Kuala Lumpur unopposed,Jeffreys and Anderson p.39 Wavell ordered Percival to retreat into southern Malaya, giving up central Malaya, and then to allow the Australian 8th Division an opportunity to prove itself against the Japanese Army. The devastation caused by this short battle also resulted in Lieutenant-General Percival changing his tactics of defensive prepared positions and ordering a rapid retreat to the south where an ambush would be prepared at Gemensah Bridge by the Australians.

According to the Vita Sancti Desiderii, Pepin of Heristal of the Franks, led two expeditions against Willehari in 709 and 712. It is unknown why Pepin intervened in Alemannia at this time, but it is likely that he was trying to affirm Frankish suzerainty by upholding the rights of succession of Lantfrid and Theudebald, the sons of the late duke Gotfrid, whom Willehari may have been elected to replace. It is possible that Alemannia was not united at this time and that several different regions were ruled separately by different families.

Known as Bedford Road, the state highway runs from the city limits of Cumberland north to U.S. Route 220 (US 220) in Dickens. MD 807 is the original alignment of US 220 north of Cumberland. The state highway was assigned to the portion of highway between the city line and Naves Cross Road, presently MD 144, after US 220 was moved to Interstate 68 through downtown Cumberland in 1982. MD 807 was extended to its present northern terminus when the US 220 Bedford Road bypass opened in 2000. Route description View north along MD 807 at MD 144 on the north edge of Cumberland MD 807 begins at the Cumberland city limits. Bedford Street and Frederick Street continue southwest toward downtown Cumberland as the southbound and northbound directions of a one-way pair. Shortly after state maintenance begins, MD 807 intersects MD 144 (Naves Cross Road), which heads east toward I-68 and US 40. MD 807 continues north as a two-lane undivided road past residences between two mountain ridges. The state highway intersects an old alignment of Bedford Road (unsigned MD 807B) before meeting its northern terminus at US 220 in the community of Dickens. Smouses Mill Road (unsigned MD 807E) continues on the eastern side of the intersection. History Bedford Street was paved in the city of Cumberland from downtown to Naves Cross Road by 1910. Bedford Road was paved between Naves Cross Road and roughly the present intersection of US 220 and Bedford Road by 1915, with the final segment to the Pennsylvania state line completed shortly thereafter. Bedford Street and Bedford Road were designated as the southernmost portion of US 220 when the federal highway was designated in 1927. MD 807 was assigned to the stretch of Bedford Road between the Cumberland city line and Naves Cross Road shortly after US 220 was rerouted onto I-68 through downtown Cumberland in 1982. US 220 followed Naves Cross Road between the freeway and Bedford Road, then turned north on Bedford Road. Following the relocation of US 220 north of Cumberland in 2000, MD 807 was extended to its present northern terminus. Junction list Auxiliary routes Five auxiliary routes of MD 807 were designated following the completion of the Bedford Road bypass in 2000. *MD 807A is the designation for Naves Cross Road, a link from the main line of Naves Cross Road, MD 144, east to Mason Road on the north side of I-68 at Exit 46. This state highway, which was previously designated US 220A, is part of the old alignment of Naves Cross Road prior to the construction of I-68 through the area in the 1960s. *MD 807B is the designation for Bedford Road, a road serving residences to the west of US 220 in Dickens. This spur is part of the old alignment of US 220. *MD 807C is the designation for an unnamed road serving a church on the west side of US 220 just south of the state line. This spur is also part of the old alignment of US 220. *MD 807D is the designation for Pine Ridge Road, a road relocated when the US 220 bypass was completed. The state highway heads east from US 220 and intersects the original alignment of Pine Ridge Road, now designated Granet Road, before reaching its eastern terminus. Pine Ridge Road continues as a county-maintained road to the Pennsylvania state line. *MD 807E is the designation for Smouses Mill Road, another road relocated when the US 220 bypass was built.

It operated from 1971 to 2004. At the time of its sign-off, KIIS was owned by Salem Media Group and broadcast a top 40 music format as a simulcast of KIIS-FM in Los Angeles. This was the third AM station to hold the KIIS call sign, following the stations at 1150 AM in Los Angeles (1975‚Äì1980 and 1984‚Äì1997, now KEIB) and 1220 AM in Santa Clarita (1999‚Äì2003, now KHTS). Each outlet simulcast KIIS-FM during its stint as KIIS. History The station first signed on September 20, 1971 as KGOE. Originally owned by Conejo Broadcasters Inc., the 500-watt daytimer broadcast a middle of the road music format. In addition, it carried University of Oklahoma football games as a distant affiliate of the Sooner Radio Network. In December 1973, Conejo Broadcasters sold KGOE to General Broadcasting Co. for $85,466; nighttime operation began the following May. In June 1978, the station was sold to Affiliated Broadcasters for $155,000. In 1984, Affiliated sold KGOE to Comedy Broadcasting Company, owned by Ira Barmak, for $750,000. The new owner changed the station's call sign to KMDY and adopted a format consisting of stand-up comedy and comedic albums. In 1992, KMDY adopted the KCTQ call letters, and later KAHS, as an affiliate of the Radio AAHS children's radio network, simulcasting KPLS in Orange. In April 1997, Buena Ventura Communications sold KAHS to Jacor Communications for $400,000. (Jacor in turn would be acquired by Clear Channel Communications two years later.) When Radio AAHS went off the air in 1998, the station briefly switched to adult standards. Several months later, KAHS changed its call sign to KLYF and began simulcasting the all- sports format of KXTA (Xtra Sports 1150) in Los Angeles. Under Clear Channel ownership, the station underwent several format changes. KLYF became general talk station KBET in 1999. The following year, the station changed call letters to KACD and picked up the adult album alternative format abandoned by KACD-FM (103.1 FM). In 2003, KACD adopted the KIIS calls and started simulcasting top 40 station KIIS-FM. For a brief period, KIIS simulcast classic country station KTDD in San Bernardino. The Thousand Oaks station returned to simulcasting KIIS-FM in 2004. KIIS signed off February 17, 2004 after the lease on the land of the transmission towers' location expired and could not be renewed. The towers were then demolished and a housing tract was built on the former tower location. New Inspiration Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of Salem Communications, bought the station on November 2, 2004 with the intent to surrender the license to allow KRLA (870 AM) to increase its power; the KIIS license was canceled on March 4, 2005.

He followed Small Heath from a young age; as a 14-year-old he watched the then Small Heath Alliance outclassed 4‚Äì0 by West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final of the 1885-86 FA Cup. On leaving school he trained to be a silversmith in the Hockley area of Birmingham now known as the Jewellery Quarter, and remained employed in that trade while playing football part-time. In his younger days he played at inside forward. He was skilful on the ball with good movement and shooting ability. In Small Heath's first season in the Second Division, 1892‚Äì93, the front three of Walton, Frank Mobley and Fred Wheldon scored over 50 goals between them in a 22-game season; the following season the same trio scored 62 goals in the 28 games, Walton contributing 16 in 20. Later in his career he moved back to wing half, where his tireless encouragement of the younger players earned him the nickname \\"Mother\\". Walton's support for Birmingham was lifelong. He was a guest of the club for the official opening of the St Andrew's ground on Boxing Day 1906, and helped clear snow from pitch and terraces so that the match could go ahead.

She was portrayed by Lindsay Hartley throughout the program's tenure, with Priscilla Garita temporarily assuming the role from August 30‚ÄìSeptember 28, 2004, while Hartley was on maternity leave. On December 31, 2001, and January 2, 2002, Alyse Gregory portrayed Theresa in flashbacks. Taylor Balen portrayed Theresa in another flashback in 2005. Character history =Early years= Theresa was the third child and first daughter of Martin Fitzgerald and Pilar Lopez- Fitzgerald. While just a toddler, her father abandoned the family to go to Mexico with Katherine Barrett, although the reason for his disappearance wasn't revealed until much later. With her mother working two jobs, the young Theresa was raised primarily by her eldest brother, Antonio. Antonio then disappeared as well when Theresa was a teenager, at which time her older brother Luis then helped Pilar care for Theresa and her younger brother Miguel. During her teenage years, Theresa developed an infatuation with Ethan Crane, the son of her mother's employer, Ivy Crane. Unknown to her at the time, Theresa and Ethan once met each other when they were children, something that wasn't revealed until much later and she was unknowingly in love with him since childhood, she became convinced that they were fated for each other and would someday marry. Her best childhood friend and confidant was Whitney Russell. =First relationship with Ethan= Passions debuted with Theresa's heartthrob Ethan's return to Harmony, along with his girlfriend Gwen Hotchkiss. Theresa immediately began doing whatever she could to get close to Ethan, usually coming up with harebrained schemes that ended in disasters such as burying Ethan in fish at the cannery, spilling food on him, etc. Ethan came to believe that Theresa was criminally stalking him and hired a private investigator to track her down. As part of her plan to get close to Ethan, Theresa worked under disguise as an assistant for Ethan's mother Ivy. It was through this position that Ethan and Theresa came to know each other and Ethan forgave Theresa for the accidents. Eventually Theresa was successful in sparking a relationship with Ethan in the fall of 2000, and they were engaged to be married Christmas Eve of that year. Theresa promised her mother that she would not sleep with Ethan before the day of their wedding, so the couple waited until just after midnight the morning of the wedding to make love, unbeknownst to either conceiving Little Ethan in the process. The wedding was interrupted when Ethan's enraged mother, Ivy, crashed her car into the church before they could take their vows and produced a tabloid claiming that Theresa had sent information on Ethan's true paternity to a tabloid exposing that he was not a Crane, but in fact the son of Sam Bennett even though Gwen and Rebecca had in truth framed Theresa for destroying Ethan's life. Theresa then fled to Bermuda, determined to find Julian and convince him to adopt Ethan and make him the Crane heir anyway. While in Bermuda, Theresa gets drunk and Julian takes advantage of her before going through a marriage ceremony with him, which is later shown to have never been valid. Theresa returned home to Harmony and resumed her relationship with Ethan. He was furious to learn she had apparently drunkenly married Julian, but forgave her on the condition that she stop lying to him. She soon learned she was pregnant but lied to Ethan about it when she signed the annulment papers because she thought it was Julian's child. Unfortunately, Ethan learned of her pregnancy, like her marriage, in yet another tabloid reveal, and broke things off with her because he couldn't trust her. =Rivalry with Gwen= Although Theresa continued to pursue Ethan, she was unsuccessful at winning Ethan back before he wed Gwen in 2003 after she became pregnant with Ethan's baby. After the marriage, Theresa left Harmony for Los Angeles. However, in a twist of fate, Ethan and Gwen had traveled there as well to see a specialist regarding their problematic pregnancy. When they met in L.A., Ethan and Theresa kissed (unknowingly in front of a TV camera), and Gwen ended up seeing them on the evening news from her hospital bed. Enraged, Gwen confronted Theresa at an apartment and started a physical confrontation that caused her to miscarry her unborn daughter Sarah.Seen on-air from September 25, 2003, through September 29, 2003, and continued on October 7, 2003, and October 8, 2003. Back in Harmony, Gwen's mother Rebecca formulated a plan to take Little Ethan away from Theresa while Ethan and Gwen decided to have a baby using a surrogate mother. Little Ethan was eventually adopted by Ethan and Gwen. To get her son back, Theresa drugged and kidnapped Ethan and Gwen's surrogate and had herself implanted with Gwen and Ethan's fertilized embryo, planning to trade the baby for Little Ethan. Later, Theresa believed she had miscarried the baby, and tried unsuccessfully to get Fox Crane to impregnate her. Knowing she had only a limited window of time to replace the fetus, she stole a date rape drug (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) from Eve Russell and slipped it into Ethan's wine, then dressed up like Gwen and sneaked into his bed resulting in Theresa getting pregnant with a second baby. Thereafter, Theresa was pregnant with an unusual set of twins‚Äîone presumably belonged to Ethan and Gwen, and the other to Ethan and Theresa. Theresa was eventually unable to carry both children to term, and the boy, who was to be named Nathan, was medically aborted. After the baby girl, originally named Ashley, was born fourteen weeks early,Eve claimed that Jane was delivered at twenty-six weeks - transcript Theresa shocked Gwen (who believed she was the child's biological mother) with the news that the child might be hers, and that she had no intent on giving her up no matter who the biological mother was. DNA tests were performed on the newborn to establish both paternity and maternity, and Ethan and Theresa were confirmed to be the girl's biological parents, and Theresa renamed her Jane. Ethan's plans to sue Theresa for custody of Jane were interrupted after Gwen kidnapped Jane and stabbed Theresa in the back with a scalpel. Ethan then offered to let Theresa have the baby if she would agree to drop the charges against Gwen. Theresa refused to drop the charges, and Gwen was acquitted in court after Eve testified to the court that her break from reality had been brought on by drug interactions and that Gwen could not be held responsible for her actions. The judge then awarded custody to Gwen and Ethan, due to her concern over how Jane was conceived. =Marriage to Alistair= Theresa wed Alistair Crane on October 3, 2005 after he promised to help her get back her daughter Jane, and because she wanted access to the Crane mansion itself, where she believed she could uncover information that would clear her name in regards to her wedding day tabloid scandal. Unbeknownst to Theresa, Harmony's arch villain had plans to use her, as well; she signed a pre-nuptial agreement in which she consented to sexual relations with him (her later attempts to renege led to her being repeatedly raped by Alistair with Gwen's help in the fall of 2005) and she also signed her consent to Alistair's adoption of her son, Little Ethan, who would become the new Crane heir, to be molded in Alistair's image. Unable to leave her son despite Ethan's offers to help her escape, Theresa made the best out of her situation, frantically fantasizing about the man she loved while the elderly Alistair used her body (and while, on one notable occasion, her rival Gwen prevented Ethan from stopping Alistair from raping Theresa). She eventually began repeated attempts to murder Alistair, one of which attempts went horribly awry when Ethan consumed the poisoned guacamole intended for Alistair and went into a coma. Both during her husband's coma (which he faked as part of a trick to lure Harmony residents to Rome) and after his apparent July 2006 demise in Italy (where his train was struck by a missile), Theresa assumed control of Crane Industries on behalf of her son. She's used Alistair's money and power to mixed ends -- bribing and blackmailing employers to prevent Ethan from getting a job and to trap Gwen in one, but also shoring up Crane fiscally, attempting to make the company both stronger and fairer as her son's inheritance. There remains some question as to the extent to which Theresa would have power at Crane were it publicly known that her child is not Julian Crane's son, but Ethan Winthrop's, a question complicated by Alistair Crane having legally adopted the boy. =Relationship with Jared= Jared Casey was the new guy in town in July/August 2006 when he set his eyes on Theresa. Jared first met Theresa when she spilled her drink on Jared at the Blue Note night club. Jared became irate and began to argue with Theresa. Later he apologized and asked Theresa to dance; she agreed in order to annoy Gwen by making Ethan jealous. The two had a tense early relationship, with Jared repeatedly making claims and remarks that Theresa perceived as being chauvinistic, materialistic, or otherwise intolerant, a fact which was complicated by Jared's failure to recognize Theresa as the CEO of Crane Industries; but, once the case of mistaken identity was overcome, he gradually proved to her that she had been oversensitive. She gave him a chance to help her move on from Ethan, as well as what had been earmarked as Ethan's job as head legal counsel at Crane Industries, and he gave her romance, attention, and the pet name \\"Tess\\", which she initially didn't care for. The arc of their relationship from the time they met in the late summer 2006, until Jared proposed to Theresa at Kay and Fox's wedding around New Year's 2007, was characterized by Theresa's conviction that Jared would be the man who finally allowed her to get over Ethan Winthrop. However, Ethan's jealousy of Jared and conviction that the man was a liar and a criminal who was hiding a significant secret led to Ethan's frequent interference in Theresa's relationship with her new beau; Jared, in that time, broke off his relationship with \\"Tess\\" multiple times, believing she was still pining for her old flame. =Blackmailer= In January 2007, Harmony's \\"Nightstalker\\" (who is presumed to be the same entity alternately referred to as \\"the peeping tom,\\" \\"the rapist,\\" \\"the blackmailer,\\" and \\"the half-man/half-woman\\") put Ethan in a potion-induced trance, whereupon Ethan drove across town, crawled into bed with Theresa and began making love to her in the darkness. The pair were caught by Jared and Gwen; Gwen decided to leave Ethan and filed for divorce, while Jared, believing Theresa's claim that, in the darkness, she'd believed she was making love to him and not Ethan, insisted that Theresa file sexual assault charges. When Theresa refused, Jared left her, accurately perceiving that she still had feelings for her ex. Shortly thereafter, Ethan and Jane moved into the Crane mansion with Theresa, and Theresa and Ethan discussed starting anew with one another now that they were both free. With Gwen out of the picture, Theresa prepared to tell Ethan the truth‚Äîthat her son was also his, and not Julian Crane's. The idyll, however, was short-lived; Theresa realized she needed her son's Crane status to hold onto the money and resources necessary to save her brothers' lives, as the blackmailer, who had framed Theresa's brothers for crimes they were innocent of, used his knowledge of Theresa's secret and the power he had over her brothers' futures to coerce her into leaving Ethan -- whom the blackmailer wants for himself -- and marrying Jared. Theresa stalled, making desperate efforts to recover the evidence of her secret, hiring manipulative tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson, and even telling Jared that she was being blackmailed and enlisting his help. Jared made contact with mysterious \\"old friends,\\" entering what he cryptically described as a \\"deal with the devil\\" to try to help her, but ended up getting shot in the abdomen, probably by the blackmailer, for his efforts. Eventually, Theresa was out of options, and in April 2007 was coerced into marrying Jared and attempting to conceive his child, much to Ethan's dismay. Jared remained ignorant about his bride's lack of enthusiasm about their marriage and family, and also did not know that Ethan and Theresa had continued their affair, with Ethan repeatedly insisting that Theresa divorce Jared as soon as he managed to exonerate her brothers and reveal the blackmailer's identity. Because Ethan and Theresa repeatedly ignored the blackmailer's demand that they stay away from one another, they were violently attacked multiple times, including Ethan being tied naked to a chair and molested, Theresa being threatened at knifepoint, Ethan nearly being pressed to death between two walls, and Ethan and Theresa being trapped inside the burning Crane Mausoleum. Theresa found herself in an unenviable position, wanting both to help her brothers and to protect her secret, in part because she doesn't trust Ethan to forgive her for keeping the secret when he finds out. Despite Theresa's secret and the fact that both she and Ethan remain married to other people, Theresa accepted Ethan's proposal of marriage on June 27, 2007; upon finding out about her continued relationship with Ethan, Jared gracefully bowed out of the picture and wished Theresa every happiness, while Ethan's wife, Gwen, has also signed her divorce papers. Increasingly, Theresa's refusal to tell Ethan her secret seems more motivated by fear of his reaction than fear of the Blackmailer or fear for her brothers. Her situation is complicated by the fact that as many people in Harmony know her secret as don't; while Ethan remains in the dark, people who know that he is Little Ethan's father include Whitney, Pilar, Chad, Julian, Eve, Father Lonigan, Luis, Jared, Vincent, and, perhaps most pressingly for Theresa (who is being encouraged on all fronts to tell Ethan the truth), Gwen and Rebecca, who have committed to using Theresa's secret to destroy her relationship with Ethan. Theresa was almost killed in the electric chair at Harmony's prison by Sheridan working on the Blackmailer's orders, but was inadvertently saved from death by Gwen. =NBC finale= On August 17, 2007, it was revealed that Alistair was in fact alive; it was soon established that Alistair had not only been responsible for twisting grandson Vincent's already fragile psyche, but had also been behind Vincent's actions as the Blackmailer.Passions transcript , August 20, 2007. Vincent told Alistair of the secret that he had learned -- that Little Ethan had been fathered by Ethan, not Julian -- and Alistair was enraged that Theresa had duped him. Theresa finally married Ethan on August 20, 2007. Gwen tried to stop the wedding and honeymoon by telling Ethan the truth, but was stopped by Alistair, who wanted to keep Little Ethan's real paternity a secret to protect his corporate interests. Alistair's attempt to poison Theresa (with Rebecca and Gwen's help) put Ethan in a coma instead. With Alistair now known to be alive, Rebecca Hotchkiss noted in the August 23, 2007 episode that \\"if Alistair's not dead, then Theresa's marriage to Ethan is not legal. She is a bigamist.\\" Seen on-air and discussed in episodes that aired between August 23, 2007, and August 29, 2007. Alistair reminded Theresa that he was her legal husband and, fearful of being made a laughingstock for making a non-Crane his heir, threatened to harm her if she told anyone about Little Ethan's paternity. On August 29, 2007, Theresa finally revealed to an unconscious Ethan that he had a son during his hospitalization for the poisoning. The next day a nurse told Theresa that she believed Ethan could indeed hear everything Theresa said. Theresa tested this by asking Ethan to squeeze her hand, which he did. After Ethan woke up from his coma, he revealed he had heard Theresa's revelation that he has a son (although she had failed to mention his son's name or that she was the mother). The two were overjoyed. Theresa finally asked Pilar to go get Little Ethan. As Pilar and Little Ethan walked into the hospital room, Gwen entered with a surprise. She handed Ethan a baby boy and said, \\"This is your son, our son, yours and mine.\\" The NBC run of Passions ended with Ethan holding the baby, Gwen smirking at her rival, and Theresa looking horrified. =DirecTV storylines= Devastated to learn Gwen allegedly had a son, Jonathan Winthrop, with Ethan, Theresa once again decided to tell the truth of her son's paternity only to be threatened by Gwen and Alistair into backing down. Ever relentless, Theresa planned on telling Ethan until her own mother begged her not to, eventually admitting that Gwen and Rebecca were blackmailing her because of her involvement in the massacre of the Vasquez family in Mexico twenty-five years before. An embittered Juanita Vasquez blamed Pilar, and threatened to exterminate the entire Lopez family, just as Juanita's had been. Theresa could not tell Ethan the truth even when Jonathan in need of a liver donor needed the help of a sibling. When Jane failed to be compatible, Theresa arranged for her son Little Ethan to be used in the procedure. Unfortunately, to protect Little Ethan's paternity, she had to keep telling Ethan lies, alienating and infuriating him. Gwen took advantage of the situation by telling Ethan that Theresa had another lover. Theresa, not wanting to lose Ethan, traveled to Mexico and was captured by Juanita, who had acquired a vast fortune after taking over the drug cartel of her deceased husband Carlos Vasquez. The massacre had left Juanita determined to revenge herself upon the entire Lopez-Fitzgerald family. She threatened Theresa with a loaded gun after hearing her life story, and later used her as bait in order to trick her mother into coming to Mexico as well. After making their escape from Juanita's compound, Theresa and Pilar made it to a wharf where Theresa found a boat the pair planned to use to escape Mexico. Believing they had escaped, Juanita fired a rocket at their boat and it exploded, leaving Pilar injured and Theresa missing. Ethan and Luis, who along with Miguel had followed Theresa and Pilar to Mexico in order to attempt to protect them, both swam to the wreckage where Pilar was recovered and taken back to shore, while Theresa struggled to keep herself alive in the shark infested waters. Ethan and Theresa were briefly reunited only to have Theresa pulled further out to sea as Ethan was pulled under and caught in the wreckage. As everyone awaited news of Theresa's fate, Tabitha and Kay watched as Theresa tried to get the attention of her family only to find it was her ghost struggling to communicate with them. Finally a rescue worker came with news that Theresa's bloody and torn blouse had washed up on shore and her family was grief-stricken by the news. In a rare soliloquy, Ethan credited Theresa with having made him into the man he was, promised to raise her children, and bade her farewell on the wharf. Theresa disguised as Gertrude, from the June 30, 2008 episode On March 4, 2008, it was revealed that Theresa is alive and wasn't eaten alive by sharks. She was saved by DEA agents presumably looking to prosecute Juanita and was placed into protective custody; however, Theresa quickly escaped and met up with a Mexican woman with a plan to enter the United States illegally via a freight train, eventually returning to Harmony. She then infiltrated the Crane mansion disguised as a frumpy nanny named Gertrude. Little Ethan and Pilar realized that Gertrude was really Theresa, but were persuaded to keep quiet for the sake of the family's staying below Juanita's radar. While in disguise, Theresa drugged Ethan and made love with him, narrowly escaping being caught by Gwen. In the last days leading up to the finale, Ethan planned to renew his wedding vows to Gwen as a means of providing a mother for Jane, Little Ethan, and Jonathan; meanwhile, \\"Gertrude\\" plotted ineffectually to disrupt the ceremony and Pilar made arrangements to remove her entire family from Harmony to evade Juanita as soon as the weddings were over. On the day of the triple wedding ceremonies, while a volcanic eruption threatened the city in the aftermath of the first two weddings, Theresa found Juanita, dressed as a nun, planting a bomb in the church basement. Juanita overpowered Theresa and chained her to a pillar as Gwen and Ethan renewed their marriage in the third ceremony in the main sanctuary one floor over Theresa's head. Just after making his vows, however, Ethan sensed Theresa was in danger and rushed to the basement to find her. Theresa and Ethan were finally reunited in the August 4, 2008 episode of Passions. Theresa was still chained to the building as Luis apprehended Juanita and the timer on the bomb ticked inexorably toward zero. Ethan and Theresa's family refused to abandon her, nor would their spouses abandon any of them, and so nearly all of Harmony was crowded into that basement. Ethan, in possession of heretofore undisclosed wiring expertise, stopped the bomb a scant few seconds before it would have gone off. But Ethan and Theresa's problems continued as Ethan was reminded by Gwen of his vows. Ethan withdrew reluctantly from Theresa as Sheridan and others pleaded with Gwen to be merciful and release Ethan from his marital obligation. Upstairs, Little Ethan worked steadily to fix Sam Bennett's broken camera, which had recorded Gwen and Rebecca making a full confession to the extent of their collusion against Theresa and lies to Ethan over the previous decade. Rebecca attempted to stop him, but he evaded her and rushed down to the basement. The video camera was attached to a television and played for all the wedding guests Gwen and Rebecca's confession of their roles in framing Theresa for the tabloid scandal seven years before. An indignant Ethan rejected Gwen and announced that not only was he leaving her, but that he and Theresa would be raising her son, Jonathan. Sam and Luis then arrested Gwen and Rebecca on charges including fraud, bribery, and accessory status in the murder of Pilar's sister and nephews in Mexico as well as everyone in the basement of the church. With Juanita caught and Gwen's threats neutralized, Theresa also seized the opportunity to tell Ethan the truth about Little Ethan; Ethan reacted with joy, and the family was united at last. Gwen and Rebecca began arguing over a trip to Las Vegas some years before which Gwen didn't remember, and it was revealed that Gwen had drunkenly married an unknown stranger, to whom she was still legally bound. Because this happened before Gwen's marriage to Ethan in 2002, that marriage was nullified. Theresa and Ethan were finally married in a church ceremony as they both had dreamed of, in front of family and friends at St. Margaret Mary's church on August 7, 2008, in the final scene of Passions.

He was the son of John Ramsay of Corstoun in Fife (kin to the Ramsays of Carnock otherwise Pitcruvie) and Janet Napier presumed to be of the Merchiston Napiers. Janet Napier later married John Wilson a Burgess of Edinburgh (Parliamentary records of 1484). John Ramsay was married to Isabel Cant in 1484. He then married Janet Kennedy, daughter of John Kennedy, 2nd Lord Kennedy, and Lady Elizabeth Seton, c. 6 November 1505. Janet Kennedy was a favourite mistress of King James IV of Scotland and this may have been a marriage of political convenience. He and Janet Kennedy were divorced. He then married Isobel Livingston, before February 1507/8. He was attached to the court of King James III of Scotland and was resented by the traditional aristocrats. The principal charge against the King was his reliance on \\"low-born favourites\\", and Ramsay was clearly regarded as one of these. In parliament on 24 February 1484, the king bestowed the barony of Bothwell on him. In July 1482 he escaped execution by the King's opponents at Lauder Bridge by leaping on the King's horse, the only one of the King's favourites to survive. According to another version, he clung to the King and pleaded for his life: the King persuaded the lords to spare him on account of his extreme youth ( he may still have been only 18 ).MacDougall, Norman, James III, (revised edition), John Donald, Edinburgh (2009) He sat in Parliament in 1485 and 1487 as Lord Bothwell. He upset the aristocrats by obtaining a royal mandate that he alone could carry arms within the precincts of the royal residence, probably acting as a royal bodyguard in his role as Master of the Household. He was an Esquire of the King's Chamber, an auditor of the Exchequer in 1484, and a Commissioner for letting the Crown lands. He was Ambassador to England in 1485 and 1486. His reputation declined further after the death of Queen Margaret, whom he was accused of poisoning, although there is no evidence at all to support the charge. On 8 October 1488, after the death of James III at the battle of Sauchieburn, John Ramsay lost his title. He remained in England, acting as a spy for Henry VII of England, and took payment to deliver the Scottish King James IV to Henry. Under James IV he was allowed to return to Scotland in 1496, and on 8 September 1496 wrote from Berwick upon Tweed advising Henry VII how he might defeat the planned invasion of Northumbria by James IV and Perkin Warbeck.Pinkerton, John, History of Scotland, vol.2 (1791), 438-441 He was rehabilitated on 8 April 1497 under the Great Seal, although not restored to his peerage or all of his former titles. He had liferent grants of the lands of Tealing and Polgavie in Fife, Trarinzeane near Cumnock in Ayrshire and half the lands of Kirkandrews in Wigtownshire. He took the title of Sir John Ramsay of Trarinzeane. On 13 May 1498 he had a charter of a tenement in the Cowgate, Edinburgh and another of lands in Forrester's Wynd on 6 November 1500. In 1503 he was Captain of Linlithgow, probably of the palace there. He negotiated the marriage of James IV to the daughter of Henry VII, thereby laying the cornerstone of the United Kingdom. On 13 May 1510, he had a grant from the King pro bono servitio et ex special favore of the lands and barony of Balmain in Kincardineshire, erected into a free barony for him and his successors. He died on 9 September 1513 at Flodden Field, killed in action. His son William born around 1510 was entrusted to the Bishop of Dunblane, James Chisholm, uterine brother of Sir John Ramsay. William was the ancestor of the Ramsays of Balmain.

He was a son of Huoching and perhaps a grandson of the duke Gotfrid, which would make him a scion of the Agilolfing dynasty of Bavaria. He was the founder of the \\"old\\" line of the Ahalolfings. Around 724 he was one of the joint founders of the monastery of Reichenau. By his wife Hereswind, Hnabi left at least two children, Ruadbert (Rodbert, Robert), who was count in the Hegau, and Imma or Emma (died c. 785), who married Gerold of Vintzgau and was the mother of Eric of Friuli and Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne. Rodbert son of Hnabi is mentioned in a St. Gall document dated 770. Imma is mentioned in documents of Lorsch, Fulda and St. Gall between 779 and 804. The genealogy of Hildegard is recorded in the ninth-century Vita Hiudowici by Thegan of Trier: \\"the duke Gotfrid begat Huoching, Huoching begat Hnabi, Hnabi begat Emma, Emma herself the most blessed queen Hildegard\\" (Gotfridus dux genuit Huochingum, Huochingus genuit Nebi, Nebi genuit Immam, Imma vero Hiltigardem beatissimam reginam).

PDMS stamps are pieces of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone, that have been patterned usually against a master to form a relief pattern used in soft lithography. This PDMS stamp can be used in either its current form as a relief surface for techniques such as microcontact printing or can also be attached to an external source by tubing so that liquid may be passed through channels on its surface. In this second case it will often be laminated to a surface so that chemistry can be performed on that surface producing a pattern of the PDMS stamp on to the surface. Alternatively a PDMS stamp can be laminated to a second piece of PDMS to form a contained device. It is possible to pattern PDMS with nanometre resolution. PDMS stamps can be procured from some commercial sources such as Research Micro Stamps. Many techniques have been developed to modify the basic setups to perform a range of tasks such as assays on small volumes. These kinds of devices are often referred to as microfluidic devices. Because of the small dimensions of these devices flow is laminar not turbulent which can lead to many useful properties; however, this reduces the ability of fluid streams to mix. A new concept of PDMS stamp for multiplexing: the macrostamp The main drawback of microcontact printing for biomedical application is that it is not possible to print different molecules with one stamp. To print different (bio)molecules in one step, a new concept is proposed : the macrostamp.Helene LALO, Jean-Christophe Cau, Christophe Thibault, Nathalie Marsaud, Childerick Severac, Christophe Vieu, \\"Microscale multiple biomolecules printing in one step using a PDMS macrostamp\\", Microelectronic Engineering, Volume 86, Issues 4‚Äì6, April‚ÄìJune 2009, Pages 1428‚Äì1430 It is a stamp composed of dots.

File:Macrotimbre 2.pngexamples of macrostamp and magnetic macrostamp A new PDMS stamp : the Magnetic Stamp To apply a homogeneous pressure during the printing step, a magnetic force is used. For that, the stamp is sensitive to a magnetic field by injecting iron powder into a second layer of PDMS.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) have also recognised Mekkhala as the 20th tropical depression, and the 18th tropical storm of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. On September 25 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center identified a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Tonkin. On September 27 the Japan Metrological Agency, reported that the disturbance had become a tropical depression whilst the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. During the next day the JTWC designated the depression as 20W. The JMA reported that the depression had intensified into Tropical Storm Mekkhala on September 29. Later that day the JTWC also upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm status. Early the next day the JMA reported that Mekkhala had intensified into a severe tropical storm. Later that day the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical storm and then both the JTWC and the JMA reported that Mekkhala had weakened into a tropical depression as they released their final advisories. Within their best track the JMA reported that Mekkhala had never reached severe tropical storm status. Meteorological history A Tropical Disturbance formed to the south of China, within the Gulf of Tonkin on September 25, 2008. Early the next day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the disturbances chances of becoming a \\"significant tropical cyclone\\" within 24 hours as \\"Fair\\". However early on September 27 the JTWC reassessed the disturbances chances becoming a \\"significant tropical cyclone\\" as poor. Later that day the Japan Meteorological Agency then designated it as a weak tropical depression. Whilst early the next morning the JTWC upgraded the disturbances chances of becoming a \\"significant tropical cyclone\\" to good, and subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that day the JMA started to issue full advisories on the tropical depression, as it was expected to become a tropical storm within the next 24 hours. The JTWC then designated the depression as Tropical Depression 20W as they issued their first warning on the depression. On September 29 the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named the storm as Mekkhala. Later that morning the JTWC designated Mekkhala as a tropical storm. Early the next day the JMA reported that Mekkhala had intensified into a severe tropical storm and reached its peak wind speeds of 50kts. However within their next advisory the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical storm as Mekkhala had made landfall on northern Vietnam during the previous three hours. During the morning of September 30, RSMC Tokyo downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression as they issued their final advisory. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also issued their final advisory that morning as Mekkhalla was expected to weaken below their warning level of 25 kts (30 mph, 50 km/h) and then dissipate later that day. Mekkhala then dissipated over Land later that day. On November 17, 2008 the Japan Meteorological Agency released their Post Storm Analysis on Mekkhala. Within it they reassessed the peak wind speeds as 45 knots (50 mph, 80 km/h) which meant that Mekkhala was downgraded from a severe tropical storm to a tropical storm. Preparations and impact Vietnam was affected by Tropical Storm Mekkhala less than a week after Typhoon Hagupit had affected the country. Despite this Mekkhala still caused $6.6 million (2008 US$) worth of damage. A total of 1,000 homes were washed away by the storm and an additional 10,000 were damaged. The storm was also responsible for Blackouts in Vietnam, as well as causing 16 deaths and 13 injuries. Vietnam's National Steering Committee for Storm and Flood Control also reported that Mekkhala had forced the evacuation of thousands of people and had sunk 38 fishing trawlers. An estimated 3,050 hectares of crops were damaged in Thanh H√≥a Province, leading to $1.2 million in losses. In H√† Tƒ©nh Province 500 homes and 4,000 hectares of crops were damaged and three people were killed. Damages in the province amounted to $1.8 million. Naming The name Mekkhala was one of the ten original names submitted to the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000 by Thailand. It has been used once before worldwide within the 2002 Pacific typhoon season to name a tropical storm and refers to the Thai Angel of Thunder.

It is an adaptation of the Broadway stage musical of the same name produced in 1944 (which itself is an adaptation of the Jerome Robbins ballet entitled Fancy Free which was also produced in 1944), although many changes in script and score were made from the original stage version; for instance, most of Bernstein's score was dropped in favor of new songs by Edens, who disliked the majority of Bernstein's music for being too complex and too operatic for film audiences. This caused Bernstein to boycott the film. The film was directed by Gene Kelly, who also choreographed, and Stanley Donen in their directorial debut, and stars Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, and Ann Miller, and features Jules Munshin and Vera-Ellen. It was a product of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM, and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in New York City, including at Columbus Circle, the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Bridge, and Rockefeller Center. The film was an immediate success and won the Oscar for Best Music‚ÄîScoring of a Musical Picture, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 2006, the film ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of Best Musicals. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the- shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry Plot Three sailors - Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie - begin their shore leave, excited for their 24 hours in New York (\\"New York, New York\\"). Riding the subway, Gabey falls in love with the picture of \\"Miss Turnstiles\\", who is actually called Ivy Smith, and fantasizes about what she's like in real life (\\"Miss Turnstiles\\"). The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have. They are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver. Claire claims that she's found her passionate \\"Prehistoric Man\\" in Ozzie at the Museum of Anthropological History. Hildy invites Chip to \\"Come Up to My Place\\". Finally finding Ivy, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \\"Main Street\\" in a studio in Symphonic Hall - not realizing that she is also from the same town. Later, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy telling her \\"You're Awful\\" ‚Äì that is, awful nice to be with. That evening, all the couples meet at the top of the Empire State Building to celebrate a night \\"On the Town\\". But when an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a cooch dancer, the friends tell a despondent Gabey, \\"You Can Count on Me\\", joined by Hildy's annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler. They have a number of adventures before reuniting with Ivy at Coney Island just as their 24-hour leave ends and they must return to their ship to head off to sea. Although their future is uncertain, the boys and girls share one last kiss on the pier as a new batch of sailors heads out into the city for their leave (\\"New York, New York\\" reprise).

Hal Leonard Corporation Production The film had a budget of $1.5 million, one of Metro's lowest for a Technicolor musical, with a planned filming schedule of just 46 days. The musical numbers staged on location in New York were the first time a major studio had accomplished this. The location shots in New York took nine days. Shooting in New York City was Kelly and Donen's idea, which studio head Louis B. Mayer refused to allow, pointing out the studio's excellent New York sets in its backlot. Kelly and Donen held their ground, and finally Mayer relented and allowed a limited number of days shooting in New York. The primary problem experienced by the production was dealing with crowds of Frank Sinatra's fans, so some shots were made with the camera located in a station wagon to reduce the public visibility of the shooting.Mankiewicz, Ben (February 19, 2017) Intro to Turner Classic Movies showing The Breen Office of the MPAA refused to allow the use of the word \\"helluva\\" in the song \\"New York, New York\\", and so it was changed to \\"wonderful\\".

Data extracted from the  Description and significance  Pyrococcus has similar characteristics of other thermoautotrophican archaea such as Archaeoglobus, and Methanococcus in the respect that they are all thermophilic and anaerobic. Pyrococcus differs, however, because its optimal growth temperature is nearly 100 ¬∞C and dwells at a greater sea depth than the other archaea. Studying Pyrococcus helps give insight to possible mechanisms used to endure extreme environmental conditions like high temperatures and high pressure.  Genome structure  Three of the Pyrococcus species have been sequenced. P. furiosus is the largest containing 1.9Mb followed by P. abyssi with 1.8Mb and P. horikoshii with 1.7Mb. The genomes encode for many different metabolic enzymes which gives themselves a wider spectrum of living conditions because they can transport and metabolize a wide range of organic substances. Variation was detected between species as well.  Cell structure and metabolism  The cells of Pyrococcus are about 0.8‚Äì2 Œºm and are slightly irregular cocci in shape. They show a polar grouping of flagella and are enveloped by an S-layer enclosing a periplasmic space around the cytoplasmic membrane. Pyrococcus species are anaerobic but vary slightly concerning their metabolism. Peptide fermentation is the principle metabolic pathway however, growth has been observed for P. furiosus and P. abyssi on starch, maltose, and pyruvate but not for P. horikoshii. While the presence of elemental sulfur is not needed for growth, growth is enhanced with the addition of So.  Ecology  Pyrococcus species inhabit environments with extremely high temperatures such as undersea hot vents. Optimal growth conditions include a pH level of about 7, a salt concentration around 2.5%, and a temperature around 98 ¬∞C. Growing in temperatures this high, it is easy to see why they are anaerobic since at these boiling temperatures hardly any oxygen will be available. In the example of undersea hot vents, where P. abyssi has been found, there is no sunlight and the pressure is around 200 atm in addition to the extremely high temperature.

It tells the tale of an orphan named Miles Wednesday. Plot Miles Wednesday, an orphan boy who has recently escaped from the cruel Pinchbucket's orphanage, is the only one who witnesses the arrival of the Circus Oscuro in town one night. He is promptly visited by a tiger with the ability to talk; he considers making Miles his next meal, but leaves him alone after he \\"smells the circus in him\\". Miles, who has never even been to a circus before in his life, wonders what he could mean. The next evening, Miles sneaks into the circus to find the tiger and watches some of the show from behind the bleachers. He sees a small girl performing acrobatic stunts fall from the top of the tent and tries to catch her. She sprouts wings, however, and flies to safety. Miles' act of bravery results in him being kicked out by the ringmaster's right-hand man, Ghengis. Miles stays hidden and sees the acrobat, who calls herself \\"Little\\", being tied up and taken back to her wagon when the show ends. Miles introduces himself and tries to steal the keys to rescue her, but is caught by the ringmaster, the Great Cortado. Miles pretends that he is interested in joining the circus and steps outside to prepare a \\"disappearing act\\". Angered at being tricked and losing one of his stars, Cortado unleashes a monstrous beast called The Null to chase after Little and Miles. The two children barely escape. Miles takes Little to a friend of his, a widow called Lady Partridge, who lives with her many cats in a treehouse made of her own antiques. Partridge gives them shelter and Little tells her story‚Äîshe is actually a 400-year-old Song Angel who fell from the sky along with her friend Silverpoint, a Storm Angel. After seeing Silverpoint protect Little from a mean clown by shooting lightning bolts at him, the Great Cortado kidnaps and separates the two; he takes Silverpoint to a mysterious place called the Palace of Laughter and forces him to perform there to protect Little. To prove her ability, Little sings Miles' stuffed bear, Tangerine, to life. Miles and Little decide to find the Palace of Laughter and rescue Silverpoint. The two meet many difficulties along the way. Tangerine wanders away from Miles and is taken by Ghengis, leaving Miles heartbroken. Luckily, the tiger appears again, and carries Miles and Little for a good portion of the journey. The tiger, after much pestering from Miles, reveals that the Circus Oscuro did have a tiger once: the tiger, Varippuli, was originally part of the circus of a great man called Barty Fumble, and showed him more loyalty than could ever be fathomed. The circus was always a success, until the year the Circus Oscuro appeared and began stealing the crowds. Barty was expecting his first child and knew he could not afford failure. He made a deal with the Great Cortado to combine the two circuses for the summer and then part ways. All was well until Barty's wife died in labour, leaving him heartbroken. He disappeared with his son, leaving Varippuli to the wrath of the evil Cortado. After attempting to starve Varippuli to make him perform once more, Cortado tried to whip the beast, but it got the better of him. Before Varippuli could deliver the final blow, Cortado found his gun and supposedly killed the tiger. Miles also runs into an old friend of Lady Partridge, an elderly former explorer named Baltinglass of Araby, who eagerly aids them. Just before they can reach the Palace of Laughter, Miles and Little are taken by a violent gang of orphan boys called the Halfheads and caught between the constant rivalry of two other gangs, the Stinkers and Gnats. With the help of Henry, one friendly member of the Halfheads and after the betrayal of String (who holds a grudge against Miles after being replaced by him), Little and Miles reach the Palace of Laughter and find it is nowhere near the pleasant place they expected it to be. The Great Cortado uses a method he has devised with the mysterious Dr. Tau-Tau to make people laugh uncontrollably and steal the laughter and happiness out of their souls. He then sells a drink that can temporarily make them feel themselves again. Cortado plans to spread his influence across the towns and eventually the world. Miles and Little are caught by Silverpoint, who at first pretends to not recognise them to keep them safe. He finally reveals Cortado's plan, and the three are befriended by the clown trio, the Bosillio brothers, who wish to help them. Cortado intends to make Miles and Little sit through the next performance and share the same fate as the other unfortunate spectators, but Miles is able to steal some of the antidote given to the clowns, Cortado, and Genghis before the show. Cortado and Genghis happen to drink the water Miles replaces it with and now cannot stop laughing senselessly. The police arrive, informed by Lady Partridge and Baltinglass, who were informed by Partridge's cats who in turn were tipped off by the tiger. They lock up Genghis and Cortado in the local asylum since they can't answer to any accusations after falling victim to their own scheme. String plans to get revenge on Miles by stealing Little and using her ability to fly to make himself the leader of the Stinkers. He finds a room where he believes she is locked up, but instead unleashes the Null. The monster goes on a rampage and Silverpoint is knocked unconscious trying to defeat him. He is about to squeeze Miles to death when Little sings her true name, saving Miles but tying herself to the earth forever. She loses her wings and is rescued from falling by the Bosillio Brothers. The Null is now much more tame and surprisingly affectionate towards Miles, who finds that he cannot let the city council destroy it. The Bosillio Brothers find Tangerine and return him to Miles, revealing that they gave it to him the day he was born. Barty Fumble was Miles' father and they were a part of his circus. Silverpoint returns the Realm of the Angels but is forced to leave Little behind. After one more talk with the enigmatic tiger (who Miles suspects is Varippuli), he promises to find what happened to his father and make Little's life on earth as happy as it was in the heavens.  Characters  * Miles Wednesday ‚Äì A boy whose last name comes from the Pinchbuckets, the nasty owners of the orphanage who name their charges after the day they were dropped off. Miles learns the meaning of friendship and courage he never had during his adventure. * Little ‚Äì A Song Angel who followed her friend Silverpoint down to Earth and was forced to perform in the Great Cortado's circus. Little is not her real name, rather, it's Silverpoint's nickname for her. Little's task as a Song Angel is to sing the One Song, which ties all life together and keeps it in peaceful existence. This allows her to speak the language of animals and bring out the good in others. By singing her real name on earth, she is bound there forever. * Tangerine ‚Äì A stuffed bear Miles has had for as long as he can remember, named for his fading orange colouring. Due to Miles' strong imagination, Little is able to find his name in the One Song and sings it to bring him to life. Tangerine is very curious and his wandering away allows him to be caught by Ghengis. * The Great Cortado ‚Äì The evil ringmaster of the Circus Oscuro. He began as a leader who wanted nothing more than to make more money than any other circus in the land, but after nearly being mauled by the tiger Varippuli, he had an epiphany which led him to believe that having money is nothing compared to being powerful. Using this idea he studied the power of laughter and ways to control it, thus creating the Palace of Laughter and developing his master plan. * The Null ‚Äì A terrifying monster kept locked away by the Great Cortado, and used to hunt or kill anyone who gets in his way. No one knows how Cortado came across and captured the Beast. When Little searches the One Song for its name to stop it from killing Miles, she finds nothing but an empty hole where it should have been. After she sings her own name, it suddenly becomes a tamer animal and shows a strange new loyalty to Miles. * The Tiger ‚Äì An unnamed tiger that first appears to Miles after the Circus Oscuro rolls into town. It refuses to call anyone by their names, saying he doesn't like to be on speaking terms with anything that could be lunch, but more often proves to be of great help to Miles and his friends. He comes and goes as he pleases, and Miles believes that he is the tiger Cortado claims to have killed the night he was attacked. * Lady Gertrude Partridge ‚Äì The widow of a wealthy inventor. After his death, she spent her fortune trying to fix the problems caused by his unfinished inventions, leading her to move out of her mansion and into a treehouse mostly made of her favourite antiques she couldn't bear to part with. Her many cats keep her company and she has a limited understanding of what they say. After helping to save Miles and Little, one of her late husband's inventions proves to be a success, restoring her fortune. She converts her mansion into a new, much more pleasant orphanage. * Gulliver Baltinglass ‚Äì Lady Partridge's old flame, who was once an explorer of great renown. He now spends his time making his famous apple jelly from the apples in his vast orchard. He is nearly blind and a little senile, but always ready for an adventure. * Ghengis ‚Äì The Great Cortado's dimwitted lackey, who does most of his dirty work. * The Bosillio Brothers ‚Äì Gila, Umor, and Fabio, three brothers who are clowns in the Palace of Laughter and used to work for Barty Fumble. After finding Tangerine, they realise Miles is Barty Fumble's long lost son. * Silverpoint ‚Äì A powerful Storm Angel who visits Earth and is taken by Cortado. He acts as an older brother for Little and has a deep sense of righteousness. * String ‚Äì A member of the Halfhead gang who kidnap Miles and Little. After being beat by Miles in a challenge, he is kicked out of the gang and replaced by him. Out of anger he joins the rival gang, the Stinkers. After seeing Little's ability to fly, he tries to kidnap her and unleashes the Null. It is unknown whether he survives his encounter with it. * Henry ‚Äì A member of the Halfheads who is sympathetic to Miles and Little. He helps them escape after a police raid, but is captured by the Stinkers when String betrays their location. After being held prisoner at the top of an old Ferris wheel, he is rescued by the chief of police, who adopts him as his own son. Sequels Two sequels, The Tiger's Egg, and The Lightning Key, were published one year consecutively after the other. They continue Miles' adventures to find his father and search for the legendary Tiger's Egg, while escaping the devious Cortado and unlocking the mystery surrounding the Null and the Tiger. 2006 Irish novels Children's fantasy novels Novels about orphans HarperCollins books Irish children's novels 2006 children's books ","title":"The Palace of Laughter"},{"id":"12816481","text":"An evening with the \\"mother\\" of the Fluxus movement Mary Bauermeister.

The artist Gregor Zootzky and his animated short film \\"Psst pp Piano - Hommage √† Mary Bauermeister\\". Mary Hilde Ruth Bauermeister (born 7 September 1934) is a German artist who works in sculpture, drawing, installation, performance, and music. Influenced by Fluxus artists and Nouveau R√©alisme, her work addresses esoteric issues of how information is transferable through society. \\"I only followed an inner drive to express what was not yet there, in reality or thought,\\" she said of her practice. \\"To make art was more a finding, searching process than a knowing.\\" Since the 1970s, the artist's work has concentrated on the themes surrounding New Age spirituality, specifically geomancy, the divine interpretation of lines on the ground. Biography =Early life and artistic beginnings= Mary Bauermeister was born in Frankfurt am Main to Wolf Bauermeister, a professor of genetics and anthropology, and Laura Bauermeister, a singer. Mary Bauermeister was artistically influenced in secondary school (1946‚Äì54) by her drawing teacher, G√ºnter Ott. She studied in 1954‚Äì55 at the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung in Ulm and in 1955‚Äì56 at the Staatlichen Schule f√ºr Kunst und Handwerk in Saarbr√ºcken. She has been active since 1957 as a freelance artist in Cologne. In 1960, in her studio at Lintgasse 28 in Cologne, she launched a series of gatherings of members of the evolving global artistic movement Fluxus.[...]\\"Mary Bauermeister (artist renowned for hosting avant-garde gatherings in 1960s Cologne)\\" (seminar speaker on 5 February 2009, in Korea) Fluxus Heidelberg Center Blog At her invitation, avant-garde poets, composers and visual artists such as Hans G Helms, David Tudor, John Cage, Christo, Wolf Vostell, George Brecht, and Nam June Paik organised unconventional concerts of the \\"newest music\\", readings, exhibits, and actions. These activities have been described as \\"comparatively non-hierarchical exchanges of information across national, disciplinary and age boundaries\\", contributing in that way to the character of the Fluxus movement which had been developing during the 1950s.Higgins 2002, 11. In 1961, she took part in Karlheinz Stockhausen's composition course at the Internationalen Ferienkursen f√ºr Neue Musik in Darmstadt.Stockhausen 1963, 167. Later that same year she collaborated with Stockhausen in a theatre piece titled Originale (Originals), which was given twelve performances at the Theater am Dom, Cologne, from 26 October to 6 November 1961. Amongst the performers were Bauermeister herself (as The Painter), Nam June Paik (Actions), David Tudor (Piano and Percussion), and Hans G. Helms (The Poet).Stockhausen 1963, 107‚Äì29. In 1962 she had her first solo exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam with a simultaneous day-long performance of electronic music under Stockhausen's direction. On 3 April 1967, in San Francisco, she married Stockhausen, with whom she had two children: Julika (born 22 January 1966) and Simon (born 5 June 1967).Bauermeister 2011, 174, 207, 212. They were divorced in 1972.Stockhausen-Stiftung [2013]. She has two younger daughters, Sophie (born July 1972, father David Johnson) and Esther (born 1974, father Josef Halevi).Bauermeister 2011, 284, 295. =Residence in New York= Bauermeister, Perhaps (1965) Drawn by the vitality of the Pop Art movement, in October 1962 Bauermeister relocated to New York City. In the artistic circles of Pop Art, Nouveau R√©alisme and Fluxus, she maintained friendships with Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely. In New York Bauermeister enjoyed considerable artistic success. Since 1964 she has exhibited regularly at the Galeria Bonino on 57th Street. =Later life= In the 1970s, Mary Bauermeister returned to Germany and began to occupy herself with marginal sciences, for example Geomancy, the science of energy structures in the earth. She used the knowledge she garnered from these studies for the planning of gardens, which she implemented for public and private clients throughout the world. The artist now lives in R√∂srath near Cologne. On the occasion of her 70th birthday in September 2004, the Cologne Museum Ludwig acquired her 1963 wall installation Needless Needles and arranged a display of the work for several months. In 2019, Museum Ludwig acquired three more works by Mary Bauermeister, Rundes Wabenbild, Magnetbild Schwarz-Weiss and the relating 34 sketches M√∂glichkeiten Serieller Malerei. 2018 Mary Bauermeister signed an exclusive contract with the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery in New York.  Honours  On 15 June 2020, Bauermeister was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit for her contributions to Germany's post-war art scene. She received the award from the German State Minister of Culture and Science, Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen.

He was born in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, on November 2, 1801, but moved with his parents to Hampden, Maine, in 1802. His father Simeon Stetson (b. Braintree, Massachusetts) kept a store and a sawmill, and built vessels for the West India Trade. His uncle Amasa Stetson was proprietor of the nearby town of Stetson, Maine, where Simeon had briefly settled before moving to Hampden.Henry Chase, \\"Isaiah K. Stetson\\" in Representative Men of Maine (Portland, 1893). Stetson was 13 years old when a British invasion force sacked the town of Hampden and terrorized its inhabitants following the Battle of Hampden (1814). He subsequently attended Hampden Academy and graduated from Yale College in 1823. He studied law, was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Hampden in 1826. Legal and political career Stetson was admitted to the bar of the United States Supreme Court in 1828, then held various local offices. He moved to Bangor, adjoining Hampden, in 1833, as that city grew rapidly into the region's largest port. He was appointed Judge of the Bangor Municipal Court (1834‚Äì1839), Member of the Common Council of Bangor (1843‚Äì1844), and a Member of the Executive Council of Maine (1845‚Äì1848). Stetson was finally elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-first United States Congress (March 4, 1849 ‚Äì March 3, 1851).History of Penobscot County, Maine (Cleveland, 1882), p. 210. Stetson was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination to the Thirty-second Congress, and resumed the practice of law in Bangor. He affiliated with the Republican Party in 1860, as had most local politicians, including fellow Hampdenite Hannibal Hamlin, who became Lincoln's Vice President. Stetson died in Bangor March 27, 1863, and was interred in Mount Hope Cemetery. Stetson Family Stetson was married to Emily J. Pierce, the daughter of Waldo Pierce of Frankfort, Maine. The Stetsons became a powerful Bangor mercantile and political family in Charles' lifetime and beyond. Stetson's younger brother, Isaiah Stetson (1812‚Äì1880), served as Mayor of Bangor (1859‚Äì1862), and Member the Maine House of Representatives (1866‚Äì67). His other brother George Stetson (1807‚Äì1891) became a leading Bangor lumber merchant, shipbuilder, bank & insurance company president, and civic figure, and married the niece of future Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. George also served in the Maine House of Representatives (1863‚Äì64). George's son Isaiah Kidder Stetson (b. 1858, Yale class of 1879) expanded his father's business interests into ice harvesting, and became Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives (1899‚Äì1900) and a member of the Maine State Senate (1903‚Äì1906). Charles' daughter Caroline Pierce Stetson married attorney Franklin A. Wilson, who also represented Bangor in the Maine House of Representatives (1874‚Äì75) and subsequently became President of the Maine Central Railroad. His son (Charles Stetson's grandson and namesake) Charles Stetson Wilson became U.S. Ambassador to (respectively) Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia in the 1920s and early 1930s. There are two Stetson Blocks in downtown Bangor. The Stetson Block on Exchange Street was burned in the Great Fire of 1911 and quickly replaced by a building of the same name, and in the same location, from a design by local architect Wilfred E. Mansur. A second and larger Stetson Block was built in 1913 on Central Street, from a design by Parker, Thomas, and Rice of Boston. It presently houses \\"Bagel Central\\". Both buildings are presently protected as part of the Great Fire of 1911 National Register Historic District. The lower part of Broadway is also known as \\"Stetson Square\\". The George Stetson House at 208 French St. in Bangor is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Broadway Historic District. This Greek Revival style house was designed by local architect-builder Benjamin S. Deane in 1847-48.

Motley published a column in the Chicago Defender under the pen-name Bud Billiken. Motley also worked as a freelance writer, and later founded and published the Hull House Magazine and worked in the Federal Writers Project. Motley's first and best known novel was Knock on Any Door, which was made into a movie by the same name (1947). Early life and career Motley was born and grew up in the Englewood neighborhood, South Side, Chicago, in one of the few African-American families residing there. His father was a Pullman porter. Motley graduated from Lewis-Champlain grammar school, and Englewood High School.Bill Granger, \\"Willard Motley - A Writer Of Brutal Honesty\\", Chicago TribuneJune 26, 1994. He is related to the noted artist Archibald Motley. The two were raised as brothers, although Archibald was in fact Willard's uncle. He was hired by Robert S. Abbott to write a children's column called \\"Bud Says\\" under the pseudonym \\"Bud Billiken\\", for the Chicago Defender. He traveled to New York, California and the western states, earning a living through various menial jobs, as well as by writing for the radio and newspapers. Returning to Chicago in 1939, he lived near the Maxwell Street Market, which was to figure prominently in his later writing. He became associated with Hull House, and helped found the Hull House Magazine, in which some of his fiction appeared. In 1940 he wrote for the Works Progress Administration Federal Writers Project along with Richard Wright and Nelson Algren. In 1947 his first novel, Knock on Any Door, appeared to critical acclaim. A work of gritty naturalism, it concerns the life of Nick Romano, an Italian-American altar boy who turns to crime because of poverty and the difficulties of the immigrant experience, who says the famous phrase \\"Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse.\\" It was an immediate hit, selling 47,000 copies during its first three weeks in print. In 1949 it became a movie starring Humphrey Bogart. In response to critics who charged Motley with avoiding issues of race by writing about white characters, Motley said, \\"My race is the human race.\\" His second novel, We Fished All Night,Compare Luke 5:5 (KJV) \\"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.\\" was not hailed as a success, and after it appeared Motley moved to Mexico to start over. His third novel, Let No Man Write My Epitaph, picks up the story of Knock on Any Door. Columbia Pictures made it into a movie in 1960. Ella Fitzgerald's music for the film was released on the album Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs from \\"Let No Man Write My Epitaph\\". Criticism According to the citation statement for the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame awards, \\"Motley was criticized in his life for being a black man writing about white characters, a middle-class man writing about the lower class, and a closeted homosexual writing about heterosexual urges. But those more kindly disposed to his work, and there were plenty, admired his grit and heart....Chicago was more complicated than just its racial or sexual tensions, and as a writer his exploration was expansive....\\" Motley was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014. Death and legacy On March 4, 1965, Motley died in Mexico City, Mexico at age 55. One final novel, Let Noon Be Fair, was published the following year. Since 1929, Chicago has held an annual Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic, (which served as his pen name during his early career at the Chicago Defender) on the second Saturday of August. The parade travels through the city's Bronzeville, Grand Boulevard and Washington Park neighborhoods on the south side.

(\\"ES\\" stands for \\"Electroschiff\\", meaning .) In 1941 before the US entered World War II, US authorities seized her and started converting her into a United States Navy stores ship. She was the sole ship of the US Navy's Saturn class. She was laid up in 1946 and scrapped in 1972. Arauca was built for trade between Germany and the Caribbean, and was named accordingly. Arauca is a border town in eastern Colombia on the frontier with Venezuela. ES Arauca Arauca was one of three sister ships that Bremer Vulkan of Bremen- Vegesack, Germany built in 1939 for Hamburg Amerikanische Paketfahrt AG (HAPAG). Arauca had two oil-fired high pressure LaMont boilers and turbo- electric transmission. Her boilers fed two AEG turbo generators, which fed current to an AEG electric propulsion motor on her single propeller shaft. In August 1939 Arauca left Germany on her maiden voyage, carrying general cargo to Mexico. Technological problems dogged the voyage, including the superheater of one of her boilers being burnt out. By the time she had reached port in Vera Cruz and completed discharging her cargo it was the beginning of September and Germany had invaded Poland. German merchant ships now risked being seized or sunk by the Royal Navy, so Arauca remained in port for the next two and a half months. In December Arauca tried to make for Germany, but off the coast of Florida the light cruiser fired across her bow, so on 19 December she put into Port Everglades. Orion had opened fire in US territorial waters, which prompted a US protest to the UK Foreign Office. SS Sting On 6 July 1941 US Presidential Executive Order 101 authorised the United States Maritime Commission to take over foreign ships lying idle in US ports. On 28 July 1941 the Commission took over Arauca and contracted her management to the South Atlantic Steamship Company of Savannah, Georgia, which renamed her Sting. Sting had been idle in port for 19 months so on 19 August was towed from Port Everglades to the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company shipyard at Mobile, Alabama for repairs. There both the Maritime Commission and the South Atlantic SS Co concluded that they did not have engine-room crews skilled enough to run her transmission and high-pressure boilers, so on 14 November they offered her to the US Navy Auxiliary Vessels Board. On 2 December South Atlantic SS Co handed Sting back to the Commission, which continued to manage her repairs. USS Saturn On 6 December 1941, the day before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Bureau of Navigation recommended that Sting be renamed Saturn. Her conversion for Navy use was meant to be completed by late December, but because of her technical complexity this was extended by several months. The opportunity was therefore taken to convert her more fully to Navy specifications, including armament, but the Maritime Commission retained sole charge of her repairs. On 20 April 1942 Sting was delivered to the US Navy, commissioned as USS Saturn and classified AK-49 at Mobile, Alabama, commanded by Cmdr. Charles M. Furlow. On 3 May Furlow's Navy crew tried to take her to Charleston, South Carolina were stopped by the failure of her condensate pump, steering gear, anchor windlass, make up and main feed pumps, evaporators, fuel oil service pumps and turbine-driven exciter. She eventually left Mobile on 3 June but took until 14 June to reach Charleston, where she needed further repairs. On 11 August 1942 Saturn tried to leave Charleston for Norfolk, Virginia but the water circulating pumps for both of her boilers failed. On 19 September she left Boston on the first of three trips supplying American bases in Newfoundland with general cargo. However, in October she was drydocked in Boston for emergency replacement of her stern tube, which took until December. From March 1943 Saturn operated between east coast ports, mainly Norfolk, Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland, and bases in the Caribbean such as Guantanamo and Trinidad. She suffered a loss of boiler feedwater and high oxygen content in her boiler water, so in July 1943 the Bureau of Ships gave the Norfolk Naval Shipyard plans to replace much of her boiler, feed and condensate system. There are no known records of whether this work was done, and nor are there records of any further technical problems. In October and November 1943 Saturn made one transatlantic crossing to England, and then resumed supply trips between the USA and Caribbean until September 1944. In April 1944 Norfolk Navy Yard converted her to a provision store ship and on 10 April she was reclassified AF-40. While in the Norfolk Navy Yard on April 27, 1944, a fire broke out in the hold, resulting in the death of 16 men working on the ship. This accident remained classified until 2010. https://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/article_4541519c-4e61-11e9-a4c7-d7edeeff2f07.html?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar On 2 September 1944 Saturn sailed to the Mediterranean carrying supplies for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. After one trip to Iceland and several voyages to the Caribbean, she made another trip to Oran, French Algeria in March 1945. Saturn resumed her supply voyages up and down the Atlantic Coast until arriving at Norfolk, VA on 1 July 1946. =Military awards and honors= Saturn received one battle star for her World War II service. Her crew was eligible for the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Europe, Africa, Middle East Campaign Medal (1) * World War II Victory Medal Decommissioning, layup and disposal Saturn was decommissioned on 23 July 1946, redelivered to the War Shipping Administration on 25 July and struck from the Navy list on 15 August. She was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in the James River, Virginia until 12 September 1972, when she was sold to Isaac Varela of Castellon de la Plana, Spain for scrap.

In November 1948, the nationalist forces from Guangdong consisted of the 13th Security Regiment, the 5th Regiment, and a battalion of the 1st Security Regiment were dispatched to eradicate the local communist guerrilla. The nationalists enjoyed both the technical and numerical superiorities, so they decided to attack on multiple fronts in separate directions.

The entire nationalist convoy was lost with over 70 troops killed and over a dozen boats full of supplies fallen into enemy hands. On November 20, 1948, a group of communist guerrilla faked the attack on Great Lake (Da Hu, Â§ßÊπñ) region, and as the nationalist 1st Security Regiment sent out a company to engage the enemy, the enemy immediately retreated, lured the unsuspecting nationalists into the preset ambush in the Lion‚Äôs Brain (Shi Zi Nao, ÁãÆÂ≠êËÑë) mountains, where the communist guerrilla 3rd Regiment was waiting, and the entire nationalist company was wiped out.

The communist guerilla concentrated its 3rd Regiment, 5th Regiment, 7th Regiment and Independent 5th Group totaling 1,000 to ambush the convoy was when the nationalists were stopping at the riverbank. On January 11, 1949, after a nine-hour-long fierce battle that lasted from noon till 9:00 PM, the nationalists managed to successfully breakout, but all of the suppliers had lost to the enemy in addition to suffering over 190 fatalities. After this setback, the nationalists cancelled any further plans to eradicate the communist guerrilla and withdrew all of its deployed forces. The nationalist failure was mainly caused by the grave underestimation of the enemy‚Äôs strength and determination. Although the so-called communist guerrilla regiments were actually only battalion sized, they could still be a sizable and formidable force when they were concentrated together. In contrast, although the nationalist enjoyed both the technical and numerical superiority, they did not have advantage when their forces were deployed separately in smaller numbers.

The nationalist 4th Security Regiment of Shanxi totaling around 1,000, defended the pass.

At 3:00 AM on April 25, 1947, the enemy finally attacked under the cover of artillery shelling. The defenders immediately came out of their fortifications to counterattack, but this proved to be a great mistake: venturing out of their fortifications allowed the defenders to be sealed off by the attacking enemy into several isolated groups that could not support each other, and without the fortifications, the stranded defenders were annihilated within three hours. The communist victory ensured the control of the strategic pass and secured the safe passage of future troop movements for themselves while blocking the passage of nationalists, thus helped the communist to achieve final victory in Zhengtai Campaign.

Operation Elster (\\"Magpie\\" in English) was a German espionage mission intended to gather intelligence on U.S. military and technology facilities during World War II. The mission commenced in September 1944 with two Nazi agents sailing from Kiel, Germany on the U-1230 and coming ashore in Maine on November 29, 1944. The agents were William Colepaugh, an American-born defector to Germany, and Erich Gimpel, an experienced German intelligence operative. They spent nearly a month living in New York City, expending large amounts of cash on entertainment, but accomplishing none of their mission goals. Colepaugh quickly lost his commitment to espionage, and hoping to avoid the death penalty for treason, turned himself in to the FBI and betrayed his partner Gimpel, effectively ending the operation in late December 1944. In February 1945, the two agents were convicted of espionage by a military court and sentenced to death. At the time, the military tribunal which named American citizens in a conspiracy to commit treason was only the third of its kind ever held in the history of the US. When the war ended, their sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment by President Harry S. Truman. Gimpel was paroled in 1955. Colepaugh was paroled in 1960. Operation Magpie was one of only two times the Germans landed agents on American shores by submarine during the war. Despite a number of claims and speculations that the mission was intended to sabotage the Manhattan Project, no supportive evidence exists in the official investigative records. Mission The idea of landing spies in the United States originated with Nazi Germany's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and this particular operation was developed by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Operation Magpie would be Germany's second and final attempt to insert agents onto the American mainland by submarine. They had previously landed agents on American shores by U-Boat as part of Operation Pastorius in June 1942, but that mission failed, resulting in the capture of all eight of the espionage agents who were deployed. Originally intended to gather information gauging the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda in the United States, the objective of Operation Magpie was later widened to include the gathering of technical engineering information, generally from public sources. Of particular interest was intelligence on shipyards, airplane factories, and rocket-testing facilities. The mission was intended to last for 2 years, and called for information to be communicated to Germany by morse code radiotelegraphy using a shortwave radio transmitter the agents were expected to build. In the event they could not transmit by radio, they were to send the information via postal letters written in secret ink and addressed to a number of \\"mail drops\\", which included both American prisoners of war and intermediaries in Spain. It was thought that the agents would eventually build additional shortwave radio transmitters for use of other German agents sent to the United States in the future. = Agents = Chosen for the mission were 26 year-old William Colepaugh, an American citizen from Niantic, Connecticut who defected to Germany, and 34 year-old Erich Gimpel, a German radio operator and technician who had been engaged in spying operations in other countries since the start of the war. Gimpel was a seasoned operative, having begun activities as an intelligence informant in the mid 1930s in Lima, Peru where, while working for Telefunken as a radio engineer, he transmitted shipping information to German U-Boats waiting offshore. He also conveyed information helpful to the German government gathered from corrupt Peruvian officials and underworld contacts. He was deported from Peru back to Germany in 1942, and was shortly recruited by the German Foreign Intelligence Service Amt VI. His experience as a covert operative and skilled radio operator was considered valuable, and he was reportedly assigned to serve in Operation Pelikan, a German espionage mission designed to cripple the Panama Canal which was cancelled shortly before it was scheduled to take place. According to many accounts, Colepaugh grew up in a family that was very pro-German and often listened to propaganda broadcasts from Berlin. After graduation from Admiral Farragut Academy, he briefly attended MIT. He served 14 months in the United States Merchant Marine. In 1942, he was arrested in Philadelphia for draft evasion. He enlisted in the United States Navy but was discharged \\"for the good of the service\\" in 1943. The next year he spent working at a watch factory, and then a farm. In 1944, fearing being drafted by the Army, he signed on as a crew member of the SS Gripsholm and sailed to Lisbon, where he went to the German Embassy and requested to join the German Army, saying that he renounced his US citizenship and owed his allegiance to Germany. In Berlin, he was recruited by the Foreign Intelligence Service, Amt VI, who saw that he was given extensive firearms and espionage training. Colepaugh was not deemed to be particularly reliable by the Germans, but was judged necessary for the operation due to his easy familiarity with American society and customs. It was also thought that Colepaugh would handle any interactions and conversations with locals for Gimpel, who spoke English with a marked German accent. = Landing = After completing training in The Hague, Gimpel and Colepaugh boarded U-1230 on September 22, 1944, to sail for the United States. The landing site, located near on the west coast of Crabtree Neck, Hancock Point, in the town of Hancock, Maine, was chosen because of its remote location, and because it was one of a small number of places on the Maine coast where the submarine would be able to approach relatively close to the shore. On the evening of November 29, 1944, after spending eight days resting on the ocean floor off the coast of Maine to avoid American patrols, the U-1230 passed into Frenchman Bay and Gimpel and Colepaugh were put ashore at approximately 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time in an inflatable rubber raft rowed by two German seamen. Before rowing back to the sub, the two seamen allegedly stood on American soil for a moment, ostensibly so they could boast of it later. The landing was delayed in part because the submarine had received reports that another U-boat, engaged in a similar mission, had been sunk nearby and its spies captured. After discussing a number of alternative landing sites along the coast of New England as far south as Newport, Rhode Island, the decision was made to use the originally-chosen landing site. Gimpel and Colepaugh made their way from the rocky beach to a local road, hiked to United States Route 1, and were fortunately able to flag a cab that was making its way to Bangor. The men were spotted twice while on foot in the Hancock Point area, with both observers noting with suspicion their city garb, suitcases, and lack of hats on the snowy night. Mary Forni, a local housewife, saw the pair walking together as she drove home from a card game. 17 year-old Harvard Hodgkins, a Boy Scout and son of local deputy sheriff Dana Hodgkins, also spotted the two men as he was driving home from a dance. The boy noticed that their footprints on the snowy ground originated from a path that led to the beach. The elder Hodgkins was away on a hunting trip, but by the time he returned, investigated the reports, and contacted the FBI, fully five days had elapsed. =Activities= Operation Magpie was dramatized in the 1956 film Spy for Germany (German title: Spion f√ºr Deutschland) From Bangor, the pair made their way to Boston and then New York City by train. In addition to false identity papers, they were equipped with US$60,000 in currency ($ today), a \\"backup\\" cache of 99 diamonds, two .32 caliber Colt automatic pistols, a Leica camera with a special lens for document copying, two Krahl wristwatches, secret inks and developers, and microdots that contained radio schematics and transmission schedules as well as mail drop addresses. Using the aliases Edward Green (Gimpel) and William Caldwell (Colepaugh), they rented a studio apartment on the top floor of a building at 39 Beekman Place, selected for its lack of steel frame construction that might interfere with radio signals. They set about procuring parts for the radio transmitter Gimpel was expected to build. A bulky magnifier unit was supplied to them by Berlin to read the microdots containing radio plans, however they left it behind when disembarking the submarine because of its excessive weight. They bought a magnifying glass, but found it was insufficiently powerful to read the dots. Gimpel obtained a 1944 edition ARRL Radio Amateurs Handbook containing transmitter plans, as well as a multimeter, several milliamp meters, a roll of copper bell wire, and some small hand tools. They purchased a used General Electric broadcast radio receiver which Gimpel intended to convert to an 80 watt shortwave radio transmitter by modifying it with additional electronic components, however there is no evidence this was ever accomplished.David Kahn. Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence In World War II. Perseus Books Group; 14 July 2000. . p. 20‚Äì.Robert A. Miller. A True Story of An American Nazi Spy: William Curtis Colepaugh. Trafford Publishing; 27 February 2013. . p. 97‚Äì. Once landed in America, Colepaugh was more interested in spending money and chasing women than in conducting espionage work. Although Gimpel tried to persuade him to record shipping activity in New York harborJay Robert Nash. Spies: A Narrative Encyclopedia of Dirty Tricks and Double Dealing from Biblical Times to Today. M. Evans; 28 October 1997. . p. 238‚Äì. and assist in shopping for radio parts, Colepaugh preferred to take advantage of the many attractions the city had to offer. Gimpel was substantially more focused on the mission than his partner. However, he was not immune to the enticements of New York City; he and Colepaugh often ate together in restaurants such as Longchamps and the Hickory House, visited nightclubs such as the Latin Quarter and Leon and Eddie's, and patronized numerous bars in Greenwich Village. They also attended theaters such as the Roxy, Radio City Music Hall, and the Capitol. According to some estimates, the pair spent between US$1500 and US$2700 ($ today) of their funds in a single month, mostly on bars, restaurants, nightclubs, shows, and clothing. Colepaugh enthusiastically pursued numerous casual sexual affairs with women, tipped extravagantly, and drank heavily. He was sometimes absent for many hours at a time, using hotels such as the Empire and Essex for his sexual liaisons. Gimpel passed the time reading newspapers, going to the movies to watch newsreels, and dining out at some of New York City's finer steak houses. On December 21, Colepaugh permanently deserted Gimpel, making off with US$48,000 ($ today) of their currency, and taking a room at the Hotel St. Moritz to continue his spree of nightclubbing and womanizing. = Arrest = A few days later, a troubled Colepaugh sought out an old schoolmate, Edmund Mulcahy. He confessed that he was part of a Nazi espionage mission, and sought his friend's advice on how to surrender to authorities. Colepaugh hoped he'd be granted immunity from prosecution if he turned himself in, revealed information about the Nazi war effort, and voluntarily betrayed Gimpel. After discussing Colepaugh's options with him over the Christmas holiday, Mulcahy agreed to make initial contact with the FBI on behalf of Colepaugh. On December 26, Federal agents arrived at the Mulcahy family home in Richmond Hill, NY, and took Colepaugh into custody after a brief questioning. The bureau had already been searching for the two German agents following the sinking of a Canadian ship a few miles from the Maine coastline (indicating a U-boat had been nearby) and reports of suspicious sightings by local residents Forni and Hodgkins. The FBI interrogated Colepaugh at the United States Courthouse at Foley Square in New York City, and gained information which then enabled them to track down Gimpel. It was learned that Gimpel, who could read and speak Spanish, habitually visited a Times Square newsstand located at the corner of 42nd Street and 7th Avenue where he bought Peruvian newspapers. Gimpel was subsequently arrested at that location on December 30. =Interrogation= The pair remained in custody at the Courthouse in Foley Square and underwent interrogation for approximately three weeks. A U.S. Navy Department report on their interrogation notes that it yielded intelligence on German submarine operations and Naval bases. According to the report, Colepaugh was \\"a somewhat unstable New Englander but impressed his interrogators as attempting to tell the truth. [H]e is intelligent, very observant, and has an extraordinary visual memory for details. His attitude toward the interrogators was friendly and cooperative. He was always careful to distinguish between eye witness evidence and hearsay. The interrogators were under the impression that his helpfulness was inspired by the hope of escaping the death penalty\\". Gimpel was characterized in the same report as \\"a very difficult subject for interrogation. He was a professional German espionage agent, thoroughly indoctrinated in security. He believes that the death penalty awaits him and that nothing he can do will mitigate his sentence. He was untruthful on several occasions with his interrogators and told them only what he believed they already knew. His statements are of very little value\\". The FBI undertook its own investigation into Gimpel and Colepaugh's backgrounds and activities, and in a report to President Franklin Roosevelt, J. Edgar Hoover noted that Colepaugh's mother claimed to be a cousin of the President and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and could produce genealogical evidence. Roosevelt dismissed this, however, telling Hoover, \\"He is no relation of mine\\". =Trial= Gimpel and Colepaugh were transferred to Governors Island on January 18, 1945, to stand trial by a military commission. Future Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark was selected to prosecute the case. At the time, the military tribunal which named American citizens in a conspiracy to commit treason was only the third of its type convened in the history of the US; the first was in 1865 after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the second in 1942 following the capture of German agents involved in Operation Pastorius. Legal counsels assigned to Gimpel were Major Charles E. Reagin and Major John E. Haigney. Colepaugh was represented by Major Thayer Chapman and Major Robert B. Buckley. During the trial, Colepaugh's defense claimed that the accused had a change of heart while in Germany, undertook the espionage mission as a way to get back to the US and turn himself in, but could not easily get away from a watchful Gimpel. The prosecution countered, saying that Colepaugh was often alone without Gimpel and had many opportunities to turn himself in during the month since he arrived in Maine by submarine, but failed to act on any of them. In February 1945, the pair were convicted of espionage by the military tribunal and sentenced to death.Joseph E. Persico. Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage. Random House; 2002. . This was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment by President Harry S. Truman. Gimpel was paroled in 1955; Colepaugh was paroled in 1960.  Atomic espionage claims  Claims that Gimpel had a secret mission not disclosed to Colepaugh to sabotage heavy water works related to the Manhattan Project are without foundation in the documentary record. Although some proponents have claimed Gimpel's target was a heavy water research facility at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, no such program existed beyond relatively small-scale research, and official files concerning the activities of Colepaugh and Gimpel contain nothing to substantiate the claim. Author David Kahn wrote that ‚ÄúGimpel‚Äôs ghostwritten account of the mission, Spy for Germany, must be used with the greatest caution, as it differs in a number of critical points from his (FBI) statement. The most important are the book‚Äôs claims that he was assigned to ferret out atomic secrets, that he succeeded to some extent, and that he radioed a message to Germany. None of these are supported by his statement or by Colepaugh‚Äôs or by postwar interrogations of his spymasters, and the atomic claim is specifically contradicted by a statement of Schellenberg‚Äôs\\".  V-weapon claims  During his interrogation, Colepaugh claimed that German U-boats were being equipped with long range rocket launchers. Supposedly, the U-1230 was shadowed by a U-boat pack equipped with such V-weapons intended to be launched at New York City and Washington D.C.. Although the US took the threat seriously, it never materialized,\\"The air-raid warden was a spy: and other tales from home-front America in World War II\\", William B. Breuer. John Wiley and Sons, 2003. , . p. 174-176 and Colepaugh's claim was later proven false.  Books and film  Gimpel co-authored an autobiographical book about his experiences entitled Agent 146 in the mid 1950s, later published as Spy for Germany in Great Britain, and adapted for a west German film of the same name in 1956. During research for his own book about Operation Magpie, author Robert Miller noted a number of inconsistencies in Gimpel's highly romanticized accounts of his espionage activities in the US, commenting that, \\"it is filled with sensational contradictions and fantasies, almost from cover to cover, when compared to the official FBI reports and trial records\\". Author David Kahn also compared Gimpel's book to official records and found it to contain many inaccuracies and unsupported fabrications.

To avert the situation, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division was ordered to be deployed from the Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, ÈªÑÊ°•) Town to reinforce Rugao. Meanwhile, the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division deployed at Yangzhou and Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ) was ordered to attack Shaobo (ÈÇµ‰ºØ) in the north. The communist, in response, ordered their 1st Division, 6th Division, 5th Brigade and the Specialized Regiment to attack Taizhou, Jiangsu from Dingyan (‰∏ÅÂ†∞) and Linxin (ÊûóÊ¢ì) regions, in the hope of luring the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division to abandon its attack on Shaobo (ÈÇµ‰ºØ) and reinforce Taizhou, Jiangsu, so that it could be ambushed on its way. Although the communist plan succeeded in forcing the nationalists to abandon their attack on Shaobo (ÈÇµ‰ºØ), the planned ambush of the nationalist Reorganized 25th Division failed to materialize. Instead, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division became the unfortunate victim. In the morning of August 25, 1946, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division begun its march toward Rugao from Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, ÈªÑÊ°•) Town, with nationalist 187th Brigade and a regiment of the nationalist 79th Brigade coming out of Rugao to meet their comrades-in-arms. By the noon, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division met the communist main force on the road from Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, ÈªÑÊ°•) Town to Rugao. The communist 1st Division and 6th Division immediately launched their assault on the nationalists, successfully besieging the enemy in isolated pockets in the regions of Fenjie (ÂàÜÁïå) and Jiali (Âä†Âäõ). The communists decided to concentrate their forces 4 to 5 times than that of their enemy to annihilate the weakest enemy first, and then the stronger one. On August 26, 1946, the nationalist 99th Brigade of the Reorganized 69th Division at Fenjie (ÂàÜÁïå) region was first to be completely annihilated, and on the next day, the nationalist 187th Brigade and a regiment of the nationalist 79th Brigade at Jiali (Âä†Âäõ) region was also annihilated completely. The victorious communists then launched their assault on Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, ÈªÑÊ°•) Town, and remaining 5 companies of the nationalist 160th Brigade simply could not challenge the overwhelmingly superior enemy force, and gave up the town and surrendered. With the fall of Yellow Bridge (Huangqiao, ÈªÑÊ°•) Town, the nationalists was forced to cease their offensive to regroup for the next stage of the campaign and the battle ended.

The Cheng Zhiwu was unable to stop his fleeing troops, forcing a complete withdraw. Given the opportunity, the Peoples Liberation Army counterattacked, inflicting further casualties on the National Revolutionary Army and taking over a hundred prisoners. The National Revolutionary Army's failure was due to the reliance on poorly trained bandits. The bandits themselves were poorly organised and unwilling to fight.

This suggests that Plioplatecarpus would have hunted relatively small prey that it could grab very precisely. The broad distribution of fossil remains in both North America and Europe suggest that it would have been an open ocean predator. Discovery Plioplatecarpus was first found in Europe by paleontologist Louis Dollo (P. marshi), in 1882. It was relatively incomplete, but more fossils would soon turn up. In North America, Edward Drinker Cope found another mosasaur in 1869, but had identified it as Mosasaurus. It would later be reclassified as Plioplatecarpus, as would Cope's Liodon, in 1870. Liodon would be reclassified as Platecarpus, and later as Prognathodon. However, some have placed it in the genus Plioplatecarpus.Oceansofkansas.comPaleodb.org Distribution Plioplatecarpus mounted skull in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado Plioplatecarpus has been found in many locations around the world (most mosasaurs were fairly widespread). Plioplatecarpus has been found in the Pierre Shale of Kansas, Demopolis Chalk of Alabama, and also in Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, Canada, Sweden, The Netherlands.

Goyer. It is the first sequel in the Kickboxer franchise, and stars Sasha Mitchell in the role of David Sloan (although spelled Sloane in the first movie) the brother of Kickboxers lead character Kurt, portrayed by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Plot One year after the events of the first film, it is revealed that kickboxing brothers Kurt and Eric Sloan have been killed by Tong Po in Thailand shortly after his defeat to Kurt. David Sloan, the last surviving brother, struggles to keep the family's Los Angeles kickboxing gym afloat. He offers free kickboxing lessons to local kids, often demonstrating a technique he calls the \\"rock and the river\\" which allows him to defend against attacks while blindfolded. Although his will to compete has waned since the loss of his brothers, financial problems eventually force David to fight again in a new organization run by a crooked promoter, Justin Maciah. His surprising comeback ultimately attracts the attention of Po who, disgraced by his previous loss to Kurt, seeks to defeat David in the ring and regain his honor. But when David announces his retirement after the bout, Po's manager Sangha (who is later revealed as the one helping fund Maciah's kickboxing organization) hires a group of thugs to burn down the gym. Although David attempts to fight them off, he is beaten down and suffers a gunshot wound to the leg. The attack prevents him from aiding a young student trapped in the blaze, who dies as a result. While recovering in the hospital, David is visited by Xian Chow, who trained his brother Kurt in Thailand. Though David initially wants nothing to do with him, he finally relents and allows Xian to nurse him back to health. Meanwhile, one of David's most promising students, Brian Wagner, has secured a championship bout and invites David to watch the fight. However, the champion is unexpectedly replaced by Po; as a part of a deal made between Maciah and Sangha, who brutalizes the young man and kills him in the ring despite David's efforts to talk the young fighter down. The bout leaves Justin in financial and professional ruin while Sangha declares their partnership is over. Afterwards, Xian reveals to David that the main reason he is helping him is because Tong Po had also murdered his niece Mylee along with his brothers. He guiltily admits that part of him wants revenge for her death, and is willing to sacrifice David to get it. Insisting that the fight is his own, David accepts Po's challenge. In a bloody bout reminiscent of the \\"ancient way\\" of fighting in Thailand, David is beaten badly and has clouded vision. Utilizing his \\"rock and the river\\" technique, however, David gains the upper hand and ultimately defeats his rival. Having lost his honor, Sangha confronts David in the ring at gunpoint, but thanks to a distraction by his friend Jack, David is able to disarm and incapacitate him. The next day, David unsuccessfully teaches Xian to drive a car. When his students introduce him to the new neighborhood bully, David once again demonstrates the \\"rock and the river,\\" but the lesson is cut short when the ice cream truck arrives, and Xian treats the kids. Cast Release Kickboxer 2 was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Trimark Pictures in June 1991, grossing $1,250,712 at the box office. HBO Home Video released it on VHS and laserdisc the same year. In the Philippines, the film was released by Pioneer Films on July 4, 1991. The film was released on DVD by Lionsgate in 2003.

Early life Macarthur was the eldest son of John Macarthur, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Veal). He was born at Bath, Somerset, England and arrived at Sydney with his parents in the ships Neptune and Scarborough in 1790 in the Second Fleet. Edward Macarthur is believed to be the only passenger on these ships of whom a photograph (taken later in life) exists. The young Edward was sent to England to be educated in 1799. Career Macarthur returned to Australia in 1806, and took part with his father in the deposition of Governor William Bligh, as Bligh, in his dispatch to Viscount Castlereagh of 30 April 1808, requested that \\"two of the rebels Charles Grimes and Edward Macarthur who have gone home in the Dart may be secured, in order to be tried in due time\\". On Macarthur's arrival in England he entered the army as an ensign in the 60th regiment, serving at Corunna and in Sicily. In 1809 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. As part of the 39th Regiment he took part in the Duke of Wellington's campaigns in the Peninsular War and in France. In 1820 or 1829 he became a captain. In 1824 he paid a visit of 10 months to Australia as an agent of Thomas Potter Macqueen. After Macarthur's return to England, he was for some years secretary to the Lord Chamberlain. In 1826 he was promoted to the rank of major and in 1837 he was on the staff in Ireland. Macarthur retained his interest in Australia, on 3 July 1839 he addressed a long communication to the Right Hon. Henry Labouch√®re, suggesting that regular lines of steamers should be established in Australia to trade between the various ports. This was referred to the governor, Sir George Gipps, who in May 1840 replied that government aid was unnecessary, as a large company had been formed to establish a line of steamers of which James Macarthur (Edward's brother) was chairman. Edward Macarthur also promoted emigration in two small books, Colonial Policy of 1840 and 1841, as Illustrated by the Governor's Despatches, and the Proceedings of the Legislative Council of New South Wales (London, 1841) and Brief Remarks on Colonization (London, 1846). In August 1840 Macarthur made a protest against the regulations that persons desiring to take up land in the Port Phillip district should have to proceed to Melbourne where all charts of land were kept for public inspection. He was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1841 and afterwards went to New South Wales as deputy adjutant-general. Macarthur became colonel in 1854. Macarthur travelled with the Commander-in-chief of British forces in Australia, Major-General Sir Robert Nickle, to the site of the Eureka Rebellion on 5 December 1854. There they talked with the miners openly; as a result of their investigations Nickle advised the withdrawal of martial law. Macarthur was appointed Commander-in-chief of British forces in Australia in 1855, to replace Nickle. On 1 January 1856, after the death of Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, he was administrator of the State for 12 months. Late life Macarthur returned to London in 1860, was created in 1862 a KCB and given the colonelcy of the 100th (Prince of Wales's Royal Canadian) Regiment of Foot the same year, a position he held until his death. He died in London on 4 January 1872 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, In 1862, at the age of 73, he had married Sarah (daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel W. S. Neill), who survived him.

Data extracted from the Members of the genus Thermococcus are typically irregularly shaped coccoid species, ranging in size from 0.6-2.0 Œºm in diameter. Some species of Thermococcus are immobile, and some species have motility, using flagella as their main mode of movement. These flagella typically exist at a specific pole of the organism. This movement has been seen at room or at high temperatures, depending on the specific organism. In some species, these microorganisms can aggregate and form white-gray plaques.Tae-Yang Jung, Y.-S. K., Byoung-Ha Oh, and Euijeon Woo (2012). \\"Identification of a novel ligand binding site in phosphoserine phosphatase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus.\\" Wiley Periodicals: 11. Species under Thermococcus typically thrive at temperatures between 60 to 105¬∞C, either in the presence of black smokers (hydrothermal vents), or freshwater springs. Species in this genus are strictly anaerobes, and are thermophilic, found in a variety depths, such as in hydrothermal vents 2500m below the ocean surface, but also centimeters below the water surface in geothermal springs. These organisms thrive at pH levels of 5.6-7.9. Members of this genus have been found in many hydrothermal vent systems in the world, including from the seas of Japan, to off the coasts of California. Sodium Chloride salt is typically present in these locations at 1%-3% concentration, but is not a required substrate for these organisms, as one study showed Thermococcus members living in fresh hot water systems in New Zealand, but they do require a low concentration of lithium ions for growth. Thermococcus members are described as heterotrophic, chemotrophic,Yuusuke Tokooji, T. S., Shinsuke Fujiwara, Tadayuki Imanaka and Haruyuki Atomi (2013). \\"Genetic Examination of Initial Amino Acid Oxidation and Glutamate Catabolism in the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis.\\" Journal of Bacteriology: 10. and are organotrophic sulfanogens; using elemental sulfur and carbon sources including amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids such as pyruvate. Metabolism Metabolically, Thermococcus spp. have developed a different form of glycolysis from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One example of a metabolic pathway for these organisms is the metabolism of peptides, which occurs in three steps: first, hydrolysis of the peptides to amino acids is catalyzed by peptidases, then the conversion of the amino acids to keto acids is catalyzed by aminotransferases, and finally CO2 is released from the oxidative decarboxylation or the keto acids by four different enzymes, which produces coenzyme A derivatives that are used in other important metabolic pathways. Thermococcus species also have the enzyme rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), which is made from enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleic acids in Thermococcus kodakarensis, showing how integrated these metabolic systems truly are for these hyperthermophilic microorganisms. Some nutrients are limiting in Thermococcus cell growth. Nutrients that affect cell growth the most in thermococcal species are carbon and nitrogen sources. Since thermococcal species do not metabolically generate all necessary amino acids, some have to be provided by the environment in which these organisms thrive. Some of these needed amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, and valine (the branched-chain amino acids). When Thermococcus species are supplemented with these amino acids, they can metabolize them and produce acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA, which are important precursors used in other metabolic pathways essential for cellular growth and respiration. With today's technology, Thermococcus members are relatively easy to grow in labs, and are therefore considered model organisms for studying the physiological and molecular pathways of extremophiles. Thermococcus kodakarensis is one example of a model Thermococcus species, a microorganism in which has had its entire genome examined and replicated. Ecology Thermococcal species can grow between 60 and 80¬∞C, which gives them a great ecological advantage to be the first organisms to colonize new hydrothermal environments. Some thermococcal species produce CO2, H2, and H2S as products of metabolism and respiration. The releases of these molecules are then used by other autotrophic species, aiding the diversity of hydrothermal microbial communities. This type of continuous enrichment culture plays a crucial role in the ecology of deep-sea hydrothermal vents,Hakon Dahle, F. G., Marit Madsen, Nils-Kare Birkeland (2008). \\"Microbial community structure analysis of produced water from a high- temperature North Sea oil-field.\\" Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 93: 13. suggesting that thermococci interact with other organisms via metabolite exchange, which supports the growth of autotrophs. Thermococcus species that release H2 with the use of multiple hydrogenases (including CO-dependent hydrogenases) have been regarded as potential biocatalysts for water-gas shift reactions. Transportation mechanisms Thermococcus species are naturally competent in taking up DNA and incorporating donor DNA into their genomes via homologous recombination. These species can produce membrane vesicles (MVs), formed by budding from the outermost cellular membranes, which can capture and obtain plasmids from neighboring Archaea species to transfer the DNA into either themselves or surrounding species. These MVs are secreted from the cells in clusters, forming nanospheres or nanotubes, keeping the internal membranes continuous. Thermococcus species produce numerous MVs, transferring DNA, metabolites, and even toxins in some species; moreover, these MVs protect their contents against thermodegradation by transferring these macromolecules in a protected environment. MVs also prevent infections by capturing viral particles. Along with transporting macromolecules, Thermococcus species use MVs to communicate to each other. Furthermore, these MVs are used by a specific species (Thermococcus coalescens) to indicate when aggregation should occur, so these typically single-celled miroorganisms can fuse into one massive single cell. It has been reported that Thermococcus kodakarensis has four virus-like integrated gene elements containing subtilisin-like serine protease precursors. To date, only two viruses have been isolated from Thermococcus spp., PAVE1 and TPV1. These viruses exist in their hosts in a carrier state. The process of DNA replication and elongation has been extensively studied in T. kodakarensis. The DNA molecule is a circular structure consisting of about 2 million base pairs in length, and has more than 2,000 sequences that code for proteins. Future technology An enzyme from Thermococcus, Tpa-S DNA polymerase, has been found to be more efficient in long and rapid PCR than Taq-polymerase. Tk-SP, another enzyme from T. kodakarensis, can degrade abnormal prion proteins (PrPSc); prions are misfolded proteins that can cause fatal diseases in all organisms. Tk-SP shows broad substrate specificity, and degraded prions exponentially in the lab setting. This enzyme does not require calcium or any other substrate to fold, so is showing great potential in studies thus far. Additional studies have been coordinated on the phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) enzyme of T. onnurineus, which provided an essential component in the regulation of PSP activity. This information is useful for drug companies, because abnormal PSP activity leads to a major decrease in serine levels of the nervous system, causing neurological diseases and complications. Thermococcus spp. can increase gold mining efficiency up to 95% due to their specific abilities in bioleaching.

Plot summary The novel is about Roger Lambert, a theology professor in his fifties, whose rather complacent faith is challenged by Dale, an evangelical graduate student who believes he can prove that God exists with computer science. Roger becomes obsessed with the thought that Dale is having an affair with his wife, Esther. Roger himself becomes involved with his niece Verna, a coarse but lively nineteen-year-old and single parent whose own mother (Roger's half-sister) had a sexual hold over him when they were in their teens. Verna, frustrated by her poverty and limited opportunities, becomes increasingly abusive towards her one-and-a-half-year-old, mixed-race daughter, Paula. Roger, out of sympathy for her situation and his increasing sexual attraction for her, begins to tutor Verna so she can earn her high school equivalency. One evening, when Paula refuses to go to sleep, Verna shoves and hits her; Paula falls and breaks her leg. Roger, after helping Verna disguise the assault as a playground accident from the hospital staff, has sex with her. Dale, meanwhile, grows depressed and disillusioned when his computer data does not seem to point to the existence of God. The novel ends with Verna leaving Boston to return to her parents in Cleveland, and Roger and Esther receiving temporary custody of Paula. Major themes The novel's structure, characters and themes are based somewhat on Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, with Roger Lambert representing Roger Chillingworth, his wife Esther as Hester Prynne, Dale standing for Arthur Dimmesdale, and Paula a version of Hester's illegitimate daughter Pearl. The review for Publishers Weekly said the novel was focused on longstanding themes of Updike's work: \\"reason versus faith; science versus religion; belief versus any of the forms of unbelief.\\" The New York Times review by novelist David Lodge described the novel as having five major thematic areas: theology, eroticism, domesticity, physical description and science. All of these themes are mediated by the narrating character Roger, which Lodge describes as at times \\"over [the reader's] head, at least on first reading.\\"  Critical reception  Publishers Weekly was not impressed with the novel, writing \\"for all Updike's finesse and dexterity in the deployment of ideas, there is more arcane computerology here than readers, including his most devoted, can digest by force-feeding, and probably more theology as well. Most readers will also think the characters contrived, mouthpieces for the perspectives they espouse.\\" Some voices found the novel praiseworthy, with David Lodge writing, \\"One finishes it with gratitude ‚Äì for it is challenging and educative ‚Äì and with renewed respect for one of the most intelligent and resourceful of contemporary novelists.\\" References 1986 American novels Ambassador Book Award-winning works Novels by John Updike Alfred A.

Through a varied international career, Herincx performed in most of the world's great opera houses and with many of the world's leading symphony orchestras, having been in demand in international opera and in the choral and orchestral field. He is also featured in many recordings, some of which are creator's recordings and others, first recordings. Career During the first ten years of his career he sang, as principal baritone, with both the Welsh National Opera and Sadler's Wells Opera companies, singing in over 400 performances and 40 major roles with the latter. A parallel international career developed as he was engaged for guest appearances in the opera houses of Paris, Brussels, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Stuttgart. Concert appearances in Rome, Madrid, Athens, Lisbon and Stockholm were also part of his itinerary. His BBC Promenade Concert debut was in 1961 and, as a result, he took the English language concert repertoire into many European concert halls including the premieres of works by Walton, Tippett, Vaughan Williams, Elgar and Britten. His debut at the Royal Opera House was in 1968. He then appeared in many roles in Italian, English, German, Russian and French for that company and starred in three world premieres including Faber in The Knot Garden by Michael Tippett on 2 December 1970 conducted by Sir Colin Davis and produced by Sir Peter Hall. Meanwhile, appearances for the English National Opera included many major roles, notably as Wotan in Wagner's Ring Cycle. This role also brought him personal success in Europe and North and South America. From 1976, when he joined the Metropolitan Opera of New York, much of his career was in the USA and was focussed on the operas of Wagner. He subsequently appeared in most of the major cities for the leading American opera companies. Both in Britain and America he was well known as a voice teacher and therapist and devoted some of his time to cancer research, guiding and helping patients with voice and throat problems. In the UK, he taught at the Royal Academy of Music, Trinity College of Music, and the Universities of Cardiff and Aberdeen; whilst in the USA he taught at the Universities of Washington and California (UCLA) and lectured for the Yale Club and the Juilliard School. He continued to teach regularly at the North East of Scotland Music School in Aberdeen. In the sphere of international music competitions he became well known as an adjudicator and examiner, having appeared regularly as a jury member for competitions such as the BBC Young Musician of the Year and the Mary Garden award. In this capacity he was frequently invited overseas as the British representative on international juries. More recently he became much in demand as a lecturer, speaker and translator and was also frequently engaged as a musical journalist and critic. His numerous recordings include Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage and The Knot Garden, Handel's Messiah, Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, Tavener's The Whale, Delius' Koanga plus Vaughan Williams' The Pilgrim's Progress and Sir John in Love. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen. He lived in Bath and was married to Astra Blair.

SRI International in Menlo Park, California led development of the IraqComm system under the DARPA program Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC). Vocabulary IraqComm has a vocabulary of tens of thousands of words in English and in Iraqi Arabic. The system is designed to enable soldiers or medics to converse with civilians in settings such as military checkpoints, door-to-door searches, or first aid situations. The system is tailored to translate spoken interactions on topics on force protection, security, and basic medical services, and can be customized to include other topics as needed. Conversations can be logged for later review or archiving. Users After IraqComm demonstrated leading performance in competitive laboratory tests under Phase 1 of TRANSTAC, in Spring 2006 the U.S. military selected the IraqComm system for evaluation in real tactical operations in Iraq. Design IraqComm integrates three software technologies: automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). To start a dialog, the user speaks into the microphone and the system records his or her voice. The ASR module processes the recording and displays what it heard on the screen. The MT module translates the phrase into the target language (e.g., Iraqi Arabic). The TTS module then ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù this translation, which is also displayed on the screen. To simplify and speed up communication, the IraqComm interface provides a shortcut menu of frequently used phrases. The user can change the phrase to be translated by editing it with the keyboard or by selecting a similar-sounding phrase with a single press of a button. SRI's DynaSpeak speech recognition engine is embedded in the IraqComm system. DynaSpeak speech recognition is also used in the Phraselator, a weatherproof handheld language translation device developed by VoxTec, a former division of the military contractor Marine Acoustics, located in Annapolis, MD.

Taxonomy The type species, T. taqueti, was described by Eric Buffetaut in 1974. A second species, T. oblita, was named from Madagascar in 1979, but was renamed Miadanasuchus in 2009. Trematochampsa gives its name to the Trematochampsidae, a poorly known group of fossil crocodiles. However, the labile phylogenetic position of Trematochampsa in many studies has been attributed to character conflict, leading many authors to exclude this genus from many cladistic analyses, but Sertich et al. (2014) noted that the referred material of Trematochampsa consists of more than one crocodyliform taxon, so they opted to use only the cranial material in the dataset for the cladistic analysis of Rukwasuchus and recommended removing the postcranial material from Trematochampsa. The analysis recovered Trematochampsa as a member of Peirosauridae, rendering Trematochampsidae a junior synonym of Peirosauridae.a b c d e Sertich, J. J. W.; O‚ÄôConnor, P. M.

A 2018 revision of T. taqueti found that its fossil material was a mixture of bones from peirosaurids, Araripesuchus, Anatosuchus, Notosuchus-like crocodyliforms, and neosuchians. No distinguishing characteristics were found in the holotype specimen, a lacrimal bone, thus rendering the genus a nomen dubium. References * Carroll, RL. (1988).

Subsequently renamed Aetna and then Saginaw around 1937 while in merchant service, she was acquired by the Navy 27 September 1941. Originally designated USS Matinicus (AG-38), she was reclassified AK-52 7 January 1942 while undergoing conversion at Bethlehem Steel Company, Boston, Massachusetts. Commissioned as USS Matinicus (AK-52) 4 August 1942, Lt. Comdr. W. L. Cain in command, she was redesignated and renamed USS Gemini (AP-75) 15 August 1942. World War II service Gemini sailed 16 August for New York to load troops and sortied 24 October with convoy SC-107 bound for Ireland and United Kingdom ports. This, her first voyage, was also the most difficult, for the convoy ran into German submarine wolfpacks in mid-Atlantic and from 1 to 4 November no less than fifteen ships, nearly half the convoy, were torpedoed and sunk in a running battle. Gemini arrived safely at Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, and spent the next 10 months as a transport for troops and cargo between Icelandic ports. The ship put in at Boston 3 September 1943 for overhaul, and then embarked troops at New York, departing 9 October bound for the west coast via Panama. After touching at San Pedro, California, for repairs, she reached Honolulu 11 December and commenced duty as an inter-island transport in Hawaiian waters. In July 1944 Gemini shifted her operations to the Marshalls and Gilberts, carrying men and cargo to and from Kwajalein, Apamama, Tarawa, Makin, Majuro, Roi Namur, and Eniwetok. She continued these essential transport duties in support of the allied advance until 1 June 1945 when she got underway for San Francisco, California, via Pearl Harbor. Gemini remained in drydock at San Francisco until the end of the war. After hostilities Gemini sailed 28 August 1945 for the Pacific Ocean again, resuming her earlier transport runs in the Marshalls-Gilberts area and continuing the assignments until her return to San Francisco. She decommissioned at Oakland, California, 8 April 1946 and was turned over to the Maritime Commission 10 September 1946. Subsequently sold to Oly Fenno S.S. Co.

His subject is the changing nature of culture.  Biography  He was born in Mexico City in 1953. He was partly raised by an Amerindian nurse who helped him to respect the indigenous people of his country and their history. He studied economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City in 1975. As a student, he was sent to work on rural development projects, an experience that strengthened his interest in political and social activism. In 1977, Chagoya and his first wife immigrated to the United States, where he worked as a free-lance illustrator and graphic designer and for a time, in 1977, with farm laborers in Texas. In 1984, he earned a BFA at the San Francisco Art Institute and in 1987 an MFA at the University of California at Berkeley.

Aside from a number of literary and scientific works, his printing press is mainly known for its publications of music. Phalesius was the principal publisher of music active in the sixteenth-century Low Countries.Leuvense drukken van Petrus Phalesius at Erfgoedcel Leuven Life Petrus Phalesius was born in Leuven about 1510. His original name was Peeter (or Pieter) van der Phaliesen.Alfons Goovaerts, De muziekdrukkers Phalesius en Bellerus te Leuven en te Antwerpen 1546‚Äì1674, E van Bergen, 1853 Canticvm beat√¶ Mari√¶ qvod magnificat nvncvpatur, per octo musice modos variatum at Flandrica Phalesius started a bookseller business in 1545 and soon set up a publishing house. Phalesius at first outsourced the printing of his books to other printers such as Jacob Bathen, Servaas van Sassen and Reynier Velpen. After obtaining a printing patent in 1552, he established himself as an independent printer in Leuven. By 1553 his press was printing his own high- quality output from movable type. In 1570 he entered into a partnership with Johannes Bellerus, a printer based in Antwerp, enabling him to reach a wider clientele. Phalesius died in Leuven in 1575. His sons Cornelis (Cornelius) and Petrus Phalesius the Younger continued the family firm. The latter moved the business in 1581 to premises in Antwerp. In Antwerp the publishing house flourished into the seventeenth century under the direction of Petrus the Younger's daughters Maria and Magdalena. Publications Frontispiece of Canticum Beatae Mariae, published by Phalesius in 1563 While the Phalesius press published a number of literary and scientific works such as Gemma Frisius' De radio Astronomico & Geometrico liber, it is mainly known for its publications of music. By 1575 the Phalesius press had published about 180 music books. The majority of Phalesius's output is dedicated to sacred music‚Äîmasses, motets and magnificats‚Äîthe rest being a mix of French chansons, Italian madrigals, Flemish songs and instrumental works. Vocal and instrumental works are both represented. Because Phalesius put out a number of lute publications during the early years of his activity, some music historians believe that he may himself have played the lute.Robert Lee Weaver , Waelrant and Laet: Music Publishers in Antwerp's Golden Age, Harmonie Park Press, 1995 Phalesius borrowed from many composers and did not hesitate to include works from collections of other publishers. For instance Phalesius' Een Duytsch musyck boeck (A Dutch music book) of 1572 copies no less than half of the songs from Niewe Duytsche Liedekens, met III. IIII. V. VI. ende VIII. partyen (New Dutch songs in 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 parts) published by Jacob Bathen in Maastricht in 1554.Ben J.P.

Issue 1-2 Many pieces are by Clemens non Papa and other Flemish composers such as Lassus and Rore, while some of his instrumental pieces are obviously borrowed from the Parisian publishers Le Roy and Ballard. Notable among these is Selectissima... in guiterna ludenda carmina (Leuven, 1570), a collection containing instructions (in Latin) for amateurs wishing to play the guitar, together with 115 pieces for that instrument. In the same year Phalesius published a collection of music for cittern under the title Hortulus cytherae.

Life He was one of nine children of the architect George Godwin senior (1780‚Äì1863)http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10891?docPos=1 Retrieved 21 April 2011 and trained at his father's architectural practice in Kensington, where he set up in business with his brother Henry Godwin (1831‚Äì1917). Encouraged by his friend the antiquary John Britton, he pursued an interest in architectural history and wrote several volumes on The Churches of London (1839), mason's marks and gothic style. He was also interested in new materials, and wrote on the use of concrete (1836). He soon joined the Institute of British Architects and the Society of Antiquaries, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was a co-founder of the Royal Architectural Museum in 1851. The Builder The Builder was first published as a weekly magazine in 1842 by Joseph Hansom, inventor of the Hansom cab. In 1844 Godwin became its third editor and immediately expanded its scope and coverage beyond new works and architectural issues to include history, archaeology, arts, sanitation and social issues. It described itself as 'An illustrated weekly magazine for the architect, engineer, constructor, sanitary reformer, and art lover'. This broadened its appeal beyond the construction trade, and he took a campaigning stance to improve the circumstances of the working classes. Godwin wrote on slums and republished edited collections of his articles as reforming books. In addition to self-improvement, he promoted the use of public baths, wash-houses, charitable housing trusts, and pavilion-styled hospitals. In 1881, he set up the Godwin Bursary, which was administered by the Royal Institute of British Architects. This yearly competitive prize was to enable young British architects to study modern techniques of construction outside of Great Britain. Winners were encouraged to spend at least five weeks within a country of their choice, and then to submit reports on what they learnt. The first five winners all went to the United States. He edited the magazine until 1883. It was renamed Building in 1966, and is still published.  Other works  Throughout his editorship he worked in the family architectural practice. His works included churches, housing and public buildings, amongst them Redcliffe Square, Kensington; The Boltons, Kensington; St Mary's, The Boltons; Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea; St Luke's, Kensington; and the restorations of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Mary's, Ware. He was largely responsible for the design of large areas of South Kensington and Earls Court, including five public houses‚Äîamong them the Finborough Arms, now the Finborough Theatre. Godwin was retained as district surveyor for south Islington between 1853 and 1874. In 1884, he reported to the Royal Commission that was producing recommendations for improving working-class housing. He also wrote plays, and co-founded the Art Union of London. Death Godwin died on 27 January 1888 at Kensington, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. He lies to the east side of the main path, between the north entrance and the colonnades. Although set back behind other monuments, his memorial is easily spotted due to its unique design; containing a portrait medallion, and being topped by the mourning figures of Faith and Charity, it is Grade II listed. His extensive art collection was sold at Christie's, London, on 12 April 1888; it numbered 98 lots.  References  Sources * G. B.

The essay is especially interested in war photography. Using photography as evidence for her opinions, Sontag sets out to answer one of the three questions posed in Virginia Woolf's book Three Guineas, \\"How in your opinion are we to prevent war?\\" While debunking a certain number of common misconceptions (including some to which she contributed) concerning images of pain, horror, and atrocity, Regarding the Pain of Others both underscores their importance and undercuts hopes that they can communicate very much.

Quaker Square was the original Quaker Oats factory; the complex consists of the former mill, factory, and silos. The buildings were bought in the early 1970s by developers who sought to create a unique, useful home for shops and restaurants. The buildings were bought by the University of Akron in 2007. The hotel has been converted to a residence hall. The retail space consisted of several small shops and restaurants, while offices were on the floors above. Quaker Square was open to the general public until September 18, 2015. The hotel no longer accepts reservations as the former hotel rooms and the entire complex is operated exclusively for student and university use. However, ballrooms are still available for catered events and conferences. History The Quaker Oats company was formed by the merger of several businesses, one was the Akron-based German Mills American Oatmeal Company founded by Ferdinand Schumacher. Schumacher's facility, first built in 1872, was destroyed by fire in 1886, then was rebuilt at the same location. Those buildings formed the basis of the Quaker Oats Cereal Factory. The complex consisted of cereal production facilities, warehouses, and rail-siding sheds. Quaker Oats built 36 grain silos on the site in 1932. Each silo was 120 feet tall and 24 feet in diameter, and together they housed 1.5 million bushels of grain.http://www.quakersquare.com/quakerhistory.html The complex is now the only remaining visual reminder of what was once Akron's largest single employer. Quaker Oats terminated production in Akron in 1970. The entire complex was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Mall The facility was repurposed in March 1973, and reopened 1 April 1975 with four shops and an ice cream parlor. The silos were converted into a Hilton Hotel which opened in 1980.University of Akron News - UA Buys Quaker Square Complex Later it became a Crowne Plaza hotel. The hotel is built into the suite of silos and is famed for its 196 completely round rooms. (Source: \\"Quaker Chronicle\\" promotional sheet available at the hotel.) The Trackside Grille & Ice Cream Parlor, a restaurant themed with railroads which run parallel to the building, also provided a narrative of Akron's history. The Trackside Dining Room was constructed with the beams and columns of the factory building. (Source: \\"Quaker Chronicle\\" promotional sheet available at the hotel.) The Quaker Square General Store offered oatmeal cookies, pie- baking classes for children, and \\"nostalgic\\" candy. (Source: \\"Quaker Chronicle\\" promotional sheet available at the hotel.) Purchase by University of Akron In mid-June 2007 the University of Akron bought the complex for $22,679,000 with plans to convert it into student housing and office space. The university planned to house more than 400 students in the converted hotel starting with the 2008 spring semester. In January 2008, the university began to use the upper floors of the hotel as a residence hall. Under contract with UA, RDA Management of Fairlawn operated 95 hotel rooms on the four bottom floors of the silos for the following two years. The university agreed to keep those rooms available to the public for that period to give the city an opportunity to secure more hotel space for downtown visitors and tourists. On June 30, 2013 the hotel was closed and converted entirely into student housing. The shops at Quaker Square, as well as Trackside, closed in 2016. The only remaining store was a Zee's store which is a convenience store for students to buy groceries and snacks. As of August 2018, Zee's moved to the lobby of UA's Quaker Hall, leaving the retail portion empty. That side of the complex continues to house offices on the second, third, and fourth floors.

Ramp to former platform The former Akron Union Station, slightly to the south, was closed in 1971 when Amtrak did not include a Washington-Chicago train on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) as part of its initial route structure. On November 10, 1990, the Broadway Limited was rerouted from the ex-Pennsylvania Railroad Fort Wayne Line to the ex-B&O.; Union Station had been reused by the University of Akron; Amtrak used part of the former platform and constructed a modular station building at Quaker Square. The New York-Chicago Broadway Limited was replaced with the New York-Pittsburgh Three Rivers on September 10, 1995, ending service to Akron. The Three Rivers was extended to Chicago through Akron on November 10, 1996; however, Amtrak and the city disagreed over who would pay for necessary repairs to the station. Akron station reopened on August 10, 1998 - the last of several ex-Broadway stops to be restored. The Three Rivers was cut back to Pittsburgh as the Pennsylvanian on March 7, 2005, ending service to Akron again.

It is named for Sally Beck, a local who delivered news to passing river boats in the 1880s. The river was part of a land grant given to George Washington, Jr., nephew of George Washington, the president. He surveyed the land in 1785. The Gasper River was site of the home church of Reverend James McGready, and religious revivals were held on its banks as early as 1797, constituting the first ever open-air tent revival or camp meeting. In 1800 McGready began a revival at the nearby Red River Meeting House, which sparked the Second Great Awakening, and many of the congregants present were from the Gasper River church.

In this companion book to her Illness as Metaphor (1978), Sontag extends her arguments about the metaphors attributed to cancer to the AIDS crisis. Sontag explores how attitudes to disease are formed in society, and attempts to deconstruct them. Overview Illness as Metaphor was a response to Sontag‚Äôs experiences as a cancer patient, as she noticed that the cultural myths surrounding cancer negatively impacted her as a patient. She finds that, a decade later, cancer is no longer swathed in secrecy and shame, but has been replaced by AIDS as the disease most demonized by society. She finds that the metaphors that we associate with disease contribute not only to stigmatizing the disease, but also stigmatizing those who are ill. She believes that the distractions of metaphors and myths ultimately cause more fatalities from this disease. Discussing illness in metaphorical terms is not new, but Sontag says that AIDS is the ripest opportunity for \\"metaphorizing\\" in recent years. Also, because its earlier years in the United States were marked by an affliction of very specific risk groups ‚Äì homosexual men and intravenous drug users ‚Äì it has been stigmatized. The patient‚Äôs illness is perceived to be the patient's fault, because of the unsafe habits that one seemingly has to pursue to contract it ‚Äì \\"indulgence, delinquency ‚Äì addictions to chemicals that are illegal and to sex regarded as deviant.\\" Having these defined subgroups created a distinction between the ill and potentially ill, and the general population. AIDS is seen as a plague and as a judgment on the individuals suffering from it. Despite the fact that it is a heterosexual disease as well as a global issue, it is still often discussed as a consequence of decadence and a punishment for \\"deviant\\" sexual behavior. Although HIV is likely not a new virus, its emergence changed attitudes towards illness and medicine. Infectious diseases have clearly not been as summarily defeated as society would have preferred to believe. Generally, the many uncertainties about AIDS are the center of discourse on the illness, and reassurances that \\"the general population\\" is safe are multiplying. The judgments on the illness and the patients are still implicit in any discussion, and Sontag believes that detaching the guilt and shame from perspectives on this disease, and retiring the military metaphors from the discussion, will contribute to productive discourse on AIDS and help those who have contracted the illness. Comparisons made To explicate her claims on the various metaphors attributed to AIDS and diseases more generally, Sontag employs a number of comparisons among AIDS, cancer, and historical illnesses. =AIDS and cancer= Cancer was at one time the identity of a patient. It was a shameful and stigmatized condition, and was often omitted from obituaries and concealed from as many people as possible. Often, it was perceived to be a curse or a punishment. Sontag claims that AIDS has taken over on all counts, and that AIDS patients now suffer the same, or worse, judgment and stigmatization that cancer patients once did. =AIDS and syphilis= Like syphilis, AIDS is perceived as having stages. The tertiary stage of syphilis was the most severe, as it is with AIDS, and both have a period of latency before the progression. However, syphilis did not run its full course in every case, and even cases that ended in death could be romanticized. For example, numerous artists suffered from syphilis, and it came to be an accepted view that its effects on the brain could actually inspire original thought. No such compensating factor exists for AIDS, and it was too early in the epidemic at the time of the writing of this book to determine definitively whether AIDS always progresses to death. =Relative perceptions of diseases= Sontag examines a theory regarding relative perceptions of diseases. She believes that those diseases that society finds most terrifying are not the most widespread or the most lethal, but those that are seen to be dehumanizing. For example, a rabies phobia tore through nineteenth-century France, but rabies was actually incredibly rare, and was just terrifying with its ideas that it could transform humans into raving animals. Cholera has killed fewer people than smallpox, but the \\"indignity of the symptoms\\" made it more dreadful. Polio \\"withered the body\\" but did not touch the face, placing it above afflictions like leprosy. Metaphors Sontag defines metaphors as \\"giving the thing a name that belongs to something else\\", and notes that they have been used throughout history to discuss the body, illness, and health. =Military metaphors= When it was discovered that illnesses were caused by pathogens, the associated metaphors took on a military flair, and military metaphors have since come to dominate the way we talk about medical situations. There are \\"immunological defenses\\" and \\"aggressive\\" medicine, and the \\"efforts to reduce mortality from a given disease are called a fight... a war\\". Sontag claims that these military terms are a factor in the stigmatizing of certain illnesses and those who are suffering from them. She explains that \\"the metaphors and the myths, I was convinced, kill\\". =Invasion and pollution= AIDS lends itself to metaphorizing, and its descriptions combine two of the most potent metaphors associated with disease. First, it is connected to the idea of a disease as an invader, complete with all the military metaphors of defense and war. Sontag stresses that as we as a society have become more accustomed to fighting ideological wars, it is easier to conceptualize mounting a war against a disease. The descriptions of AIDS often takes on an out of this world flavor, especially in discussing the \\"alien takeover\\" of the body's cells by the invader. Secondly, its transmission is described in terms of pollution. This creates a divide between the general population and the disease carriers who endanger them, and reopens a topic not seen in recent years: the concept of disease as punishment. Because AIDS is sexually transmitted, and because the groups most at-risk for AIDS in its earliest years were populations engaging in behaviors condemned by society (homosexuality, illegal drug use), AIDS was seen as a judgment on the patient. As AIDS does not strike at random, like cancer does, contracting AIDS made you guilty, complicit in your own disease, suffering the consequences of your own willful activity. =Plague= Sontag believes that \\"plague is the principal metaphor by which the AIDS epidemic is understood\\", and that AIDS has taken that mantle from cancer. When AIDS is seen as affecting a \\"risk group\\", it brings back the historical idea that the \\"illness has judged\\". One important point for a plague is that the affliction must come from somewhere else. AIDS is believed to have come from the \\"dark countries\\", and spread to the West. Because AIDS is sexually transmitted, the connection from plague to punishment is easily made. Changes brought on by AIDS Sontag claims that AIDS has created a new concept of illness, where a patient is \\"ill\\" as soon as they are infected, whether or not they have shown any symptoms. She talks of tabulating cases of disease, where before the number was based on those with demonstrated symptoms but with AIDS is as almost arbitrary number. In this new vision of illness, one can lose their employment, their housing, and their place in society years before any changes in health. Also, with modern advances in medicine, society had begun to believe that epidemics and incurable illnesses were a thing of the past. The advent of AIDS proved these conclusions to be wrong. The \\"plague\\" notion was revived, but when it had been previously used to conceptualize punishment of a society, it was adapted to be a punishment visited on an individual or small group. Sontag discusses her views on the male homosexual culture prior to AIDS, saying that they had embraced the 1970s sexual culture of freedom. The view that all sexually transmitted diseases were easily curable had led to a mentality of getting what one wanted whenever one wanted it, and this was completely ended with the emergence of AIDS. Sex was suddenly viewed as a potential suicide or murder. Reception Christopher Lehmann-Haupt writes that although \\"valuable as both history and practical advice\\", the work is missing conclusions and opinions that would make it more powerful. It is \\"hard to tell what Ms. Sontag's point of view is\\", as she functions as both objective historian and attacker of views she disagrees with. Sontag doesn‚Äôt actually answer the questions of whether adapting behavior in the face of AIDS is the appropriate protection against infection, or how society should react to the epidemic. And her conclusion in the last pages, that the metaphors she is ‚Äúmost eager to see retired‚Äù are the set drawn from military vocabulary. After the many topics discussed in the work, this seems a shallow point on which to end. Paul Robinson writes that \\"the disease itself, and not the way we talk about it, is the true source of its horror,\\" and turns Sontag's point that \\"we cannot think without metaphors\\" on itself. This indicates that, instead of attempting to deconstruct these diseases entirely, we should be asking \\"whether its metaphors are well or ill chosen.\\" Literary critic Camille Paglia writes that AIDS and Its Metaphors was an attempt by Sontag to play \\"catch-up\\" after twenty years of silence about gay issues. Paglia added that although she normally disagrees with \\"the gay- activist establishment\\", in her view Sontag was \\"rightly clobbered\\" by gay activists over the work.Paglia, Camille.

It was conducted by Wendell Johnson at the University of Iowa. Graduate student Mary Tudor conducted the experiment under Johnson's supervision. Half of the children received positive speech therapy, praising the fluency of their speech, and the other half, negative speech therapy, belittling the children for speech imperfections. Many of the normal speaking orphan children who received negative therapy in the experiment suffered negative psychological effects, and some retained speech problems for the rest of their lives. It was dubbed the \\"Monster Study\\" as some of Johnson's peers were horrified that he would experiment on orphan children to confirm a hypothesis. The experiment was kept hidden for fear Johnson's reputation would be tarnished in the wake of human experiments conducted by the Nazis during World War II. Because the results of the study were never published in any peer-reviewed journal, Tudor's thesis is the only official record of the details of the experiment. The University of Iowa publicly apologized for the Monster Study in 2001. However, Patricia Zebrowski, University of Iowa assistant professor of speech pathology and audiology notes that the data that resulted from the experiment is the \\"largest collection of scientific information\\" on the phenomenon of stuttering and that Johnson's work was the first to discuss the importance of the stutterer's thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and feelings and continues to influence views on stuttering greatly. Study The research began with a selection of twenty- two subjects from a veterans' orphanage in Iowa. None were told the intent of her research, and they believed that they were there to receive speech therapy. Tudor was trying to induce stuttering in healthy children and to see whether telling stutterers that their speech was fine would produce a change. Included among the twenty-two subjects were ten orphans whom teachers and matrons had marked as stutterers before the study began. Tudor and five other graduate students who agreed to serve as judges listened to each of the children speak, graded them on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (fluent) and concurred with the school's assessment. Five were assigned to Group IA, the experimental set, and would be told that their speech was fine. The five in Group IB, the control group, would be told that their speech is \\"as bad as people say\\". The remaining 12 children were chosen at random from the population of normally fluent orphans. Six of these were assigned to IIA. These children, ranging in age from 5 to 15, were to be told that their speech was not normal at all, that they were beginning to stutter and that they must correct this immediately. The final six children in Group IIB, similar in age to those in IIA, were normal speakers who were to be treated as such and given compliments on their nice enunciation. On the first visit, Tudor tested each child's I.Q. and identified whether they were left-handed or right-handed. A popular theory at the time held that stuttering was caused by a cerebral imbalance. If, for example, a person was born left-handed but was using their right hand, their nerve impulses would misfire, affecting their speech. Johnson did not believe the theory, but still suggested Tudor test each child's handedness. She had them draw on chalkboards and squeeze the bulb of the dynamometer. Most were right-handed, but left-handed children were present in all the groups. There was no correlation between handedness and speech in the subjects. During this period, they assigned numbers to the children, such as \\"Case No 15 Experimental Group IIA...\\" The experimental period lasted from January until late May 1939, and the actual intervention consisted of Tudor driving to Davenport from Iowa City every few weeks and talking with each child for about 45 minutes. She followed an agreed-upon script. In her dissertation, she reported that she talked to the stuttering youngsters who were going to be told that they did not stutter. She said to them, in part, \\"You'll outgrow [the stuttering], and you will be able to speak even much better than you are speaking now... Pay no attention to what others say about your speaking ability for undoubtedly they do not realize that this is only a phase.\\" To the non-stuttering youngsters in IIA, who were to be branded stutterers, she said: \\"The staff has come to the conclusion that you have a great deal of trouble with your speech‚Ä¶ You have many of the symptoms of a child who is beginning to stutter. You must try to stop yourself immediately. Use your will power‚Ä¶ Do anything to keep from stuttering‚Ä¶ Don't ever speak unless you can do it right. You see how [the name of a child in the institution who stuttered severely] stutters, don't you? Well, he undoubtedly started this very same way.\\" The children in IIA responded immediately. After her second session with 5-year-old Norma Jean Pugh, Tudor wrote, \\"It was very difficult to get her to speak, although she spoke very freely the month before.\\" Another in the group, 9-year-old Betty Romp, \\"practically refuses to talk,\\" a researcher wrote in his final evaluation. \\"Held hand or arm over eyes most of the time.\\" Hazel Potter, 15, the oldest in her group, became \\"much more conscious of herself, and she talked less,\\" Tudor noted. Potter also began to interject and to snap her fingers in frustration. She was asked why she said 'a' so much. \\"Because I'm afraid I can't say the next word.\\" \\"Why did you snap your fingers?\\" \\"Because I was afraid I was going to say 'a.'\\" All the children's schoolwork fell off. One of the boys began refusing to recite in class. The other, eleven-year-old Clarence Fifer, started anxiously correcting himself. \\"He stopped and told me he was going to have trouble on words before he said them,\\" Tudor reported. She asked him how he knew. He said that the sound \\"wouldn't come out. Feels like it's stuck in there.\\" The sixth orphan, Mary Korlaske, a 12-year-old, grew withdrawn and fractious. During their sessions, Tudor asked whether her best friend knew about her 'stuttering,' Korlaske muttered, \\"No.\\" \\"Why not?\\" Korlaske shuffled her feet. \\"I hardly ever talk to her.\\" Two years later, she ran away from the orphanage and eventually ended up at the rougher Industrial School for Girls -- simultaneously escaping her human experimentation. Mary Tudor herself wasn't untouched. Three times after her experiment had officially ended she returned to the orphanage to voluntarily provide follow-up care. She told the IIA children that they didn't stutter after all. The impact, however well-meaning, was questionable. She wrote to Johnson about the orphans in a slightly defensive letter dated April 22, 1940, \\"I believe that in time they ‚Ä¶ will recover, but we certainly made a definite impression on them.\\" Criticism The results of the study were freely available in the library of the University of Iowa, but Johnson did not seek publication of the results. The experiment became national news in the wake of a series of articles conducted by an investigative reporter at the San Jose Mercury News in 2001, and a book titled Ethics: A Case Study from Fluency was written to provide an impartial scientific evaluation. The panel of authors in the book consists mostly of speech pathologists who fail to reach any consensus on either the ethical ramifications or scientific consequences of the Monster Study. Richard Schwartz concludes in Chapter 6 of the book that the Monster Study \\"was unfortunate in Tudor and Johnson's lack of regard for the potential harm to the children who participated and in their selection of institutionalized children simply because they were easily available. The deception and the apparent lack of debriefing were also not justifiable.\\" Other authors concur claiming the orphan experiment was not within the ethical boundaries of acceptable research. Others, however, felt that the ethical standards in 1939 were different from those used today. Some felt the study was poorly designed and executed by Tudor, and as a result the data offered no proof of Johnson's subsequent hypothesis that \\"stuttering begins, not in the child's mouth but in the parent's ear\\" -- i.e., that it is the well-meaning parent's effort to help the child avoid what the parent has labeled \\"stuttering\\" (but is in fact within the range of normal speech) that contributes to what ultimately becomes the problem diagnosed as stuttering. The Monster Study name may come from this negative reception. Compensation On 17 August 2007, seven of the orphan children were awarded a total of $1.2M by the State of Iowa for lifelong psychological and emotional scars caused by six months of torment during the University of Iowa experiment. The study learned that although none of the children became stutterers, some became self-conscious and reluctant to speak.Huge payout in US stuttering case - BBC News A spokesman for the University of Iowa called the experiment \\"regrettable\\" and added: \\"This is a study that should never be considered defensible in any era. In no way would I ever think of defending this study. In no way. It‚Äôs more than unfortunate.\\"Rothwell, J.D. (2003) In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication. Mayfield Pub Co. Before her death, Mary Tudor expressed deep regret about her role in the Monster Study and maintained that Wendell Johnson should have done more to reverse the negative effects on the orphan children's speech. Story origins The lawsuit was an outgrowth of a San Jose Mercury News article in 2001 conducted by an investigative reporter. The article revealed that several of the orphans had long-lasting psychological effects stemming from the experiment. The state tried unsuccessfully to have the lawsuit dismissed but in September 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court justices agreed with a lower court in rejecting the state's claim of immunity and petition for dismissal. Many of the orphans testified that they were harmed by the \\"Monster Study\\" but outside of Mary Tudor, who testified in a deposition on November 19, 2002, there were no eyewitnesses. The advanced age of the three surviving former orphans on the plaintiff's side helped expedite a settlement with the state. \\"For the plaintiffs, we hope and believe it will help provide closure relating to experiences from long ago and to memories going back almost 70 years. For all parties, it ends long-running, difficult and costly litigation that only would have run up more expenses and delayed resolution to plaintiffs who are in their seventies and eighties.\\" (DM Register) Despite the settlement, the debate remains contentious over what harm, if any, the Monster Study caused the orphan children. Nicholas Johnson, the son of the late Wendell Johnson, has vehemently defended his father. He and some speech pathologists have argued that Wendell Johnson did not intend to harm the orphan children and that none of the orphans were diagnosed as \\"stutterers\\" at the end of the experiment. Other speech pathologists have condemned the experiment and said that the orphans' speech and behavior was adversely affected by the negative conditioning they received. Letters between Mary Tudor and Wendell Johnson that were written shortly after the experiment ended showed that the children's speech had deteriorated significantly. Mary Tudor returned to the orphanage three times to try to reverse the negative effects caused by the experiment but lamented the fact that she was unable to provide enough positive therapy to reverse the deleterious effects.

Today, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association prohibits experimentation on children when there exists a significant chance of causing lasting harmful consequences.

It is located in the centre of Beijing, China, and was the Chinese imperial palace from the early- Ming dynasty in 1420 to the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, continuing to be home of the last emperor Puyi until 1924, since when it has been a museum. Built from 1406 to 1420, the palace complex has undergone many changes. After serving as the imperial palace for some five hundred years, the Forbidden City became a museum, the Palace Museum, in 1925. In 1987, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Construction and Ming Dynasty The Forbidden City as depicted in a Ming Dynasty painting The site of the Forbidden City was situated on the Imperial city during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. After the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty moved the capital from Beijing in the north to Nanjing in the south, and in 1369 ordered that the Yuan palaces be razed. His son Zhu Di was created Prince of Yan with his seat in Beijing. In 1402, Zhu Di usurped the throne and became the Yongle Emperor. He made Beijing a secondary capital of the Ming empire, and construction began in 1406 of what would become the Forbidden City.Yu (1984) p. 18 The Forbidden City's plan was designed by many architects and designers, and then it was examined by the Emperor's Ministry of Work. The chief architects and engineers include Cai Xin, Nguyen An, a Vietnamese eunuch, Kuai Xiang, Lu Xiang and others. Construction lasted 14 years and employed the work of 100,000 skilled artisans and up to a million labourers.Yang (2003) p. 15 The pillars of the most important halls were made of whole logs of precious Phoebe zhennan wood () found in the jungles of south-western China. Such a feat was not to be repeated in subsequent years ‚Äî the great pillars seen today were rebuilt using multiple pieces of pinewood in the Qing Dynasty.The only surviving large-scale hall built with whole logs of Phoebe zhennan is at Zhu Di's tomb at the Ming Tombs outside Beijing. This hall is only slightly smaller than the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City: China.org.cn: The Thirteen Ming Tombs in Beijing The grand terraces and large stone carvings were made of stone from quarries near Beijing. The larger pieces could not be transported conventionally. Instead, wells were dug along the way, and water from the wells was poured on the road in deep winter, forming a layer of ice. The stones were dragged along the ice. The floors of major halls were paved with \\"golden bricks\\" (), baked with clay from seven counties of Suzhou and Songjiang prefectures.Yu (1984) p. 21 Each batch took months to bake, resulting in smooth bricks that ring with a metallic sound. Much of the interior pavings seen today are six-century-old originals. Soil excavated during construction of the moat was piled up to the north of the palace to create an artificial hill, the Jingshan hill.Yu (1984) p. 20 Even before the palace was completed, Zhu Di moved to Beijing under the guise of \\"touring and hunting\\" (Â∑°Áã©): the administrative centre of the empire gradually shifted from Nanjing to Beijing. When the palace was completed in 1420, Zhu Di moved there and Beijing officially became the primary capital of the empire. However, scarcely nine months after their construction, the three main halls including the throne room burnt down, and it would be 23 years before they were rebuilt. From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming Dynasty. In April 1644, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng captured it, and Chongzhen, the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, hanged himself on Jingshan Hill. Li Zicheng proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun Dynasty at the Hall of Military Eminence.Yang (2003) p. 69 However, he soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui and Manchu forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.p 3734, Qing Dynasty The Kangxi Emperor returning to the Forbidden City after a tour to the south. A depiction of the Forbidden City in the German book The Garden Arbor (1853) By October 1644, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and prince regent Dorgon proclaimed the Qing Dynasty as the successor to the Ming. A ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young Shunzhi Emperor as ruler of all China. The Qing rulers largely maintained the Palace's Ming Dynasty scheme, except for the names of some of the principal buildings. The Ming Dynasty names favoured the character ji (), meaning \\"supremacy\\" or \\"extremity\\", while the new Qing names favoured names meaning \\"peace\\" and \\"harmony\\"; for example, Huangji Dian, the \\"Hall of Imperial Supremacy\\", was changed to Taihe Dian, the \\"Hall of Supreme Harmony\\". In addition, signs and name plates were made bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), and the main part of the Empress's official bedchamber, the Hall of Earthly Tranquility, became a Shamanist shrine. The Forbidden City thus became the power centre of the Qing Dynasty. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war. In 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi fled from the Forbidden City during the Boxer Rebellion, leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty powers until the following year. After being home to twenty-four emperors, fourteen of the Ming Dynasty and ten of the Qing Dynasty, the Forbidden City ceased to be the political centre of China in 1912, with the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. However, under an agreement signed between the Qing imperial house and the new Republic of China government, Puyi was allowed, in fact required, to live within the walls of the Forbidden City. Puyi and his family retained the use of the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was handed over to the Republican authorities. A museum was established in the Outer Court in 1914.Yang (2003) p. 137 After the revolution Republican troops fighting to retake the Forbidden City on July 12, 1917, after Zhang Xun's attempted imperial restoration Opposition to Puyi staying in the palace grew during the Beiyang government of the Republic of China. In 1923 Reginald Johnston, Puyi's English teacher, told Puyi about eunuchs smuggling treasures out of the palace and selling them in antique shops. Puyi ordered an audit of the palace's collections. Before it began, a fire consumed the gardens of the Palace of Establishing Prosperity (Âª∫Á¶èÂÆ´) where the bulk of the Qianlong Emperor's collection of art works was stored. In his memoir, Puyi claimed the fire was started by the eunuchs to conceal their embezzlement. This fire further fuelled public sentiments against Puyi's continued occupation of the palace. The gardens were not rebuilt until 2005. In 1924, Feng Yuxiang took control of Beijing in a coup. Denouncing the previous agreement with the Qing imperial house, Feng expelled Puyi from the Palace. On October 10, 1925 (Double Ten Day), the Palace Museum was established in the Forbidden City. The large amount of treasures and curiosities housed there were gradually catalogued and put on public display. Soon, however, the Japanese invasion of China threatened the safety of these national treasures, and they were moved out of the Forbidden City. Starting in 1933, important artefacts were packed and evacuated. They were first shipped to Nanjing and thence to Shanghai. However, the Japanese forces soon threatened Shanghai. The Executive Yuan decided to evacuate the collections to the remote west. The artifacts were split into three lots. One took the northern route towards Shaanxi. One was shipped up the Yangtze River towards Sichuan. The final lot was transported south towards Guangxi. The pace of the Japanese advance forced the artifacts to be moved quickly to escape bombing and capture, often with just hours' notice. In the end, all three collections reached the relative safety of Sichuan, where they stayed until the end of the war.See map of the evacuation routes at: Meanwhile, the Japanese army captured the Forbidden City in Beijing, but were only able to remove a few large bronze tubs and a few pieces of cannon. Most of these were recovered after the war, in Tianjin. At the end of World War II in 1945, the artifacts were moved back to Nanjing and Beijing. Remarkably, none were damaged or lost. In the late 1940s, with the Kuomintang losing the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the artifacts from the Forbidden City and the National Museum in Nanjing to be moved to Taiwan. In the event no artifacts were shipped from Beijing, but many of the best collections stored in Nanjing were shipped to Taiwan, and today form the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Under the People's Republic of China The East Glorious Gate under renovation as part of the 19-year restoration process. In 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed at Tiananmen, directly in front of the Forbidden City. Over the next two decades various proposals were made to raze or reconstruct the Forbidden City to create a public park, a transport interchange, or \\"places of entertainment\\". The Forbidden City suffered some damage during this period, including the dismantling of the throne in the Hall of Middle Harmony, the removal of name tablets from several buildings and gardens, and the demolition of some minor gates and structures. The damage peaked during the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, the Hall of Worshipping Ancestors was modified and some artifacts destroyed for an exhibition of revolutionary mud sculptures. However, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai intervened by sending an army battalion to guard the city. These troops also prevented ransacking by the Red Guards who were swept up in the storm to demolish the \\"Four Olds\\". From 1966 to 1971, all gates to the Forbidden City were sealed, saving it from more destruction. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO as the \\"Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\\",The Forbidden City was listed as the \\"Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\\" (UNESCO World Heritage Official Document). In 2004, Mukden Palace in Shenyang was added as an extension item to the property, which then became known as \\"Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang\\": due to its significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture. Present Tourists inside the Palace Museum Currently, the Palace Museum is responsible for the preservation and restoration of the Forbidden City. Building heights around the Forbidden City are restricted. In 2005, a sixteen- year restoration project was started to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre-1912 state. This is the largest restoration of the Forbidden City undertaken in two centuries, and involves progressively closing off sections of the Forbidden City for assessment, repairs, and restoration. Also as part of the project, some derelict or destroyed sections are being rebuilt. The gardens of the Palace of Establishing Prosperity, destroyed by fire in 1923, were rebuilt in 2005, but remain closed to the public. The interior was also designed in a different style, and the buildings are used by visiting dignitaries. A alt=An area enclosed on three sides by red walls in traditional Chinese architectural style.

In the middle are tables, and at the right foreground is an ice cream cart and a red umbrella While effort has been made to prevent the commercialisation of the palace, a variety of commercial enterprises exist, such as souvenir shops and photography stands. These commercial enterprises often rouse controversy. A Starbucks store, which opened in 2000, sparked objections and eventually closed on July 13, 2007. Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in 2006. According to the reports, the purpose was to preserve an atmosphere where foreigners could be victims of price gouging. The Palace Museum promised to investigate the matter. Some commentators, such as influential Phoenix TV host Luqiu Luwei, have further questioned the whole practice of renting out premises in the Forbidden City as retail space.; see also the original blog post here (in Chinese). In 2005, IBM Corporation and the Palace Museum announced a joint project to build a World Wide Web-based virtual model of the Forbidden City and associated sites in Beijing. The online cultural heritage project, titled The Forbidden City: Beyond Space and Time, is presented in both English and Chinese, and provides interactive, three-dimensional, representations of Forbidden City structures and cultural artifacts. The virtual Forbidden City consists of some 800 buildings, and launched in October of 2008.

The history of cellular phone technology began in December 1947 with a Bell Labs internal report in which Rae Young suggested the hexagonal cell concept for a cellular mobile telephone system. W. Rae Young, 2006 Career Young graduated from the University of Michigan in 1937 with a B.S. degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, Young began working at Bell Labs in what became his lifetime employment. Young did research and development for Bell Labs in the fields of radar, television, communication systems, and top-secret military systems. Young lived and worked in New York City for many years until he and his family moved to Summit, New Jersey from which he commuted by train to New York City. During 1942-1945 Young worked on radar and communication systems for the US Armed Services. In 1945 Young began work on mobile radiotelephone systems in vehicles for coverage of urban areas and along highways. He developed systems for reducing interference between mobile systems that are closely spaced in frequency and location. Young served as chairman of a Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) subcommittee TR8.9 on systems standards for mobile communications equipment. In 1947, W. Rae Young proposed what are now called cell phones in a report to the RMA Systems Committee.page 3 of D. H. Ring's report Coworker Douglas H. Ring at Bell Labs, liked Young's idea about locating many mobile phone towers in a hexagonal cellular arrangement throughout each city so that every mobile phone user would be able to communicate from at least one cell through the telephone system. Douglas Ring credited W. Rae Young with suggesting the hexagonal cell layout and expanded on Rae Young's concept in another internal Technical Memo dated 11 December 1947. In 1951 Young was appointed Supervisor of the cellular systems engineering team and later became department head of cellular mobile phone development at Bell Labs. In the 1950s Young was transferred to another Bell Labs facility at Murray Hill, New Jersey where he worked on communications systems and formulated requirements for design of telephone switching systems and data-transmission systems. In 1962 he was transferred to another Bell Labs facility at Holmdel, New Jersey. In 1964 W. Rae Young was made an IEEE Fellow \\"for contributions to mobile radio and data communications systems\\". After working for Bell Labs for 47 years, he retired in June 1979. Family Rae Young Jr. was born in Lawton, Michigan, a small rural town. He was the eldest of 4 children: 3 boys and a girl. Rae's father William Rae Young Sr. was a medical doctor. Rae's mother Elizabeth Emerson was also college educated and was descended from the Ralph Waldo Emerson family. In February, 1937 Rae Young Jr. married Mary Lou Traywick (1915‚Äì1975) during their senior year at the University of Michigan. They had three children: Roy, Susan, and Barbara, each of whom earned a doctorate degree. Rae Young Jr. played piano, clarinet, cello, and bass with the Summit Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and the Monmouth Symphony Orchestra for over 40 years. Rae's wife Mary Lou died from cancer just before her 60th birthday. In 1980 Rae met a widow Betty Wood, a retired crystallographer from Bell Labs.

Despite appeals to racial hatred, black and white workers remained united. The general strike ended on November 12, with unions gaining most of their original demands. The strike =The Triple alliance= Early in 1892, streetcar conductors in New Orleans won a shorter workday and the preferential closed shop. This victory drove many New Orleans workers to seek assistance from the American Federation of Labor (AFL). As many as 30 new labor unions had been organized in the city before the summer of 1892. By late summer, 49 unions belonged to the AFL. The unions established a central labor council known as the Workingmen's Amalgamated Council that represented more than 30,000 workers. Three racially integrated unions‚Äîthe Teamsters, the Scalesmen, and the Packers‚Äîmade up what came to be called the \\"Triple Alliance.\\" Many of the workers belonging to the unions of the Triple Alliance were African American.Brown and Allen, Strong In the Struggle: My Life As a Black Labor Activist, 2001. left On October 24, 1892, between 2,000 and 3,000 members of the Triple Alliance struck to win a 10-hour work day, overtime pay, and the preferential union shop. The Amalgamated Council wholeheartedly supported them. The New Orleans Board of Trade, representing financial and commercial interests, appointed a committee to make decisions for the employers. The four main railways that served the city and the large cotton, sugar and rice commodity exchanges pledged their support for the Board of Trade. They helped raise a defense fund and asked the state governor to send in the militia to help break the strike. No negotiations took place during the first week. Employers utilized race-based appeals to try to divide the workers and turn the public against the strikers. The board of trade announced it would sign contracts agreeing to the terms‚Äîbut only with the white-dominated Scalesmen and Packers unions. The Board of Trade refused to sign any contract with the black-dominated Teamsters. The Board of Trade and the city's newspapers also began a campaign designed to create public hysteria. The newspapers ran lurid accounts of \\"mobs of brutal Negro strikers\\" rampaging through the streets, of African American unionists \\"beating up all who attempted to interfere with them,\\" and repeated accounts of crowds of blacks assaulting lone white men and women.Quoted in Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 2: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism, 1955, p. 202. The striking workers refused to break ranks along racial lines. Large majorities of the Scalesmen and Packers unions passed resolutions affirming their commitment to stay out until the employers had signed a contract with the Teamsters on the same terms offered to other unions. =The general strike= Members of other unions began to call for a general strike to support the Triple Alliance. A number of meetings were held, during which sentiment proved so strong that a majority of the unions belonging to the Amalgamated Council voted in favor of a resolution calling for a general strike. A Committee of Five was formed to lead the general strike. Its members included the Cotton Screwmen's Union, the Cotton Yardmen's Union, the Printers, the Boiler Makers, and the Car Driver's Union.Cook, \\"The Typographical Union and the New Orleans General Strike of 1892,\\" Louisiana History, 1983; \\"Labor Trouble In New-Orleans,\\" New York Times, November 5, 1892. upright Union pressure increased and a call for a general strike arose. Under the threat, some employers not party to the original dispute broke and pressed the board for negotiations. A tentative agreement collapsed and the Workingman's Council again called for a general strike, which began on November 8 after two postponements. Each of the 46 unions which joined the strike demanded the union shop and recognition of their union. Some also asked for shorter work-days or higher pay. Around 30,000 union members‚Äîhalf the city's workforce and virtually all its unionized workers‚Äîstruck. Streetcars stopped running. Recently organized utility workers, against the demands of the governor and the advice of the labor committee, joined the strike. The city's supply of natural gas failed on November 8, as did the electrical grid, and the city was plunged into darkness. The delivery of food and beverages immediately ceased, generating alarm among city residents. Construction, printing, street cleaning, manufacturing and even fire-fighting services ground to a halt.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 2: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism, 1955.\\"New Orleans' Big Strike,\\" Washington Post, November 8, 1892. On November 9, the press intensified their appeals to racial hatred. The New Orleans Times-Democrat declared that African American strikers wanted to \\"take over the city\\" (a veiled reference to black sexual assaults on white women) and that white women and children were already being harassed by black strikers.Rosenberg, New Orleans Dockworkers: Race, Labor, and Unionism, 1892‚Äì1923, 1988. But the press' appeal to racial hatred failed. Violent incidents never occurred, and picket lines were so quiet that the Board of Trade sent men into the streets to try to find evidence of any physical intimidation whatsoever.\\"The New-Orleans Strike,\\" New York Times, November 9, 1892. The employers, with assistance from the railroads, brought strikebreakers in from Galveston and Memphis. But when a call by the mayor for special deputies turned up only 59 volunteers, the employers began training their own clerks and managers for riot duty, offering to pay any costs for a state militia call-up. The mayor issued a proclamation forbidding public gatherings, essentially declaring martial law. Although the city was quiet, the Board of Trade convinced the racist Democratic Governor, Murphy J. Foster, to send in the state militia on November 10. But instead of a city under siege, militia leaders found the city calm and orderly. Governor Foster was forced to withdraw the militia on November 11. The strength of the strike was reflected in the decline of bank clearings in New Orleans to half their pre- strike levels. =The settlement= The Board of Trade agreed to binding arbitration to settle the strike. Although they balked at first, the employers agreed to sit down with both white and black union leaders. After 48 hours of negotiations, the employers agreed to the 10-hour day and overtime pay, but not the union shop, nor would they grant recognition to the unions of the Triple Alliance. Other unions also won reduced hours and higher pay. Aftermath The Board of Trade was deeply angered by its humiliation during the general strike. On November 13, 1892, the Board of Trade induced a federal prosecutor to file suit in federal court against 44 of the unions belonging to the Amalgamated Council. The federal government accused the unions of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by engaging in a conspiracy to restrain trade and 45 strike leaders were indicted in federal court for violating the act. A district court granted a temporary injunction against the unions. The AFL appealed the case. The injunction was stayed, and the suit delayed for several years. The federal government quietly withdrew its suit several years later.\\"Conspiring Against Commerce,\\" New York Times, December 10, 1892. The 1892 general strike helped strengthen the labor movement in New Orleans. Most existing unions gained substantial numbers of members. Three new unions formed during the general strike and affiliated with the Amalgamated Council. Varying assessments upright=1 At the time, the 1892 general strike was considered a success, demonstrating that black and white workers could maintain solidarity in the Deep South. The strikers had avoided violence, won most of their demands, avoided military repression, and succeeded in overcoming racial hatred. Samuel Gompers declared: However, subsequent analyses declared the strike a failure, and that unions had \\"sold out\\" workers because the unions failed to win the union shop.Shugg, \\"The New Orleans General Strike of 1892,\\" Louisiana Historical Quarterly, April 1938. Just a month later, The New York Times editorialized: \\"Labor's Defeat In New-Orleans; The Victory of the Employers Complete.\\"\\"Labor's Defeat In New-Orleans,\\" New York Times, December 12, 1892. Many histories written in the next 40 years suggested that the strike's \\"massive\\" failure led the AFL to reject general strikes absolutely thereafter and remain intensely hostile even to limited strikes. More recently, however, historians have reassessed the strike's success. Declared one historian, \\"The failure of the strikers to win a preferential union shop did not detract from the significance of the struggle.\\"Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 2: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism, 1955, p. 203. The success of the workers in overcoming racial divisions in one of the major cities of the Deep South is notable (and would rarely be achieved again until the 1960s), as is the unification of skilled and unskilled worker.

Geography  It is one of an island group just south of Luss. Only a short stretch of water separates it from the island of Inchcruin. The connection between Inchcruin and Inchmoan is very shallow, only a foot or two, and it is possible to wade between the islands.Worsley, Harry Loch Lomond: The Loch, the Lairds and the Legends Lindsay Publications (Glasgow) 1988 Inchmoan is known for its large sandy beaches, and is low lying, and marshy. Wilson, Rev. John The Gazetteer of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1882) Published by W. & A.K. Johnstone There are shingle beaches on either side of the island, meaning that on a sunny day, at least one is sheltered. For this reason and others, it is popular with campers and picnickers. The island was once owned by the Colquhouns of Luss, and now owned by Luss Estates. A large 2 storey ruin stands at the western point but no record exists of any occupants. The name of the island stems from its use by the Luss people as a source of Peat fuel for the village fires. The beaches and bays are sandy and comparatively safe for bathing but the interior is, in places, totally impassable due to the dense growth of rhododendrons, gorse and other spreading trees. Privately owned, 1 mile long, highest point about 30 ft. The island was used for peat fuel for nearby Lusshttp://www.loch- lomond.net/islands/inchmoan.html Loch Lomond net.Garnett, T. (1800).

Boulston Manor was occupied from the 15th to 18th centuries by the Wogan family. When the estate was sold in 1797 the new owner, Major Dudley Acland, abandoned the old site, and built Boulston Lodge (now re-named Boulston Manor) a short distance to the northwest, described by the Royal Commission.

Founding of Landesa Rural Development Institute In the 1960s, Prosterman was working as an associate attorney on Wall Street at Sullivan & Cromwell (where he stayed for six years before taking a job to teach in 1965), but was troubled by the escalating Vietnam War as thousands of impoverished rural farmers desperate to feed their families joined the Viet Cong. Prosterman realized that giving poor farmers land rights to the land they were farming would transform the lives of these families, the country, and ultimately the world. It was just an idea. Before he knew it, Prosterman was standing in a rice paddy in the midst of the Vietnam War testing his idea through legislation‚Äîthe Land to the Tiller program. That legislation gave land rights to one million tenant farmers, allowed them to feed their families, cut Viet Cong recruitment by 80%, and increased rice production in the country by 30%.Prosterman, Roy Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: The Tables Turn It was also the birth of the Rural Development Institute (RDI), now called Landesa, an international nonprofit organization working to secure land rights for the world's poorest. Today, 50 years after Prosterman stood in the rice paddies of South Vietnam, Landesa has worked in 50 countries throughout the world to secure land rights for more than 400,000,000 people. Prosterman, now Chair Emeritus of Landesa, has helped Landesa grow into a global organization with field offices in China, India, Myanmar, and Tanzania.

This extension adds connectives specifically designed for combining simple actions into complex transactions and for providing control over their execution. The logic has a natural model theory and a sound and complete proof theory. Transaction Logic has a Horn clause subset, which has a procedural as well as a declarative semantics. The important features of the logic include hypothetical and committed updates, dynamic constraints on transaction execution, non-determinism, and bulk updates. In this way, Transaction Logic is able to declaratively capture a number of non-logical phenomena, including procedural knowledge in artificial intelligence, active databases, and methods with side effects in object databases. Transaction Logic was originally proposed in A.J. Bonner and M. Kifer (1993), Transaction Logic Programming, International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP), 1993. by Anthony Bonner and Michael Kifer and later described in more detail in A.J. Bonner and M.

Before the arrival of Leclerc, Louverture had ordered Maurepas to make the most vigorous resistance to all vessels which should appear before Port-de-Paix, and, in case he was not strong enough (having only half of a brigade), burn the city to the ground and afterward withdraw to the mountain, take with him ammunition of all kinds; there to defend himself to the death. On February 12, 1802, suspecting the French expedition was about to land in the city, Maurepas burned the city down and retreated to a nearby mountain named Les Trois Pavillons. When French General Humbert arrived, he saw the city in flames. On February 13, Humbert marched against Maurepas, but was completely defeated. When Charles Leclerc heard this terrible news, he sent by sea General Debelle against Maurepas, who defeated Debelle's army. However, Maurepas, instead of continuing to fight, surrendered to the French. General Leclerc integrated him in the French army as he had promised and placed him under the authority of a general named Brunett who was in command of Port-de-Paix. After being suspected of taking part in a revolt led by Colonel Fran√ßois Capois (Capois-la-Mort), he, his family, and some of the soldiers were arrested by Brunett and brought to Cap-Fran√ßais (now Cap- Ha√Øtien). On November 17, Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais, and, by his order, Maurepas with some of his troops of the 9th Brigade and his family were tortured and cast into the sea.

It is located on a river crossover (Horton Mill Road) to Ebell Road and Covered Bridge Circle off State Route 75 about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north of the city of Oneonta. Coordinates are (34.007644, -86.448625). Built in 1934, the 220-foot (67-meter) bridge is a Town Lattice truss construction over two spans. Its WGCB number is 01-05-07. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 29, 1970, the first covered bridge in the southeastern United States to be added. At 70 feet (21 m), it is the highest covered bridge above any U.S. waterway. It was reopened on March 11, 2013 after being closed in 2007 due to vandalism. The bridge is currently open to motor vehicle traffic. However, there is only one lane and the posted speed limit is 5 MPH. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge is maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission, Blount County Commission and the Alabama Department of Transportation. History The original Horton Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1894 at the foot of Sand Mountain, about 3/4 mile (1 kilometer) downstream from the current bridge. It was named for a local business owned by Thurman M. Horton, who helped construct the first bridge. This bridge allowed residents of Sand Mountain a better means of access to nearby Oneonta as well as to Horton's mill and general store which were located along the east side of the Calvert Prong. Construction of the current Horton Mill Covered Bridge began in 1934 over a deep gorge cut by the river, led by Talmedge Horton, a family descendant of Thurman Horton. It took a 15-man crew 1¬Ω years to complete the project. This crew included foreman Zelma C. Tidwell, who helped in building three other prominent covered bridges in Blount County (Easley, Nectar, Swann). The bridge was fully restored in 1974 by the Alabama Historical Commission and the Blount County Commission. It is one of three historic covered bridges remaining in Blount County. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge was reported closed to motor vehicle traffic on September 27, 2007 due to unsafe conditions. According to a member on the photo website Flickr as well as a report from the Blount Countian, vandals attempted to remove some of the roof supports on the west side of the bridge by tying a cable or chain around them and attached the other end to either a tow hitch or hook...using a vehicle to try to pull them out, causing significant damage. A photo showing the damaged end of the Horton Mill Covered Bridge can be seen by clicking the reference link to Flickr below. The other two historic covered bridges remaining in Blount County, Easley and Swann, were closed to motor vehicle traffic in 2009 for unsafe conditions after routine inspections. Restoration of all three covered bridges began in late 2011 starting with the Swann Covered Bridge near Cleveland, Alabama. Money for these projects primarily came from the federal National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program as well as transportation enhancement funds. The $469,110 construction contract was awarded to Bob Smith Construction of Trussville, Alabama. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge would be the last to be restored due to its high elevation above the river which made things more challenging. Wooden structural pieces were repaired or replaced as needed and new tin roofs were put on all three bridges in order to keep the weather off vital supporting timbers. Total restoration costs for the covered bridges was approximately $540,000. The difference was covered by county expenditures. Following necessary repairs and upgrades, the Horton Mill Covered Bridge was reopened to motor vehicle traffic on March 11, 2013. In late 2015, cameras were installed at the three remaining covered bridges in Blount County to help deter vandalism after graffiti was found on the Easley Covered Bridge a year earlier.ABC Channel 33/40, Cameras installed at 3 Blount County covered bridges by Alisa Long, October 5, 2015, Retrieved Jan. 30, 2016.

She was responsible for delivering goods and equipment to locations in the war zone.  Service career  Kopara (AK-62) was built in 1938 by Henry Robb Limited of Leith, Scotland. She was purchased in early August 1942 from her owner, Richardson & Co., Napier, New Zealand, through the New Zealand Government; and commissioned 21 September 1942 at Auckland, Lt. (j.g.) H. R. Greeley in command. Reclassified as AG-50 on 23 September, Kopara departed Auckland 5 October for supply runs from Noumea, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, to Guadalcanal and Tulagi, Solomons. Arriving Noumea 9 October, she steamed on the 14th for Espiritu Santo to take on board supplies for the embattled American force on Guadalcanal. Loaded with torpedoes and general cargo and escorted by Nicholas (DD-449), she departed 19 October. Kopara arrived Lunga Roads during midwatch 22 October and began unloading operations which were completed that evening despite harassing gunfire from enemy shore batteries and a noon attack by Japanese dive bombers. Protected by Nicholas, Kopara departed Guadalcanal undamaged and returned to Noumea 27 October. During the next few months, Kopara continued supply runs to the Solomons; and, while she unloaded at Guadalcanal and Tulagi 13 through 15 November, American battleships, cruisers, and destroyers fought the enemy in two fierce night naval battles off Savo Island. From 20 February to 26 June 1943, she carried cargo along the sea lanes between Auckland, Noumea, Efate, and Espiritu Santo. And from 11 July to 17 September she shuttled supplies between New Zealand and Norfolk Island. After a voyage to the New Hebrides, Kopara departed Noumea 10 November to resume supply duty in the Solomons. She reached New Georgia 16 November; and, for almost 8 months, ranged the waters of Melanesia from Bougainville to New Caledonia bringing supplies to forces which loosened the enemy's hold on the Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea. Returning to New Caledonia 7 August 1944, she began supply runs eastward out of Noumea. Between 10 August and 21 December she made four voyages to Fiji, American Samoa, and the Ellice Islands. She departed Noumea 24 December and steamed via Norfolk Island to Auckland 3 January 1945. Kopara decommissioned 12 January and was turned over to the New Zealand Joint Purchasing Board for return to her previous owner, Richardson & Company, Napier. Kopara operated under several names after World War II including SS Sarang in 1966, SS Cherry Chepat in 1970, and SS See Hai Hong in January 1987. Final Disposition: broken up in 1987.

The CNH District is the largest district in Key Club International, with nearly 45,500 members. It was in Sacramento, California where Key Club was first founded in 1925. The CNH mascot is the \\"Bee.\\" Currently, the district consists of 75 divisions spread throughout the three states. History In 1924, Sacramento High School in Sacramento, California was in trouble. Destructive clubs and fraternities, although outlawed, moved underground and continued to exercise a negative influence on the student population. Educators and community leaders feared these detrimental effects and sought some means of replacing the clubs with wholesome youth activities. The principal and a faculty member thought that what the school needed was an organization of students that discouraged delinquency by its example. Mr. Vincent asked the local Kiwanis Club for help and, together, they decided to pattern the new group after Kiwanis. The idea of a junior service club similar to Kiwanis was presented to the school in 1924, but it was not put into practice until eleven students signed a petition on March 25, 1925 which was sent to the Kiwanis International office with a request to be chartered as a Junior Kiwanis Club. By the time the charter was granted and the club held its first meeting, the membership had grown to twenty-five members. Through this group, Kiwanis hoped to provide vocational guidance to the students of the entire school. The club became known as the Key Club because of the positive influence of these key students who held luncheon meetings each week to which Kiwanians came as guest speakers. Key Club members also attended Kiwanis meetings, thus bringing these young men into constant contact with the business and professional men of the community. As the experience of the Key Club grew, the club became a complete service organization open to the whole school. A social program was offered to balance its service activities. Over the following years, Key Club went through a period of expansion by word-of-mouth. Other communities throughout the United States started Key Clubs patterned after the one in Sacramento High School. By 1939, about fifty Key Clubs were chartered, many of them in the Southern United States. CNH CyberKey Emblem. The first five clubs officially chartered by Key Club International were those of Sacramento, Monterrey, Oakland Technical, Hemet, and Stockton (now Edison) High Schools. Since Key Club was growing in the area of its birth, and a few clubs existed in neighboring Nevada, by 1947 it was decided that a district should be formed. The first step was to hold a conference in San Diego in October to which all the California Key Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs were invited. A full slate of officers was elected and a set of district bylaws and a constitution were adopted. John Cooper of Oakland Technical High School was the first district governor of the Cali-Nev District. The first official district convention was held in Oakland in March 1948; it was attended by eighty members representing the 23 recognized district Key Clubs. With the chartering of the McKinley High School Key Club in 1952, the district became Cali-Nev-Ha. The first edition of the Cali-Nev-Ha Key appeared on May 1, 1954. The advent of the new millennium saw the Cali-Nev-Ha Key Club District grow to over 500 clubs with nearly 29,000 members. It continues to grow. As of May, 2012, membership neared 45,500. Organization The California-Nevada-Hawaii District is divided into three main levels of governance: district, division, and club. Divisions are placed into regions, groups of neighboring divisions who are partnered together as an alliance for service within their borders. The highest recognized position is the district governor with the lowest ranking being the club bulletin editor. Key Club also adopts the inverted pyramid, in which the members are the highest governing body, while the district board and international are the lowest. =The District Board= The CNH Board is similar to all other Key Club International District boards. A total of five board meetings, (initial district convention, spring board, summer board, winter board, and concluding district convention), are held during the Key Club term of one year. The initial assembly of the district board at the initiating district convention is primarily used as a transitional/training conference for the elected lieutenant governors.

District and Governor's Project District Project A specific project focus selected every other year by the District Project committee made up of members of the District Board. The current District Project (Project Jumpstart) covers the years 2012-2014. Clubs in the California-Nevada-Hawaii District come up with projects that encompass this District focus. Clubs do these projects throughout the year. The District has certain District Project weeks during the year that clubs throughout the district concentrate on certain aspects of the District project. Governor's Project Bee Clean, CNH! was a 2-year long (2017‚Äì2019) Governor's Project. Clubs throughout the California-Nevada-Hawaii District were asked to dedicate at least one service event per month to improving the environment. District cheers and spirit Spirit tradition in the district primarily revolves around the \\"How Do You Feel\\", Cheer in which a Key Clubber asks another Key Clubber or group of Key Clubbers how they feel, the targets then respond with the cheers answer. Nevada Key Clubbers are known to respond with an \\"Unga\\" instead of an \\"Abooga\\" while the Kiwins answer with an \\"Awooga\\". The \\"We've got Spirit\\" Cheer has a universal usage while all other cheers are rarely used as competitive cheers other than at Key Club International Convention. Division often mark their own unique cheers and battle cries to be used against one another at major district events. =How Do You Feel?= We feel good! Oh! We feel so good! We feel fine! All of the time! Abooga! Abooga! Abooga, Booga, Booga! (Throw your fist over your head during \\"Abooga\\" and turn in a circle) =How Do You Feel? (Remix, many variations)= Hold up! Wait a minute! Let me put some booty in it! Ugh! Some booty! Ugh! Ugh! Some booty! =We Got Spirit (against other Key Clubbers)= We've got spirit... Yes we do! We've got spirit... How 'Bout you!?!? We've got spirit... Yes we do! We've got spirit... How 'Bout you!?!? (repeat twice) =Cali-Nev-Ha Cheer= Cali-Nev-Ha! Cali- Nev-Ha! Abooga, booga, booga! Ha, Ha, Ha! (Throw your fist over your head) (Repeat 3x, each time louder) =CNH Rap= From the east to the west! You Know We're the best! We're the district with the sting! And that's why we sing! We're the bees buzz buzz! We're the bees buzz buzz! It's all about the party hardy! CNH Bees! Rallies CNH Fall Rally South 2008 session 3 The CNH fall rally is a fundraiser and the largest gathering of Key Clubbers held during the district year. Because of the district's geographic size, two fall rallies are held each year in order to allow for greater ease of attendance. Fall Rally North, held in late October, is currently held in Northern California at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. Fall Rally South, held in mid- November, is held in Southern California at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Thousands of members gather at each of the two theme parks. Because of the sheer number of Key Clubbers at Fall Rally South, the rally is divided into four sessions, with divisions being assigned to specific rally times. At both fall rallies, all district board members (executive officers, appointed board members, and lieutenant governors) are \\"auctioned\\" off to divisions. The winning division is then able to spend a designated period of time with the \\"purchased\\" officer. Funds and ticket sales for both events go toward Pediatric Trauma Program and Pediatric Emergency Medicine programs at the partner hospitals in Oakland, San Diego, Loma Linda, Madera, Honolulu and Reno. In 2009-2010, the fall rallies generated over $120,000, more than double of the previous year. District convention The district convention is held each year in March or April, the conclusion of the CNH Key Club year. This convention is held in celebration of the accomplishments of the individual Key Clubber as well as the clubs, divisions and District's achievements. A convention center has been required to host the assembly of massive amounts members at the general sessions, the location of the convention center alternates each year between Northern and Southern California. Workshops are hosted throughout a three-day period covering training and service project information for elected officers to member centered meet and greets and motivational seminars. The Policies International and Elections Committee oversees the election process of the new District Executive Officers and International Officer Candidates. Caucuses are held to allow the members of the District to hear candidate's platforms and ask questions. A House of Delegates assembles with two representatives from every club in the district to vote. The results of the election are announced Saturday night at the general session.

It broadcasts on the AM band, at a frequency of 1089 kHz. The station is part of the Ace Radio network. History The station opened on 11 September 1933 as 3HS Horsham.Walker, R.R., The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia, 1973, The Hawthorn Press, MelbourneGriffen-Foley, Bridget, Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio, UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney On 16 May 1936 the station was taken over by 3DB a subsidiary of The Herald and Weekly Times, Melbourne. Then, on 24 December 1936, the call sign was changed to 3LK and, at this time, the Horsham studios and transmitter were closed with the transmitter being relocated to the small village of Lubeck, hence the 3LK call sign. (Lubeck currently has a population of about 140, but it would have been bigger when a few 3LK technicians lived there with their families and, importantly, when Lubeck was a railway junction for the branch line to Rupanyup). 3LK did not have a local Wimmera studio, and the vast majority of its programming was relayed from 3DB. There was, however, about one or two hours per day of local programming, which came from the 3LK studio in the 3DB Melbourne building, utilising 3DB announcing staff.various radio magazines in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne 3LK supported numerous local Wimmera/Mallee events and charities. The slogan used for all 3DB/3LK programming during most of this era was: 3DB Melbourne, 3LK Central Victoria, the Herald-Sun stations, but towards the end of the DB/LK partnership this was modified to the more logical: 3DB Melbourne, 3LK Wimmera Mallee, the Herald- Sun stations. The Herald and Weekly Times sold 3LK on 1 February 1972Carty, Bruce, On the Air: Australian Radio History, privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W. and its studios and transmitter were again moved to Horsham. In 1977 there was yet another name change when 3LK Horsham became 3WM Wimmera Mallee, broadcasting from Horsham. Current Programming Currently, 3WM takes much of its programming from 3AW Melbourne. 3WM's sister station, also a member of the Ace Radio network, is Mixx FM Wimmera Mallee. Mixx FM broadcasts on three different channels from transmitters placed in geographically diverse parts of the Wimmera Mallee: 101.3 MHz from Horsham, 94.5 MHz from Lawloit (near Nhill) and 98.5 MHz from Ararat.

In half the cases, the killer lastly kills themselves in a murder-suicide. If only the parents are killed, the case may also be referred to as a parricide. Where all members of a family are killed, the crime may be referred to as family annihilation. Familicide of others Familicides were used as an enhanced punishment in antiquity. In ancient China, the \\"nine familial exterminations\\" was the killing of an entire extended family or clan, usually for treason. Machiavelli advocated the extermination of a previous ruler's family to prevent uprisings in The Prince. Sippenhaft was used in Nazi Germany to punish and sometimes execute the relatives of defectors and anyone involved in the 20 July plot. La Cosa Nostra began killing the relatives, including women and more recently children, of informants (pentiti) and rivals in the 1980s. It is not incorporated formally into any modern judicial systems, except in North Korea, where whole-family internment at Kaechon internment camp often ends in death. Family annihilation =Definition and statistics= Between 1900 and 2000, there were 909 victims of mass murder in the US (defined as 4 victims within a 24-hour period). Of those, more than half occurred within an immediate family. Although the familicide cases are relatively rare, they are the most common form of mass killings. However, statistical data are difficult to establish due to reporting discrepancies.Berton, Justin. Familicide: Experts say family murder-suicides, though rare, are most common mass killing. San Francisco Examiner, June 20, 2007 Familicide differs from other forms of mass murder in that the murderer kills family members or loved ones rather than anonymous people. This has a different psychodynamic and psychiatric significance, but the distinction is not always made.Malmquist, Carl P., MD. Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing, 1996, A study of 30 cases in Ohio found that most of the killings were motivated by a parent's desire to stop their children's suffering. According to ABC News contributor and former FBI agent Brad Garrett, people responsible for killing their families tend to be white males in their 30s. Many of these crimes occur in August, before school starts, which may delay detection and investigation. In Australia, a study was done of seven cases of familicide followed by suicide in which marital separation followed by custody and access disputes were identified as an issue. Some common factors such as marital discord, unhappiness, domestic violence, sexual abuse, threats of harm to self or others were found in varying degrees. It was not clear what could be done in terms of prevention.Johnson, Carolyn. Familicide and Custody Disputes ‚Äì Dispelling The Myths. University of Western Australia, FamilicideAbstract_CarolynJohnson.pdf The Director of the Birmingham City University Centre of Applied Criminology, David Wilson, co-wrote a study with two others, \\"A taxonomy of male British family annihilators, 1980‚Äì2013\\", examining British familicides in the period. Newspaper articles were used as references. The study concluded that most of the perpetrators were male. Men who murder their entire families usually do so because they believe their spouse did a wrongdoing and that the spouse needs to be punished, they feel that the family members caused a disappointment, they feel that their own financial failings ruined the point of having a family, and because they wish to save their family from a perceived threat. Far fewer women commit familicide, and those who do usually have different reasons. A literature review done in 2018 noted contextual and offense characteristics of familicide. Among the 63 articles reviewed 74‚Äì85% noted relationship problems or separation. This article also found evidence of financial problems, intoxication, and use of firearms. This literature review unveiled that 71% of these offenses were motivated in regard to conflict between parents and 29% associated to the perpetrators' situation in life. Lastly this article reported two studies, one of which found that many of the motives involved feelings of abandonment, psychosis, and narcissistic rage. The other study found that 60% of these perpetrators were suicidal and 40% homicidal. =Narrative= The internal logic for family annihilation can stem from a number of sources. David Wilson of Birmingham City University has divided these cases into four groups: anomic, disappointed, self-righteous and paranoid. In this typology, the anomic killer sees his family purely as a status symbol; when his economic status collapses, he sees them as surplus to requirements. The disappointed killer seeks to punish the family for not living up to his ideals of family life. The self-righteous killer destroys the family to exact revenge upon the mother, in an act that he blames on her. Finally, the paranoid killer kills their family in what they imagine to be an attempt to protect them from something even worse.

Having been born in Munich, Germany, and moved to New York City in 1896, Viereck graduated from the College of the City of New York and directly entered the world of publishing.  Background  Viereck outspokenly supported the German cause at the outset of World War I, and his poetry reflected his pro-German zeal. Drawing on experience gained while working on his father's German-language monthly, Der deutsche Vork√§mpfer (The German Pioneer), later called Rundschau Zweier Welten (Review of Two Worlds), the younger Viereck now channeled his German sympathies into his own publication. He founded The Fatherland in August 1914, a weekly publication in English that reached a circulation of 75,000, by some estimates, and 100,000 by others,Keller, Phyllis. ‚ÄúGeorge Sylvester Viereck: The Psychology of a German-American Militant.‚Äù Journal of Interdisciplinary History 2:1 (Summer 1971). 59-108. to promote American neutrality in the war and give voice to German support. The Fatherland was advertised on the cover of its first issues as a magazine devoted to ‚ÄúFair Play for Germany and Austria-Hungary.‚Äù Three German-American banker friends helped Viereck with the fifty dollars needed to start up The Fatherland. The first edition of ten thousand copies sold out quickly in New York. The publication grew to thirty employees almost immediately and ‚Äútook upon itself the task of exposing the malfeasance of the Allied countries, of revealing the prejudices and distortions of the American press, and of rallying German- Americans in their own defense.‚Äù The weekly received part of its funding from a German propaganda cabinet set up in New York Society, with which Viereck worked closely. One of the contributors to The Fatherland was Aleister Crowley. Viereck was accused by the New York World of receiving German subsidies for propaganda purposes, but the Department of Justice was unable to prosecute. Still, Viereck faced social censure, being driven from his house by a lynch mob and expelled from the Authors League as well as the Poetry Society of America. Surely, Viereck‚Äôs personal circumstances affected the publication life and reception of The Fatherland.

He made 20 league appearances in both the 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87 seasons, but endured the disappointment of Villa's relegation in 1987 and made just two appearances the following season as they were promoted. He did not form part of Villa's return to the First Division, as he was transferred to Third Division Notts County. He helped the Magpies reach the First Division in 1991 following back-to-back promotions (both via the playoffs) but once again he dropped down two divisions, this time signing for a Hull City side who had just fallen into the Third Division. He spent three years at Boothferry Park before beginning a two-year spell in the league's lowest division with Northampton Town in 1994. He signed for Hereford United in 1996, but had to endure the disappointment of relegation from the Football League the following year and he retired soon afterwards due to injury. After surgery David was able to play again at non-league level and after leaving Hereford United signed for Cheltenham Town helping them win the Football Conference but because he had taken an insurance payout on his injury he was not able to play when the club were promoted to the Football League. He moved on firstly to Yeovil Town and then to Forest Green Rovers where he became joint-manager alongside former England international Nigel Spink. He helped lead Forest Green to the 2001 FA Trophy final where they lost to Canvey Island at Villa Park. He had further spells at Tamworth and finally Gainsborough Trinity. His brother Trace Norton also played for Aston Villa youth team before later playing for Exmouth Town and later becoming an accountant.

Unlike other hacking simulation games, the in-game engine is made to appear more like an actual computer system similar to the Linux OS/Shell. Plot In Street Hacker, the player assumes the role of a hacker who is approached by a crude executive and entrepreneur, Demetrius Mordecai. He sees you as a person with a strong analytical mind, keen intuition and a desire for power. Having no money at your disposal, he hires you as a hacker to do his dirty work. Vince, his chief of operations, helps you get started and accustomed to the game. Being as successful as he is, Demetrius has made quite a few enemies in the corporate world. This is evident by the first few missions he assigns you to, missions in which you are required to disrupt these corporations by sabotaging their servers. Once these missions are completed, Demetrius decides to \\"retire\\" you by calling in an anonymous tip to the FBI about who was behind the attacks. Quickly responding, the FBI surrounds your apartment and finds enough evidence to put you away for 4 years. Two years later, you are freed from prison to serve your remaining two years on parole. Vince, your mentor from the beginning, helps you get back on your feet by hooking you up with a laptop and some cash. He and many of the others who still work for Demetrius are all hoping that you can find enough dirt on him to put him away for life. Too afraid to directly betray him, they all put their support behind you. Style Street Hacker focuses primarily on actual forms of hacking (viruses, worms, etc.). The user is given a program with which to order these different programs so that they can perform the various missions assigned to them. Another feature to the game is the infiltration feature, where the user is required to infiltrate a building in order to hack internet access so they can accomplish the different missions that are assigned to them. Similarly to games such as Uplink, Street Hacker is heavily mission-driven, the entire main storyline being propelled by the different missions assigned. For the most part, the in-game dynamics mimic that of an actual operating system (down to the ability to execute programs and view folders). Hacking takes place in a DOS-style command prompt, using commands familiar to computer aficionado (commands such as WHOIS, CONNECT, etc.). It also allows for downloading files from the respective servers which you must connect to for missions (and in some cases for software downloads).

Sivanath Sastri wrote (about Sen and his contemporaries), \\"These young leaders are trying to keep up the Brahmo name and the work of the Brahmo Samaj of India; thereby strengthening the hope, expressed before, of their counteracting the narrowing influence of Keshub Chunder Sen‚Äôs close adherents.Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, 1911-12/1993, p. 510, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. Formative years The son of Madhusudan Sen, and nephew (sister's son) of Keshub Chunder Sen, he was born on 25 September 1868 at Kolkata. Sen received Western education, supported by his father, who had been initiated into the Brahmo Samaj by Debendranath Tagore. Sen topped his class throughout his academic career. He mastered the intricacies of Western philosophy. After his graduation with honours in English and philosophy from the General Assembly‚Äôs Institution (now Scottish Church College) in 1888, he did his Master of Arts in history and philosophy from Calcutta University.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , pp. 345-346, Career He started working in Baharampur College and worked in Tej Narayan Jubilee College at Bhagalpur for a short period before joining Presidency College in 1893. His lectures outside the college premises drew in large number of listeners.Niyogi, Niranjan, Smritir Gourab Smritir Sourav (The scent of glorious memories), 1969, , pp. 199-208. Brahmo Samaj Inspired by Keshub Chunder Sen from a young age, he undertook all work for the Brahmo Samaj, along with Pramathalal Sen and Mohit Chandra Sen, under the guidance of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar and Krishnabihari Sen. In 1897, he and Mohit Chandra Sen opened a students‚Äô hostel named ‚ÄòFraternal Home‚Äô at 92 Harrison Road (renamed Mahatma Gandhi Road). In 1898, when plague struck Kolkata, the residents of ‚ÄòFraternal Home‚Äô participated in the relief activities. Many persons attended his classes on Bhagavad Gita held at Albert Hall. He took the lead to act parts of it and enlivened the entire environment. Many persons attended his prayer-meeings. Among them was Brajendra Nath Seal. He was elected president of \\"Youngmen & Interpretation\\" and \\"Theistic Endeavour Society\\". He represented Brahmo Samaj in the World Conference of Liberal Religions, organised by Unitarians at Geneva in 1905 and was felicitated by the Unitarians. At the conference his paper dealt with the problem of religion in modern India. While arguing the need for more theology, he warned against ‚Äòdry rationalism‚Äô that would stifle the spiritual impulse. He organised a school for the moral education of Brahmo children. It was looked after mostly by his wife, Shakuntala Devi. He was associated with numerous educational and welfare activities of the Brahmo Samaj. Sen was actively involved in the functioning of Victoria Institution. He presided over the Indian Theistic Conference held at Lahore in 1909. Other activities Sen was a member of Calcutta University for many years, and was inspector of colleges. He was secretary of Calcutta University Institute. Upadhyay Gour Govinda Ray used to say, \\"Benoyendranath is a rose in bloom.\\" At the time of Titanic disaster in 1912, Sen presided over a memorial service.

Biography  O'Donnell was educated at Harvard University and worked as a journalist, mostly for magazines. He was a friend of the Kennedy family. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps until July 2, 1945, when he was discharged. He became Newsweek magazine's German bureau chief. In this capacity, he arrived in Berlin on July 4. He was assigned to investigate Hitler's death and to obtain information as to Eva Braun. O'Donnell bribed the Soviet soldier guarding the entrance to Hitler's Berlin bunker becoming the first non-Soviet to examine it. He found and took numerous top secret Nazi documents. After using these documents and interviews with many of the last occupants of the F√ºhrerbunker in his later publications, he became an authority on the death of Adolf Hitler, and ultimately published his collected findings in his 1975 book, The Bunker. After his tenure with Newsweek, O'Donnell worked for many years as a freelance journalist in Germany, and published pieces in magazines ranging from Life magazine to The Saturday Evening Post. He later joined the U.S. State Department as an adviser on Berlin. He spent his last years as a journalism professor at Boston University.

He studied at the Chouinard Art Institute and Otis Art Institute (now Otis College of Art and Design) in Los Angeles, before receiving his BFA degree from the University of Southern California in 1956. He continued his studies at Chouinard Art Institute in 1957 and received an MFA degree from New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University in 1959. Kenneth Price studied ceramics with Peter Voulkos at Otis and was awarded a Tamarind Fellowship. He is best known for his abstract shapes constructed from fired clay. Typically, they are not glazed, but intricately painted with multiple layers of bright acrylic paint and then sanded down to reveal the colors beneath. Ken Price lived and worked in Venice, California and Taos, New Mexico. Biography Price was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Price's earliest aspirations were to be an artist, \\"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be an artist. Even when I was a kid I would make drawings and little books, and cartoons..,\\"Price, Ken. \\"A Talk with Slides.\\" Chinati Foundation Newsletter. (October 2005) pp. 22‚Äì23. he states. Price enrolled in his first art ceramics course at Santa Monica City College in 1954, where he quickly embraced a formal craft tradition as espoused by Marguerite Wildenhain.Price, Ken. \\"Personal Influences.\\" Ceramics Monthly (September 1994) p. 32. He subsequently studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, before receiving his BFA degree from the University of Southern California in 1956. As a student at USC, Price spent time visiting the ceramics studio at the Otis Art Institute where ceramic artist Peter Voulkos was teaching. Price has often cited Voulkos as his strongest single influence as a student. After finishing his degree at USC, Price spent a portion of the next year as a graduate student at Otis. There he studied (under Voulkos) with Billy Al Bengston, John Mason, Mike Frimkess, Paul Soldner, Henry Takemoto and Jerry Rothman. Price writes about the group at Otis: \\"We've been cited as the people who broke away from the crafts hierarchy and substituted so-called 'total freedom!' Actually we were a group of people who were committed to clay as a material and wanted to use it in ways that had something to do with our time and place.\\" Price, Ken. \\"Personal Influences.\\" Ceramics Monthly (September 1994) p. 31. In 1958, Price left Otis for Alfred University (with a six-month detour in the Army Reserves). \\"I went to Alfred to try and develop some low-fire, brightly colored glazes, but also to try and get away from the influence of Voulkos, which was very strong on me.\\"Price, Ken. \\"A Talk with Slides.\\" Chinati Foundation Newsletter. (October 2005) p. 24. During his time at Alfred, Price was able to formulate some of the glazes he desired, using a lead base. In 1959, Price returned to Los Angeles having received an MFA in Ceramics from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University. Price describes Los Angeles upon his return and the beginnings of the L.A. art scene: \\"When I started out in L.A. in the late fifties there was no art scene at all really. I mean there was an art scene in New York, but there wasn't one in L.A. There were hardly any galleries. The museum was downtown and it didn't endorse contemporary art. And there were only about three viable art publications. The local newspaper critics didn't like us at all. There weren't any collectors, really very few. We made few sales, and for little money when we made them. But the people I knew were totally committed. And so was I. I was confused about a lot of things at that time, but not about being an artist. I knew that's what I had to be. And then later, around the mid-sixties, the whole scene cooked up: galleries, museums, foundations, art schools, and you know, lots more artists.\\"Price, Ken. \\"A Talk with Slides.\\" Chinati Foundation Newsletter. (October, 2005) p. 26. Price's first solo show came at the Ferus Gallery in 1960 where he quickly became part of a developing art movement that included artists such as Larry Bell, Billy Al Bengston, John Altoon, John McCracken, Robert Irwin and Ed Ruscha, among many others. Price would have three solo shows during the short time Ferus was open, and by the mid-1960s Price was a fixture in the west coast art scene. Aside from six months Price spent in Japan in 1962, Price would remain in Los Angeles until 1970, when he and his wife, Happy, relocated to Taos, New Mexico.Price, Ken. Interview with Mark Rosenthal, ed. Artists at Gemini G.E.L.: Celebrating the 25th Year. (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1993) p. 130. In the early 1980s (around 1982), Ken and family moved from Taos to Southeastern Massachusetts. \\"We wanted to get out of Taos for a variety of reasons, and had visited a friend in Massachusetts who lived right on the Atlantic Ocean. It was really beautiful, so we moved there and stayed for about eight years.\\" Working in his studio near New Bedford, Massachusetts, Price concentrated on developing his sculptural forms, and allowed his production of cup forms to wane. In September 2012, Price was the subject of a 50-year retrospective opening at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveling to the Nasher Sculpture Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In honor of the artist, the museum has displayed his 2011 piece \\"Zizi\\" in the lobby of its Ahmanson Building. watercolor on paper, 2005 In September 2013, Price was also the subject of a works on paper retrospective titled 'Slow and Steady Wins the Race, Works on Paper, 1962‚Äì2010' at the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Drawing Center, and the Harwood Museum of Art.

His mummy was discovered in an unmolested tomb by Czech archaeologists under the direction of Ladislav Bare≈° and Miroslav Verner in February 1998. The discovery of an unmolested Egyptian tomb of this significance is a very rare occurrence. The mummy was in a state of advanced decomposition due to the proximity of the water table, however many of the tomb's artifacts were in good condition. Discovery In 1994, a team of archaeologists from the Czech Institute of Egyptology at Charles University in Prague began investigating a second large shaft tomb at Abusir in Egypt. In 1996, they located a burial chamber at the bottom of the shaft, below the desert. As they excavated they found tunnels that had been previously built by looters; these tunnels ended a few meters (yards) above the burial chamber. The shaft had been built through weak, brittle clay, and the team took the precaution of building a protective roof of reinforced concrete over the burial chamber to prevent a collapse of the shaft. The tomb and its vaulted roof were created from white limestone blocks, and a white limestone sarcophagus almost filled the chamber. The contents of the tomb were intact, making this the first unrobbed shaft tomb found in Egypt since 1941. The researchers dated the tomb to the late 26th dynasty (before 525 BC). The sarcophagus was surrounded by 408 ushabtis, symbolizing servants for the dead, and the tomb also contained stone vessels, wooden furniture, pottery, and papyri scrolls. Some of the pottery had been imported from the Aegean. The walls of the tomb were covered with texts from the Book of the Dead, and inscriptions in the tomb identified the man buried as Iufaa, a high-ranking priest and palace official. The team of researchers opened the sarcophagus of Iufaa in February 1998. The sarcophagus contained a black-grayish basalt mummiform sarcophagus. Inside this was a wooden coffin which contained the mummified remains of Iufaa, covered in a net of blue beads. The chamber was located almost at groundwater level, which resulted in high humidity. The humidity had caused the soft tissue and wrappings on the mummy to disintegrate, leaving only a preserved skeleton, which was \\"more or less complete\\". The papyri scrolls were also in poor condition. Family In 2001, the team investigated east of Iufaa's tomb and found two smaller shafts, with a sanctuary between them. Three bodies were buried in those two shafts. According to inscriptions, the other mummies were of Imakhetkherresnet, Nekawar, and Padihor. Tests showed that Imakhetkerresnet, who was between 35 and 45 at her death, and Nekawar, aged 55 to 65 at his death, were biologically related to Iufaa. It is likely that Imakhetkerresnet was Iufaa's sister, as inscriptions in both tombs identified them as having a mother named Ankhtisi, and Nekawer is probably either Iufaa's father or his brother. The other man, Padihor, aged 28-32 at death, was not biologically related to the others. Life and death Examination of Iufaa's skeleton revealed that he was 25‚Äì35 years old at his death. He had very serious tooth decay and \\"advanced fusion of cranial sutures\\". His skeleton also showed severe biparietal thinning, a rare condition that today occurs in Europe in only 0.4‚Äì1.3% of people. Iufaa also had slight arthritis and suffered from severe osteoporosis. The team speculated that Iufaa \\"suffered from some unknown long- lasting disease\\" which caused the osteoporosis and led directly to his death.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, and Colorado Rockies. Davis is a three-time MLB All-Star. He was a member of the Royals' 2015 World Series-winning team, and earned the Babe Ruth Award for his performance in the 2015 MLB playoffs. Amateur career Born and raised in the small town of Lake Wales, Florida, Davis attended Lake Wales High School. After high school, Davis originally committed to attend the University of Florida, but later turned down the offer to play professional baseball. Professional career =Tampa Bay Rays= Draft and minors Davis pitching for the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays in 2006 The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Davis in the third round, with the 75th overall selection, of the 2004 MLB draft. In the minors, he sported a 93‚Äì94 mph fastball, and a spike curveball. Davis has expanded his repertoire to include a two-seam fastball, a slider, and a changeup. 2009 Davis made his major league debut on September 6, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. He earned a no- decision after pitching seven innings, allowing one run, with nine strikeouts. 2010 Davis was the July 2010 AL Rookie Pitcher of the Month, after posting a 4‚Äì0 record with a 3.03 ERA in five starts. He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team. The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America also named Davis the Most Outstanding Rookie of the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. He came in 4th in the voting for 2010 AL Rookie of the Year. 2011‚Äì2012 Tampa Bay Rays in 2012 After two years in the Rays' starting rotation, Davis spent 2012 coming out of the Rays' bullpen and had a strong season. =Kansas City Royals= On December 9, 2012, Davis was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with James Shields) in exchange for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard. 2013 Davis spent most of 2013 in the Royals' rotation and compiled a 6‚Äì10 record through the end of August. He moved to the bullpen for September 2013 and remained in the bullpen through 2014. 2014 In 2014, Davis posted one of the most dominant seasons ever by a reliever. From June 25 to September 16, Davis did not give up an earned run. On September 15, his ERA was an astonishing 0.69. On September 22, 2014, Davis struck out Yan Gomes for his 104th strikeout of the season, breaking the Royals record for most strikeouts by a relief pitcher, which was 103 and had been shared by Jim York (1971) and Greg Holland (2013). Davis finished the regular season with a 9-2 record, posting a 1.00 ERA. He struck out 109 batters and walked 23. He did not give up a home run in 2014.

On October 23, Davis forced Blue Jays slugger and 2015 American League MVP candidate Josh Donaldson to ground out to Mike Moustakas at third base, which was the final out to secure the Royals' second consecutive American League Championship Series title. Davis later recorded the final three outs of the 2015 World Series, as the Royals defeated the New York Mets in five games. In the 2015 MLB postseason, Davis went 1-0 and earned four saves in four opportunities. He struck out 18 batters while allowing zero earned runs over 10 2/3 innings pitched.

Information Beef rings were common among North American farmers who had no means for refrigeration of meat until the beginning of the 20th century. Although pigs were small enough that a smoked pork carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of cattle, and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case. After obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a steak, a roast, and a boiling joint each week. By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.

PANEL , Newsarama, July 26, 2007 Promotion about the limited series describes its story as \\"the day evil won\\". The series deals with alien villain Darkseid's plot to overthrow reality, and the subsequent death and corruption of various DC characters and their universe. Publication history Final Crisis came out of several ideas Grant Morrison had when he returned to DC Comics in 2003. Morrison said, \\"I pitched a huge crossover event called Hypercrisis, which didn‚Äôt happen for various reasons. Some of Hypercrisis went into Seven Soldiers, some went into All-Star Superman, some went into 52 and some of it found a home in Final Crisis.\\"Grant Morrison: Final Crisis Exit Interview, Part 1, Newsarama, January 28, 2009 According to Grant Morrison, work finally began on Final Crisis #1 in early 2006, with the intention of the series being a thematic and literal sequel to Seven Soldiers and 52, two projects that Morrison was heavily involved in at the time.Grant Morrison on Final Crisis #1, Newsarama, June 9, 2008 References to Infinite Crisis as the \\"middle Crisis\\"Justice League of America #9: \\"The Lightning Saga, Chapter Three\\", July 2007. gave readers the impression there would be at least one additional major follow-up to the original Crisis on Infinite Earths. A May 2007 teaser poster confirmed this speculation with the tagline: \\"Heroes die. Legends live forever.\\" Final Crisis was preceded by Countdown, a year-long weekly series which was meant as a follow-up to 52. Halfway through, the series was renamed Countdown to Final Crisis. However, the artwork met with delays. To keep the release on schedule, Countdown wrapped with issue #1 and its planned final issue (#0) was revamped as a 50 cent one-shot special called DC Universe #0. Besides hyping upcoming storylines such as \\"Batman R.I.P.\\" and \\"Blackest Night,\\" the issue was narrated by Barry Allen and featured Libra leading a group of super-villains in prayer for the \\"god of evil\\", Darkseid. The result is, as described by Morrison, that \\"we‚Äôre watching him fall back through the present, into the past of Seven Soldiers where he finally comes to rest in the body of 'Boss Dark Side‚Äô, the gangster from that story.\\" To help readers identify events pertinent to Final Crisis and other major DCU events as the crossover approached, a \\"Sightings\\" cover banner appeared on various DC comics as \\"signposts, marking important storybeats and moments throughout the DC Universe.\\"\\"DC Nation\\" #110 The first such headers appeared on Justice League of America (vol. 2) #21 and Action Comics #866, respectively (the JLA issue featured Libra's return and his recruiting of the Human Flame). The original intent was for Jones to pencil the whole series. Due to delays, however, Carlos Pacheco drew issues #4‚Äì6 with Jones, and issue 7 was drawn entirely by Doug Mahnke. Jones said that ‚ÄúAny problems completing the series are my own. I love Doug Mahnke‚Äôs art, and he would have probably been a better choice to draw this series in the first place.‚Äù In addition to the core limited series the larger storyline includes a number of tie-ins, including one-shots and limited series. The one-shots comprise \\"Requiem,\\" \\"Resist,\\" \\"Secret Files\\" and \\"Submit\\". Also \\"Rage of the Red Lanterns\\" is the start of a storyline of the same name, that picks up on events in \\"Green Lantern: Secret Origin\\" and continues in Green Lantern #36‚Äì38. It starts as a tie-in because, according to writer Geoff Johns, \\"events in Final Crisis have motivated the Guardians to proceed further with their attempted containment of the light\\". The limited series comprise Superman Beyond (a two issue mini-series also written by Grant Morrison), Legion of 3 Worlds (a five-issue limited series focusing on the different incarnations of the Legion of Super-Heroes), Revelations (a five- issue limited series), and Rogues' Revenge (a three-issue mini-series focused on the Flash Rogues). Plot Following the final battle of the New Gods, the spirit Darkseid tumbles through time itself, coming to rest on Earth, where it, along with the spirits of the other evil gods of Apokolips, manifests itself in the body of a human being. Darkseid's \\"fall\\" has sundered reality, creating a singularity at the heart of creation, into which all of space and time are slowly being drawn, setting the stage for the evil god's final victory, to be claimed in his inevitable death. Through his agent Libra, he arranges for a huge army of super villains to be gathered, who capture and murder the Martian Manhunter as the opening salvo of the conflict. Coinciding with the Manhunter's death is the arrival on Earth of Nix Uotan, an exiled member of the cosmic Monitors, who has been sentenced to become human as punishment for failure in his duties. Following the trail of a group of missing child prodigies, detective Dan Turpin discovers the dying body of Darkseid's son, Orion. The Justice League of America liaise with the Green Lantern Corps to investigate the murder, deducing the cause of death to be a bullet of Radion (a substance toxic to New Gods) fired backwards through time from the future. New God Granny Goodness, possessing the body of Green Lantern Kraken, stymies the investigation by framing Hal Jordan for the murder; when Batman deduces her true identity, she captures him and teleports him to Command D, a government bio-chemical weapons facility beneath the city of Bl√ºdhaven that has also fallen under the control of Darkseid's minions. Slowly becoming aware of the threat the evil gods pose, Alan Scott enacts \\"Article X\\", a super hero draft, that readies Earth's metahuman forces for the coming war. With Batman and Jordan removed from play, the New Gods continue to eliminate the greatest threats to Darkseid's plan. Wonder Woman is infected by the Morticoccous bacteria by a Desaad-possessed Mary Marvel while investigating Bl√ºdhaven. Superman departs for the future in order to obtain a cure for Lois Lane after a bomb in the Daily Planet building mortally wounds her. The Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, is resurrected from within the Speed Force by powers unknown, and races back in time alongside Wally West, in an attempt to outrun the Black Racer (the Death of the New Gods) and stop the bullet that will kill Orion. Turpin's search for the missing children leads him to the Dark Side Club, where he is confronted by Darkseid's human host, Boss Dark Side. The evil god transfers his essence into Turpin's body and brings him to Command D, where the detective is subjected to bio-genetic restructuring to transform his body into a replica of Darkseid's original form. Concurrently, Darkseid's agents release the Anti-Life Equation through all of Earth's communications networks, spreading it across the entire planet. The two Flashes, having failed to prevent Orion's death, emerge from the time stream one month after the equation's release, and discover that the minds of nearly the entire population have fallen under Darkseid's control, with its super-human victims having been transformed into a military force of \\"Justifiers\\". With the help of the Tattooed Man, the Super Young Team and former allies of the New Gods of New Genesis Shilo Norman and Sonny Sumo, small cells of super heroes who have managed to resist the equation discover a possible salvation: a symbol from the alphabet of the New Gods that will break the equation's control over minds, which was gifted to the cave-boy Anthro by Metron in prehistoric times. Meanwhile, a huge battle erupts between the superheroes and the Justifiers in Bl√ºdhaven, during which the equation- controlled Wonder Woman infects the heroes with Morticoccous, which strips the heroes of their powers. However, the loss of these troops is soon mitigated by the turning of Libra's Justifiers, control over whom is usurped by Lex Luthor and Doctor Sivana so they can help defeat Darkseid. These twists and turns are observed by Nix Uotan, whose powers and memories of his true nature are unlocked with the help of Metron and a mysterious ape-like figure in a robe. Escaping confinement in Command D, Batman uses the radion bullet to mortally wound Darkseid, while Darkseid in turn kills Batman with his Omega Beams. Superman returns to the present and tears Command D apart to recover Batman's corpse, and faces off against Darkseid as the Flashes come racing into Bl√ºdhaven, the Black Racer hot on their heels. As the heroes reach super- luminal velocity, time warps around the Flashes, creating the temporal eddy into which Darkseid fires the bullet, sending it back in time to kill Orion. Outpacing Omega Beams fired from the eyes of the humans in Darkseid's thrall, the Flashes lead both the beams and the Black Racer straight to Darkseid, finishing the job Batman had begun. Simultaneously, The Ray traces the Metron symbol across the face of the Earth in beams of light, liberating all those under the equation's control. The freed Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth to release Darkseid's consciousness from Turpin's body. Although physically bested, Darkseid's dying essence is still dragging all of reality into nothingness along with it. Time and space break down as the effect worsens, until eventually, only Superman is left in the darkness at the end of creation, struggling to complete a copy of the \\"Miracle Machine\\", a wish- granting machine shown to him by Brainiac 5 during his trip to the future. Darkseid's essence re-emerges to claim the machine, but Superman destroys him for good by using the last of his super-powered breath to sing, countering the vibrational frequency of Darkseid's life-force. With Darkseid's end, however, the evil behind evils emerges; Mandrakk, the Dark Monitor, fallen father of Nix Uotan, who waits at the end of all things to consume what remains. Superman uses the solar energy in his own cells to power the Miracle Machine, and makes a wish that is granted by the appearance of an army of Supermen from all across the multiverse (including one modeled on U.S. President Barack Obama). Nix Uotan joins the clash, using his Monitor powers to summon the Green Lantern Corps, the Zoo Crew, the Super Young Team, the armies of Heaven itself, and more for a final battle with Mandrakk that culminates in the Corps spearing him with a stake made of pure light created by the combined energy of their rings. The heroes drag Earth out of the black hole that is Darkseid, and Nix Uotan returns to being human as the other Monitors cease to exist in accordance with the wish Superman had made: a wish for a happy ending. In the distant past, Anthro dies of old age in a cave. His body is discovered by Bruce Wayne‚Äînot dead, but sent back in time by the Omega Beams, who picks up where Anthro left off, drawing a bat symbol on the cave wall.

Stefan Ustvolsky was a Russian Orthodox priest excommunicated from the Most Holy Synod in Saint Petersburg and pretend bishop in early Ukrainian Canadian history. He called himself Bishop Seraphim, Metropolitan of the Orthodox Russian Church for the whole of America and started the All-Russian Patriarchal Orthodox Church in 1903 in Winnipeg. His claim of consecration was backed by forged documentation and the church eventually fell apart around 1908.  Europe  Seraphim was born Stefan Ustvolsky in 1858. Ustvolsky‚Äôs name is probably linked with the birthplace of his relatives on his father‚Äôs side - the village of Ust‚Äô-Volma, Russia. Ustvolsky graduated from the Olonets Theological Seminary, and in 1881 he completed his studies at the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy with a degree in theology and \\"the right to obtain a master's degree from a new oral test \\". In June 1881, he was appointed a priest in the Moscow court at Verkhospassky Cathedral. In January 1882, he transferred as a priest to the church of the 8th Grenadier Moscow Regiment quartered in Tver. In April 1882, he was accused by the commanding Colonel of the regiment, Ivan Karloviƒá von Burzi (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤–∏—á —Ñ–æ–Ω –ë—É—Ä–∑–∏), of misconduct which was fully confirmed in the course of the investigation conducted. Ustvolsky requested from the Holy Synod (–ü—Ä–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ), a rebuke or resignation with dignity . The request was granted, and as an exception, by Imperial decree was given to him the right and the rank of a collegiate secretary. After some time, for unknown reasons (obscured by him), this was lost. In May 1901, he entered into the brotherhood of the Novgorod Khutyn Monastery.–¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –í–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏. 1907. ‚Ññ 34 Then, he traveled to Mount Athos, to its Russian Monastery. What the Ukrainians in Canada learned about Ustvolsky‚Äôs life before his arrival in Canada, what Ustvolsky told of himself, Ivan Bodrug recorded in his memoir: ‚ÄúOn Athos, living out his life and fast approaching the grave, was the aged Patriarch Anphim (–ê–Ω—Ñ–∏–º). That Patriarch, like the other Patriarchs, disliked Russian Orthodoxy for the reason that in Russia the Tsars had abolished the Patriarchate and substituted themselves as heads of the Orthodox Church. In the monastery at Athos, there lived a Master of Theology, Father Stephen Ustvolsky, who had previously been a Court priest in St. Petersburg (Bodrug may have made a mistake here). When his wife deserted him to live with a Polish Colonel, Ustvolsky became a monk on Athos. The retired Anphim ordained this same Ustvolsky and sent him to America as Bishop in defiance of the Russian Synod.‚ÄùBodrug, Ivan. Independent Orthodox Church: Memoirs Pertaining to the History of a Ukrainian Canadian Church in the Years 1903-1913, translators: Bodrug, Edward; Biddle, Lydia, Toronto, Ukrainian Research Foundation, 1982, The Holy Synod at this time was practically a Russian government agency, and after Anthimus VII had retired from his position, he may have for personal reasons, in protest, because of his dissatisfaction with the circumstances of the Russian Orthodox Church, ordained Ustvolsky as a bishop.  New York  To discard his old identity and to look ahead, according to the religious practice of taking on a new name, Ustvolsky chose Seraphim. Now calling himself Bishop Seraphim, he left for the new world. He arrived in New York in 1902, where he stayed with Ukrainian priests briefly. Again, in Bodrug‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúThus in 1902, Bishop Seraphim arrived unexpectedly from Athos to America. Our dissenters from Catholicism met Seraphim in New York, but found that Seraphim was a Russian patriot who recognized neither Ukraine nor Ukrainians. Disillusioned, they refused to accept him as their Archbishop and later all returned to their Irish Bishops, ‚Äòrepenting‚Äô of their errors.‚Äù Ivan Bodrug (1874‚Äì1952) Makarii Marchenko  Winnipeg  Seraphim arrived in Winnipeg in April 1903, along with his assistant Monk Makarii Marchenko. \\"Due to various indiscretions and problems with alcohol\\"Yereniuk, Roman, A Short Historical Outline of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada, page 9 Seraphim quickly lost the trust of the intelligentsia who invited him to Winnipeg, and a coup took place in which they moved to get rid of him while not losing his congregation. It was decided that Ivan Bodrug and Ivan Negrich would infiltrate Seraphim‚Äôs church, as priests. They were already theology students at Manitoba College. Bodrug describes the moment: ‚ÄúOut of that meeting (with Cyril Genik) came the decision that Seraphim could continue as Seraphim, and we would accord him due respect, but, having once established leadership over his priests, we would undertake to preach not Orthodoxy, but Evangelical Christianity. As for the forms and traditions in the Church ritual, we would honour those which did not conflict with the spirit of Christ and the teaching of the Apostles. Within a week of that meeting, Negrich and I went to Winnipeg to see Seraphim. We found him at prayer in his modest room. Genik introduced us to Seraphim, and we turned out to be the first people able to converse with him in his native Russian, which we had learned as leaders of the Doukhobors. (The Principal of Manitoba College had released Bodrug and Negrich from February through May 1899 to help in settling 10,000 Doukhobor immigrants who had arrived from the Caucasus; they worked as interpreters for the Immigration authorities.) Seraphim blessed us using both hands (Bishop‚Äôs blessing), and invited us to sit down. He asked us exactly who we were, when we had arrived in Canada, and what schooling we had had. He questioned us as to whether we had the willingness and the call to become Orthodox priests. We told him that we were Protestants by conviction. He smiled and said: 'We will make fine Orthodox priests out of you. The Protestant Anglican Church is a daughter of the Orthodox Eastern Church.'‚Äù Sometime later, Bodrug describes their ordination as priests: ‚ÄúSaturday morning, we accompanied Seraphim on a mission to Brokenhead, about fifty miles east of Winnipeg. The church was small, but a great many people had gathered there. During the service, Seraphim ordained us as priests.‚Äù Though apparently Seraphim ordained priests indiscriminately for a fee, it was only so indiscriminate, as according to Bodrug‚Äôs account it was tougher for Bodrug and Negrich to get ordained by Seraphim than for them to be accepted as students of theology at Manitoba College. Historic Sites of Manitoba: Bishop Seraphim's Tin Can Cathedral, 1905. Charismatic, Seraphim \\"...ordained some 50 priests and numerous deacons, many semi-illiterate, who carried out priestly duties throughout the settlements, preaching independent Orthodoxy and trustee ownership of church property. In two years this church claimed nearly 60,000 adherents‚Ä¶\\" Seraphim left for Russia to try to obtain funding for his thriving church. He returned to Winnipeg in the autumn of 1904, but brought no such funds with him. ‚ÄúThose who opposed the Holy Synod did not dare to support Seraphim in Canada. Seraphim did bring back photographs showing him celebrating the Bishop‚Äôs Mass, with the assistance of Father Ivan Kronshtadsky, a miracle-worker famous throughout Russia. Many other priests at the altar of the cathedral appeared in that photograph, and Seraphim was in the middle wearing a mitre on his head and with a crozier in his hand.‚Äù Upon his return, Seraphim was astounded to learn that in his absence Bodrug and others had reorganized his church. He excommunicated these priests and anyone who supported them. So began the split between Seraphim‚Äôs church and the new Independent Greek Church headed by Bodrug.  Seraphim's departure  The Russian Greek Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral, 1905 In the same way that Seraphim excommunicated all the priests who abandoned him, he himself received word shortly of his own excommunication by the Russian Orthodox Church. It is highly likely that the person instrumental in this was Archbishop Tikon Bellavin. On September 17, (O.S. September 4,) 1905, The Holy Trinity Russian (Greek) Orthodox church was consecrated in Winnipeg, on the corner of McKenzie Street and Manitoba Avenue, by Archbishop Tikhon, Head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America and soon to become Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.

Tikon wrote in a letter dated October 1905: \\"The residence of our priest, Seraphim, in Winnipeg (with whom I stayed) is located beside Seraphim‚Äôs cathedral. It is difficult to describe his \\"cathedral\\": one must see it. Pillars are made from old, unfit iron pipes, and between them the space is plastered with boards and tin; crosses are made of old iron rods; ornaments and cornices are made from cardboard paper. The place resembles a kind of booth, where visiting actors and magicians give performances. On top of everything, Seraphim lives in his cathedral, where he climbs out onto the roof through the dome and, sits there on a chair, attracting large crowds of contemplatives (especially the neighboring Jews).\\"–ò–∑ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–æ—Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ê–ª–µ—É—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –¢–∏—Ö–æ–Ω–∞ (–ë–µ–ª–ª–∞–≤–∏–Ω–∞) –ü–æ–±–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ—Å—Ü–µ–≤—É –ö.–ü. –æ—Ç 2 (15) –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 1905 –≥–æ–¥–∞: ¬´–ö–≤–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞—à–µ–≥–æ —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –°–µ—á–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤ –í–∏–Ω–∏–ø–µ–≥–µ (—É –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ —è –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–≤–ª–∏–≤–∞–ª—Å—è) –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤—É —Å ‚Äú–∫–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–æ—é‚Äù –°–µ—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–º–∞. –¢—Ä—É–¥–Ω–æ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –∑–∞ ‚Äú–∫–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä‚Äù: –µ–≥–æ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å. –ò–∑ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—Ö, –Ω–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç—Ä—É–± —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω—ã —Å—Ç–æ–ª–±—ã, –∏ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –Ω–∏–º–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∑–∞–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–æ –¥–æ—Å–∫–∞–º–∏, –∂–µ—Å—Ç—å—é; –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—ã –∏–∑ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—Ö –ø—Ä—É—Ç—å–µ–≤; —É–∫—Ä–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –∫–∞—Ä–Ω–∏–∑—ã –∏–∑ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –±—É–º–∞–≥–∏. –ü—Ä—è–º–æ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π-—Ç–æ –±–∞–ª–∞–≥–∞–Ω, –Ω–∞–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–∏–µ —Ç–µ—Ö, –≥–¥–µ –∑–∞–µ–∑–∂–∏–µ –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä—ã –∏ —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –¥–∞—é—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. –í –¥–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –°–µ—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–º –∏ –∂–∏–≤–µ—Ç –≤ —Å–∞–º–æ–º —Ö—Ä–∞–º–µ –Ω–∞ —Ö–æ—Ä–∞—Ö, –æ—Ç–∫—É–¥–∞ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –∫—É–ø–æ–ª –≤—ã–ª–µ–∑–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –∫—Ä—ã—à—É –∏, —Å–∏–¥—è —Ç–∞–º –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—É–ª–µ, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–ª–µ–∫–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à—É—é —Ç–æ–ª–ø—É —Å–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Ü–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π (–æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ö –∂–∏–¥–æ–≤)¬ª.

But other versions (in Russian and Polish history) have him returning to Russia. Possibly, being a larger than life figure, people mistook someone else for Seraphim and only thought they saw him in British Columbia, and these are the reports that trickled back to Winnipeg.  Postscript  The success of Ustvolsky's church led to the emergence of legitimate Ukrainian Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox churches to serve the needs of the Ukrainian pioneers. In 1912, Nykyta Budka was named the first Ukrainian Catholic bishop in Canada and in 1918, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada was formed.

Life and work Little is known about the life of Bryson; he came from Heraclea Pontica, and he may have been a pupil of Socrates. He is mentioned in the 13th Platonic Epistle,Platonic Epistles, xiii. 360c and Theopompus even claimed in his Attack upon Plato that Plato stole many ideas for his dialogues from Bryson of Heraclea.Athenaeus, xi. ch. 118, 508c-d He is known principally from Aristotle, who criticizes his method of squaring the circle.Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, 75b4; Sophistical Refutations, 171b16, 172a3 He also upset Aristotle by asserting that obscene language does not exist.Aristotle, Rhetoric, 3.2, 1405b6-16 Diogenes La√´rtiusDiogenes La√´rtius, i. 16, vi. 85, ix. 61 and the SudaSuda, Pyrrhon, Krates, Theodoros refer several times to a Bryson as a teacher of various philosophers, but since some of the philosophers mentioned lived in the late 4th-century BCE, it is possible that Bryson became confused with Bryson of Achaea, who may have lived around that time.Robert Drew Hicks, Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers, page 88. Loeb Classical Library =Pi and squaring the circle= Bryson, along with his contemporary, Antiphon, was the first to inscribe a polygon inside a circle, find the polygon's area, double the number of sides of the polygon, and repeat the process, resulting in a lower bound approximation of the area of a circle. \\"Sooner or later (they figured), ...[there would be] so many sides that the polygon ...[would] be a circle.\\"Blatner, page 16 Bryson later followed the same procedure for polygons circumscribing a circle, resulting in an upper bound approximation of the area of a circle. With these calculations, Bryson was able to approximate œÄ and further place lower and upper bounds on œÄ's true value. But due to the complexity of the method, he only calculated œÄ to a few digits. Aristotle criticized this method,Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, 75b37-76a3. but Archimedes would later use a method similar to that of Bryson and Antiphon to calculate œÄ; however, Archimedes calculated the perimeter of a polygon instead of the area. =Robert Kilwardby on Bryson's syllogism= The 13th-century English philosopher Robert Kilwardby described Bryson's attempt of proving the quadrature of the circle as a sophistical syllogism‚Äîone which \\"deceives in virtue of the fact that it promises to yield a conclusion producing knowledge on the basis of specific considerations and concludes on the basis of common considerations that can produce only belief.\\"Robert Kilwardby, De ortu scientiarum, LIII, ¬ß512, pp. 272f.

The division was a reserve division of the IV Reserve Corps and was raised primarily in the Province of Prussian Saxony, the Duchy of Anhalt, and the Thuringian states. Combat chronicle The 7th Reserve Division began the war on the Western Front. It fought in the opening campaigns against the Belgian Army and the British Expeditionary Force, including the Battle of Mons, and pursued the Allies during the Great Retreat, culminating in the First Battle of the Marne. After 1st Marne, the division held the line in the Aisne region until September 1915, when it went to the Champagne region. In 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun, where it suffered heavy losses. It then saw action in the later phases of the Battle of the Somme. The division occupied various parts of the line in 1917 and into 1918, before participating in the German Spring Offensive. After the offensive, it occupied various parts of the line again, facing Allied offensives and counteroffensives, and was hit by U.S. troops in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Allied intelligence rated it second class and noted that it was almost annihilated by the Armistice in November 1918.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 149-152.

Written by Mark Farmer, with art by Farmer and Alan Davis. The comic series is a tale about the baby Kal-El, the last survivor of the doomed planet Krypton, arrives on Earth in the 30th century and is found by billionaire R.J. Brande. As Kal grows up, he decides to find other super-powered teens like himself and form a Legion of Super-Heroes. The story uses elements from the Silver Age Comics, most notably from the original Legion of Super-Heroes series. Plot In the year 2987, R.J. Brande, the galaxy's richest man and head of Brande Industries, discovers a life-pod in the asteroid belt. Inside the life-pod lies a baby boy, Kal-El of Krypton. Kal-El's rocket was set on a course for the planet Earth, in the 20th century moments before Krypton was destroyed. But the rocket crashed into an asteroid and remained there for approximately one thousand years. In 3001, Kal-El became Brande's adopted son, Kal Brande. Kal gains superpowers due to the effects of the radiation from Earth's sun and calls himself Superboy. Inspired by legends of superheroes from the 20th century, he uses his powers to help humans. Every planet in the Milky Way Galaxy is protected by the Science Police, who are guided by the supercomputer Universo. The Science Police sees Kal as a misfit, because he damages public property and makes unregistered flights. The Science Police threatens R.J's business, if he doesn't control Kal's behavior. After a heated argument between Superboy and R.J, Superboy flies off into space to the former location of Krypton. He witnesses, Talu-Katua, a member of the Green Lantern Corps fighting against a Khund space vessel and helps. Talu-Katu reveals that the Green Lantern Corps protects all sectors of space, that are not under police protection, but their resources are limited, and this gives Superboy the idea to form his own group. Meanwhile, on the luxury space cruiser Lystrata, a young couple, Imra Ardeen a psychic and Rokk Krinn who has magnetic abilities, help defend the ship against an energy being, blister beast, and are helped by Superboy. The trio form a team called Superboy's Legion. Imra calls herself Saturn Girl, and Rokk calls himself Cosmic Boy. They hold televised tryouts, covered by young reporter Lois Olsen, for more members on Titan. They induct best friends Dirk Morgna (Sun Boy) and Gim Allon (Colossal Boy), Salu Digby (Shrinking Violet), Chuck Taine (Bouncing Boy), Jan Arrah (Element Lad), and Tasmia Mallor (Shadow Lass). Superboy meets Lois and a spark seems to form between the two after the tryouts. When news comes of a giant asteroid about to collide with planet Rimbor, the Legion sets out to save the planet. On Rimbor, word of the asteroid's collision has caused mass hysteria. As the Legion heads for Rimbor, they are contacted by Lyle Norg (Invisible Kid) and Querl Dox (Brainiac 5), informing the Legion that Superboy's plan to smash the asteroid will fail because the asteroid is too large. The Legion calls in Thom Kallor (Star Boy), the last survivor of the planet Xanthu, who uses his gravity powers to increase Superboy's mass to stop the asteroid. Superboy shatters the asteroid, and the Legion collects the fragments. The Legion is attacked by the Fatal Five, five of the most dangerous criminals in the galaxy; and the ones responsible for Xanthu's destruction. Due to his weakness against magic, Emerald Empress gains an advantage over Superboy with her powerful talisman, the Emerald Eye. Mano, a mutant born with an anti-matter touch, burns Star Boy's face. Cosmic Boy has his right arm cut off by the Persuader's atomic axe, and Colossal Boy is killed in battle with the giant Validus. When the Five leave, they take Brainiac 5 back to their base, under orders from their leader, Lex Luthor. Superboy is not sure he wants to do any more good, after getting Colossal Boy killed. But Star Boy encourages Superboy to rescue Brainiac 5, not to prove himself or avenge anyone, but because it is the right thing to do. The rescue party arrive at Colu, but the planet is now visible and is being accessed by the computers in Luthor's ship. Luthor sics the Fatal Five on the heroes to avoid interference. Superboy and the Legion arrive and incapacitate the majority of the villains. Sensor mind controls the Emerald Empress into believing her Eye has been destroyed. Tinya and Reep trick and knock out Mano and the Persuader, and Sun Boy uses his rage at Colossal Boy's death to stop Validus. On Earth, Saturn Girl senses a malevolent presence inside the Universo computer and attempts to find it, but Luthor orders the Science Police to gun her down. The Science Police realize Luthor is paranoid, and sees Saturn Girl is their only hope as Universo starts to crash. Saturn Girl discovers the evil presence is diverting Universo's power to Colu. Luthor becomes aware of the interference and snaps the Emerald Empress out of Sensor's illusion to stop Saturn Girl. The Empress blows up Invisible Kid's ship before she leaves, as Bouncing Boy prevents his friends crashing into Colu. The Emerald Empress arrives on Earth and traps Saturn Girl and the others, ruining any chance they had of fixing Universo. When Ferro Lad learns the Eye's powers are magical, he uses his power to turn into iron to incapacitate it, while Karate Kid uses his knowledge of pressure points to knock out the Empress. Saturn Girl then befriends the Eye and convinces it to serve as Universo's replacement. On Colu, Superboy rescues Brainiac 5 from Luthor's ship, but Luthor has transferred his mind into an indestructible robot and continues to hack into Colu. After being rescued from Tharok by the Legion, Superboy engages Luthor, who reveals he has been watching Superboy and planned to transfer his mind into Superboy's body to achieve immortality. The Legion severs his link to Colu, and Brainiac 5 forces Luthor to face the truth‚Äîthat Luthor is in a dead body hidden in the depths of the Universo computer and he is a hologram. Luthor decides to blow his robot body up and destroy Colu. Superboy and Ultra Boy are able to remove Luthor from the planet before he explodes and save Colu. The Coluans teleport the Legion's friends and R.J. Brande to Colu and Superboy makes up with his adoptive father. The Legion become the official heroes of the newly formed United Planets. Superboy handing over leadership of the Legion to Ultra Boy, renames himself Kal-El and starts dating Lois Olsen.

August 30, 1822 - 1883) was a renowned landscape architect born in Silesia, Prussia, known particularly for his layout designs of cemeteries like Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, Forest Lawn in Buffalo, NY and Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois. Strauch also laid out many parks in Cincinnati, Ohio, including Eden Park, Burnet Woods and Lincoln Park. Strauch was hired by Spring Grove Cemetery in 1855 to handle the landscaping, and became superintendent of the place by 1859. He also designed Greenwood Cemetery (Hamilton, Ohio). Biography  Born in the province of Silesia of Prussia in 1822, Strauch began learning the art of landscaping around 1838, at age sixteen, when he studied in Vienna, Austria, under gardeners at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace and Schloss Laxenburg. It was at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace that he became recognized in the craft by Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, who praised his work and befriended Strauch. By 1845 Strauch had left Vienna to get a more thorough idea of gardening techniques used in areas like Belgium, Germany and France. Career \\"Temple of Love\\" Pergola at Mount Storm Park In 1852, soon after arriving in the U.S., Strauch designed Mount Storm Park in Cincinnati in the neighborhood of Clifton, which was at that time the private villa estate of entrepreneur Robert A. Bowler. His reputation quickly grew and he designed many private gardens in that area. After reading Cosmos by Alexander von Humboldt, with its depictions of grave gardens in China, Strauch was inspired to implement similar plans in the United States. By lessening the appearance of gaudy monuments and railings that were so much a part of cemetery layouts at the time, Strauch focused more on expansive areas of lawn and clusters of trees and shrubs. He did allow some monuments to be constructed or kept, but only those that met certain specifications (typically those with a Gothic appearance). After redesigning the layout of Spring Grove Cemetery, which had been rundown and filled with swampland, the cemetery was transformed into an area of scenic lakes and clusters of trees and bushes. The project earned Strauch praise in the U.S. and abroad, including from Frederick Law Olmsted and the French landscape architect Edouard Andr√©. Other cemeteries, like Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana, modelled their landscaping concept after Spring Grove.

Quote  In a letter, Fr. Kovch wrote: \\"I understand that you are trying to free me. But I am asking you not to do anything. Yesterday they killed 50 people here. If I were not here, who would help them to endure these sufferings? I thank God for his kindness to me. Apart from Heaven, this is the only place I'd like to be.Here were are all equal: Poles, Jews, Ukrainians Russians, Latvians, and Estonians. I am only a priest here. I couldn't even imagine what would happen here without me. Here I see God, Who is the same for everybody, regardless of the religious distinctions which exist among us. Maybe our Churches are different, but they are ruled by the same all-powerful God. When I'm celebrating the holy Mass, everyone prays... Don't worry and don't despair about my fate. Instead of this, rejoice with me. Pray for those who created this concentration camp and this system. They are the only ones who need prayers... May God have Mercy on them.\\".

It fought in the opening campaigns against the Belgian Army and the British Expeditionary Force, including the Battle of Mons, and pursued the Allies during the Great Retreat, culminating in the First Battle of the Marne. After 1st Marne, the division held the line between the Aisne and the Oise until the Autumn of 1915, when it went to the Champagne region. In 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun. It then saw action in the later phases of the Battle of the Somme. The division occupied various parts of the line in 1917, and then fought in the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1918, it saw action in the German Spring Offensive, including the Battle of the Lys.

Early life and education Kottke was born on April 4, 1954 in Bronxville, New York. Kottke first met Steve Jobs when they were both undergraduates at Reed College in 1972. In 1974, Kottke and Jobs made a trek in search of spiritual enlightenment to India to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. They then made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji.\\"Interview: Apple Employee No. 12 Dan Kottke on Company‚Äôs Earliest Days and the College Steve Jobs.\\" KQED, November 25, 2011. After returning from India, Kottke transferred to Columbia University in 1975 as a literature and music major. He stayed in touch with Jobs and they traveled together to fellow Reed College classmate Robert Friedland's All One Farm.  Career  =Apple= During his junior year at Columbia in 1976, Kottke was asked by Jobs to become involved in a hobbyist computer project where, he assembled and tested the boards during the summer. He also arranged for Kottke to work \\"for an hourly rate part-time assembling circuit boards for a company called Call Computer\\" that didn't require technical expertise. It was during that summer that Kottke realized his own interest in computers. Kottke stated in an interview with KQED/PBS that both he and Jobs' sister Patty (who was also assembling boards while watching TV) were the first part- time employees of Apple, while Bill Fernandez was the first full-time employee. In 1977, after graduating from Columbia, Kottke joined Apple as full-time employee #12. It was at that time that Jobs, Kottke, and Jobs' girlfriend Chrisann Brennan shared a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Kottke spent an additional eight years with Apple debugging Apple II printed circuit boards and building Apple III and Macintosh prototypes as well as working on the design for the Macintosh keyboard. The Apple II gained a sizable amount of popularity, eventually becoming one of the best selling personal computers of the 1970s and early 1980s. Kottke was also one of the original members of the Macintosh development team and his signature can be found embossed on the internal wall of early production Macintosh computers. Jobs, however, refused to grant Kottke stock in the new company, stating that he \\"will give him zero\\" (Steve Wozniak would later give Daniel some of his own shares in Apple). In her memoir of her life with Jobs, Chrisann Brennan states that she later asked Kottke about not receiving the stock options and that he replied: \\"Oh that [...] Steve had offered me a job in marketing [...] but I wasn‚Äôt interested in marketing because I had something like a fever to understand the technology [...] so I never pursued the marketing opportunity.\\" In addition, in 1982 when Time Magazine featured a major, but unflattering, profile of Jobs that actually made him cry, he publicly \\"berated\\" Kottke for confirming the fact to Time that he had a daughter, Lisa Brennan, whom he had basically abandoned. Representations in film =Documentaries= * Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine (2015) =Feature films= * Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999), with Marcus Giamatti as Kottke: In an interview with Slashdot, Kottke stated that Pirates of Silicon Valley was \\"a great movie. Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs. Just unbelievable. I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen.\\" He also stated that in the film there were \\"all these scenes of the garage where it‚Äôs like half a dozen people working, busily carrying things back and forth, and oscilloscopes\\" when he [Kottke] \\"was really the only person who worked in the garage. Woz would show up once a week with his latest to test it out, and Steve Jobs was on the phone a lot in the kitchen.\\" * Jobs (2013), with Lukas Haas as Kottke: In an interview with Slashdot, Kottke stated that he was consulted on early versions of the screenplay for Jobs and noted, \\"Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair.\\" He also said that the early versions of the screenplay \\"were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to Mike Markkula because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe.\\" Kottke also outlined various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. Bill Fernandez was part of the same interview but stated that he didn't see the film because \\"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \\"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\\" In the same interview, Bill Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of Rod Holt (portrayed by actor Ron Eldard). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \\"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair [‚Ä¶] he‚Äôs like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\\" Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \\"thought it was hilarious.\\" As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \\"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn‚Äôt look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he‚Äôs wearing leathers.\\" Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, ‚ÄúWho could this possibly be in the Apple universe? [‚Ä¶] It seems to me that there‚Äôs a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there‚Äôs been to date. The TV show John Wants Answers took Steve Wozniak, Kottke, and Andy Hertzfeld through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred. * Steve Jobs‚Äô‚Äô (2015), mentioned in dialogue. In an interview with CNN, Kottke states that seeing the movie was a bit of a shock to him and that he enjoyed it very much. \\"It took me a few days after seeing the film ... I was surprised to see what a dominant character Lisa became. I found that very gratifying to see. It was very much a caricature ...

Located only from the Newcastle CBD on one of Newcastle's major arterial roads, it was initially developed as a residential suburb. Today it includes a small industrial area and is adjacent to the Newcastle campus of the Hunter Institute of Technology. Its southeastern border is occupied entirely by the Hunter and Newcastle and Central Coast railway lines. The suburb has one railway station, which is shared with, and named after, adjacent Hamilton. History The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land. Islington was developed in the 1870s as a residential suburb. It is located on Maitland Road, which later became part of the Pacific Highway and was part of Highway 1 until the Minmi to Beresfield section of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway was completed in 1998. The convenient location attracted small factories. The Regent Theatre in Islington, located on the corner of Maitland Road and Beaumont Street, opened on 2 December 1928. In 1941 or 1942, Hoyts Theatres obtained a majority interest in the property but, with the advent of television, the Regent was unable to survive and closed on 27 June 1964. After remaining empty for five years, the building reopened as a hardware store in August 1969 and operates in that capacity today. In 1947, Lettesi (a settler group made up of nearly 150 families from the village of Lettopalena in the Abruzzo region of Italy) settled in the Islington region, primarily due to its proximity to the BHP steel works. (original document p. 3, PDF p. 7) Present day Islington Park, located on Throsby Creek, has a cycleway that links Islington to the redeveloped Newcastle foreshore. Islington is located at the north-eastern end of Beaumont Street, the restaurant precinct of Newcastle. Known as the antique district of Newcastle, with numerous shops primarily located on Maitland Road, which also houses Islington's main trade area, with more shops on Beaumont Street. Located on Maitland Road is the Newcastle Hotel; a popular nightclub and music venue, formerly known as the Gateway Hotel, which served as a prominent gay bar. Islington had a problem with street sex work. A residents group was formed to work with authorities to eradicate the practice although complaints continue. Transport Maitland Road, a suburban carrier of the Pacific Highway, runs through the suburb and links it to Mayfield and Newcastle West. Islington is served by bus services operated by Newcastle Buses & Ferries, including routes 100, 101, 103 and 108 along Maitland Road, and route 111 through the suburb's east. In addition, the Hamilton railway station, located on the Newcastle and Central Coast and Hunter Lines, is located on the suburb's southern boundary and provides regular services to Maitland, the Central Coast and Sydney.

The mammal Lavocatia, the Notosuchian Lavocatchampsa and phorusrhacid Lavocatavis are named after him. Paleontological discoveries Eager to try paleontological research in Africa to find Oligocene mammals, Le P√®re Lavocat, √©minent pal√©ontologue, dans les Kem-Kem Lavocat was strongly endorsed by Camille Arambourg. In 1947, he obtained leadership of a research mission in the Algerian-Moroccan desert. He did not find any Oligocene mammals, but instead came across a rich fauna of Cretaceous vertebrates. His first notes on this subject were made in 1948 entitled les Comptes Rendus Sommaires de la Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France (English: Report Summary to the Geological Society of France) in which Lavocat explains the discovery of a large number of Cretaceous reptiles (dinosaurs and crocodiles) and fish in the bedrock of the desert. A year later, a second note appeared in the same journal and extends his discoveries to the southwestern Kem Kem. In 1954, Lavocat described a new species of sauropod, Rebbachisaurus, discovered in the region. In addition, in 1955 he described a new genus of theropod, Majungasaurus. In 1960, Lavocat returned to Africa and described a second species of Rebbachisaurus, R. tamesnensis. In 1973, Lavocat discovered two genera and three species of Miocene rodent, which he placed in the family Kenyamyidae.

The XL175 first entered the market in 1973 as a lightweight dual-sport motorcycle, and the model continued in production through 1978. The XL175 had a 173cc single cylinder OHC four-stroke engine mated to a 5-speed transmission and was started via a kickstarter only (no electric starter). The gauges included a speedometer and a tachometer up until 1976, when the tachometer was deleted for that and subsequent years. Braking was via front and rear cable operated drum brakes. The dimensions of the bike were 2,075x840x1,095mm (82x33x43in). History =1973= The 1973 XL175 was available in one color, Mars Orange with Silver. The fuel tank and the side covers were orange and the stripes were black. The side cover had a white XL175 decal on it. The front and rear mudguards were silver-painted plastic. The exhaust system was downswept on the K0, K1, and K2 models. =1974= The 1974 XL175 was also only available with one color, Mars Orange with Silver as on the previous model. The fuel tank and sidecovers were orange and the stripes were black. The side cover decal was white and yellow. The mudguards were silver colored plastic. =1975= The 1975 XL175 was available in only one color, Tahitian Red with Silver. The fuel tank and side covers were red and the stripes were black. Both mudguards were plastic and were painted silver. =1976= The 1976 XL175 was available in Aquarius Blue only. The fuel tank, side covers and mudguards were blue. Wheel hubs were polished aluminium. This and subsequent XL175 models featured an upswept exhaust system, an AC ignition, and a revised fifth gear ratio. (Earlier models had a ratio of 0.960; the 1976, '77, and '78 models had 0.885. This change coincided with a rear sprocket of 42 teeth. Earlier models had 38 teeth.) This was the first year that the previous \\"K\\" model designator was dropped. =1977= The 1977 XL175 was available in Black and Tahitian Red. The fuel tank and sidecovers were black with a red and white stripe. The side cover decal was red and was outlined with white. Both mudguards were red- painted plastic. =1978= The 1978 XL175 was the last model produced. The colors it came in were Excel Black with Tahitian Red. The side cover decal was red and white like the 1977 model. Both mudguards were plastic painted in red. The stripes were red. The wheel hubs were now black. Components =Electrical System= The electrical system in all six years of the XL175 was a six volt system and included a battery, headlight with high/low beam, turn signals, brake/taillight, instrumentation lights, and a horn. A warning light panel was also included on models 1976 through 1978 which displayed lights for 'High Beam' (blue light), 'Turn Signal' (orange light) and 'Neutral' (green light). Models from 1973 through 1975 incorporated warning lights for neutral and turn signals into the tachometer face, and a high beam indicator light on the top of the headlight housing. In the K0, K1, and K2 models the entire lighting system and the ignition system were DC-powered. These models require a charged battery to start and run. The engine's alternator supplies rectified current to charge the battery. All of the electrical components run from the battery. Beginning with the 1976 models, and continuing for the 1977 and 1978 models, significant changes were made to the electrical system. The ignition was now AC, which meant the bike would start with a dead battery, as the ignition system drew its power directly from the alternator. Likewise, the headlight also was AC-powered, as it too drew its power directly from the alternator. However, all other electrical components - lighting and horn - were still DC-powered. In all models, a rectifier converts the alternator's AC to DC in order to charge the battery. The change in 1976 to AC ignition and an AC headlight caused changes to the wiring harness, the ignition switch, the coil, the alternator, the rotor, and the ignition advance mechanism.

It binds to, and destabilises, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis. ODC is then rapidly degraded. It was first characterized in 1981. The expression of ODC-AZ requires programmed, ribosomal frameshifting which is modulated according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. High levels of polyamines induce a +1 ribosomal frameshift in the translation of mRNA for the antizyme leading to the expression of a full-length protein. At least two forms of ODC-AZ exist in mammals and the protein has been found in Drosophila (protein Gutfeeling) as well as in Saccharomyces yeast (encoded by the OAZ1 gene).SGD entry for OAZ1 gene Human genes encoding Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are OAZ1, OAZ2, and OAZ3.

Biography  Goodridge first came to Edmonton in 1874 with a troop of soldiers, visiting a settlement that had only recently started to expand beyond the confines of Fort Edmonton, near the present site of the Alberta Legislature Building. Goodridge returned in 1876, becoming the first white settler in the area that is now the neighbourhoods of Jasper Place, roughly west of Fort Edmonton. When his fianc√©, D. S. McKay, arrived some time later, they married and homesteaded a farm roughly west of Fort Edmonton, near what is now Stony Plain. He later worked for a time in the implement trade. He and his wife would have six sons together. In 1892, Edmonton was incorporated as a town. Sometime before 1899, Goodridge had moved into Edmonton, as he was appointed as an alderman to Edmonton Town Council that year to replace Kenneth W. MacKenzie, who had resigned to run for mayor. Goodridge was re-elected in the 1900 election, in which he placed third of eight candidates, but resigned in 1901. In the 1901 election, he was elected to complete the term to which he had originally been elected. He did not seek re-election at the conclusion of that term in 1902. In 1908, Goodridge moved to Entwistle, Alberta to operate a lumber business. He retired in 1913, and died of a stroke February 25, 1914.

It was published by Bonus Books of Los Angeles, California in August 2003. Content Ehrenfeld argues in the book that international networks are used by terrorist groups to finance terrorist activity worldwide. She describes the activities of individuals, various charities, banks, drug trafficking networks, money- laundering schemes and bribed officials, documenting the involvement of specific groups, organizations and individuals of being involved. The involvement of Iran, Hezbollah, and al Qaeda in the drug trade is given particular attention. Ehrenfeld asserts that \\"it was bin Laden who managed the drug profits for the Taliban and arranged money-laundering operations with the Russian Mafiya.\\" Ehrenfeld goes on to argue that the international community should take stronger action against terrorist funding, including imposing economic sanctions on states that fund or foster terrorism, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Indonesia, Libya, North Korea, and Malaysia.William B. Scott, \\"In Review; Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed --and How to Stop it By Rachel Ehrenfeld\\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, Volume 160, No. 3, 19 January 2004, p. 420 Ehrenfeld's book criticizes international aid organizations as well for their often inadvertent support of terror. Reviews The book received a mixed reaction from reviewers. William B. Scott wrote in Aviation Week & Space Technology that the book is \\"brutally bipartisan and international in its bare-knuckled explanations of how political power and corporate greed have emboldened and strengthened the likes of Osama bin Laden and Yasar Arafat, while allowing future terrorists to be recruited and trained.\\" He concluded that it \\"should be required reading for every elected and senior government official in the U.S. and Europe-- especially those charged with counterterrorism responsibilities.\\" Nan Goldberg reviewed the book in The Star Ledger, commenting that the book leads to the \\"inescapable conclusion that the West is funding its own destruction, not only in allowing its economy to become and remain dependent on oil, but also by providing a market for illegal services.\\"Nan Goldberg, \\"What we're reading in November\\". The Star-Ledger, 2 November 2003, p. 5 Libel controversy Cover of the second edition of Funding Evil, updated to reflect the libel case, saying \\"the book the Saudis don't want you to read.\\" The book became the subject of international legal controversy when the Saudi businessman Khalid bin Mahfouz and his sons, Abdulrahman and Sultan, alleged in the book to be terrorist financiers, sued the author for libel in London. Although the book was not published in the United Kingdom the lawsuit was made possible when 23 copies were purchased in England via online booksellers and a chapter of the book was published for a short time on ABC TV's website. Ehrenfeld refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the British courts and did not appear to defend the suit. The High Court of Justice ruled against her by default. The court ordered her and her publisher to pay ¬£10,000 in damages to each of the three plaintiffs, with an additional ¬£80,000 costs for a total of ¬£110,000 ($225,000). Further distribution of the book from the United States was also prohibited with a previous injunction being continued.David Pallister, \\"US author mounts 'libel tourism' challenge\\". The Guardian, 15 November 2007 Ehrenfeld was also ordered to publish a correction and apology, but had no intention of complying.Dominic Kennedy, \\"Libel and money - why British courts are choice of the world\\". The Times, 19 May 2005\\"English High Court awards substantial damages to Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz and his sons\\", Al Bawaba, 16 June 2005 The judge noted that \\"the nature of the allegations which were made in the book... are of the most serious and defamatory kind.\\" He added that under English law, the defendants had the opportunity to counter the suit by attempting to \\"prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the defamatory allegations were substantially true.\\" The Mahfouz family published a statement on their website, declaring that a number of \\"serious errors of fact\\" had been published about the family and that they \\"abhor violence as a way of achieving political or other objectives.\\"Larry Neumeister, \\"Book Author Sues Saudi Billionaire\\". Associated Press, 10 December 2004 Mahfouz had posted similar statements on his website regarding more than 40 similar libel cases and threats to sue against authors and publishers from many countries including the U.S. Ehrenfeld accused Mahfouz of \\"forum shopping,\\" using English libel law to chill investigations (\\"libel tourism\\"). Her argument was based on the fact that Mahfouz resided in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia at the time of suit and had sued her in England as opposed to the United States because the libel law framework in the UK was more favorable to plaintiffs. This was rejected by Justice Eady. Mahfouz's English lawyer argued that \\"Our clients have brought proceedings in England because they maintain residences, transact business and have reputations to protect in this jurisdiction.\\" Ehrenfeld's actions following the initiation of Mahfouz's lawsuit were also noted by the court. A second edition of Funding Evil was published in the US with a new introduction commenting on the lawsuit and the book's cover was amended with the tag line \\"The book the Saudis don't want you to read.\\" =Counter-suit= In December 2004, before the English libel suit had concluded, Ehrenfeld pre-emptively counter-sued bin Mahfouz in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. She sought a declaration that the English judgment could not be enforced in the US and that the allegations that she had made against Mahfouz were not defamatory under US law. Her complaint asserted that the Mahfouz's litigation violated her rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, arguing that Mahfouz \\"seriously chills legitimate and good-faith investigation into his behaviour. With the benefit of his vast financial resources, he has managed to silence his critics one at a time.\\" In addition, she asserted that she had not properly been served notice and lacked the financial resources to fight bin Mafouz's lawsuit in England. Her case was supported by free-press advocates in the United States who argued that the case underlined the incompatibility of the English legal system with US constitutional rights. Sandra Baron, the executive director of the Media Law Resource Center in New York, argued that \\"it's critically important that American journalists and scholars be able to publish on topics of profound importance without having to look over their shoulders to make sure someone isn't suing them in the United Kingdom.\\"Sara Ivry, MediaTalk; Seeking U.S. Turf for a Free-Speech Fight. New York Times, 4 April 2005 A number of major media organizations supported her case, including the Authors Guild, Forbes, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Association of American Publishers and Amazon.com.Brendan O'Neill, \\"A town called Sue\\". New Statesman, 24 July 2006Samuel A. Abady & Harvey Silverglate, 'Libel tourism' and the war on terror\\". Boston Globe, 7 November 2006 Major newspapers also supported the cause, including the New York Times, the Washington Post and the LA Times. Mahfouz sought to have the New York case dismissed, claiming that the court had no jurisdiction over him and no power to rule in the issues raised by Ehrenfeld. Judge Richard C. Casey found in his favour and dismissed the case in April 2006, ruling that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over Mahfouz under New York state law.Memorandum and Order of April 25, 2006, Rachel Ehrenfeld v. Khalid Salim a Bin Mahfouz, United States District Court Southern District of New York, 04 Civ. 9641 (RCC) Ehrenfeld appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ehrenfeld's appeal was again supported by many media organisations in a consolidated amicus curiae brief, which argued that the \\"growing and dangerous threat of 'libel tourism' ‚Äì the cynical and aggressive use of claimant-friendly libel laws in foreign jurisdictions ... has chilled and will continue to chill Dr Ehrenfeld's exercise of her free speech\\". The Second Circuit referred the case to the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest appellate court, emphasizing that the case had implications for all U.S. authors and publishers whose First Amendment rights were threatened by foreign libel rulings. The Court of Appeals was asked specifically to determine whether ¬ß 302(a)(1) of New York's civil procedure rules conferred personal jurisdiction over a person who \\"(1) sued a New York resident in a non-U.S. jurisdiction; and (2) whose contacts with New York stemmed from the foreign lawsuit and whose success in the foreign suit resulted in acts that must be performed by the subject of the suit in New York.Opinion of the New York Court of Appeals in Rachel Ehrenfeld v. Khalid Salim a Bin Mahfouz, 20 December 2007 Based on the Appellate Court's response, the Second Circuit, in its final decision, noted that if the law on New York State court jurisdiction were to change, Ehrenfeld could bring suit again. =Subsequent legislative activity= Following the Second Circuit decision, two members of the New York State Legislature, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman (D-Queens) and Senator Dean Skelos (R-LI), introduced a \\"Libel Terrorism Protection Act\\" in both houses of the Legislature (bills no. A09652 and S 6676-B) in January 2008 to amend the New York civil procedures in response to the case. Free-press advocates in the author and publisher community strongly supported the passage of the bill. The bill passed the New York State Legislature unanimously and was signed into law on April 29, 2008.James Oliphant, \\"Saudi wields British law against U.S. author\\". Chicago Tribune, 17 March 2008 The law enables New York courts to assert jurisdiction over anyone who obtains a foreign libel judgment against a New York publisher or writer, and limit enforcement to those judgments that satisfy \\"the freedom of speech and press protections guaranteed by both the United States and New York Constitutions.\\"Samuel A. Abady & Harvey Silverglate, \\"Rachel's Law: NY's 'Libel-Tourism' Fix\\". new York Post, 25 February 2008 The Libel Terrorism Protection Act \\"offers New Yorkers greater protection against libel judgments in countries whose laws are inconsistent with the freedom of speech granted by the United States Constitution.\\".Governor Paterson Signs Legislation Protecting New Yorkers Against Infringement Of First Amendment Rights By Foreign Libel Judgments As of July 2010, six other states have passed analogs to Rachel's Law: Illinois,Illinois Florida,Florida California,California Tennessee,Tennessee Maryland,Maryland and Utah.Utah A federal bill based on Rachel's Law, the SPEECH Act, was passed in the 111th Congress, by unanimous vote of both the House of Representatives (as HR 2765 in 2009) and the Senate (as S 3518 in 2010), and signed into law by President Barack Obama in August 2010. Like Rachel's law, the SPEECH Act declares foreign libel judgments to be unenforceable unless they meet the criteria set forth by the First Amendment. The act contains further provisions allowing the libel plaintiff to be counter-sued for a declaration that the foreign libel judgment is \\"repugnant\\" to American constitutional law, with the possibility of recovering damages.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ223/html/PLAW-111publ223.htm See also * List of charities accused of ties to terrorism * Alms for Jihad References Further reading * Barbour, Emily C.

Conrad Robertson married Sarah Lucas, the sister of the wheelchair racer Ben Lucas. The Robertsons have three children. Rowing Robertson was a member of the North Shore Rowing Club. He won the first of his six Premier Redcoat National Rowing titles in the coxless pair with Mike Stanley in 1979. Perhaps his most impressive victory was three years later when he won the New Zealand nation championship in the 1982 men's single sculls title by defeating the five time national champion John Alexander from Whakatane as a Premier sculler at Lake Waihola. The following year in 1983 at Lake Horowhenia he won the historic and famed 'Boss Rooster' trophy in the coxed four with Mike Stanley, Rogar White-Parsons and Barrie Mabbott, and coxswain Andrew Hay. Later he was the three time consecutive national champion in the double sculls with Eric Verdonk in 1987, 1988, and 1989. On an international level, his first competition was at the 1978 World Rowing Championships at Lake Karapiro, where he rowed with David Clayton-Greene (bow) in the coxed pair; they came eighth overall. At the 1979 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Yugoslavia, he won a silver medal with the New Zealand eight. Robertson was selected to compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow with the New Zealand eight but did not compete due to the Olympics boycott. At the 1981 World Rowing Championships in Munich, he came seventh with the New Zealand eight. At the 1983 World Rowing Championships in Duisburg, Germany, he stroked the gold medal winning coxed four with Greg Johnston (3 seat), Keith Trask (2 seat), Les O'Connell (bow), and Brett Hollister (cox).

It is the only citywide conservancy in New York City that brings private resources to spaces that lack adequate municipal support, with the goal to fortify the City‚Äôs aging infrastructure and creating a healthier environment for those who live in the most densely populated and least green neighborhoods.  History  On July 7, 1995, Bette Midler founded the nonprofit New York Restoration Project (NYRP), with the goal of revitalizing neglected neighborhood parks in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods of New York City. These include Sherman Creek Park, Highbridge Park, Fort Washington Park, and Fort Tryon Park in upper Manhattan; and Roberto Clemente State Park and Bridge Park in the Bronx. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation initiated a partnership with NYRP in 1995 to assist with cleaning and maintaining Fort Tryon Park. In May 1999, the city planned to auction 114 community gardens for commercial development. Midler and NYRP founding president, Joseph Pupello, led a coalition of greening organizations to save them. NYRP worked closely with the City of New York and took ownership of fifty-two of the most under- resourced gardens in New York City's most economically challenged communities. In 2007, NYPR became the private partner of Michael Bloomberg's MillionTreesNYC campaign to plant one million new trees in New York City by 2015. In 2013, Midler won the Jane Jacobs Medal for her work through NYRP. The Rockefeller Foundation Jane Jacobs Medal recognizes New Yorkers who intervene in and use the urban environment to build a more equitable city. Rockefeller Foundation President, Judith Rodin said: \\"It is completely appropriate for us to honor Ms. Midler's work in light of her work to bring verdant recreational space to so many New Yorkers in so many different communities.\\" References External links * New York Restoration Project Rodale, Inc.

City centre in Freiburg, the western end of the trail Its western end is the city of Freiburg, in the Rhine valley; its eastern end is the city of Konstanz, on Lake Constance (German name: Bodensee). The name Querweg means \\"cross route\\", referring to the fact that the classic long- distance routes in the Black Forest, which were developed in the early 20th century, run north‚Äìsouth. The Querweg (as it is briefly known) was developed in the mid-1930s. The longer name is used to distinguish this path from other east‚Äìwest routes in the Black Forest. Available guide books (e.g. Bremke, 1999) describe walking the route in the west‚Äìeast direction, which leads to sharp climbs on the first one or two days and then more gradual descents for the rest of the route. From Freiburg, the route passes through Stegen, Buchenbach, Hinterzarten, Titisee-Neustadt, Kappel (part of the municipality of Lenzkirch), the Wutach Gorge, Blumberg, Engen and Singen. Its total length is approximately . Its highest point is , at the Hochfirst Tower, just north of the village of Saig in the Lenzkirch municipality. Because the path cuts across the Black Forest, and then continues across the volcanically formed Hegau region before skirting Lake Constance in its final section, it offers a great variety of landscape and vegetation. The Wutach Gorge Waymark 28px The route is very well marked throughout its length, using a waymark of a red and white lozenge (divided vertically, and with its longer axis horizontal) on a yellow background. According to Bremke (1999), the original planners of the route intended that the red end should always point towards Konstanz and the white towards Freiburg; this rule is generally but not universally obeyed in the waymarking in place . Access and accommodation The route passes through or near numerous villages or small towns, so there is no difficulty in finding overnight accommodation and meals along the route. It would require more planning to walk it while staying in youth hostel-type accommodation, or camping. The route can be accessed at numerous places along its length by road or public transport, so it is easy to walk part of it or to do day walks along its route: the section through the Wutach Gorge is particularly popular for this. For the eastern part of its length, from the Wutach Gorge to Konstanz, the Querweg route is followed by the European walking route E1. The E1 has no separate waymarking, although occasional notices record that its route is being followed. The Querweg intersects all three of the main north‚Äìsouth Black Forest long-distance paths, the Westweg at Titisee, the Mittelweg at Hochfirst, and the Ostweg at Achdorf. References *Bremke, N.

The center's mission is to contribute to promoting peace and security in the Middle East, through policy-oriented researches on national security in the Middle East. It is located at the Social Sciences Faculty of Bar-Ilan University. The center was founded by Thomas Hecht, a Canadian-Jewish leader, and was dedicated to Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat, who signed the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty, the first peace agreement ever signed between Israel and an Arab country. About the BESA Center =BESA according to BESA= Professor Efraim Inbar describes the center's mission as follows: \\"Over the years, we have been the first to successfully place on the public agenda issues such as the problematic aspects of Palestinian statehood, the danger of Arab chemical and biological weapons and missile stocks, Israel's relations with key countries such as Turkey and India, and the abuse of international institutions in the attempt to delegitimize Israel.

From some of Besa Center's publications: In 2004, \\"Palestinian Terror Makes Peace a Fantasy\\". Also, three years before Hamas led the government in Gaza, as Israel was planning its Gaza area withdrawal, E. Inbar wrote on Israel's withdrawal \\"do it right\\", and only the future will tell of consequences of withdrawal. In 2007, \\"The Mideast Axis of Destabilization,\\" that the Iran-Syria-Hizballah-Hamas alliance has acted during the last 15 years as an ‚Äúaxis of destabilization‚Äù in the Middle East, achieving major strategic victories at the expense of moderate Arab states, and US, European, and Israeli interests.

The paper, authored by then-director Inbar(who has since left BESA to establish the Jerusalem Institute of Strategic Studies), described ISIL as a security protection for Israel and the West as well as a useful tool against Syria, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah.

In 2004, spectroscopic observations showed that it had a relatively high concentration of metals in its atmosphere. Since the high gravitational field of white dwarfs quickly forces heavy elements to settle towards the bottom of the atmosphere, this meant that the atmosphere was being polluted by an external source. In 2005, infrared photometric observations suggested that it was surrounded by a ring of dust with size comparable to the rings of Saturn, providing an explanation for this pollution.A Dusty Disk around GD 362, a White Dwarf with a Uniquely High Photospheric Metal Abundance, E.E.

In 2006, Benjamin Zuckerman, Michael Jura and other astronomers used the Keck telescope to obtain high-resolution spectra of GD 362 which showed that heavy elements in the star's atmosphere occurred in concentrations similar to those in the Earth-Moon system. The group concluded that a possible origin for GD 362's dust ring and atmospheric pollutants was that a rocky asteroid about 200 km in diameter was disintegrated by tidal effects between 100,000 and 1 million years ago. If this was the origin, the spectra indicate that the asteroid should have had composition similar to the Earth's crust, suggesting that the star might have had an Earth-like planet before it entered its red giant phase.

Esther Short Esther Short was an early Vancouver resident. She and her husband Amos, and ten children, \\"jumped a claim\\" near present-day downtown Vancouver. This land was originally part of a larger land plot by American Henry Williamson, who mapped out a little town called Vancouver City and registered the claim in the US courthouse in Oregon City. He left his caretaker, David Gardner, in-charge of the land before leaving for California. During a dispute, Amos Short killed Gardner, though he was acquitted of any crime. Short used his courtroom experience to become a judge and claim the disputed land for himself. He died during a return voyage from selling local produce in San Francisco. With Williamson's registered claim intact, Esther Short filed papers to claim the land. Ultimately, she obtained part of the land (including the parcel which includes present-day Esther Short Park), along with the Catholic Church and Vancouver City. \\"Images of America DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER\\", Pat Jollota, p 42 She also gave permission to use house ferry boats to land on her property, at the foot of present-day Washington Street, where she operated a restaurant and hotel called The Alta House.

Contemporary development Before the last decade or so, downtown Vancouver was in serious economic decline, and the park was mainly home to transients. A 1996 Columbian article named the park as the nucleus of the majority of emergency 911 calls in the city. As part of the push for revitalization by mayor Royce Pollard and others, the park received $5.67 million in direct aid, and investment of $220 million of capital funded a slew of development in and surrounding the park. This movement to revamp the park is widely believed to have been jump started by a 1997 incident involving Pollard at a series of social events he designed to make the park a family- friendly gathering place. According to reports, a transient individual pushed Pollard in the back with a shopping cart, and made threatening comments warning him to leave. The man was arrested, and henceforth public interest and support in reclaiming the park surged. In the summer of 2007, the property received the \\"Development of Excellence\\" award from the Urban Land Institute of Oregon and Southwest Washington.

The wavy step or trails error is a die error that is found on some United States minted coins beginning in 1986. The anomaly occurs during the die making by the single-squeeze hubbing process. Cause While the exact cause of \\"trails/wavy steps\\" is not known, it is believed to be caused by movement of the die against the hub during the single squeeze hubbing process. Similarities exist between this anomaly and the doubled die, however, the major difference is that a doubled die is a duplication of a design element, while a \\"trail\\" die is an extension of a design element. Single-squeeze hubbing In 1986 The Annual Report of the Director of the Mint for financial year 1986, states that the mint had been experimenting with a new single-squeeze hubbing system. In the year 1996, the mint announced at the opening of the Denver Mint's die shop that the cent, nickel, and dime dies would be made from this process. It took until 1999 to include the rest of the denominational coins' dies to be produced by this method. While the purpose of the single-squeeze hubbing process's creation was to entirely eliminate the doubled die error, not only has it failed to do so, but also it has produced this die anomaly whose properties are similar in nature. This anomaly, known as \\"wavy steps\\" or \\"trails\\", is considered a variety type error since it is found on every coin that the particular affected die produces. Statistics The die anomaly, \\"trails\\", began to occur in the year 1986, shortly after the mint began experimenting with the single-squeeze hubbing process and persists even to this year, 2011. To date, over 1,200 examples of dies affected with this anomaly have been found on cents, nickels, dimes, quarters, and dollars. The first wavy step die was discovered in 1995 on a 1994 Lincoln cent from the Philadelphia mint. It was not until 2003 that this die variety gained popularity when another die, a 2003 Lincoln cent, was discovered and written about in Coin World magazine. It was only a matter of time that more and more of these varieties began to be uncovered. It wasn't until the year 2003 that the name \\"wavy steps\\" was affixed to this anomaly. The phrase \\"trail\\" die was first thought of in the year 2000, when Ken Potter observed lines trailing off some of the design elements of a wavy step die. Comparison of other dies that carried both \\"wavy steps\\" and \\"trails\\" showed that the lines from both anomalies traveled in the same exact direction. From this, it was ascertained that these anomalies were one and the same thing with the only difference being the direction that the lines took.

The Ruby Princess was built in 2008 by Fincantieri in Trieste, Italy, as a sister ship to and . She was turned over to Carnival Corporation and Princess Cruises in late October 2008. She was formally named at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 6 November 2008 by Trista and Ryan Sutter. The ship became infamous in 2020, as the source of over 10% of Australia's early COVID-19 cases. By 24 April at least 22 deaths in Australia and the United States were linked to the ship. A cluster of cases in New Zealand was also linked to the ship.

By gross tonnage she was the largest ship in the Princess fleet until the arrival of the new . Areas of operation Ruby Princess was initially based in Los Angeles for cruises to the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii and California coastal cruises. In late 2019, Ruby Princess' base moved to Australia. 2020: spread of COVID-19 On 8 March 2020, Ruby Princess departed Sydney, Australia for a 13-night cruise around New Zealand. Intended ports of call were Fiordland National Park (scenic cruising), Port Chalmers (for Dunedin), Akaroa, Wellington, Napier, Tauranga, Auckland, and Paihia (for the Bay of Islands). The cruise was cut short on 15 March and Ruby Princess returned direct to Sydney from Napier. Ruby Princess' visit to Napier on 15 March 2020 led to a cluster of 16 COVID-19 cases there. On 19 March 2020, the ship arrived back in Sydney, New South Wales two days early from the New Zealand cruise, docking at 3am, as some COVID-19 swabs needed to be tested as an urgent matter. The ship disembarked 2,700 passengers later that morning. The state health minister, Brad Hazzard announced on 20 March 2020 that 13 of the people on the ship had been tested for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and 3 of them were positive. New South Wales health authorities asked all passengers to go into self-isolation. It was announced on 24 March that one passenger had died and 133 on the ship had tested positive for the coronavirus. As of 30 March, at least 440 passengers had tested positive for the virus. 211 were in New South Wales, 71 in South Australia, 70 in Queensland, 43 in Western Australia, 22 in the Australian Capital Territory, 18 in Victoria, three in Tasmania and two in the Northern Territory. By 31 March, five of them had died, one in the Australian Capital Territory, two in Tasmania, one in New South Wales and one in Queensland. By 2 April, cases in New South Wales had risen to 337 passengers and 3 crew members, and total passenger cases had risen to at least 576, excluding passengers who left Australia without being tested. On 1 April, the ship was off Port Botany. The International Transport Workers' Federation had called on the Australian government to allow the crew members to be disembarked so that they could be flown to their countries of residence. At that point, there were 15,000 crew members in 18 cruise ships sitting off the Australian coast. Six from Ruby Princess had been medically evacuated. Aspen Medical was contracted to carry out medical assessments on the ship and visited it on 2 April. Another three passengers from the ship were reported dead in New South Wales on 5 April, and a fourth in Queensland. Another died in Western Australia on 6 April followed by one in Tasmania on 7 April, bringing total deaths to 13. The death toll reached 21 on 18 April 2020 with the death of a second man in the United States. About 900 passengers from other countries other than Australia and left Sydney after the ships arrival there; few specifics are known about infections or deaths in this group. The death toll was reported to have reached 22 on 13 May, with the death of an 81 year old passenger. According to an inquiry by Bret Walker SC for the New South Wales government, the eventual death toll was at least 28, including eight from the United States. There had been 662 confirmed cases of the virus, including 342 in New South Wales. 11 cases of secondary transmission from people infected on the ship had been reported, which had not led to any deaths. As of 8 April, the ship's crew of about 1,000 remained on board, with 200 exhibiting flu-like symptoms; 18 had tested positive for COVID-19. The vessel moored at Port Kembla on 5 April 2020. 542 crew members were taken off the ship for repatriation to Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States between 21 and 23 April. 190 members of the crew have tested positive for the virus. The ship left Port Kembla on 23 April. On 7 May, the ship arrived in Manila and disembarked 214 Filipino crew members. = Criminal investigation = On 5 April 2020, New South Wales Police launched a criminal investigation into whether the operator of the ship, Carnival Australia, broke the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cwth) and New South Wales state laws, by deliberately concealing COVID-19 cases. A report by The Guardians Matilda Boseley commented: \\"Since the ship's 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March, federal and state authorities have been pinballing blame.\\" On 7 April 2020, it was reported that the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, had requested Crown Law to check whether her country's laws had been broken. As of the evening of 8 April, 30 investigators had been assigned to Strike Force Bast which was looking into the Ruby Princess case: as to \\"the communications, actions, and other circumstances that led to the docking and disembarking of the vessel\\" without a quarantine. The ship's voyage data recorder had been seized. = Special Commission of enquiry = On 15 April, the NSW State Government announced a Special Commission of inquiry to investigate events surrounding the Ruby Princess.

Ross Cutler and Senthil Velayutham founded the RoundTable product group as part of the Microsoft Greenhouse and led by GM Jeff Finan to commercialize the technology. The product launched in 2007. It used the Windows CE operating system on the main processor and other operating systems on the supporting DSP chipsets. In 2009 the Roundtable device was licensed to Polycom and rebranded as the Polycom CX5000.https://web.archive.org/web/20080315165647/http://www.microsoft.com/uc/products/roundtable.mspx The device has an identical feature set but is branded as a Polycom unit. Polycom has since launched two new products based upon the RoundTable design ‚Äì the CX5100 and the CX5500, supporting 1080p resolution video. The CX5100 is a USB only device.

Beaches Nobbys beach circa 1900 Newcastle East is home to two of Newcastle's beaches, Nobbys Beach and Newcastle Beach, both of which have surf lifesaving clubs and are patrolled by lifesavers. In June 2007, the bulk carrier MV Pasha Bulker grounded itself off Nobbys Beach in a storm. Between Newcastle and Nobbys beaches lie the Newcastle Ocean Baths. Fort Scratchley Fort Scratchley is a fort atop a knoll overlooking Nobbys Beach. It was designed by Lt. Col. Peter Scratchley and built between 1881 and 1886. While its original purpose was to protect the colony against a feared Russian invasion, its most prominent role came during World War II when the guns at the fort fired upon a Japanese submarine which shelled the city in 1942. The military role of the fort came to an end in 1972 and it now houses the Newcastle Region Maritime and Military Museum. Damage from the Japanese Navy attack during World War II can still be seen on the front of some of the buildings in East End. Today Fort Scratchley is a visitor attraction with views of the city and coastline, displays of military artefacts, and tunnel tours. Fort Scratchley also has a library of military books operated by the Fort Scratchley Historical Society. Motor racing Newcastle East has hosted the Newcastle 500 since 2017. Nobbys Road was extended to create the circuit. The Newcastle Street Circuit, a temporary Supercars Championship circuit first used in 2017 for the Newcastle 500, passes through Newcastle East.

Hydra was transferred to Army shortly after commissioning and trials. Navy had assumed the administration of contracts for these ships from the Maritime Commission on 1 January 1943 during or before construction and thus most were only administratively Navy, including names and numbers, during construction. was never commissioned and thus never bore the USS designation. The ship was transferred to become the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Port Repair ship Robert M. Emery the day after acquisition by Navy. Construction The ship, one of 109 Maritime Commission N-type coastal cargo ships built, was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Penn-Jersey Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, 22 May 1943 as MV William Nott, a Maritime Commission type N3-M-A1 cargo vessel. The ship was launched 31 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Clementine C. O‚ÄôBrien; acquired by the U.S. Navy 6 November 1943 for service as Mira (AK-84). However, she was never commissioned and was transferred to the Army 7 November 1943. Her name was struck from the Navy list 16 November 1943. Army career Mira was renamed Robert M. Emery in 1944 for First Lieutenant Robert M. Emery of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers serving with the 1st Infantry Division and killed in action on 8 November 1942 in Algeria. Lieutenant Emery was presented the Distinguished Service Cross posthumously for his action on that date. Emery Barracks was also named in his honor. Robert M. Emery was among the first four of the N3-M-A1 types converted for use as a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers port repair ship. The conversion work was done by Bethlehem Steel Co., Inc., Brooklyn, New York, in mid 1944. Robert M. Emery joined her three sister ships and the converted Great Lakes steamer Junior N. Van Noy as one of the five ships leaving in late summer of 1944 for operations in Europe. She then began operations at ports in the United Kingdom, North Africa, and France. She was the only member of that group to operate in the Pacific Ocean, going there in July 1945 to operate in the Hawaiian Islands between September and November. Subsequently, she returned to the United States West Coast for transfer to the Maritime Commission. Mira was returned to the Maritime Commission. She eventually was sold for scrapping in 1966. Civilian usage Instead of scrapping the ship was sold to Canadian interests in 1966 and towed to Victoria, British Columbia and reportedly docked at the foot of Fort Street until resale in 1969. The U.S. buyers converted the ship to an attraction at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf in San Francisco, California until 1970 when the ship was towed to Astoria, Washington and apparently scrapped in Tacoma, Washington during late 1984.

Examples are also known from Kazakhstan. The deposits are anomalously high in iron for deterital material, and exclude detrital iron deposits typified by scree of hematitic banded iron formations and accumulations of currently-forming maghemite pisolite alluvials. CIDs are a major source of cheap, high grade iron ore exploited primarily in the Pilbara and Murchison regions of Western Australia.  Morphology  Channel iron deposits are typically partly eroded and currently are from between <1m to 100m thick, with preserved channel widths of between 100m and >5 km. Mineralised channels are up to 150 kilometres in length, but not all of the preserved length of the CID is of ore grade. Channel iron systems typically form within a depression on the Cenozoic ‚ÄòHamersley Surface‚Äô, and form several pods downstream on the palaeodrainage. The channels show typical fluvial sedimentary morphology, with channel scours truncating or incising the channel iron deposits, and rare examples of graded bedding, and so on. Individual ore deposits are subsets of a larger sub- economic mineralized system, which varies laterally and along the palaeodrainage. The deposits form lensoidal accumulations with interbeds of clays, gravels and siliceous detrital materials.  Age  No clear geochronological data exist for CIDs, as no radioisotope methods are applicable to directly date CID deposits. Palynological data do exist but cannot constrain ages sufficiently beyond centring on the Middle Miocene. = Formation mechanism = The source of iron for the CIDs is believed to be a Miocene aged iron-rich soils which developed upon a palaeosurface (since eroded) which developed in the Early Miocene during hot, humid conditions. The erosion of this ferritic palaeosurface in the Mid Miocene transported of the iron-rich soils into the palaeodrainage system, where the iron became consolidated within the existing river courses. The river beds were at the time a rich humic swamp with thick vegetation, and accumulation of peats or thick detrital vegetation. Most CIDs are underlain by organic-rich clays and/or Miocene aged lignite. The iron became fixed in place in the river channels and gradually replaced the existing humic material via replacement with goethite. = Petrology = Channel iron deposits are formed by accumulation of massive deposits of what is generally referred to as ‚Äúpisolite iron gravels‚Äù, which are ooids and pisoids of goethite. CIDs were initially considered to be analogous to accumulations of pisolite gravels within palaeochannels via sedimentary means. Modern evidence points to an in-situ formation of the classic pisolitic textures. Goethite ooids and pisoids show evidence of being formed by concretion of layers of goethite (cortex) around a core fragment (nucleus) which is typically ferruginised wood fragments, but may be quartz grains, hematite grains or other detrital material. It is considered that the mechanism for enrichment and formation of the goethite cortex is related to near-surface alteration of an existing highly ferruginous material by groundwater action. Ferruginised wood is ubiquitous and a major component of CIDs, existing as porous, friable limonite. Fossilised wood fragments are present but are usually extremely rare and of very small size (<50 mm). The goethite pisolites are cemented via a variety of agents, usually a mixture of goethite, clays, carbonate minerals (magnesite, calcite and sometimes siderite), and occasionally silica. This process may form an in-situ concretion of pisolites which may be very resistant to erosion - some mesas in the Pilbara, and Yilgarn are in fact old cemented ferruginous pisolite river gravels.  Economic importance  Channel iron deposits are an important source of iron ore, with the deposits at Yandi and Robe River accounting for approximately 47% of iron ore mined from the Hamerley Iron province. Although channel iron deposits are typically low-grade at 53% to 57% Fe in-situ, they are composed of goethite-limonite which are hydrated iron oxide species. Ore typically contains around 8% to 12% water, and <5% SiO2, and <3% Al2O3. The hydrous iron oxides can be calcined, and the CID ore on a volatile-free basis is around 63% Fe or more. The CID deposits relative lack of consolidation and proximity close to the surface in most cases renders them liable to bulk mining with little or no need for drilling and blasting. This then is a significant cost saving to miners, who can offset a lower revenue from Fe percentages in the ore via the ease of extraction. Also, in most cases, beneficiation can increase the in-situ iron grade several percent by washing out the majority of clay, carbonate and hydrous limonite cements. The key economic criteria for channel iron deposits are, firstly tonnage and location relative to infrastructure similar to other bulk commodities. Thereafter, the nature of the cement is important, particularly in the cases of carbonate cements containing magnesite, as magnesium is a problem. Rare channel iron deposits are rendered uneconomic because of a silica cement proving too durable for easy mining and crushing. The water content of channel iron deposits (quoted as Loss on Ignition) is from 7% to 12%, which is the highest of all iron ore types, generally due to the presence of goethite-limonite. Phosphorus, aluminium and sulfur levels are another concern, typically being above normal levels in-situ although if the phosphorus and aluminium are hosted in a weak cement, they can often be washed out during beneficiation. Most channel irons are upgraded via washing of the pisolite gravels to remove the cements and matrix.  Type examples  The type deposits are those at Pannawonnica and Robe River, in the Pilbara of Western Australia, which are currently mined by Rio Tinto Iron Ore. Channel iron deposits are rarer outside of the West Australian landmass, due to the relative youth of the regolith in the rest of the continental land masses, although there are smaller examples in Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan deposits are Oligocene in age and occur as ooidal ironstone deposits of deltaic or fluvial origin in the north-eastern continental sediments of northern Turgai and Aral'sk Districts. They occur on valleys excavated from uplifted Paleogene marine strata during subtropical conditions in the Late Oligocene. There is evidence of densely wooded valley fills and significant input of humic material, similar to the observed palaeoclimatic setting of the Pilbara examples. Grades reported for the Kazakh deposits are highly variable, from 29% Fe to 73% Fe, with higher phosphorus (0.5% to 2.5%), calcium and lower silica and aluminium.

She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1974 and B.A. in 1968 from Rhodes College, and is currently Distinguished Scholar Teacher at the University of Maryland. Research Darden's research has led to the publication of several books. In her 1991 book, Theory Change in Science, Darden argues, contra Kuhn, that science is a self-correcting enterprise which progresses through a thoroughly piecemeal process of \\"reiterative refinement,\\" consisting of three stages: (1) theory construction, (2) theory assessment, and (3) theory modification. Although there are similarities between stages (1) and (2) and the traditionally recognized contexts of scientific discovery and justification, Darden argues that her stages are not easily mapped onto this dichotomy. Furthermore, Darden attempts to illumine the \\"mysterious\\" process of constructing scientific theories by positing various \\"strategies\\" that she claims are sufficient for solving actual historical cases of theory change. For example, Darden examines the Mendelian \\"Theory of the Gene,\\" which underwent significant theoretical modifications from around 1900 (when Mendel was \\"rediscovered\\") to 1926 (when Thomas Hunt Morgan published his famous textbook defining Mendelian theory in its roughly modern form). Looking at these cases, Darden describes procedures for devising the hypotheses that early twentieth-century Mendelian theorists actually proposed, although she does not claim that these theorists actually employed such procedures, or strategies. Ultimately, by constructing a list of such strategies for discovery, Darden hopes that scientists can use them to solve present theoretical problems that contemporary science encounters. As such, she advises scientists to use them, calling her model \\"advisory\\" (rather than \\"descriptive\\" or \\"normative\\"). Darden has also worked on mechanisms, notably in her collaborative paper entitled \\"Thinking about Mechanisms\\" (2000), co- authored with Peter Machamer and Carl Craver. In 2006, Darden completed her second book, entitled Reasoning in Biological Discoveries: Essays on Mechanisms, Interfield Relations, and Anomaly Resolution. In it, Darden propounds a number of strategies for discovering mechanisms in biology, including \\"Schema Instantiation,\\" \\"Modular Subassembly,\\" and \\"Forward/Backward Chaining.\\" References External links *Darden's faculty page *Lindley Darden Publications Philosophers of science 1945 births Living people Philosophy of biology ","title":"Lindley Darden"},{"id":"12819734","title":"List of people considered father or mother of a field"},{"id":"12819735","text":"Sutton Grange may refer to: *Sutton Grange, North Yorkshire, a small settlement in North Yorkshire, England *Sutton Grange, Victoria, a small country town in Victoria, Australia *Sutton Grange, a settlement in Ellington High and Low ","title":"Sutton Grange"},{"id":"12819737","text":"RFK Grafiƒçar Beograd (Serbian Cyrillic: –§–ö –ì—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–∞—Ä –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥) is a football club based in Belgrade, Serbia.

The raids were executed by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces under Colonel L√™ Quang Tung, and combat police, both of which took their orders directly from Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, younger brother of the Roman Catholic President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. X√° L·ª£i Pagoda, the largest pagoda in the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, was the most prominent of the raided temples. Over 1,400 Buddhists were arrested, and estimates of the death toll and missing ranged up to the hundreds. In response to the Hu·∫ø Vesak shootings and a ban on the Buddhist flag in early May, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority rose in widespread civil disobedience and protest against the religious bias and discrimination of the Catholic-dominated Di·ªám government. Buddhist temples in major cities, most prominently the X√° L·ª£i pagoda, became focal points for protesters and assembly points for Buddhist monks from rural areas. In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals proposed the imposition of martial law, ostensibly to break up the demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders. Soon after midnight on 21 August, Nhu's men attacked the pagodas using automatic firearms, grenades, battering rams and explosives, causing widespread damage. Some religious objects were destroyed, including a statue of Gautama Buddha in the T·ª´ ƒê√†m Pagoda in Hu·∫ø, which was partially leveled by explosives. Temples were looted and vandalized, with the remains of venerated monks confiscated. In Hu·∫ø, violent street battles erupted between government forces and rioting pro-Buddhist, anti-government civilians. Initially, the Ng√¥ family claimed that the army had carried out the raids, something their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Di·ªám's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university and high school students boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ng√¥ family's power base.  Background  In South Vietnam, where the Buddhist majority was estimated to comprise between 70 and 90 percent of the population in 1963,Moyar, pp. 215‚Äì216.Tucker, pp. 49, 291, 293.Maclear, p. 63. President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám's pro-Catholic policies antagonized many Buddhists. A member of the Catholic minority, his government was biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions.Tucker, p. 291. Di·ªám once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting the man was from a Buddhist background, \\"Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted.\\" Many officers in the ARVN had converted to Catholicism in the belief that their career prospects depended on it, and many were refused promotion if they did not do so.Gettleman, pp. 280‚Äì282. Additionally, the distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias intended to repel Vi·ªát C·ªông guerrillas was done so that weapons were only given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran private armies,Warner, p. 210. and in some areas forced conversions; looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.Fall, p. 199. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diem's regime.Buttinger, p. 993. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the \\"private\\" status that was imposed on Buddhism by the French, which required official permission to conduct public activities, was not repealed by Di·ªám.Karnow, p. 294. The land owned by the church was exempt from land reform,Buttinger, p. 933. and Catholics were also de facto exempt from the corv√©e labor that the government obliged all other citizens to perform; public spending was disproportionately distributed to Catholic majority villages. Under Di·ªám, the Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and in 1959, he dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary.Jacobs p. 91. The Vatican flag was regularly flown at major public events in South Vietnam. alt=The flag consists of six vertical stripes, colored from left to right as blue, yellow, red, white and saffron. The sixth stripe consists of five squares from top to bottom in the same colors. The flag is rectangular. A rarely enforced 1958 law ‚Äî known as Decree Number 10 ‚Äî was invoked in May 1963 to prohibit the display of religious flags. This disallowed the flying of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists on the eve of the most important religious festival of the year, as a week earlier Catholics had been encouraged to display Vatican flags at a government-sponsored celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, the most senior Catholic cleric in the country.Hammer, pp. 103‚Äì05.Jacobs, p. 142. On 8 May in Hu·∫ø, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army broke up the demonstration by firing guns at and throwing grenades into the gathering, leaving nine people dead.Jacobs, p. 143.Hammer, pp. 113‚Äì14. Di·ªám's denial of governmental responsibility for the incident ‚Äî he instead blamed the Vi·ªát C·ªông ‚Äî added to the anger and discontent of the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement against the religious discrimination of the Roman Catholic‚Äìdominated Di·ªám regime, resulting in widespread large-scale civil disobedience among the South Vietnamese public, persisting throughout May and June. This period of political instability was known as the \\"Buddhist crisis\\". The objectives of the protests were to have Decree Number 10 repealed and to force implementation of religious equality.Jacobs, pp. 144‚Äì47.Jones, pp. 252‚Äì60. On 11 June, a Buddhist monk, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, self-immolated in downtown Saigon. Images were shown by news outlets across the world, embarrassing Di·ªám's government and bringing negative global attention. A few days later, under mounting American pressure, Di·ªám signed the Joint Communique with senior Buddhist leaders, making various concessions to the Buddhists, who in turn agreed to stop the civil unrest and return to normal life.Halberstam, pp. 125‚Äì29.Jones, pp. 275‚Äì77. Neither the Ng√¥ family nor the Buddhists were happy with the agreement, however, and it failed to solve the dispute. Both sides accused the other of failing to uphold their obligations; the government accused the Buddhists of continuing to vilify them in demonstrations, while the Buddhists accused Di·ªám of stalling and not acting on his commitments to religious reform, and continuing to detain arrested Buddhist dissidents.Jacobs, pp. 150‚Äì51. The demonstrations and tension continued throughout July and August, with more self-immolations and an altercation (known as the Double Seven Day scuffle) between secret police and American journalists reporting on a Buddhist protest.Prochnau, pp. 328‚Äì332.Langguth, pp. 218‚Äì19.  X√° L·ª£i  The hub of Buddhist activism in Saigon was the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda. Built in the late 1950s,Ray and Yanagihara, p. 332. it was the largest Buddhist temple in the capital and was located in the city center. Many monks from outside Saigon ‚Äî including prominent Buddhist leaders ‚Äî had congregated at X√° L·ª£i since the dispute began and it was used as a venue for press conferences, media interviews, publication of pamphlets and to plan and organize mass demonstrations.Jacobs, p. 145. At the time, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu was known to favor an even harder line against the Buddhists. Nhu was the younger brother of President Di·ªám and his main confidant, and was regarded as the real power behind the Ng√¥ family's rule.Jacobs, pp. 86‚Äì88. Nhu had made statements calling for the suppression of the protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam.Halberstam, p. 139. There were persistent reports that Nhu was seeking to usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish X√° L·ª£i in two hours, and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the American embassy largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.Halberstam, p. 140. In the meantime, Nhu prepared the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel L√™ Quang Tung ‚Äî who took his orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals ‚Äî for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Vi·ªát C·ªông, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ng√¥ family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent the majority of their time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.Jacobs, p. 167.Karnow, pp. 306, 309. On Sunday, 18 August, the Buddhists staged a mass protest at X√° L·ª£i, attracting around 15,000 people, undeterred by rain.Sheehan, p. 354. The attendance was approximately three times higher than that at the previous Sunday's rally.Hammer, p. 164.Dommen, p. 524. The event lasted for several hours, as speeches by the monks interspersed religious ceremonies. A Vietnamese journalist said that it was the only emotional public gathering in South Vietnam since Di·ªám's rise to power almost a decade earlier. David Halberstam of The New York Times speculated that by not exploiting the large crowd by staging a protest march towards Gia Long Palace or other government buildings, the Buddhists were saving their biggest demonstration for the scheduled arrival of new U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. the following week. As a government attack on X√° L·ª£i was anticipated, Halberstam concluded that the Buddhists were playing \\"a fast and dangerous game\\".Halberstam, p. 141. He wrote that \\"the Buddhists themselves appeared to be at least as much aware of all the developments, and their protest seemed to have a mounting intensity\\".  Planning  On the evening of 18 August, ten senior ARVN generals met to discuss the situation regarding the Buddhist unrest and decided martial law was needed. They wanted to disperse the monks who had gathered in Saigon and other regional cities and return them to their original pagodas in the rural areas.Jones, p. 300. Nhu summoned 7 of the 10 generals to Gia Long Palace on August 20 for consultations. They presented their request for martial law and discussed how to disband the groups of monks and their supporters from the temples in Saigon. Nhu sent the generals to see Diem. The president listened to the group of seven, led by General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n. The group also included Army Chief General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m and General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, commander of the II Corps in the Central Highlands. Khi√™m and Kh√°nh were two of the officers who were responsible for helping to put down the attempted coup against Di·ªám in 1960. Also present was ƒê√¥n's brother-in-law, General ƒê·ªó Cao Tr√≠, commander of I Corps, which oversaw the northernmost region around Hu·∫ø, and General L√™ VƒÉn Kim, head of the military academy. Tr√≠ and Kim were favorites of the Di·ªám regime.Jacobs, pp. 168‚Äì69. General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, a brash paratrooper, who was also South Vietnam's youngest-ever general, commanded the III Corps surrounding Saigon. General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao was the commander of the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta and the only one of the septet who would prove not to have been involved in the later plotting against Di·ªám.Hammer, p. 166. ƒê√≠nh and Cao controlled the two corps regions closest to Saigon and therefore the two areas most crucial in the success or failure of a coup. Cao had used the Seventh Division of his IV Corps to storm the capital in 1960 to save Di·ªám.Hammer, pp. 285‚Äì86. alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black- haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n claimed communists had infiltrated the monks at X√° L·ª£i and warned that ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest and consequent disruption of the war effort. He claimed it was possible that the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace. Hearing this, Di·ªám agreed to declare martial law effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet, and troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Don was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in place of General L√™ VƒÉn T·ªµ, who was terminally ill with cancer and receiving medical treatment abroad. ƒê√¥n claimed Di·ªám was concerned for the welfare of the monks, allegedly telling the generals that he did not want any of them hurt. The martial law orders were then signed and authorized by ƒê√¥n. The real purpose of ƒê√¥n asking for martial law was to maneuver troops in readiness for a coup, and he had no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas.Karnow, p. 301.Halberstam, pp. 144‚Äì45. ƒê√≠nh, the officer most trusted by the Ng√¥ family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.Halberstam, p. 181. With the approval of Di·ªám, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose a time when he knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire,Halberstam, p. 145. to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation ‚Äî which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts.Hammer, p. 167. The raids were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.Halberstam, pp. 139‚Äì42.  Raids  = Saigon = 240px The Buddhists in Saigon were aware that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist relatives of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into the region in the lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furnitureHalberstam, p. 142. and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.Prochnau, p. 366. In the afternoon before the raids, trucks filled with soldiers headed past the offices of media outlets‚Äîfrom where the journalists saw them‚Äîdestined for the ·∫§n Quang Pagoda. More troops were seen congregating at police headquarters, ready to board trucks moving towards X√° L·ª£i.Halberstam, pp. 142‚Äì43. The American-made trucks had been provided as part of the U.S. military aid program for South Vietnam. Late at night, the convoys arrived and surrounded X√° L·ª£i from several sides, causing a traffic jam in the city center. Several thousand personnel were estimated to have been present.Halberstam, p. 143. Journalists were informed as soon as the attacks began, even as Nhu's men cut communications lines, and rushed to X√° L·ª£i.Prochnau, p. 367. Squads of Special Forces and combat police flattened the gates and smashed their way into the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August as X√° L·ª£i's brass gong was struck to signal the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades and tear gas. The red- bereted Special Forces were joined by truckloads of steel-helmeted combat police in army camouflage uniforms.Jones, p. 297. Two of Nhu's senior aides were seen outside X√° L·ª£i directing the operation, while Nhu and his wife, Madame Nhu, watched the action from a nearby tank. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The sound of the pagoda's gong was largely masked by that of automatic weapons fire, exploding grenades, battering rams, shattering glass and human screaming.Jacobs, p. 153. The military personnel shouted as they attacked, as did the occupants, in fear. Tung's men charged forward in a V-shaped riot formation. According to Halberstam, \\"they pranced into the pagoda, looking something like a smart football team coming up to the line of scrimmage\\". In the end, it took around two hours to complete the raids because many of the occupants had entrenched themselves inside the various rooms in anticipation of the attacks and doors had to be unhinged to reach them. According to journalist Neil Sheehan, who was at the scene, \\"The raid on X√° L·ª£i, like those on the pagodas elsewhere in South Vietnam, was flawlessly executed. It reminded me of a scene from a movie of the French Resistance‚Äîthe scene when the Gestapo arrive at the Resistance hideout in Paris.\\"Sheehan, p. 355. William Prochnau said that \\"Using the elite guard against the Buddhists was analogous to using Green Berets to put down Negro protests at home. It was outrageous.\\"Prochnau, p. 368. One monk was thrown from a balcony down to the courtyard six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped the back wall of X√° L·ª£i to enter the grounds of the adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.Sheehan, p. 356. Th√≠ch T·ªãnh Khi·∫øt, the 80-year-old Buddhist patriarch, was seized and taken to a military hospital on the outskirts of Saigon.Hammer, p. 168. As commander of the III Corps, General ƒê√≠nh soon announced military control over Saigon, canceling all commercial flights into the city and instituting press censorship.Jones, p. 298. Later, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô, one of the leading arrested monks, who later would become a leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, explained the protest strategy. After being released following the deposal of Di·ªám, he was asked why the Buddhist leaders had not fled to avoid arrest. He said that \\"We had done nothing wrong; therefore we could not flee. If we had, it would have been an admission that we were guilty.\\"Halberstam, pp. 143‚Äì44. = Hu·∫ø = 240px alt=A green colored pond is at the front of a temple entrance. From the pond, there are paved stone steps up to the front of the temple, which is surrounded by a stone wall and a red triple gate with two levels and tiles. The area is surrounded by green shrubs and trees. The violence was worse in Hu·∫ø, where the approach of government forces was met by the beating of Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left their homes in the middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At T·ª´ ƒê√†m, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang,Dommen, pp. 508‚Äì11. monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.Jacobs, pp. 152‚Äì53. The most determined resistance to the Di·ªám regime occurred outside the Di·ªáu ƒê·∫ø Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with their bare hands. The protesters fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and their bare fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were fired at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Di·ªáu ƒê·∫ø left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded. Ten truckloads of bridge defenders were taken to jail and an estimated 500 people were arrested in the city. Seventeen of the 47 professors at Hu·∫ø University, who had resigned earlier in the week in protest against the dismissal of the rector Cao VƒÉn Lu√¢n, a Catholic priest and opponent of Archbishop Th·ª•c (elder brother of Di·ªám and Nhu) were also arrested. The raids were repeated in cities and towns across the country. The total number of dead and disappeared was never confirmed, but estimates range up to several hundred. At least 1,400 were arrested.  U.S. reaction and sanctuary for monks  The United States became immediately embroiled in the attacks following the escape of the two monks over the back wall of the X√° L·ª£i pagoda into the adjacent USAID compound. Saigon's police chief, disguised as a member of Nhu's Republican Youth, cordoned off the building. He ordered all Vietnamese inside to leave the area and threatened to storm the building when the Americans denied him entry. Foreign Minister V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u rushed to the scene to stop any physical confrontation, but demanded the Americans turn over the monks. William Trueheart, the deputy of the recently relieved U.S. Ambassador Nolting, arrived at the building. As the leading American diplomat in Vietnam in the transition period between ambassadors, Trueheart refused to take action until he received instructions from Washington, but warned M·∫´u against violating the diplomatic immunity of the USAID offices. Trueheart knew that handing over the monks would imply American approval of the regime's action. The confrontation soon died down, and the U.S. State Department ordered Trueheart not to release the two monks and to regard the USAID building as being equivalent to the embassy. More monks went on to find sanctuary in the U.S. embassy, which became known as the \\"Buddhist Hilton\\".Jones, p. 299. Lodge was in Honolulu for last minute briefings with Nolting when news filtered through of the pagoda raids. He was given directions to proceed directly to Saigon, and arrived after sunset on 22 August. In the meantime, the State Department denounced the raids as a \\"direct violation by the Vietnamese government of assurances that it was pursuing a policy of reconciliation with the Buddhists\\". On 23 August, Lodge's first full day in Saigon, he visited the two monks who had taken refuge in the USAID building, and ordered that vegetarian food be made available for them. The meeting was a means of showing where American government policy stood on the attacks against the Buddhists.Hammer, p. 171.  Di·ªám reaction  alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. At 06:00 on 21 August 1963, President Di·ªám broadcast a statement on Radio Saigon in which he said: \\"under Article 44 of the constitution, I declare a state of siege throughout the national territory. I confer upon the Army of the Republic of Vietnam the responsibility to restore security and public order so that the state may be protected, Communism defeated, freedom secured, and democracy achieved.\\" Under martial law, the army was given blanket search-and- arrest powers and was empowered to ban all public gatherings, enforce a curfew, restrict press freedom and stop the circulation of all \\"printed material and other documents harmful to public order and security\\".Halberstam, p. 144. The military were given orders to shoot anybody who violated the curfew on sight, and the secret police used the increased powers to raid and vandalize the premises of anyone thought to be unfriendly to the regime. Government sources claimed that in X√° L·ª£i, ·∫§n Quang, and various Theravada pagodas, soldiers had found machine guns, ammunition, plastic explosives, homemade mines, daggers, and Vi·ªát C·ªông documents. It was later discovered that they had been planted there by Nhu's men.Jones, pp. 298‚Äì99. A few days later, Madame Nhu, a Catholic convert from Buddhism, said in an interview that the raids were \\"the happiest day in my life since we crushed the B√¨nh Xuy√™n in 1955\\", and assailed the Buddhists as \\"communists\\".Halberstam, p. 146. On 29 August,Moyar, p. 460. General ƒê√≠nh held a press conference in which he accused the Americans of trying to launch a coup in South Vietnam and took credit for the raids, despite Tung having been the chief military officer in charge.Halberstam, pp. 181‚Äì82.Karnow, p. 317.  Confusion over culpability and army denials  The driving force behind the government assault on the Buddhists appeared to have come from senior military commanders acting without consulting the civilian government. Immediately after the attacks, posters were erected across Saigon under the aegis of ARVN, but the language was recognized as that of Nhu. The Secretary of State Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Thu·∫≠n and Interior Minister B√πi VƒÉn L∆∞∆°ng were caught off guard by the attacks. The initial perception was that the military establishment had suddenly cracked down on the Buddhists because they were deemed to be a threat to the war effort. The government propagated a theory which held that the military felt compelled to take action after pro-Buddhist student unrest on 17‚Äì18 August. In Hu·∫ø, student protestors had turned on an ARVN officer after he fired in their direction. The attacks were preceded by a large rally at X√° L·ª£i during which some monks had called for the overthrow of the Di·ªám regime and denounced the anti-Buddhist statements of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu. However, observers dismissed government claims that the raids were spontaneous. Di·ªám had long distrusted his generals and frequently played them against each other in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Vi·ªát C·ªông infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.Jones, p. 305. The initial government line was that the regular army had taken the actions. ARVN radio broadcasts bore the influence of Nhu's abrasive tone in directing the Republican Youth to cooperate with the government. Nhu accused the Buddhists of turning their pagodas into headquarters for plotting anti- government insurrections. He claimed the Buddhist Intersect Committee operated under the control of \\"political speculators who exploited religion and terrorism\\". Lodge believed Di·ªám remained in control but that Nhu's influence had risen to unprecedented levels. He thought that Nhu's divide and conquer tactics had split the military into three factions, respectively led by Generals ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh, and Colonel Tung. ƒê√¥n was believed not to have the allegiance of ƒê√≠nh and Tung, who took their orders directly from Gia Long Palace. The two loyalists had support from various pro-Di·ªám elements. Lodge predicted that if the army deposed Di·ªám, fighting could break out within the ARVN.Jones, p. 306. Initially, the American embassy believed the Ng√¥ family's claims that the regular army was responsible for the raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Di·ªámist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ng√¥ family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, and the fact that the army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.Halberstam, pp. 145‚Äì46. The New York Times printed two versions of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version.Halberstam, p. 148. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ng√¥ family hit list along with political dissidents because of their expos√©s of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official.Sheehan, pp. 356‚Äì57.Prochnau, p. 374. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.Prochnau, pp. 364‚Äì65. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) went on to report that ARVN officers resolutely denied any involvement in the pagoda raids. They held that Tung's Special Forces had disguised themselves in ARVN uniforms before attacking the pagodas. Further unsubstantiated rumors had spread within the army that the Americans, who trained the Special Forces, had helped to plan the attack. The ARVN leaders were unsure of how to proceed and Don called a staff meeting on the morning of 23 August to discuss impending demonstrations against the raids by university students and the anger of junior ARVN officers about the pagoda attacks. General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh noted that the ongoing presence of armed military personnel had alienated society by creating an \\"aura of suppression\\". Later in the day, ƒê√¥n privately met with CIA officer Lucien Conein and reiterated that the Americans were mistaken in believing that the ARVN was responsible. ƒê√¥n insisted that Diem remained in control although Nhu had to approve all of the generals' meetings with Di·ªám. ƒê√¥n insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that the generals had too much power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit the generals by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. ƒê√¥n insisted that he was unaware of the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters with Khi√™m when he received a radio message informing him of the assaults. Police Commissioner Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Tu, supported by Tung's men, were in charge of the operation at ground level, and by the time Don arrived, the mission had been completed.Jones, pp. 307‚Äì08. Khi√™m had his own meeting with Rufus Phillips at the U.S. Embassy. He bitterly confided that Nhu had tricked the army into imposing martial law and becoming his \\"puppet\\". Khi√™m asserted that ƒê√≠nh, ƒê√¥n and the other generals were not aware of the raids in advance and revealed that the arms and explosives that Nhu claimed were found in the pagodas had been planted. As a result, the Vietnamese people expressed anger at the army and their U.S. backers, strengthening Nhu's position.Jones, p. 309.  Martial law and riots  Following the raids, tensions were high in the streets of the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled. The pagoda raids provoked widespread disquiet among the Saigonese. At midnight on 22 August, Generals ƒê√¥n, ƒê√≠nh and Khi√™m informed Nhu that student demonstrations were planned for three consecutive days. They recommended that schools be closed, but when Nhu took them to see Di·ªám, the president refused to close the educational institutions. Di·ªám decided the students, not usually known for political activism,Halberstam, p. 153. should be allowed to voice their opinions. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which was met with arrests, imprisonment, and the closure of the campus. These events were repeated at Hu·∫ø University, which was likewise shut down. When high school students followed the lead of their elders and demonstrated, Di·ªám had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded at a press conference in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Di·ªám and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school windows and erecting banners that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps.Jacobs, pp. 153‚Äì54. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have their children or younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials.Halberstam, p. 154. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.Sheehan, p. 358. alt=A middle-aged lady wearing a light-coloured dress and with short hair, fluffy at the front, sits at a dinner table smiling. To the right is a taller, older man in a dark suit, striped tie and light shirt who is turning his head to the left, talking to her. A man in a suit is visible, standing in the background. Foreign Minister V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest. M·∫´u had decided to leave the country for a religious pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ng√¥ family had him arrested.Sheehan, p. 357. General ƒê√≠nh softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail. Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Ch∆∞∆°ng, the ambassador to the United States and father of the de facto first lady Madame Nhu, resigned in protest,Karnow, p. 302. along with all but one of the staff members at the embassy.Halberstam, p. 151. Ch∆∞∆°ng charged Di·ªám with having \\"copied the tactics of totalitarian regimes\\",Jacobs, p. 154. and said that as long as Di·ªám and the Nhus were in power, there was \\"not once chance in a hundred for victory\\" against the communists. Madame Ch∆∞∆°ng ‚Äî who was South Vietnam's observer at the United Nations ‚Äî resigned and spoke of mass executions and a reign of terror under Di·ªám and Nhu. She predicted that if Di·ªám and the Nhus did not leave Vietnam then they would be killed in some sort of uprising. Voice of America announced that Ch∆∞∆°ng had resigned in protest against the Ng√¥ family's policies, but this was denied by the Saigon government, which asserted the Ch∆∞∆°ngs had been sacked. Di·ªám bureaucrats claimed Ch∆∞∆°ng's last telegram had been so critical of the regime that it was determined to be \\"inadmissible in form and substance\\" and that after years of privately complaining about his ambassador, Di·ªám dismissed him.Hammer, p. 173. In the meantime, the brothers made selective payments to some generals, hoping to cause resentment and division within the army. Vietnamese civil servants also became more reluctant to do their jobs, especially in conjunction with American advisers. They reasoned that as the Americans were funding Tung's men, they must have been involved in the attacks.  Change in U.S. policy  Once the U.S. government realized the truth about who was behind the raids, they reacted with disapproval towards the Di·ªám regime. The Americans had pursued a policy of quietly and privately advising the Ng√¥s to reconcile with the Buddhists while publicly supporting the partnership, but following the attacks, this route was regarded as untenable. Furthermore, the attacks were carried out by American-trained Special Forces personnel funded by the CIA, and presented Lodge with a fait accompli.Halberstam, p. 147. One Western ambassador thought that the raids signaled \\"the end of the gallant American effort here\\". The U.S. State Department issued a statement declaring that the raids were a \\"direct violation\\" of the promise to pursue \\"a policy of reconciliation\\". On 24 August, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to Lodge at the embassy in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek the removal of the Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Di·ªám refused to heed American pressure for reform. As the probability of Di·ªám sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup.Jacobs, pp. 162‚Äì63.Karnow, pp. 303‚Äì04.Halberstam, pp. 157‚Äì58. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility.Halberstam, p. 152. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ng√¥ brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.Jacobs, pp. 165‚Äì75.

At the time of the 2011 Census the population of the civil parish remained less than 100. Details are included in the civil parish of Worleston. History Poole was a late Saxon village; the name derives from the Saxon Pol, meaning a pool. Two holdings were recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086, with a total population of 9, greater than any of the surrounding manors except Acton. A coppice or small wood was recorded. Before the Norman Conquest, it was held by Wulfeva, described as \\"a free woman\\", and afterwards by William Malbank (or Malbedeng), the first Baron of Wich Malbank (Nantwich).Latham, pp. 16, 18, 20The Domesday Book Online: Cheshire L‚ÄìZ (accessed 5 April 2010)Husain, p. 26 At this time, Poole fell within the Forest of Mondrem, the southern half of Delamere Forest.

It was his eleventh solo studio album and was released in 2006 on Frontier, Demolition, Sony BMG and Yamaha records. History Music for the Divine, the follow-up to 2005's Soul Mover marked a continued increase in Hughes' popularity. The album contains a more varied approach than his previous albums, songs like \\"Steppin' On\\", \\"Too High\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\" follow Hughes' regular style of funk infused hard rock, but other songs like \\"Frail\\" and \\"The Divine\\" are mellower and lean towards acoustic songwriting. There is a heavy use of acoustic guitar on many of the tracks as well as some orchestration. This is the second Hughes album to feature Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith on the entirety of the record. The record was also co-produced by Smith and was recorded at his home in the Hollywood Hills; the album artwork features pictures taken during the recording process. The album features Hughes' regular guitarist JJ Marsh, who co-wrote the majority of the songs with Hughes. Other performances come from South African composer Mark Kilian who arranged the string sections and played keyboards and Chad Smith's Red Hot Chili Peppers' bandmate John Frusciante, who plays guitar on two tracks. Music for the Divine was mixed by Ryan Hewitt, who has also worked with Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante, Blink-182, Alkaline Trio and many others. The European version of the album includes a cover of the Moody Blues song \\"Nights in White Satin\\", featuring Frusciante. This was originally featured on the soundtrack for the 2005 film Stealth and also appeared on the Australian version of Soul Mover. The version on Music for the Divine is a slightly different mix. The Japanese version includes a bonus track, which is an acoustic rough version of \\"This House\\". The Australian version, released in 2007 included two bonus tracks, the first is a different version of \\"Monkey Man\\" which features Australian singer Jimmy Barnes performing backing vocals. The second bonus track is a cover of Led Zeppelin‚Äôs \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", which was recorded in 2005 with Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell. Promotional videos were shot for the songs \\"This House\\", \\"The Divine\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\" (which featured Barnes).

He was best known for his biographies of Aleister Crowley (The Legacy of the Beast) and Israel Regardie (Crowley's Apprentice). Family life Suster was born 2 August 1951 in Hampstead, London, and was educated at Highgate School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Suster's father, Ilya Suster, an entrepreneur in the egg products industry, was born Ilya Shusterovich in Harbin, Manchuria on 17 October 1914, grew up in Hamburg, Germany, and emigrated with his family to the United Kingdom in 1938. Gerald Suster was married twice, in 1975 to Ann Nash (marriage dissolved) and in 1992 to Michaela Antonina Duncan (1948‚Äì2001). Occult activities While working in California Gerald Suster met Israel Regardie and Gerald Yorke, two of the few remaining occultists who had studied directly under Aleister Crowley. Suster made great progress in A‚à¥A‚à¥, and became a well-known figure in the London occult and pagan scenes. He prefaced every speech & comment with the words: \\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\\"; the immediate source of the utterance is the Book of the Law. In 1989 he became a tutor at Boarzell Tutorial College in Sussex; however his teaching career came to an abrupt end when he was featured in an expos√© of his occult activities in the News of the World newspaper on 16 April 1989. Suster sued the paper for libel, citing extensive damage to his livelihood arising from the article and various lies by the reporter Chris Blythe. News International paid ¬£10,000 into court; Suster accepted the offer and got ¬£80,000 of costs from them. After the case, Gerald Suster & his new wife went on honeymoon to Madrid. On their return, he focused on being a full-time author, producing books of biography, occultism, and erotica. He called his new occupation \\"my most productive period of creative writing\\". Suster died on 3 February 2001 in London. The Suster family buried the body in the ground of the local Anglican church. The Central London Pagan Scene held a goetic memorial for him in the upper room of The Princess Louise in Holborn, one of Suster's long-time haunts.

Life and work  Although little is known about the life of Thymaridas, it is believed that he was a rich man who fell into poverty. It is said that Thestor of Poseidonia traveled to Paros in order to help Thymaridas with the money that was collected for him. Iamblichus states that Thymaridas called prime numbers \\"rectilinear\\", since they can only be represented on a one-dimensional line. Non-prime numbers, on the other hand, can be represented on a two-dimensional plane as a rectangle with sides that, when multiplied, produce the non-prime number in question. He further called the number one a \\"limiting quantity\\". Iamblichus in his comments to Introductio arithmetica states that Thymaridas also worked with simultaneous linear equations. In particular, he created the then famous rule that was known as the \\"bloom of Thymaridas\\" or as the \\"flower of Thymaridas\\", which states that: > If the sum of n quantities be given, and also the sum of every pair > containing a particular quantity, then this particular quantity is equal to > 1/(n + 2) [this is a typo in Flegg's book the denominator should be n ‚àí 2 to > match the math below] of the difference between the sums of these pairs and > the first given sum. or using modern notation, the solution of the following system of n linear equations in n unknowns: : begin{align} x + x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{n-1} &= s,  x + x_1 &= m_1,  x + x_2 &= m_2,  &~~vdots  x + x_{n-1} &= m_{n-1} end{align} is given by : x = frac{(m_1 + m_2 + cdots + m_{n-1}) - s}{n - 2}.

Biography Morris was born in Blenheim, Ontario on July 12, 1868. He attended public schools in Ontario, and moved to Medicine Hat, Alberta upon graduating. He relocated to Lethbridge shortly thereafter. In Lethbridge, he was manager for general merchant J. H. Cavanagh until 1895 and also served on the Lethbridge City Council as an alderman and as president of the Lethbridge Board of Trade. He married Margaret Drummond Jardine in June 1895; the pair would have four children. He came to Edmonton in 1897 to open J. H. Morris & Company. The following year he also established a wholesale grocery. He ran for Edmonton Town Council in the 1900 municipal election, and finished second of eight candidates, making him one of three people elected to two year terms as aldermen. He completed his term, but did not seek re-election at its expiration. Morris served as president of the Edmonton Board of Trade (now the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce) and the Edmonton Exhibition Association. He was also active in the Anglican Church, the Masonic Order, and the Independent Order of Foresters. Joseph Morris was the owner of Edmonton's first automobile, a 1903 Ford Model A that he brought to town on May 25, 1904. Accordingly, he was granted license place number one. According to legend, until 1905 motorists in what would become Alberta were responsible for making their own license plates, and Morris elected to use a broomstick. He was brought into court for having an unsatisfactory license plate, but was able to convince the judge that displaying the broomstick vertically at the back of the car satisfied the requirement that his license number be displayed. Whether the legend is true or not, in 1905 Morris was issued with a leather license plate with the number one. Joseph Morris died in 1939.

It was published every two weeks and available free of charge in more than 300 locations throughout Knox and Blount counties. The paper debuted on April 20, 2006 and ceased publication on January 8, 2009. The summer 2007 sale of Knoxville alternative weekly Metro Pulse to media conglomerate E.W. Scripps, owner of the daily Knoxville News Sentinel, left the Knoxville Voice as the only major, general-interest independent alternative newspaper in Knoxville until it ceased publication.  Origins and influences  The Knoxville Voice was originally an African American newspaper, also published in Knoxville and devoted to minority cultural and civil rights issues. The oldest surviving issue (dated November 19, 1949) \\"focused almost exclusively on national news stories pertinent to African Americans, with a greater emphasis on the work of the NAACP to obtain equal rights, providing a glimpse of the beginnings of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\\": Copies of the two known surviving issues, dated 9/18/1948 and 11/19/49, are on display at the Knoxville Voice office downtown. The paper continues an editorial tradition of alternative media that extends beyond Knoxville. The spectrum of influences runs from labor-run papers like the British Daily Herald to muckraking newsletters like I.F. Stone's Weekly. Like its local, national, and international predecessors, Knoxville Voice practiced advocacy journalism, covering stories as they affect the public at large and filling gaps in reporting left by mainstream media. With most mainstream media outlets owned by a handful of multinational corporations, polls regularly report that nearly half the U.S. public has little or no \\"trust and confidence\\" in the mass media.: When asked, \\"In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media ‚Äî such as newspapers, T.V. and radio ‚Äî when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately, and fairly,\\" 37% answered \\"not very much\\" and 12% answered \\"none at all.\\" The responses have been consistent for a decade. Knoxville Voice is a reflection of such public attitudes embodied in its reporting and approach to news coverage. Knoxville Voice published bi-weekly with a focus on local news and cultural events.  Notable editorial features  Knoxville Voice regularly published opinion-editorial articles from notable local and national commentators, including the award-winning columnist Don Williams, local nuclear nonproliferation activist Ralph Hutchison, and scholar and activist Noam Chomsky. In early 2007, Don Williams left the News Sentinel, the Scripps- owned daily after 20 years and began writing a regular column and online blog for Knoxville Voice. Knoxville Voice was the only local newspaper to publish an article critical of the controversial summer 2006 deal involving the long- term leasing of the Sunsphere, the iconic Knoxville structure built for the 1982 World's Fair.

Marco Marazzoli (1602? - 26 January 1662) was an Italian priest and Baroque music composer. Early life Born at Parma, Marazzoli received early training as a priest, and was ordained around 1625. He moved to Rome in 1626, and entered the service of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. In 1631, he and other musicians such as Filippo Vitali and Landi accompanied the cardinal on a trip to Urbino and may have accompanied him on other official travels. In 1637, Marazzoli was appointed Barberini's aiutante di camera, and became a tenor in the papal chapel that same year; in 1639 he was awarded the position of musico under Barberini. Barberini patronage About this time, it becomes possible to trace some of Marazzoli's compositions to specific places and functions. In 1638, he composed the music for a ballet La piazza d'Orlando for the Carnival of Venice and the intermedi for Chi soffre, speri for the Carnival of 1639. These two pieces were performed at the Palazzo Barberini. After 1640, he began composing more for patrons in Ferrara and Venice, including an opera, L'Amore trionfante dello Sdegno (or L'Armida), for a Ferrarese wedding in 1641. Also in 1641, the Barberini were embroiled in the Wars of Castro, and Marazzoli set the events of the battle fought by Taddeo Barberini and Luigi Mattei in October 1641 to music in Le pretensioni del Tebro e del Po, probably composed late in 1641. Marazzoli's L'Armida was performed in a revised version in January 1642 at a celebratory fete. At Carnival in 1642, Marazzoli had another opera performed, Gli amori di Giasone e d'Isifile; following this, Marazzoli returned to Ferrara and directed another performance of Le pretensioni to celebrate Taddeo Barberini's return to the city in March 1642. Returning to Rome by midyear, Marazzoli composed the opera Il giudito della ragione tra la Belt√† e l'Affetto (or Il Capriccio), which was first given at Carnival 1643. Towards the end of 1642, Marazzoli was granted papal permission to travel to Paris with a group of Italian musicians; here he was employed at the court of Anne of Austria, composing chamber cantatas which greatly pleased his patron. Barberini exile In April 1645 he returned again to Rome, finding to his chagrin that the Barberini family had been exiled to France (where they would remain until 1653). He then turned to composing oratorios both in Latin and Italian, some of which were written for the Arciconfraternita del SS Crocifisso. Barberini return Upon Antonio Barberini's return, he commissioned an opera from Marazzoli for the wedding of Taddeo Barberini's son Maffeo Barberini; pressed for time, Marazzoli collaborated with Antonio Maria Abbatini to create Dal male il bene, given at Carnival 1654 at Barberini's theater. Le armi e gli amori was to be given at Carnival 1655, but the papal conclave of 1655 interrupted production, and it was not given until 1656, alongside Dal male il bene and Marazzoli's latest opera, Vita humana (composed to honor the visiting Queen Christina of Sweden). Marazzoli may have composed the prologue to a ballet by Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1657 entitled L'Amour malade, but this is not certain. From 1655 Marazzoli composed works commissioned by Pope Alexander VII, including festival cantatas. Alexander named him cameriere extra in 1656, but a plague hit that year, and musical life in Rome ebbed until 1660. Marazzoli was also a famed harpist, and played the gilded three-rank \\"Barberini harp\\", which was painted by Giovanni Lanfranco and which is now owned by the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali in Rome. Marazzoli was seriously hurt in an accident during a mass at the Sistine Chapel on 25 January 1662, and died the following day.

Biography He was born on November 15, 1885, in the Leesburg section of Maurice River Township, New Jersey. He played in the outfield for the Detroit Tigers on May 18, 1912. Three days earlier, Tigers' star Ty Cobb was taunted with racial slurs in New York by a fan named Claude Lueker. Cobb lost his cool, went into the stands, and attacked the heckler. The heckler was handicapped, having lost one complete hand and three fingers from the other hand in an industrial accident, and unable to defend himself. When fans yelled at Cobb that the man had no hands, Cobb shouted back, \\"I don't care if he has no feet!\\" American League president Ban Johnson responded by suspending Cobb indefinitely. Cobb's teammates voted to strike in response to Cobb's suspension, declaring that they would not take the field again until Cobb was reinstated. Ban Johnson refused to back down and told Tigers owner Frank Navin that the team would be fined $5,000 for every game in which they failed to field a team. Navin ordered manager Hughie Jennings to find players willing to take the field. The Tigers were on the road in Philadelphia, and so Jennings recruited eight \\"Tigers\\" from a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. Each man was paid $25. A 26-year-old \\"Hap\\" Ward was one of the local \\"sandlotters\\" who ended playing for the Tigers in one of the worst defeats in major league history. \\"Hap\\" Ward played in the outfield for the replacement Tigers. He went hitless in two at bats but played flawlessly in the outfield with two putouts and no errors. In front of 20,000 Philadelphia fans, the Athletics set a club scoring record in trouncing the replacement Tigers by a score of 24‚Äì2. The Tigers' starting pitcher, Allan Travers was a college student who later confessed he had never pitched a game in his life. Travers later became a Catholic priest. After the embarrassing display, Ban Johnson met personally with the striking Tigers and told them they would be banned for life if the strike continued. Ty Cobb urged his teammates to end the strike, and the Tigers complied. Accordingly, the major league career of \\"Hap\\" Ward and the other replacement Tigers was cut short at one game. By playing in this game, Ward became a small piece of baseball history with his name and \\"career\\" statistics recorded forever in the records of Major League Baseball along with Ty Cobb and other legends of the game.

He held a regent position kampaku from 1690 to 1703. Early life and family He was a son of regent Konoe Hisatsugu and a concubine. Motohiro was not considered a legitimate member at first, but his father Hisatsugu and his wife, Princess Shoshi, a daughter of Emperor Go- Mizunoo, had no child and Hisatsu died in Motohiro's childhood. Thus by an imperial order from Go-Mizunoo, Motohiro was installed in the Konoe lineage, and grew up under imperial protection. In 1654 he performed his genpuku ceremony and entered adulthood and therefore courtier life. In 1664 he married Princess Joshi, another daughter of Emperor Go-Mizunoo and his consort. With her he had a son, Iehiro, and a daughter, Teruko, who was a consort of Tokugawa Ienobu, the 6th sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa shogunate. Political career After his entrance to the court, he served three emperors: Emperor Go-Mizunoo, Emperor Reigen and Emperor Higashiyama. Go-Mizunoo was his protector since his childhood, so his early career was prospective along with his noble lineage. But Emperor Reigen did not get along with the Tokugawa shogunate, and considered Motohiro sympathetic to the Shogunate, hence his career in Reigen's court was not as splendid. Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, the shogun at that time, was not warm to Ienobu at all, one of the candidates for his successor, hence also Motohiro, as the father-in-law of Ienobu. In Higashiyama's court, Motohiro however gained power again. He served as kampaku, the most powerful courtier from 1690 to 1703. After he quit, he had his supporters, including his own son, succeed the kampaku position respectively, and kept his influence. In 1704 the Tokugawa shogunate designated Ienobu, Motohiro's son-in-law, the successor of Tsunayoshi, hence the future shogun. His relation to the shogunate was therefore strengthened. Motohiro visited Edo twice, and was even welcomed to give political opinions, however it made the terms between ex-Emperor Reigen and him worse. Emperor Reigen even cursed him at Shimogamo Shrine, and accused him of being a \\"bad subject who privatizes and bends laws and justice\\" (ÁßÅÊõ≤ÈÇ™‰Ωû„ÅÆÊÇ™Ëá£) in his cursing prayer. However Motohiro was not always a supporter of Shogunate politics, and publicly objected to the Shogunate over some of their pressure on the imperial court. In 1722 he died and was buried at Daitoku-ji. He wrote a diary from 1655 until his death, later titled Diary of Lord Motohiro (Âü∫ÁÜàÂÖ¨Ë®ò).

He is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a specialist on the Chicago school of architecture. Bruegmann is best known for his research on the architectural firm of Holabird & Root, and is also a commentator on urban sprawl.  Life and career  Bruegmann received his B.A. from Principia College in 1970 and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1976 with a dissertation on late 18th and early 19th century European hospitals and other institutions. In 1977 he became assistant professor in the Art History Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he is currently professor with appointments in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning and Policy. He also taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia College of the Arts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University, and has worked for the Historic American Buildings Survey of the National Park Service. Bruegmann's fields of research and teaching are architectural, urban, landscape, and planning history and historical preservation. He has received scholarships and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Graham Foundation, the Buell Center for the study of American Architecture at Columbia University and the Institute for the Humanities and the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His research on Holabird & Root (earlier known as Holabird & Roche) in the 1980s improved public awareness of that firm's contributions to the commercial architecture of Chicago and other cities. A comprehensive three-volume catalog of the firm's commissions from 1910-1940 was followed by a book describing the firm's first four decades and influence on Chicago. In recent years Bruegmann has been examining the issue of urban sprawl. His 2005 book, Sprawl: A Compact History, takes a contrarian view, offering statistical and historical arguments to disprove the most frequently offered criticisms of dispersed development patterns as environmental harmful, unhealthy, and undesirable.

Every student must take SEE examination(according to the new Education Act) before they join higher secondary or intermediate level education (Class 11th and 12th grade also known as +2 Course). The SLC (Class 11 and 12) and SEE (Class 10) examination is normally scheduled in April to June of every year. Class 10, 11 and 12 examinations are held by NEB(National Examination Board) located in Sanothimi Bhaktapur Nepal.Class 10 was known as the \\"iron gate\\" in Nepal. In reality, however, there are indeed more obstacles regarding higher-level studies (SLC aka +2) after the examination. The SLC Examinations are the most important examination in the educational system of Nepal for building an academic career. The government has a great determination that the grading system that has been recently implemented in the SEE examination will help the country to increase the literacy rate. As the new Education Act, 2016 (2073) has been implemented. The SEE examination will take place in Grade 10 as a national level examination, whereas the examination of Grade 10 will be known as Secondary Education Examination (S.E.E). Examination centres For most of the years, when the SLC Board was in execution, Nepal used to be divided into five development regions and seventy- five districts, and each region had many examination centers (as per the Examination Commission's Plan). The examination questions used to differ from region to region but were the same within one single region, so if the exam were to be canceled, only one region would be affected, and only the questions of that region would have to be prepared. Every examination takes place at the same time throughout the whole country. There are different centers for students belonging to different schools. Results About two and a half to three months after the completion of the SLC now called SEE, the SEE results are published by the Examination Control Board. Students are categorized into five divisions according to their score: Despite such a low percentage required to pass the examination, many students (more than 50%), mostly students of government schools in rural areas of Nepal, still fail the exam every year due to its level of difficulty. Since government schools are known for being less rigorous to students compared to private schools, government school students are reportedly less likely to pass the exam. Even if one fails to get above 40 marks in each subject, they are declared failed. The result of the SLC is significant to an individual student since students with a high percentage can obtain various scholarships for their higher secondary level education. The Government Of Nepal has now formulated and implemented a new system for SLC. The Government has changed the system that has proven quite advantageous and disadvantageous in its implementing year. The students do not fail in the exam according to the new system, but those having low GPI don't get admission for higher-level studies. That's why the education system has been getting a lot of criticism. Criticism Some educationalists in Nepal criticize the SLC exam by citing it not being important in the present context. They say that the tests are neither standardized nor can it assess the capacity of Nepalese children. The education experts, for the past three decades, have been asking the government to review and revise the SLC examinations. However, the government, they say, is running the same old mechanism that will still be running in the same way for several decades more. And also there is no trend of SLC examination results in a continuum, rather it is so haphazard that the School Leaving Certificate results can not be trusted, they say.SLC syndrome and the impacts of results In 2010, mathematics question paper was leaked in Bajang, Kailali, Sunsari, Bara and Banke districts as well. A huge criticism arises on the SEE Administrators after the question of SEE 2019 of Province No. 2 get leaked before the exam day. The government postponed and even retook the previous day exam. They believed that it get spammed and went viral through different social sites and free video calling application like IMO. The SEE Security Committee chaired by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel took a decision and handed the case to CIB.

Gotfrid (also Gotefrid, modernized Gottfried; or Cotefredus; (c. 650-709) was the Duke of Alemannia in the late seventh century and until his death. He was of the house of the Agilolfing, which was the dominant ruling family in the Frankish Duchy of Bavaria. In a document dated to the year 700 in Cannstatt, Gotfrid at the request of a priest named Magulfus donated the castle of Biberburg to the monastery of Saint Gall. Gotfrid fought a war over his de facto independence with the mayor of the palace Pepin of Heristal. The war was unfinished when Gotfrid died in 709. His sons, Lantfrid and Theudebald, had the support of Pepin and succeeded him. It has often been stated that Gotfrid married a daughter of Theodo of Bavaria, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this assertion. It is largely based on conjecture, due to the fact that his third son, Odilo, later ruled in Bavaria. Furthermore, Gotfried died several years before most of Theodo's children are believed to have been born. Even if he had been betrothed to Theodo's daughter, whose name is unknown, she would have been little more than a child and unable to consummate such a union before his death, let alone bear him multiple children. One theory suggests that he had a Merovingian wife, based on the fact that several of his descendants bore Merovingian names, including the sons of his 2nd great-granddaughter Hildegard of the Vinzgau, wife of Charlemagne. The Agilolfings were, in fact, ruling Bavaria and Alemannia under the suzerainty of the Merovingian dynasty at this time, so such a union is not improbable. However, there is currently no further evidence to confirm this. From his son Huoching (Huocin, Houchi, or Hug) came the later stock of the Ahalolfings. His daughter Regarde married Hildeprand of Spoleto, and he left a youngest son named Liutfrid. He is a distant Ancestor of John of England. Sources *Geuenich, Dieter. Geschichte der Alemannen.

From the ancient Greek sources, she appears to be the first Greek Cyrenaean Queen mentioned from the dynasty. Life Eryxo was the only daughter and youngest child to Cyrenaean Princess Critola and her father was a Cyrenaean noble whose name is unknown. Her father was murdered in 550 BC, by Learchus who became a rival to Cyrenaean King Arcesilaus II . Plutarch states her eldest brother was called Polyarchus and the historian states she had other brothers, but the historian doesn‚Äôt give their names. Her maternal grandfather was the second Greek Cyrenaean King Arcesilaus I, however her maternal grandmother is unknown. Through her mother, she was a great grand daughter of the first Greek King and founder of Cyrene, Battus I. =Marital history= Before 560 BC, she married her maternal cousin Cyrenaean Prince Arcesilaus II, who was the son of Cyrenaean King Battus II who was her maternal uncle. Eryxo and Arcesilaus had a son called Battus III. Plutarch describes her as a ‚Äònoble, modest and courteous woman‚Äô. Succession In 560 BC, Battus II died. Her husband Arcesilaus II became the new king. Arcesilaus‚Äô counsel was Learchus, who had murdered her father. Learchus was secretly plotting against Arcesilaus to overthrow him. When Arcesilaus discovered that Learchus was plotting against him, he ordered Learchus and his supporters to be banished from Cyrene. In turn Learchus, Arcesilaus and their supporters ended up in a power struggle which resulted with Learchus and his supporters defeating Arcesilaus and the Cyrenaean Army at Leucon. Learchus also poisoned and strangled Arcesilaus near Leucon and after his victory over Arcesilaus. Learchus returned to Cyrene in triumph in hope of becoming king. Learchus became King under the false pretence, he was protecting Battus III, although by then Battus was a young man. Learchus was pretending to Eryxo‚Äôs humble servant, trying to show some dignity to Battus and Eryxo, in hope that Eryxo would marry him. Learchus also wanted Battus III to be co-ruler with him. Eryxo was taking counsel with her brothers and in the end wanted to see Learchus and gave the impression, she wanted to marry him. She sent her maid to Learchus and stated to him, to come to her at night where the union can be done. Learchus was overjoyed by the news that Eryxo wanted to marry him and Learchus came over when Eryxo was ready. This was when that Eryxo and Polyarchus were plotting to kill Learchus in revenge for the deaths of their father and Arcesilaus. Polyarchus with two young men had swords in their hands were secretly waiting and hiding in her bedroom. =Demise of Learchus= Eryxo had asked Learchus to come to her bedroom and Learchus came unattended to Eryxo‚Äôs room. As he entered, the young men fell upon Learchus and ran their swords through his body and Learchus had died. Learchus‚Äô body was throw over the wall and Polyarchus brought out Battus III and proclaimed him the new king. Battus reigned 550 BC-530 BC. =Reign of Battus= When Battus was proclaimed King, soldiers that served the Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis II were present. Amasis became an ally to the late Learchus. In avenging the death of Learchus, Amasis wanted to declare war on the Cyrenaeans and the Pharaoh had sent messengers to the royal family about this. It was at this time, that the mother of Amasis that died and Amasis was preparing her funeral. Polyarchus decided to travel to Egypt to state his condolences to Amasis. Eryxo and Critola would not allow Polyarchus to travel alone and they travelled with him, in order to save Cyrenaica. When the three reached the court of the Egyptian Pharaoh and gave their condolences to Amasis, others admired them for the purpose of their travel. Amasis did little to applaud the chastity and fortitude of the three, so he honored Polyarchus‚Äô mother and sister with presents and royal attendance which Amasis had sent the three back to Cyrene. Amasis withdrew his soldiers from Cyrenaica. The fate of Eryxo‚Äôs afterwards is unknown.

Three days earlier, Tigers' star Ty Cobb was taunted with racial slurs in New York by a fan named Claude Lueker. Cobb lost his cool, went into the stands, and attacked the heckler. The heckler was handicapped, having lost one complete hand and three fingers from the other hand in an industrial accident, and unable to defend himself. When fans yelled at Cobb that the man had no hands, Cobb shouted back, \\"I don't care if he has no feet!\\" American League president Ban Johnson responded by suspending Cobb indefinitely. Cobb's teammates voted to strike in response to Cobb's suspension, declaring that they would not take the field again until Cobb was reinstated. Ban Johnson refused to back down and told Tigers owner Frank Navin that the team would be fined $5,000 for every game in which they failed to field a team. Navin ordered manager Hughie Jennings to find players willing to take the field. The Tigers were on the road in Philadelphia, and so Jennings recruited eight replacement \\"Tigers\\" from a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. Each man was paid $25. An 18-year-old Bill Leinhauser was a Philadelphia native who was a noted amateur welterweight boxer. For one day, Leinhauser switched from boxing to baseball and ended up playing in one of the worst defeats in major league history. Leinhauser was given the daunting task of taking Ty Cobb's spot in center field for the replacement Tigers. He went hitless in four at bats but played flawlessly in the outfield with one assist and no errors. In front of 20,000 Philadelphia fans, the Athletics set a club scoring record in trouncing the replacement Tigers by a score of 24‚Äì2. The Tigers' starting pitcher, Allan Travers was a college student who later confessed he had never pitched a game in his life. Travers later became a Catholic priest. After the embarrassing display, Ban Johnson met personally with the striking Tigers and told them they would be banned for life if the strike continued. Ty Cobb urged his teammates to end the strike, and the Tigers complied. Accordingly, the major league career of Bill Leinhauser and the other replacement Tigers was cut short at one game. A rumor making the rounds in 1912 was that \\"when Leinhauser's wife found that he had the audacity to replace the great Ty Cobb, she hit him with a skillet.\\" By playing in this game, Leinhauser became a small piece of baseball history with his name and \\"career\\" statistics recorded forever in the records of Major League Baseball along with Ty Cobb and other legends of the game. Leinhauser served in France for the U.S. Army during World War I. When his boxing career came to and end, Leinhauser became a Philadelphia police officer. He retired as captain of the North Central Detective Division of the Philadelphia Police Department in 1959 after 41 years, 29 in the narcotics squad. Bill Leinhauser died at age 84 in 1978 in Elkins, Pennsylvania. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeardon, Pennsylvania.

He is the earliest historically attested ruler of the Thuringians. Almost nothing more about him can be said with certainty, including whether all the variations on his name in the sources refer to one or two different persons. His name is given as Bysinus, Bessinus or Bissinus in Frankish sources, and as Pissa, Pisen, Fisud or Fisut in Lombard ones. History Bisinus was the first husband of Menia, a fact attested only in the Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani.Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani, p. 9: Mater autem Audoin nomine Menia uxor fuit Pissae regis. He had a daughter, Raicunda, who became the first wife of the Lombard king Wacho (c. 510‚Äì540), a fact attested in all three of the main Lombard chronicles (two of which specify that he was king of the Thuringians).Origo Gentis Langobardorum, p. 4: Raicundam, filia Fisud [Fisut] regis Turingorum.Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani, p. 9: Ranigunda, filia Pisen regi Turingorum.Historia Langobardorum, p. 60: Habuit autem Waccho uxores tres, hoc est primam Ranicundam, filiam regis Turingorum. Menia later married a man (unnamed in the sources) of the Gausus family and became the mother of Audoin, who in 540 became the regent of Wacho's son by his third wife, Walthari, and then succeeded him to the throne in 546. Bisinus was also the father of the three brothers who ruled Thuringia in the 520s and 530s: Hermanafrid, Bertachar and Baderich. Bertachar had a daughter, Radegund, who founded Holy Cross Abbey in Poitiers and was recognised as a saint. She died in 587. Two hagiographies of her were produced by her friends Baudovinia and Venantius Fortunatus. Fortunatus specifies that she was \\"from the Thuringian region\\", a daughter of King Bertachar and granddaughter of King Bisinus.Fortunatus, p. 365: Beatissima igitur Radegundis natione barbara de regione Thoringa, avo rege Bessino, patruo Hermenfredo, patre rege Bertechario. While most scholars accept that the Thuringian kings called Bisinus in the Frankish sources and Pissa in the Lombard ones are one and the same, Martina Hartmann rejects the identification and points out that the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire makes no such identification either. Gregory of Tours Roman Empire under Majorian, with Frankish Kingdom and Thuringians. Gregory of Tours, writing in the last quarter of the 6th century, says that when the Franks rebelled against their king, Childeric I, who was accused of seducing their daughters, he went into exile at the court of Bisinus in Thuringia for eight years. In his absence, the Franks elected the Roman commander Aegidius as their king. Childeric's exile corresponds to the period between Aegidius' appointment as magister militum for Gaul in 456 or 457 and his death in 465. When Childeric returned from exile, Bisinus' wife Basina abandoned her husband to go with him. She became his wife and the mother of Clovis I. Gregory does not describe Bisinus as king of the Thuringians or even as a Thuringian himself, but as king \\"in Thuringia\\". Gregory's account was used by the authors of the 7th- century Chronicle of FredegarPseudo-Fredegar, pp. 95 and 97. and the 8th- century Book of the History of the Franks.Liber Historiae Francorum, pp. 248‚Äì49, uses the spelling Bisinus. Scholars have been skeptical of Gregory's account. It has been called a \\"folk tale\\", albeit one that corresponds well chronologically to the dates of Aegidius' magistracy. It has been suggested that Gregory in fact confused the civitas Tungrorum (today Tongeren) in northern Gaul with Thuringia and that Childeric was exiled to Tongeren. It has even been suggested that Gregory, knowing only that the name of Clovis' mother was Basina and that an early king of Thuringia was named Bisinus, invented the relationship between Basina and Bisinus based on the similarity of their names (having already, possibly erroneously, presumed the location of exile to be Thuringia). Although most scholars accept Childeric's exile as historical, Berthold Schmidt rejected Gregory's entire account of it as a fiction. It is highly unlikely (but not impossible) that the Bisinus of Gregory and the Bisinus of the Lombard chronicles are one and the same. In that case Bisinus would have been married to Basina almost eighty years before his youngest son's death in battle and had a living grandchild in 587. Taking Gregory's account as historical, it has been suggested therefore that there were in fact two kings named Bisinus. Bisinus (II), husband of Menia, may then have been the nephew of Bisinus (I), husband of Basina. The alternative is that Gregory misused the name of the historical Bisinus, husband of Menia and grandfather of Radegund, in reconstructing the events of the 460s. Location of kingdom The location of Bisinus' kingdom is a matter of some debate. Usually it is located in the place of present-day Thuringia, well to the east of the Rhine. An artefact that may be associated with Basina was found in the vicinity of Weimar: a silver ladle engraved with the name Basena that may date to the 5th century. The heartland of 5th-century Thuringia, however, may have initially been west of the Rhine, with the kingdom only expanding eastward in the decades after Bisinus' reign. The 12th-century Liber de compositione castri Ambaziae et ipsius dominorum gesta records that Bisinus' territory lay on the banks of the Sa√¥ne between Toul and Lyon. It also refers to Bisinus as a dux (duke) only and not as a king. Notes Sources ;Primary sources *Gregorius Turonensis, Libri Historiarum X, eds. Bruno Krusch and Wilhelm Levison. MGH SS rer.

It was privately owned by Griswold Airport, Inc. The airport has been closed since the beginning of 2007.  History  Griswold Airport opened in 1931, located between Route 1 and the Hammonasset River, and adjacent to Hammonasset State Park. In 1969, the Town of Madison paid to pave runway 6/24, in return for the owner's promise to maintain the property as an airport. The Madison Aviation Commission was formed at that time to oversee the town's interest in the property. Shoreline Aviation was founded here in 1980, operating landplanes at first. They added floatplane operations the following year. In 1985, the Griswold family offered to sell the airport to the town of Madison. In November 2000, Leyland Development Corporation obtained an option to purchase the land, and submitted plans for a 260-unit housing development, which was approved by the towns' Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC). A lawsuit against the town to stop the development failed, but local opposition was so strong that Leyland withdrew its original proposal. In the fall of 2003, the developer (renamed LeylandAlliance), submitted a revised proposal to build 131 units. In May 2004, the new proposal was approved by the PZC. LeylandAlliance completed the purchase in February 2007. In January 2010, residents of the Town of Madison voted to buy 42-acre former airport property from the developer. Assisted by the Trust for Public Land, the town completed the purchase in May 2010 and in 2011 signed a conservation easement to permanently protect 20.6 acres of the land from development.  Facilities and aircraft  Griswold Airport covered an area of . It contained one asphalt paved runway designated 6/24 which measured 1,863 by 50 feet (568 x 15 m). There was also a turf runway designated 4/22, about 1,150 by 50 feet (350 x 15 m); and a seaplane ramp between the river and the northeast corner of the airport. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2005, the airport had 3,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 57 per week.

Biography Grierson was born in Cavan, Ontario on April 2, 1860. He left home when he was eleven years old and worked a variety of jobs in western Ontario until 1878. He subsequently moved to Michigan and worked in the lumbering and railroad businesses; upon his return to Canada in 1883, he worked on constructing the Canadian Pacific Railway line westward from Winnipeg, Manitoba. He worked for the Canadian Anthracite Coal Company for eight years, and then helped with the construction of the CPR Hotel in Banff. He came to Edmonton in 1893 and purchased the Queen's Hotel with business partner Fred Jackson. He managed it for three years before buying the Alberta Hotel in 1897, on to which he added an addition which made it the first four- storey structure in Edmonton. He first ran for office in the 1901 Edmonton election, when he was elected to a two-year term as alderman on Edmonton Town Council. He was re-elected in the 1903 election, finishing second of nine candidates, but did not seek re-election after his term was truncated by Edmonton's incorporation as a city the following year. In 1904, Grierson married Lola Booth. The couple moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1909. Edmund Grierson died March 4, 1922. Grierson Hill in Edmonton is named in his honour.

Mangaroa railway station was a single-platform rural railway station on the Wairarapa Line between Upper Hutt and Featherston in the Wellington region of New Zealand‚Äôs North Island, on the section that was replaced by the Rimutaka Tunnel deviation in 1955. It served the small rural settlement of Mangaroa, in the Mangaroa Valley, east of Upper Hutt.  History  Mangaroa station was not originally built prior to the opening of Kaitoke station as part of the Mungaroa Contract. Looking south-west of the station, at the site of the Flux Road level crossing and in the direction of the Mangaroa River. a privately owned 43-wagon-capacity siding was laid several chains to the north of Cruickshanks Tunnel to serve a timber mill that was owned, constructed and operated by James Duff Cruickshank, a member of the Wellington Provincial Council. His siding handled only timber traffic, but also became a stopping place for main line trains, and was known as Cruickshanks. He later built a second mill about half a mile closer to Mangaroa station, but the first remained in use until 1889 when the siding was lifted. The second mill operated its own tramway between the mill and station yard where timber was transferred to railway wagons. Cruickshank owned 400 acres in the Mangaroa Valley and leased another 200 acres which he was required to clear and convert to pasture. The inference is that he operated a mill in the Mangaroa Valley. This land was lost in a mortgagee sale in 1882 when Cruickshank was declared bankrupt. In 1912 Seed Bros, who had a mill in Colletts Road, were issued a licence by the railways department for a tramway into the Mangaroa Station yard. The tramway ran down Flux Road. In 1915 signals were installed at Mangaroa Station. The Railways Department needed two houses for staff. Arthur Seed offered his house which was at the right angle bend in Flux Road but the offer was rejected. During the construction of the Rimutaka Tunnel, a siding was laid from the eastern end of the Mangaroa Valley and several chains north-east of Mangaroa station to the new Maymorn Station yard. This was to enable work trains to bring lengths of welded rail, other supplies and equipment from the Hutt Workshops directly to the construction site. Once the tunnel and deviation opened, this siding, along with the rest of the old section, was lifted in 1956. A military siding was established at Mangaroa in World War II to service RNZAF No. 2 Stores Depot that was later used by the Army. The depot opened in 1942 after being moved from the RNZAF station at Rongotai and was used until after the war. After the war the depot was a disposal site for surplus stores until RNZAF use ceased in July 1949, at which time it is assumed that the site was transferred to the NZ Army for their use.  Proposals  Prior to the construction of the Rimutaka Tunnel, several proposals for a tunnel under the Rimutaka Ranges to bypass the Incline section involved tunnels with a western portal to the north-east of Mangaroa station. In 1898 a survey was completed for a tunnel between Mangaroa and Cross Creek. The idea received a great deal of attention, but ultimately went nowhere as such a tunnel could not be contemplated at the time. In 1921‚Äì1922, a feasibility study was conducted which again considered the possibility of a Mangaroa to Cross Creek tunnel. This would involve an improved gradient from Upper Hutt, followed by a tunnel on a maximum gradient of 1 in 132. Again, the Public Works Department did no further work on the idea. In 1936 the Government announced its intention to proceed with a Mangaroa to Cross Creek tunnel. Though new surveys were conducted in 1938‚Äì1939, the project was delayed once more, this time by war conditions. After the war, work restarted on a tunnel through the Rimutaka Ranges. When the Rimutaka Tunnel opened in 1955, the line between Upper Hutt and Featherston then followed an alignment that bypassed Mangaroa altogether. The new Maymorn railway station on the Rimutaka Tunnel deviation was initially called Mangaroa.  Today  Very little of the old railway formation remains between the west and east sides of the Mangaroa Valley. Cruickshanks Tunnel still exists, though there is no formal access to it and the status of public access is uncertain. The only remains of the old Mangaroa River bridge are a few wooden bridge piles. There is still a noticeable hump in Flux Road just before the T-intersection with Leonards Road, the site of a level crossing just before the station. Of the station itself only the loading bank remains, at the side of Flux Road. See also * Rimutaka Tunnel  References  External links * Rimutaka Incline Railway.

During combat against the French in the French Revolutionary Wars, he first became known as an artillery specialist. In the Napoleonic Wars, he commanded corps in the 1805 and 1809 campaigns. He became the Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment in 1801 and held that position until his death. He was the last governor of the Kingdom of Serbia in 1791, having succeeded Count George Olivier of Wallis and acceded to those territories in accordance to the Treaty of Sistova. Early career Born in Prague on 21 December 1748, Kollowrat's military career began in 1766 when he joined the Austrian army. Two years later he became a captain. In 1778‚Äì79, he fought against the Prussians in the War of the Bavarian Succession during which he received promotion to Major. In 1786 he became an Oberst-Leutnant. The Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì91) saw him elevated in rank to Oberst (colonel) in command of the Alvinczi Infantry Regiment # 19. After performing notable service and being wounded at Belgrade, he earned promotion to General-Major on 9 October 1789.Smith-Kudrna, Kollowrat-Krakowsky He succeeded in 1791 count George Olivier Wallis as supreme military commander of the Habsburg forces in Serbia. French Revolutionary Wars =War of the First Coalition= In 1792, Kollowrat transferred to the artillery and fought in the War of the First Coalition. After proving himself a crack gunner and a careful student of logistics, he received command of the 2nd Artillery Regiment. He served as chief of artillery under the Count of Clerfayt during the 1795 campaign. In recognition of his abilities, Emperor Francis II named him Feldmarschal-Leutnant on 4 March 1796. He distinguished himself while directing the batteries at the Siege of Kehl in 1796‚Äì97 and received the Commander's Cross Military Order of Maria Theresa for his efforts. On 28 October 1800, he received the rank of Feldzeugmeister. =War of the Second Coalition= At the Battle of Hohenlinden, the army commander Archduke John of Austria rode with Kollowrat's 22,000-strong Austro-Bavarian column.Arnold, p 222 Before Kollowrat's column left the heavy woods, the French ambushed its leading elements. Because his column rapidly followed the main highway and the columns on either side fell behind schedule due to snow squalls and poor roads, a French flanking attack enveloped Kollowrat's column. After severe fighting, the French hemmed in the allies on three sides and their formations disintegrated. Kollowrat's men suffered very heavy losses in captured men and cannons.Arnold, pp 242‚Äì248. Arnold asserts that Johann (Karl) Kollowrat fought at Hohenlinden. However, Vinzenz Kollowrat-Liebsteinsky is a possible candidate. Neither Smith-Kudrna nor Ebert specify which Kollowrat was at Hohenlinden. Napoleonic Wars =Austerlitz= He became proprietor of the Kollowrat Infantry Regiment # 36 in 1801. In the same year, he became a member of the Aulic Council. He led the 25,400 Austrians of the 4th column at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805. Advancing across the Pratzen plateau, his force found itself in the path of Napoleon's main attack. After severe fighting, Marshal Nicolas Soult's corps broke Kollowrat's Austrians and drove them off the field.Chandler, pp 425‚Äì427 =Danube campaign= In 1809, Kollowrat led the II Corps during the Battle of Eckm√ºhl where it was unengaged because it operated north of the Danube. Transferring to command of the III Corps, his troops missed the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Instead, he operated against Emperor Napoleon's lines of communication with little effect.Bowden & Tarbox, p 96 On the second day of the Battle of Wagram, Archduke Charles launched the corps of Kollowrat and Johann von Klenau in a dangerous assault against the French left flank. Napoleon stopped the slow-moving III Corps by hurling a cavalry division at it. The French horsemen suffered crippling losses but they bought time for the Grand Army's artillerists to assemble a 112-gun grand battery. When these cannons opened fire, they stopped the III Corps cold. Next, Napoleon sent √âtienne Macdonald's corps against the junction between Kollowrat's III Corps and Johann Liechtenstein's I Reserve Corps. Despite this heavy attack, the Austrians succeeded in halting Macdonald. But by this time, the French had overwhelmed the Austrian army on the rest of the battlefield. Archduke Charles issued orders to retreat and Kollowrat was forced to pull back his command.Bowden & Tarbox, pp 130‚Äì137 =Later career= After 1809, Kollowrat held no further major field commands. He was promoted to Feldmarschall on 12 September 1809. In 1813 he fell ill and did not participate in the fighting. Instead, he organized relief efforts for the many Allied and French wounded soldiers. He died in Prague on 5 June 1816.

He may have been the Hedan who married Saint Bilihild. One of the chief sources for his life is the Passio minor sancti Kiliani. According to the Passio, after the revenge of God came upon his father Gozbert, who had married his brother's widow Geilana, who was reproved for it by Kilian, who in turn paid the price for his temerity, Hedan was chased from the realm, and his mother Geilana ruled as duchess (689). Sometime later Hedan returned as an adult and took over (before 704). The duchy over which Hedan and his ancestors ruled was the region around the river Main. Only under Hedan did the duke take up an extensive interest in the lands to the east, the region today called Thuringia. Hedan's claim to rule Thuringia may have been claimed through his wife Theodrada. Hedan's hypothetical relationship with Bilihild is established by the 12th-century Vita Bilihildis, based on earlier sources, which names Bilihild's husband as dux militum gentilis ... vocabulo Hetan. Theotbald on the other hand may have been a brother of Theodrada and the man who preceded Hedan in ruling Thuringia. It was during the reign of Hedan that the conversion of the Thuringii to Christianity, abortively initiated by Kilian, began to bear fruit under Boniface. In 742 the diocese of Erfurt was established. The support of the duke himself and his wife Theodrada was instrumental in establishing the new religion in Thuringia. In a donation dated 1 May 704 in W√ºrzburg, his capital, Hedan, with the consent of his wife and his son Thuring and the Frankish magnates Rocco and Doda, granted the bishop Willibrord the places of Arnstadt (Arnestati), M√ºhlberg (Mulenberge), and Gro√ümonra (Monhore). A document dated 18 April 716/717, Hedan enlarged his earlier donation by granting hereditary estates on the Saale and at Hammelburg (on the Saale) to the counts Cato and Sigeric as well as the nutricius (tutor or regent) Ado and the magnates Adogoto and Hereric. Through his wife Hedan had connexions to the Rodoin family and the family of Gundoin, Duke of Alsace. He also had ties to the monastery of Wei√üenburg in Alsace.

He also played a decisive part in the reconstruction of Cologne after the Second World War. He took a leading tole with Cologne's reconstruction authority between 1947 and 1952, contributing to the rebuilding of the city with some of his own designs. Among these is the Wallraf-Richartz Museum (1956), which now houses the Museum of Applied Art. He also reconstructed the pilgrimage church of Saint Anne in D√ºren, near Aachen, which is probably his most famous work. Schwarz worked with the German blacksmith Carl Wyland and closely with the Fr. Romano Guardini at Burg Rothenfels, where he designed the chapel for Quickborn, a large German Catholic youth movement run by Guardini. His wife, Maria Schwarz, worked together with him and is still in business as an architect, especially in reconstructing and modifying her husband's buildings.  Architecture Principles  Rudolf Schwarz accompanies his extraordinarily rich architectural opus constantly with numerous writings. Outstanding for the theoretical discussion are above all three books: Vom Bau der Kirche (1947; translated in English as The Church Incarnate), Von der Bebauung der Erde (1949) and finally Welt vor der Schwelle (1960), where he illustrates the continuity of building from geological stratification to architecture as the last layer of earth-building by human life. Black establishes architecture in the sacred by understanding it as a reflection of a primordial images founded in creation. These archetypes reflect the basic conditions that have arisen in creation. The architecture is a spatial representation that evokes these archaic archetypes. > \\"The subject of this design is the age-old struggle between man and earth. > In it, man stands for buoyancy, lightness and clarity against heaviness, > darkness, unformedness ‚Äì for the delicate against the massive. Extricating > himself from the earth and her clutches, he renews victoriously the age-old > legend.\\" Rudolf Schwarz defined, at least as far as the scope of his writings, an incomparable position on the nature of the sacred in architecture. In a sense this works as a renewed cosmogony based on the expression of a society that is constantly reinventing itself in the wake of an ever-evolving creative force. An important role for the development of the sacral dimension in the architecture of Rudolf Schwarz has the theologian Romano Guardini, who accompanied him from his first buildings.

Various of his works remained in print for a century after his death, but if he is remembered at all today it is for the use others made of his work. Texts of his were set by the foremost composers of the day and his translation of the Letters of Abelard and Heloise was a major source for Alexander Pope's Eloisa to Abelard. Life and work Hughes was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, the elder son of John Hughes, clerk in the Hand-in-Hand Fire Office, Snow Hill, London, and his wife Anne Burges, daughter of Isaac Burges of Wiltshire. He was educated in London, receiving the rudiments of learning in private schools. Emerging from education with an interest in all the arts, Hughes had to earn his living as a secretary at the Board of Ordnance. His poetry often dealt with patriotic themes and was judiciously dedicated to political lords but did not obtain for him a sinecure until late in his life. In fact his literary ability was mediocre, but he retained the friendship of such leading Augustan writers as Joseph Addison, Richard Steele and Alexander Pope. He was in the company of all these as a contributor to The Spectator, and also wrote essays for several other periodicals of the day. In one on \\"The Inventory of a Beau\\" he describes a picture of himself as a young man about town wearing \\"a well trimmed blue suit, with scarlet stockings rolled above the knee, a large white peruke, and a flute half an ell long\\".Henry R. Montgomery, Memoirs of the Art and Writings of Sir Richard Steele, New York 1865, p.256 His portrait by Godfrey Kneller some two decades later is more restrained, except for the length of the wig. As an amateur musician, Hughes mixed with composers and took part in the musical politics of the time, championing those who opposed over-dependence on the Italian language for singing. To prove his point he wrote many cantatas taking the form of recitative passages interspersed by sung airs. His first set of six \\"after the manner of the Italians\\" was prefaced by a defence of the use of English for such compositions, pleading that comprehension of the words adds to the pleasure, and that recitative provides variety.Poems on Several Occasions, vol. 1, pp.127 ff The cantatas were set by Johann Christoph Pepusch, for whom Hughes wrote many more, as well as an ode for the birthday of the Princess of Wales and the masque \\"Apollo and Daphne\\".Poems on Several Occasions, vol.2, pp. 121 ff, 107 ff, He also wrote cantatas for Johann Ernst Galliard, as well as the opera Calypso and Telemachus. This had an introduction that repeated much the same points as the earlier preface to the cantatas, with the addition of a vigorous commendation by Topham Foot asserting that, with the advent of \\"our own British Muse\\", ::Th'Italian opera sure will quit the Stage ::And Charms Superior fix the flutt'ring Age. ::Musick and Verse no longer disagree, ::Nor Sense is now a Foe to Harmony.Poems on Several Occasions, vol.2, p.17 Single cantatas by Hughes were also set by Henry Purcell, Nicola Francesco Haym and George Frideric Handel, and an \\"Ode in Praise of Music\\" was performed in 1703 in a setting by Philip Hart. The ode was another favourite form used by Hughes, written in the pindarics popularised by Abraham Cowley, although in this particular he was at odds with his Augustan friends. Besides dramatic compositions for music, Hughes had been trying his hand at plays since his schooldays, and had also translated scenes or whole plays from other languages, but he never had success in this form until the very end of his life, when his tragedy, The Siege of Damascus, was put on at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in February 1720.Archived online News of its successful first performance only reached the author on the night that he died, of tuberculosis, in London. Many more performances and revivals followed through the course of the century. Among his scholarly work can be included his contributions to White Kennett's Complete History of England (1706) and his own six-volume edition of The Works of Mr. Edmund Spenser (1715). He also translated Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle's Dialogues of the Dead (1708),Google Books a work that a century later was to serve as the model for Landor's Imaginary Conversations. But his most successful work was the Letters of Abelard and Heloise (1713),Google Books translated from a French version, of which there were numerous new editions for over a century. Its popularity can partly be explained by its having served as the basis for Pope's \\"Eloisa to Abelard\\", and that poem was eventually added to Hughes work in later editions. As Richard Steele noted in his article on the death of Hughes, he was in ill-health through much of his life.The Theatre 15, pp.119‚Äì125 After his death from consumption, he was buried under the chancel of St. Andrew, Holborn.

Performance Given its higher pressure and larger case which holds more powder than the .270 Winchester, the .270 Weatherby has about 200 ft/s faster performance with any particular bullet weight. This performance comes at the cost of more recoil and barrel heat. In addition, a long barrel is necessary to take advantage of extra powder to gain maximum velocity. The cartridge is excellent at long-range hunting, but is not well suited to high-volume shooting such as varmint hunting. For those handloading their own cartridges, this is an easy round to load. It does best with full-power loads and is not well-suited for reduced loads. Ed Weatherby, son of Roy Weatherby says that the .270 Weatherby is his favorite caliber. As he puts it, there just isn't a better long-range deer caliber. He goes on to mention that it is also quite effective for elk, and pronghorn. .308 Winchester (left) .270 Weatherby Magnum (center) .223 Remington (Right) See also * List of rifle cartridges * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges * 7 mm caliber References Weatherby Magnum rifle cartridges Pistol and rifle cartridges Magnum rifle cartridges ","title":".270 Weatherby Magnum"},{"id":"12820972","text":"John Addison (1920‚Äì1998) was a British composer, especially of film scores.

The Vernon Dalhart version was recorded on Victor Records in October 1924 and marketed in the hillbilly music genre. It was likely one of the best-selling records of the early 20th century. Although contemporary data show that Victor pressed slightly over 1.3 million copies during the record's peak years of popularity, anecdotal accounts sourced from a 1940s promotional flyer report sales as high as 7 million. The song's publisher at the time, Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., reportedly sold over one million copies of the song's sheet music. It was later performed by, among others, Hank Snow, Bill Monroe, and Brenda Lee. The first verse was sung by Liberace at the end of an episode of the 1960s television show Batman in which Liberace played the double role of twin criminal brothers, both of whom ended the episode behind bars. The song was mentioned in the book MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors (1968) by Richard Hooker. It was parodied by the two main characters simulating being in jail outside the commander's tent. They sang: \\"If we had the wings of a Colonel, We'd fly to the high Pyrenees, And open an open air laundry, Specializing in Blake's B.V.D.'s.\\" It may also have been expanded in the stage adaptation of the book. The song was included in Lyle Kessler's play Orphans and the film adaptation of the same name which the character of Harold drunkenly mumbles. The verse sung was altered to \\"if I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly, Straight to the arms of my mutter, and then I'd be willing to die\\". The song was an influence on Albert E. Brumley's popular hymn, \\"I'll Fly Away\\" (1929). History The events leading to the song's immense popularity began with a decision by Victor in 1924 to issue a recording of another song The Wreck of the Old 97, also titled The Wreck of the Southern Old 97, which had been a money-maker for other record companies. Nathaniel Shilkret, A&R; man for Victor's newly established Country Records Department and his boss, Victor's Director of Light Music Eddie King agreed to have Dalhart as vocalist on the recording.Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Shell, Niel and Barbara Shilkret, Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005. Shilkret indicated that he felt it necessary to choose a good recording for the B-side of the record in order not to depend entirely on an eight-month-old hit and that he asked Dalhart for a suggestion. Dalhart said his cousin Guy Massey had a song, \\"The Prisoner's Song\\", that would be appropriate, and, on August 13, 1924, \\"The Prisoner's Song\\" was recorded, with Dalhart's singing backed by Victor singing, whistling artist Carson Robison on guitar, and on viola, Lou Raderman, a Victor violin artist and frequent concertmaster of Shilkret ensembles. This recording was issued as Victor 19427, and became a big hit. Long-lasting controversy over the authorship of the song quickly arose. Dalhart copyrighted the song in Guy Massey's name, taking 95% of the author royalties for himself and giving Massey 5%. Shilkret protested, claiming that the song as Dalhart had brought it to him (Shilkret) was unusable, and that he rewrote the music.Malone, Bill C., Country Music USA, Revised Edition, University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas, 1985, p. 62. The Shilkret family fought unsuccessfully through the 1950s for author credit. Guy Massey had heard the song from his brother Rob Massey, who had actually spent some time in prison and probably first heard the song there. Palmer cites a letter dated October 20, 1924, from Guy Massey to his brother Rob Massey and two of his sisters telling them that he agreed to a 5% stake in royalties because he thought there would not be any royalties. Guy also said that, even though the royalty contract did not mention Rob explicitly, he (Guy) would split the 5% evenly with Rob. Although Dalhart changed his story frequently when he told it in public, he sometimes also claimed to have rewritten the original that he got from Guy. At times there were claims made that Guy had written it and there were claims that Rob had written it. Another story claims the lyrics were carved into the wall of a cell in the old Early County Jail in Blakely, Georgia, by Robert F. Taylor, who was at one time held there.

He is one of only a few record executives ever who has had a number one record in each of four decades (1960s‚Äì1990s). Career He started his career in the 1950s as a composer and record producer. His first notable hit was a 1959 Christmas novelty song, inspired by \\"The Chipmunk Song\\", titled \\"The Happy Reindeer\\" credited to Dancer, Prancer and Nervous (#34, Pop) issued by Capitol Records. In the early 1960s, Regan recorded \\"Joan of Love\\", backed with \\"Adults Only\\", which was released under the name Russ Regan. He also recorded \\"Calling All Cars\\" under the name Davy Summers for Warner Brothers with producer Sonny Bono. In the mid-1960s, he was drafted in to help form a musical direction for Warner Brothers' fledgling pop/soul music subsidiary, Loma Records. Regan started in record promotion with Motown in the early years of the company. His first project there was the company's first Billboard Hot 100 number one record, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" by The Marvelettes in 1961. He would go on to promote songs by the likes of The Supremes, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Stevie Wonder, The Temptations and Marvin Gaye. He suggested the name of The Beach Boys when a Los Angeles group called The Pendletones had just recorded a song called \\"Surfin'\\". He also helped Frank Sinatra record his #4 hit, \\"That's Life\\" in 1966. He struck a deal with Jimmy Miller Productions when Miller left The Rolling Stones which resulted in albums from B.B.King, Henry Gross, Bobby Whitlock, and others. Regan also signed Ambrosia and Harriet Schock to 20th Century Records. Russ Regan played a major role in the careers of a number of recording artists as he headed up labels such as Uni, 20th Century & Polygram Records. Dozens of recording artists, including Elton John, Neil Diamond, Barry White, Olivia Newton-John and The Beach Boys had Regan to thank for opening the doors for their success. One of his most surprising successes while at UNI was South African trumpeter Hugh Masakela's \\"Grazing In The Grass\\" in 1968, which sold over a million and reached the top spot in the Billboard pop chart. While President of 20th Century Records, Regan was inspired from a dream to create the movie All This and World War II which saw Fox News Footage from WWII backed with various artists singing Beatles songs. The movie was never released on video, and remains in the vaults of 20th Century Fox. Regan also supervised the soundtracks for the movies Endless Love, Breakin', The Karate Kid, All The Right Moves, Love At First Bite, This Is Spinal Tap and A Chorus Line. Regan was also the Music Supervisor for four Academy Award-winning songs from the films: The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno, Flashdance and Chariots of Fire.

The acronym HRMM is often used to refer the Hudson River Maritime Museum in publications. Its collections are devoted to the history of shipping, boating and industry on the Hudson and its tributaries, such as the Rondout, where Kingston grew prosperous early in the 19th century as the northern end of the Delaware and Hudson Canal. The city was the busiest port between New York City and Albany. The museum was founded in 1980 by local Hudson River enthusiasts, but did not move to its present property, an old boat shop, until 1983. Its exhibits include various small craft, artifacts of river steamships such as the Mary Powell, a research library, ice-harvesting tools and maps, paintings and sketches from past eras. The 1898 steam tugboat Mathilda is displayed in the yard next to the museum. In the summer months boat trips are available to nearby Rondout Lighthouse, where the creek drains into the Hudson. Boats putting in at the dock range from privately owned pleasure craft to oceangoing cruise liners. The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater has its winter home port here and visits frequently as do many historic reproduction vessels such as the Onrust and the Half Moon. As well as having the ability to accommodate deep draft vessels at their docks the museum provides free docking for canoes and kayaks. The Hudson River Maritime Museum is home to the Kingston High School Crew Team, the Rondout Rowing Club and the Kingston Sailing Club. The museum is a membership supported organization and sponsors festivals and events including the Antique and Classic Boat Society Boat Show, Hudson River Days with music, crafts and displays, the \\"Follow the River\\" Lecture Series, Cinema Sundays and Family Days.

Replacement player for Detroit Tigers (1912) Maharg's first appearance in baseball came on May 18, 1912. Three days earlier, Ty Cobb jumped into the stands and attacked a handicapped heckler who had been taunting Cobb, calling him a \\"half-nigger\\". The heckler had lost one complete hand and two fingers from the other hand in an industrial accident. When fans yelled that the man had no hands, Cobb shouted back, \\"I don't care if he has no feet!\\" American League president Ban Johnson witnessed the incident and suspended Cobb indefinitely. Cobb's teammates voted to strike in support of Cobb, refusing to play until the suspension was lifted. When Ban Johnson threatened Tigers owner Frank Navin with a $5,000 per game fine if he failed to field a team, Navin told manager Hughie Jennings to find replacement players. As the Tigers were on the road in Philadelphia, Jennings recruited eight replacement \\"Tigers\\" from a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. Each man was paid $25. Maharg was one of the replacement players. The replacement Tigers lost 24-2 to the Philadelphia Athletics. Maharg played two innings at third base and had two assists and no errors. He failed to reach base in his only at bat in the game. The regular Tigers returned after a one-game strike, and Maharg's major league career was over until 1916. Philadelphia Phillies (1916) On October 5, 1916, Maharg resurfaced in major league baseball as an assistant trainer and driver with the Philadelphia Phillies. Maharg was given a chance to bat in the final game of the 1916 season. With the Braves ahead 4-1 in the 8th inning‚Äö Phillies manager Pat Moran put the pudgy Maharg in as a pinch hitter. Maharg grounded out and then played left field before returning to his real duties as chauffeur for Phillies catcher Bill Killefer. After one- game, one-at-bat stints in both the American and National Leagues, Maharg ended his two-game playing career with a .000 batting average but a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal Maharg's third connection with major league baseball came in 1919 as he conspired to fix the 1919 World Series‚Äîthe infamous Black Sox Scandal. Several White Sox players, including Eddie Cicotte, Chick Gandil, and Swede Risberg, conspired with Sleepy Bill Burns, a former big-league pitcher, to throw the World Series in exchange for $100,000. Billy Maharg worked with Burns to find financing. Maharg and Burns approached New York gambler Arnold Rothstein to raise the money for the players. Other gamblers soon entered the picture, whereupon the players, Maharg and Burns suffered multiple double-crosses. The White Sox did in fact lose the Series. In September 1920, a disgruntled Maharg gave the full details of the plot to a Philadelphia writer. Eight White Sox players were indicted for throwing the Series. When Maharg was called as a witness in the criminal trial, someone noted, ‚ÄúHe flashed enough diamonds on his fingers to buy a flock of autos.‚Äù Maharg was asked, ‚ÄúAre you a ballplayer named ‚ÄúPeaches Graham?‚Äù The answer was, ‚ÄúNo! I have never been anything but Billy Maharg. I know Graham, but I am not he.‚Äù (It has long been believed that Maharg's real name was Graham, or Maharg spelled backwards.) The Chicago jury found the eight players not guilty, and Maharg celebrated with the players afterward. All eight were subsequently banned from baseball for life by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Three of the former players implicated in the Black Sox Scandal were members of the 1912 Detroit Tigers: Sleepy Bill Burns and Jean Dubuc were both pitchers for the 1912 Tigers, and Maharg was one of the 1912 replacement Tigers. Actor Richard Edson played the part of Maharg in John Sayles' 1988 film Eight Men Out.

History The group formed in 1990, establishing itself on the New York hardcore and metal scene through frequent touring and a few demo releases. In 1995, the band released an EP after vocalist Jorge joined, replacing Minus, and toured with Biohazard.[ Biography] at Allmusic.com Upon the release of their 1996 debut, the band scored a slot opening for Fear Factory and toured Europe in 1995 with B√∂hse Onkelz. Merauder shifted into crossover thrash and metalcore genres. The band split up following the recording of their 2003 release Bluetality. In 2007, vocalist Jorge Rosado formed his own version of the band. Guitarist Anthony Muccini publicly opposed Rosado's use of the name Merauder, though Muccini himself is not an original member, having replaced the original guitarist, 'Karate\\" Chris Bozeth. In 2008, the band announced completion of a new studio album recorded at Big Blue Meenie studios in Jersey City, New Jersey, and embarked on headline tours through Europe, Japan, and the U.S. The band also finished touring with the Haunted and the Agonist. A new album titled God Is I was released June 19, 2009, in Europe and August 11, 2009, through Regain Records. Although there were many difficulties with the European release, Regain has sent the copies only to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands. In December 2009, Merauder toured around Europe with Entombed and Devious. Their last show was at Eindhoven's Metal Meeting, where they shared the stage with Satyricon, Nile and Legion of the Damned. In May the band went on a tour around the US West Coast (including a festival in Las Vegas with Donnybrook and Grave Maker) and Mexico. In August they joined This is Hardcore festival in Philadelphia, along with Bane, Cro-Mags, Sheer Terror, Death Before Dishonor and more. In February 2011, a fan-made video for the song \\"Until\\" surfaced online featuring Rosado and Smerdon. In Summer of 2018 Merauder returned to Europe for a full tour with UK metal/hardcore band Climate Of Fear, featuring Rosado and long-time bassist Kevin Mahon and members of Climate Of Fear filling in.

Based in Vancouver, Washington, United States, Bluewater publishes biographical comics, adaptations from films, and original titles with self-created characters. History The first iteration of Davis's company started in 2001 as a production studio at Image Comics, where its founder Darren G. Davis developed the company's signature series 10th Muse and The Legend of Isis. This iteration came to an end with the company declared bankrupt in 2003. Davis's revived company, then known as Bluewater Productions, became a publisher in May 2007 with the signature series Ray Harryhausen Presents, which was produced in conjunction with filmmaker Ray Harryhausen until 2009. Other signature series, including Vincent Price Presents, produced in conjunction with the daughter of the actor Vincent Price,Immortal After All... Vincent Price Comes to Comic Books, Newsarama, June 13, 2008 and William Shatner Presents, with actor William Shatner, followed. The company signed a deal, in 2009, to republish the Rock 'N' Roll Comics series from defunct publisher Revolutionary Comics, the deal was ended in 2013 after seven volumes with an eighth left un-published. The company has come under criticism, starting in 2009, from former content creators claiming non-payment for their work. Rich Johnston, writing for Bleeding Cool, claims: \\"The company uses a number of free creators, working for no money at all, seeking exposure, who later wonder if they've been taken for a ride-- especially if the work never even sees publication.\\" Bluewater Productions founder Davis issued a statement saying, \\"Bluewater does not engage or condone any such underhanded or untoward activity and refutes each and every allegation made against the company and me personally. Much of the perceived conflict comes from a handful of creatives who became disenchanted over the terms of their signed agreements and mistakenly believe they are owed compensation.\\" A cease and desist notice was sent to the company in 2010 by Kenneth Feinswog over the publication of unauthorized biographical comics of his clients Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. Davis announced, in 2010, the appointment of Arastao Maree as Executive V.P. of Creative Development with the responsibility of re-purposing the company's titles for theatrical, television, new media and videogame production. A collaboration with The Graphic Classroom was announced in August 2011, which resulted in the creation of free lesson plans to tie-in with the company's series of biographical comics. Bluewater became a pioneer in digital first publishing in January 2012, with the release of its Gabrielle Giffords and Mitt Romney bio-comics on the Nook and Kindle prior to their print versions. Bluewater ended its distribution deal with Diamond Comic Distributors in 2012 after several of their titles were cancelled for not meeting the sales benchmarks, distribution was taken over by Comic Flea Market, which operates a print on demand service. Following this Arcana Studio bought up the majority of the company's non- biographical original content, including 10th Muse and Legend of Isis. Content creator Jaymes Reed ended his deal, in 2013, with the company to publish his creator-owned Comics series of biographical comics about famous comedians, which had been running since 2011, claiming non-payment for his work. Darren G. Davis responded to the claims by stating that Reed had been paid despite poor sales and copyright infringement issues with the estates of the comics' subjects. Reed made further complaints in 2014 that the company was continuing to publishing the series without his permission. A name change to StormFront Media/Publishing in 2015 followed a television production deal for their property Insane Jane that required the company to differentiate itself from another production company of the same name. A second name change to Storm Entertainment later that year was undertaken in order to end any confusion of the company with the controversial Stormfront message forum. This rebranding coincided with a change to a digital-centric business plan. Darren G. Davis titles =10th Muse= Developed by founder Darren Davis, 10th Muse follows the adventures of the forgotten tenth muse of ancient Greece reincarnated in the body of ordinary present-day girl Emma Sonnet. 10th Muse was the sixth highest selling comic in November 2001. 10th Muse has been optioned for film and television several times, first in 2002. While ultimately the project failed to come to fruition, CastleBright Entertainment acquired the film option in 2007. In 2011 Vanquish Motion Pictures commissioned a television pilot of 10th Muse penned by Jennifer Quintenez. =Legend of Isis= Legend of Isis follows the adventures of the Egyptian goddess Isis as she adjusts to life in 21st century Los Angeles following 5,000 years of imprisonment.

Isis's primary weapon, the mystical staff of Luxor, channels the power of Osiris, her lost love. The Legend of Isis was optioned in 2004 as a motion picture by Paramount Studios and Grammnet Productions. =Other titles= *Orion the Hunter *Judo-Girl *The Blackbeard Legacy *Victoria's Secret Service (VSS) *The Mis-Adventures of Adam West Ray Harryhausen Signature Series The Ray Harryhausen Signature Series is a series of authorised comic book adaptions of unrealised projects developed by filmmaker Ray Harryhausen which ran for two years, from 2007 to 2009.

The artwork by Noeth in the first two chapters is complimented by Thomas as \\"highly illustrated, bright, and bold,\\" while dismissed by Ferguson as \\"very uneven,\\" which he puts down to tight deadlines. The artwork by Tennant in the final two chapters is described by Thomas as \\"heavy-textured, almost photo-realistic panels,\\" while Ferguson compliments the \\"insane\\" action shots despite the lazy shortcuts taken. As part of a publicity campaign for the comic, a preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film. =Sinbad: Rogue of Mars= Sinbad: Rogue of Mars is a 2007 four-issue comic book miniseries created by Greg Thompson, Scott Davis, Jeff Cruz and Kiatisak Piewkao based on ideas developed by Ray Harryhausen in 1981 as a continuation of his Sinbad the Sailor film series, which would have been titled Sinbad Goes to Mars, and had previously included The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977).

Nolan titles A series of comic book titles created in collaboration with Logan's Run co-creator William F. Nolan, which started in 2010.

Other titles =The Wave= In April 2011, Gregg Paulson and AE Stueve announced The Wave, the first shared universe in Bluewater Productions history. This multi-part, creator-owned miniseries revolves around the adventures of characters from Greek mythology in modern times. Initially, the series will consist of a four-issue miniseries, planning to expand to a team book of four to six issues. The Wave #0 explores what happens to Greek gods Artemis, Zeus, Poseidon and Persephone when mankind ceases to worship them. The line will also follow mythological figures Heracles and Orion, as well as Bluewater original characters from 10th Muse, The Legend of Isis and Atlas. Stueve and Paulson cite the films of Ray Harryhausen and mythic archetypes of Joseph Campbell as major influences. The first four titles are confirmed as Artemis, Orion, Heracles and Trident: The Power of Poseidon, with issue #0 Twilight of the Gods to be released in November 2011. =Other titles= Biographical comic books In 2009, the company ventured into biographical comics with Female Force, a series celebrating influential women in society and popular culture. In the subsequent years, Bluewater Productions has filled the growing biography comics niche with other titles profiling popular figures in politics (Political Power), entertainment (Fame), literature, and others. Less than half of Bluewater Productions publications are biography. Bluewater Productions attempts to utilize the \\"power of celebrity\\" to broaden comics distribution. \\"We tried something different to get new readers into to comic book stores and it is working... We get a lot of flak from the true comic book fans thinking we are ruining the industry, but we are doing our part to help it.\\" Fame: Justin Bieber was initially distributed exclusively at Wal-Mart stores. Although many of the biography comics are unauthorized, the company does reach out to most of its subjects to participate. In 2010, the publication of Female Force: Charlaine Harris marked the first authorized Female Force biography. Harris granted interviews to writer Kim Sherman. When requested, Bluewater has donated profits made off the biography comics to charities of the subject's choice, as was the case with FAME: Ellen DeGeneres. Criticism surrounds the potentially exploitative nature of biography comics. Responses from Bluewater Productions highlight positive aspects of potentially expanding comics readership. Furthermore, the company defends its right to provide timely coverage that its audience demands. According to Davis, speaking about the upcoming Infamous: Charlie Sheen comic, \\"there are those who are going to complain that we are exploiting Sheen. But honestly, this is no different than People magazine devoting most of an issue to the story or TMZ or Slate or the general media's constant coverage of breaking developments. If Sheen contacted us right now and wanted us to donate some of the potential profits to a charity of his choosing, we would happily do so.\\" In addition to Female Force, the company publishes the biography comics lines Political Power (eg: Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Ophra Winfrey...), Fame (eg : 50 cent, Adele, Beyonce, Black Eyed Peas...), about famous authors (eg : Anne Rice, JK Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Stephenie Meyer...)\\"All Bluewater Productions comicbooks\\", \\"ComicBookRealm\\", accessed june 2020 and others. In September 2009, Bluewater announced it would be reprinting defunct publisher Revolutionary Comics' line of music comics (including their flagship title Rock 'N' Roll Comics) in 10 monthly volumes, averaging 250 pages each.Parkin, J.K. \\"Don‚Äôt call it a comeback: Bluewater to collect classic Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics,\\" Comic Book Resources: Robot6 (September 10, 2009). The first collections were The Beatles Experience and Hard Rock Heroes, released in early 2010. Many of Revolutionary's original creators participated in updating and modernizing the contents of the musical comic bios (which had been originally produced in the years 1989‚Äì1993). The reprints and updates were supervised by long-time Rock 'N' Roll Comics writer/editor Jay Allen Sanford. Ultimately, Bluewater released seven titles from 2010‚Äì2012:Sanford, Jay Allen, \\"No more Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics reprint editions from Bluewater Productions,\\" San Diego Reader blog (March 23, 2013).

Established in 1972 by amalgamating the four existing universities, it was the only university in Sri Lanka from 1972 until 1978. The university was based at six campuses in Colombo, Peradeniya, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kelaniya, Moratuwa and Jaffna. The university was dissolved in 1978 and its six campuses became independent universities. History The Ceylon University Ordinance No. 20 of 1942 established Sri Lanka's first fully fledged degree granting university, the University of Ceylon, on 1 July 1942 by amalgamating Ceylon University College and Ceylon Medical College. The university was initially based at the Ceylon University College site in Colombo whilst a new campus was built at Peradeniya. Various faculties and departments moved from Colombo to Peradeniya from 1949 onwards. The university's administration moved to Peradeniya in 1952 and the university officially became the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya on 6 October 1952. Sections of the university continued to be based at the Colombo campus of the university. The Vidyodaya University and Vidyalankara University Act No. 45 of 1958 elevated Vidyodaya Pirivena at Maligakanda and the Vidyalankara Pirivena at Kelaniya into two separate universities. Vidyodaya University and Vidyalankara University opened in 1959. By the mid 1960s there were calls for the creation of a separate, independent university based at the Colombo campus. The Ceylon University Ordinance No. 20 of 1942 was replaced by Higher Education Act No. 20 of 1966. At the 1967 Throne Speech it was announced that a new university was to be established in Colombo. Under the provisions of the Higher Education Act the University of Ceylon, Colombo was established with effect from 1 October 1967. The University of Ceylon Act No. 1 of 1972 amalgamated the four universities - University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, University of Ceylon, Colombo, Vidyodyaya University and Vidyalankara University - into a single university, the University of Sri Lanka, with four campuses. At the same time the Ceylon College of Technology at Katubedda became the fifth campus of the university. Jaffna became the sixth campus of the university on 25 July 1974. The Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 radically altered university education in Sri Lanka. The University of Sri Lanka was abolished and its six campuses were each elevated to independent, autonomous universities in their own right: University of Peradeniya, University of Colombo, University of Sri Jayewardenepura (Vidyodaya), University of Kelaniya (Vidyalankara), University of Moratuwa (Katubedda) and University of Jaffna.

Carolina was the eldest child of Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, and his wife Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria. Biography = Early years and education = Her full baptismal name was Carolina Maria Teresa Giuseppa. She was named after her godparents, her paternal great-uncle Charles III of Spain and her maternal grandmother Empress Maria Theresa. Carolina was the eldest of nine children born to Ferdinand, Duke of Parma by his wife Maria Amalia of Austria. By the time of the visit of her maternal aunt Maria Christina in Parma in 1774, she was described as a beautiful but melancholic child.Justin C. Vovk: In Destiny's Hands: Five Tragic Rulers, Children of Maria Theresa (2010) Carolina and her brother Louis were the favorites of their parents. They were personally instructed in religion by their father, despite the fact that their younger children was actually more interested in the subject than they were. In 1778, her brother Luigi hit his head on a marble table while playing with Carolina, and afterward suffered from epilepsy. The mother of Carolina preferred her to marry a German prince. Reportedly, however, her marriage was not arranged. Instead, her mother introduced Carolina to Maximilian during his frequent trips to Italy, and when the Parmesan Ducal family visited Saxony in the late 1780s, Carolina was able to spend time with Maximilian and reportedly fell in love with him. Consequently, she was described as eager to marry him, and her mother Amalia gave her permission despite the fact that Maximilian was not the heir to a throne. The marriage and life of Carolina in Saxony are described as happy and harmonious. When her mother moved to Prague in 1804, she was able to have more contact with her, though she was not able to visit her before her death. Princess Carolina died of fever on March 1, 1804 in Dresden. More than two decades after, her husband married her niece Princess Maria Luisa Carlota of Parma. Marriage and issue On 22 April 1792 in Parma (by proxy) and on 9 May 1792 (in person), Carolina married Prince Maximilian of Saxony, fifth and youngest son of Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony.

He served two terms, from 2007 to 2015, in the Nebraska Legislature, representing a district in the central part of the state. Wightman was a member of the Republican Party. Early life and education Wightman was born on October 2, 1938, in North Platte, Nebraska. He grew up between Sumner and Overton, and graduated from Sumner High School in 1956. He obtained a B.S. from Kearney State College, now the University of Nebraska at Kearney, in 1959. After teaching high school for one year in Dannebrog, he attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law, receiving a J.D. in 1963. In 1963, Wightman moved to Lexington to practice law. Political career Wightman served several terms on the Lexington city council, amounting to some 20 years; for two of those years, he served as the city's mayor. In 2006, Wightman ran for the Nebraska legislature from the 36th District, which consisted of parts of Buffalo and Dawson Counties in the south-central part of the state. He was one of two candidates, both Republicans, in the nonpartisan race; the other was Dick Pierce, a farmer and rancher from Miller, then a member of the Buffalo County Board of Supervisors. In the May 2006 primary election, Wightman received 4227 of the 7147 votes cast, or 59.1% of the total; Pierce obtained 2920 votes, or 40.9%. Since only two candidates had run in the primary, both moved on to the November general election, which Wightman won with 5623 votes (55.3%) to Pierce's 4552 votes (44.7%). In 2010, Wightman was unopposed for re-election to the 36th District seat. Based on the 2010 U.S. census, the boundaries of the district were redrawn in 2011; it now consisted of the entirety of Dawson and Custer Counties, and the northern half of Buffalo County. Wightman suffered health problems during his tenure in the Legislature, including several knee replacements, one of which was followed by a persistent infection that forced him to miss part of the 2011 legislative session. In September 2012, he suffered what was described as a \\"moderate\\" stroke; later, he stated that he had no memory of the two weeks after the stroke. Under Nebraska's term-limits law, Wightman was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in 2014. He was succeeded by Gothenburg banker Matt Williams.  Personal life  In 1964, he married Janet L. Hyde; the couple eventually had three children. Wightman died on January 5, 2017 at the age of 78.

Kortun served as the founding director of several international institutions, including SALT, Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Center, Proje4L, and the Museum of the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College. In 2006, he received the Award for Curatorial Excellence from the Center for Curatorial Studies for his \\"experimental approach and openness to new ideas to challenge the contemporary art world and push its parameters beyond national or international, local or global developments.\\" Kortun has written extensively on contemporary art and visual culture in Turkey for publications and periodicals internationally. He currently lives in Ayvalƒ±k, a seaside town on the northwestern Aegean coast of Turkey.  Institutions  Kortun served as the Director of Research and Programs (2011‚Äì17) at SALT, a non-profit research institution located in Istanbul and Ankara. Under his direction, SALT has organized numerous exhibitions and public programs around visual and material culture, amassed a library of over 40,000 publications, and built an archive on art, architecture and social history of Turkey with over 1,500,000 digitized items available online. Writing about the inauguration of SALT in 2011, writer Kaelen Wilson-Goldie describes Kortun as \\"an unabashed power broker on the Istanbul scene.\\" In her text, Wilson-Goldie defines SALT as \\"a think tank in action, a collaborative space for testing out new forms of debate and exchange.\\" Kortun resigned from his position at SALT in April 2017 and organized a public talk where he presented his paper \\"Questions on Institutions\\" (Kurum Sorularƒ±). He presented the English version of this talk in October 2017 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, as part of The Museum Is Not What It Used To Be series. In this talk, he says he was part of a team that conceived public programs for people who \\"are more intelligent than us, because we do not believe people are simple-minded.\\" \\"When we begin a project, we exercise what we call 'state of unknowing'. . . the idea is to enter an agonistic sphere where difficult questions can be posed without being considered incriminating or hostile.\\" Following his resignation, he remains on SALT's board of directors. Before instituting SALT, Kortun served as the Founding Director of Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Center, Istanbul (2001‚Äì10), a non-profit art organization that hosted exhibitions, conferences, an international residency program, and an archive of contemporary art in Turkey; Proje4L Istanbul Museum of Contemporary Art (2001‚Äì04), the first private contemporary art museum in Turkey; and the Museum of the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annadale-on-Hudson (1993‚Äì97), the exhibition space that preceded the Hessel Museum of Art that currently hosts over 1,700 contemporary artworks.  Exhibitions  Kortun describes the late-1980s exhibition/happening series Serotonin as a turning point for his practice. Conceived by Arhan Kayar et al, Serotonin I was organized at Feshane in 1989, and Serotonin II at Gashouse (Gazhane) in Istanbul in 1992. Kortun participated in the second edition of the series as an organizer and \\"for some as an artist.\\" Kortun speaks about Feshane as an eye opener as it was a major site for Turkey's process of modernization: It was built as one of the most advanced textile factories in the late 19th century, to be abandoned in 1986 for environmental improvements. The exhibition and the related programs used the abandoned building as part of the exhibition. Later, Kortun organized Memory/Recollection, a series that is considered to be the first contemporary art exhibition organized by an independent curator in Turkey. Memory/Recollection was organized in 1991 at Taksim Art Gallery (Taksim Sanat Galerisi), and Number Fifty/Memory/Recollection II (Elli Numara: Anƒ±/Bellek II) was presented in 1993 in Akaretler, Istanbul, where \\"politics displaced art\\" as the participating artists and he decided to prematurely close the exhibition after the banner of the show was replaced with a Democrat Party poster. He has undertaken numerous independent curatorial projects including most recently an exhibition of works by Cengiz √áekil (2010) at RAMPA, Istanbul‚Äîthe first comprehensive presentation of √áekil's practice. He co- curated The Columns Held us Up (2009) with November Paynter at Artists Space, New York, where the exhibition was \\"framed much like a one-month artist residency\\" as Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Center had paused its programs to be incorporated into SALT. Kortun curated numerous exhibitions in Turkey and internationally. He served as the chief curator of the 3rd International Istanbul Biennial (1992), co-curator of the 9th International Istanbul Biennial (with Charles Esche, 2005) and the 6th Taipei Biennial (with Manray Hsu, 2008), the 2nd Biennale of Ceramics in Contemporary Art, Albisola (2003); the 24th S√£o Paolo Biennial, S√£o Paolo (1998), among others. He also curated the Pavilion of Turkey at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) with a solo exhibition of artist H√ºseyin Bahri Alptekin as well as the United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale (2011) with a group exhibition titled Second Time Around including artists Reem Al Ghaith, Abdullah Al Saadi, and Sheikha Lateefa bent Maktoum. Kortun says he comes from a generation that \\"came to maturity through biennales,\\" which were the \\"most promising agency that changed the art world as we knew it\\" in the 1980s and the 1990s. Writer Matthew Scum writes, \\"His experience corresponds to that of other seminal curators who began working on an international scales during the 1990s.\\"  Writings  Kortun contributed to several books, including Fresh Cream: Contemporary Art in Culture (Phaidon Press, 2000), Foci: Interviews with 10 International Curators (ApexArt Curatorial Program, 2001), How Latitudes Become Forms: Art in the Global Age (Walker Art Center, 2003), and Signs Taken in Wonder: Searching for Contemporary Art about Istanbul (Hatje Cantz, 2013). In 2004, he co-authored the book Jahresring 51: Szene Turkei: Abseits aber Tor with Erden Kosova, focusing on the art scene in Turkey. In 2013, he co-edited VOTI Union of the Imaginary: A Curators Forum with Susan Hapgood and November Paynter, exploring the online discussion platform for international curators in the late 1990s. His texts have been included in numerous exhibition catalogues, such as the 2nd Johannesburg Biennial (1997), the 24th S√£o Paulo Biennial (1998), Manifesta 2 (1998), and The United Arab Emirates Pavilion at the 54th International Art Exhibition, Venice Biennale (2011), among others. A selection of his writings from 1985 onwards is available online in Turkish, organized in three publications titled 10, Ofsayt Ama Gol!, and 20. These include his essays on Istanbul, exhibition-making, cultural policies, institution-building, and interviews with artists.  Committees and Boards  Kortun is the Chairman of the board of the Foundation for Arts Initiatives (2009‚Äìongoing), a private foundation that support artists, curators, and arts initiatives since 1999. He served on the Tate Turner Prize Selection Committee in 2011. In November 2015, Kortun, along with Van Abbemuseum Director Charles Esche and Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art Director Abdullah Karroum, resigned from his position as board member from the International Committee for Museums of Modern Art (CIMAM). The resignation was the result of a controversy around artistic freedom of expression, which was related to the 2015 exhibition The Beast and the Sovereign at MACBA whose then director Bartomeu Mar√≠ also served as the CIMAM President. \\"We believe that art museums engaged with contemporary issues should be sites for the free exchange of ideas, where legal debate about and dissension from government policy or majority social opinion are allowed and encouraged,\\" their joint statement read. \\"The recent course of events at MACBA and within the board at CIMAM have led us to doubt whether our current president can defend those values credibly.\\" References Turkish art curators 1958 births Living people ","title":"Vasif Kortun"},{"id":"12821460","text":"Electronic music is music made with electronics.

Life and career Gillespie with self-portrait in his Rome studio c. 1969 He was born in Roselle Park, New Jersey. After graduating from high school, he became a nondegree student at Cooper Union in New York. In 1959 he married Frances Cohen (1939‚Äì1998), who was also an artist, and the following year they moved to San Francisco where Gillespie studied at the San Francisco Art Institute.Lerner 1977, p. 105. In 1962 he received the first of two Fulbright-Hays grants, for travel to Italy to study the work of Masaccio. He lived and worked in Florence for two years, and in Rome for six years, studying the works of such Renaissance masters as Carpaccio, Mantegna, and Carlo Crivelli, who was a particular favorite of Gillespie.Lerner 1977, p. 22. During this time he was awarded three Chester Dale Fellowships and a Louis Comfort Tiffany grant. In 1971 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994. He had his first solo show in 1966, at the Forum Gallery in New York. In 1970 he returned to the United States, where he settled in Williamsburg, Massachusetts. He exhibited in several Whitney Biennials, and in 1977 the Hirshhorn Museum organized a touring retrospective of his work. Gillespie became known for meticulously painted figurative paintings, landscapes, and self portraits, often with a fantastical element. Many of his early works were made by painting over photographs cut from newspapers or magazines, transforming the scenes through photographic collage and by adding imaginary elements. In his later work he abandoned his early fascination with creating hyper-realized realistic imagery, instead focusing on a looser and more expressive style. He often combined media in an unorthodox way to create shrine-like assemblages. He was found dead in his studio in Belchertown, Massachusetts, apparently a suicide by hanging, on April 26, 2000. Collections Gillespie's work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum, the Arkansas Arts Center, and the Butler Institute of American Art, among others.www.askart.com The Hirshhorn Museum has at least fourteen works by Gillespie in its collection (see external links).

Since 2000, it has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In that same year, construction began to reuse the property as a multi-block, mixed- use development known as the Brewery Blocks. Architecture The firm of Whidden & Lewis, Portland's pioneering architects, designed the Brewhouse. The building is designed in a medieval Tuscan style. Completed in 1908, other businesses in the area hired architects to emulate this design theme when building their own warehouses and industrial buildings.King, Bart: An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, pg. 181. Gibbs Smith, 2001 IBN 0-87905-991-5 At its highest level, the structure has six floors. The structure is actually two buildings that appear as one: The Brewhouse (on the north side of the block), and the Malt and Hop Building (facing Burnside Street). History Henry Weinhard purchased an existing brewery on this site, the City Brewery, in 1864. He then moved his operations to the then-two block site on West Burnside Street. Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872 two additional blocks to the north were purchased. As many breweries also owned the saloons that sold their beer at the time, a large business empire owning properties throughout the Northwest, from San Francisco to Canada was run from here. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand to the point where he even offered to pipe beer directly to the Skidmore Fountain. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually. The present buildings were completed in 1908 in order to meet the expanding brewing needs of the Henry Weinhard brewing empire, now serving the Pacific Northwest and even the Philippines and China. Once Prohibition was enacted, the brewery managed to survive by brewing near- beer (a brew of less than 0.5 percent alcohol), syrups and sodas ‚Äì such as root beer, becoming a local bottler of national brands. Vanilla cream and other syrup products were marketed as \\"Gourmet Elixirs\\".Key dates in the history of Blitz-Weinhard Brewery 1856-2000 Detail view of signage and decorative brickwork on the west fa√ßade and also the north fa√ßade of the six- story Malt House and Hop Building Mergers with and sales to other breweries occurred over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing, became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company, which sold it to Stroh Brewing Company in 1996. The last and final sale of the company in 1999 had major effects on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to Miller Brewing Company, which moved all Henry's brewing operations to the Olympia Brewery in Tumwater, Washington. After nearly 135 years of continual operations, the Weinhard Brewery brewed its last beer on August 27, 1999, and was put up for sale the following month.King, Bart: An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, pg. 182. Gibbs Smith, 2001 Redevelopment In early 2000, local developers Gerdling-Edlen purchased the entire brewing complex, which consisted of five blocks by the end of brewing operations. GBD proceeded to develop a mixed-use area consisting of offices, retail, and condo towers known as the Brewery Blocks. As part of the project, historic buildings were to be preserved and integrated into the new development. The brewhouse's historical importance was recognized with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the A.B. Smith Building's art deco facade, in August 2000, a year after brewing had ceased. The renovated Brewhouse was completed in November 2002, after two years of extensive renovations. The west side of the Brewhouse's low as developed into Brewery Tower, an office building. The upper floors of the historic buildings are office space, and the first floors contain retail. Henry's 12th Street Tavern, opened in 2004 in the Brewhouse building, continued the building's historical connection to beer, until the tavern's closure in 2019. The building was awarded an LEED certification.

Database administrators and application developers often face constantly changing environments which they rarely completely control. Many changes result from new development projects or from modifications to existing code, which, when deployed to production, do not always produce the expected result. For organizations to better manage development projects and the teams that develop code, suppliers of SQL programming tools normally provide more than facility to the database administrator or application developer to aid in database management and in quality code-deployment practices. Features SQL programming tools may include the following features: =SQL editing= SQL editors allow users to edit and execute SQL statements. They may support the following features: * cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, find (and replace), bookmarks * block indent, print, save file, uppercase/lowercase * keyword highlighting * auto-completion * access to frequently used files * output of query result * editing query- results * committing and rolling-back transactions * inside cut paper =Object browsing= Tools may display information about database objects relevant to developers or to database administrators. Users may: * view object descriptions * view object definitions (DDL) * create database objects * enable and disable triggers and constraints * recompile valid or invalid objects * query or edit tables and views Some tools also provide features to display dependencies among objects, and allow users to expand these dependent objects recursively (for example: packages may reference views, views generally reference tables, super/subtypes, and so on). =Session browsing= Database administrators and application developers can use session browsing tools to view the current activities of each user in the database. They can check the resource-usage of individual users, statistics information, locked objects and the current running SQL of each individual session. =User- security management= DBAs can create, edit, delete, disable or enable user- accounts in the database using security-management tools. DBAs can also assign roles, system privileges, object privileges, and storage-quotas to users. =Debugging= Some tools offer features for the debugging of stored procedures: Step In, Step Over, Step Out, Run Until Exception, Breakpoints, View & Set Variables, View Call Stack, and so on. Users can debug any program- unit without making any modification to it, including triggers and object types. =Performance monitoring= Monitoring tools may show the database resources ‚Äî usage summary, service time summary, recent activities, top sessions, session history or top SQL ‚Äî in easy-to-read graphs. Database administrators can easily monitor the health of various components in the monitoring instance. Application developers may also make use of such tools to diagnose and correct application-performance problems as well as improve SQL server performance. =Test Data= Test data generation tools can populate the database by realistic test data for server or client side testing purposes.

The museum is located in a ship-like formed building which formerly served as a training center for future sailors on trading ships. Overview The museum to which entry is free, exhibits marine engines in the basement, models of famous historical and contemporary vessels and ancient maps on the first and second floor, marine utensils such as ropes, lights and anchors on the first floor, as well as providing an extensive library on the third floor. The museum has a partnership with the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. Most texts in the museum are written in English as well as Chinese, some also in Japanese language. Ship models One of the museum's largest asset are its down-scaled realistic ship models, some of which are result of intense research.

Although those boats are often referred to as \\"Orchid Island Canoe\\" or \\"Lanyu Canoe\\", they are actually not canoes, but boats, because they are assembled from several pieces of different woods. To build the boats either 21 (for the small variant) or 27 (for the larger variant) pieces of wood are used, where different kinds of wood are used for different pieces. For painting the boat only the colors black, white and red are used. The colors are produced from materials found naturally on the island.

It was directed and choreographed in the flamenco style by Maria Pag√®s. It is the third part of the Saura's flamenco trilogy he made in the 1980s, after Bodas de sangre in 1981 and Carmen in 1983. The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. The film is based on El amor brujo composed by Manuel de Falla. Plot summary Candela, who is loved by Carmelo, marries Jos√© in a pre- arranged marriage decided by their respective fathers. Jos√© is in love with the flirtatious Luc√≠a and dies defending her honor. Carmelo is mistakenly arrested for the killing, and spends several years in prison. After being released, he declares his love for Candela. Although Candela is now \\"free\\" to marry Carmelo she is haunted (and obsessed) by the ghost of Jos√©, who reappears every night to dance with her. Candela, while speaking with Luc√≠a, learns that Jos√© pursued her even after he married Candela. She renounces him, but is unable to shake his hold on her. T√≠a Rosario provides the solution - Lucia must dance with Jos√©, an act which will exorcise his ghost forever. (It is never made clear if Luc√≠a actually gives up her life to join him, but she never reappears in the film after their dance scene.) Soundtrack The film fleshed out the story with spoken dialogue and several songs, but used the entire score of the ballet. The Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a was conducted by Jes√∫s L√≥pez-Cobos.

Around the world, about 25% of all Samoans claim Chinese ancestry. Nearly all Chinese nationals in Samoa reside within the Apia municipal area; neighbouring American Samoa,Pan (2003), p. 303 also has a small population of Chinese expatriates. The Chinese community in Samoa is growing and becoming economically strong. A new wave of northern Chinese migrants are moving to Samoa, bringing their culture and languages with them. There are no Chinese schools in Samoa but an estimated 98.7% of Chinese expatriates and migrants send their children and youth to Robert Louis Stevenson School, Samoa which is a private school with an Australasian and Samoan curriculum. There is a primary campus located in the village of Lotopa, Faleata District and the secondary campus in the urban village of Tafaigata. Notable Chinese businesses include Frankie's Supermarket and Wholesale, Alan Wholesale, and Treasure Garden, as well as other small businesses and restaurants. An estimated 4000 Chinese tourists visit Samoa every year via Apia's Faleolo International Airport. History An example of a contract for Chinese indentured labour used in Samoa c.1903. Historical records of Chinese settlement dates back to at least the 1870s. Two Chinese sailors under the command of Bully Hayes were based there for two years, and one of them settled down in 1876 and married a Samoan wife. A few Chinese traders also settled in Samoa and raised local families, and maintained close ties with Samoa's paramount chief, Malietoa Laupepa. In 1880, Malietoa issued a subsequent ban on people of Chinese descent from settling in Samoa.Crocombe (2007), p. 32 Four years after Western Samoa came under German rule in 1899, the colonial governor Wilhelm Solf lifted Malietoa's ban and shipped in Chinese labourers from 1903 onwards.Tu'u'u (2002), p. 462 Chinese labourers reportedly complained of tough working punishments as well as brutal physical punishments which they had to face, and these reports prompted the provincial governor of Canton to stop sending Chinese labourers to the German colonies. Chinese immigrants were almost entirely men, and most of the labourers took Samoan women as wives and by 1918 offspring of Chinese-Samoan descent were a visible minority, although smaller in terms of population compared to offspring of European (particularly German) and Samoan descent.American Samoa Historical Calendar This eventually led to a ban in 1931 that prohibited Chinese men from interacting with Samoan women on all grounds. By the end of World War II only 295 Chinese remained, all of whom had either taken Samoan wives or were unmarried. Many Chinese labourers had since returned to China or remained in Samoa with their families. In 1994, China provided financial assistance to fund the construction of the government office building in Apia. More recently the Chinese government has funded various other Samoan government construction projects. Aeau Peniamina, deputy leader of the Samoa Democratic United Party, caused a minor controversy in January 2005 when he remarked that \\"there are too many Chinese in the country\\". Joe Keil, the Minister of Tourism, who is of part-Chinese descent, promptly rebutted Peniamina's remarks. Chinese-Samoans are well represented in the civil service, and China established diplomatic relations with Samoa in November 1975. Chinese-Samoans are especially well represented in the retail, import-export, and restaurant sectors, notably in Apia. Samoa's legislative capital city, Apia, signed a treaty on 31 August 2015 with a delegation from Shenzhen, China, making Apia and Shenzhen, Guangdong, China sister cities. The treaty will help promote Chinese tourism to boost Samoa's growing tourism industry, bring economic growth to Samoa, and encourage stronger ties between the two cities. Shenzhen Airlines is also set to operate flights from Shenzhen International Airport and Faleolo International Airport in Apia. An example of a contract for Chinese indentured labour used in Samoa c.1903. Language The majority of the Chinese indentured labourers came from the Guangdong province and generally spoke Cantonese or Hakka as their primary language. However, their descendants in Samoa have adopted Samoan and English as their mother tongues, while Cantonese is still reportedly spoken by a few elderly people.Barm√© (2006), p. 698 Since the 1980s, the overwhelming majority of Chinese immigrants and enterprises are derived from mainland China where Mandarin Chinese is spoken. Cultural contribution The cultural legacy of Chinese laborers in Samoa is readily apparent in the various Chinese dishes that have been adopted into Samoan cuisine. Chinese immigrants brought their culinary traditions with them to Samoa, where rice (alaisa), noodles (lialia), cha siu bao (keke pua'a), chop suey (sapasui), and Chinese pastries (keke saina, masi saina) have all been adopted into standard Samoan cuisine. Several food items such as taro, arrowroot, and sugarcane were already familiar to the Chinese and Samoans prior to colonial times. Entrepreneurship, commerce, frugality, and communal investment are all business practices and cultural traits that facilitated the rise of Chinese immigrants from plantation laborers to business owners, shopkeepers, and trading moguls. The commercial and financial contribution of the Chinese continued as more Samoan-Chinese marriages and business arrangements were made. This Chinese-Samoan prevalence in modern Samoa is still apparent in the many prominent firms in Apia that bear Chinese names, such as Ah Liki Wholesale, Apia Central Hotel (proprietor, Ah Kam family), Leung Wai Legal Services, Chan Chui & Sons, Ltd, Ah Him Co., Treasure Garden (Chen Pao family), etc. Despite obvious physical and cultural differences, it became apparent to both the Cantonese and the Samoans that their cultures shared much in common, and intermarriage since the 1870s has resulted in a large proportion of ethnic Samoans having Chinese ancestry today. Respect for parents, veneration of ancestors, and strong extended family and clan relationships were mutually shared customs. The traditional Chinese camphor chest (jeung seung, Ê®üÁÆ±) has become commonplace in Samoan homes, where they are called atola'au. Ornately carved furniture and wall panels have also been adopted, often with Samoan-themed carvings and inlay. Names Many people of Chinese descent in Samoa took their fathers' first names as their surnames, rather than their actual Chinese surnames due to Chinese personal naming convention where the family name is written first and the given name next. Many of these names are of Cantonese origin, as the majority of the Chinese who settled in Samoa came from Taishan and Panyu. Chinese-Samoans often have surnames that start with \\"Ah,\\" \\"Po,\\" or \\"Ho\\" and common examples of Chinese- Samoan families include Ah Seu, Ah Kuoi, Ah Van, Ah Mu (of whom some descendants have adopted the name \\"Rivers\\"), Po Ching, Ah You, Ho Ching, Ah Kam, Ah Liki, Ah Sam, Ah Mau, Ah Ching, Ah Fong, Ah Loe and Ah Wong.Leiataua or Lei'ataua: The Polynesian Origin and Migrations; Second Samoan Congregational Church UCC Convocation on Racial Justice-Portland, Oregon The retention of the \\"Ah\\" prefix is also common in Chinese-Hawaiian surnames, such as Akina, Ahuna, Akee, Akiona and Akaka. The practice stems from the Cantonese word \\"ah\\" (Èòø) used before proper names when respectfully addressing family members - as in \\"ah-po\\" (ÈòøÂ©Ü), maternal grandmother; \\"ah-gong\\" (ÈòøÂÖ¨), maternal grandfather; \\"ah-ma\\" (ÈòøÂ´≤), paternal grandmother, etc. Likewise, some European- Samoan names begin with \\"Misi,\\" the Samoan transliteration of \\"Mister\\" (Mr.) - as in Misiluki (\\"Mr. Luke\\"), Misimua/Misimoa (\\"Mr. Moors\\"), Misipaulo (\\"Mr. Paul\\"), Misitea (\\"Mr. Stair\\"), and Misikea (\\"Mr. Gurr\\") Notable Samoans of Chinese descent * See :Samoan people of Chinese descent * Eveni Tafiti, Multicultural Counselor of Weber State University * Verona Lovel Parker, Miss Samoa 1997Miss Samoa 1997: Verona Lovel Tapu Ah Ching - Parker *Muagututagata Peter Ah Him, Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa *Papaliitele Niko Lee Hang, Minister of Communication and Information Technology and member of 15th Samoan Parliament *Harrison Hansen, New Zealand rugby league footballer. *Patrick Ah Van, New Zealand rugby league footballer. *Frank-Paul Nu'uausala, New Zealand rugby league footballer. *Hans Keil, Ministry of Tourism, Samoa *Leeson Ah Mau, New Zealand rugby league footballer. *Michael Chee Kam, New Zealand rugby league footballer.

He attended The King's School in Peterborough, as a boarding pupil, where he played in several amateur bands. Formerly of Sheffield band Graph, Burden was employed as a session keyboard player for the Human League's October 1980 tour, covering for Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh's keyboards after their departure. In March 1981 he returned to the band full-time, and would co-write much of their early 1980s material. He left the band in 1987. Burden recorded a solo album, Loot, in 1990. In 1995, Burden released a CD through Inertia Records entitled A Swim in the Ocean. This was a collaboration with Human League session player and contributor Russell Dennett. The band called themselves Deep Down Crazy, and consisted of Dan Boulton on vocals, Chris Broadhead on drums, Russell Dennett on guitar/keyboards/vocals and Burden on bass/keyboards. The recording took place at The Stockyard in Leicestershire. Burden played bass guitar on the 2006 debut eponymous release for The Tenth Stage, a Melbourne-based band, and also on their second album, Grand Guignol.
