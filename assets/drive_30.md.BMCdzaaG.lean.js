Ugyen Dorji (, , 1855‚Äì1916) was a member of the elite Dorji family and an influential Bhutanese politician. He served as the closest adviser to Ugyen Wangchuck, the hereditary 12th Penlop of Trongsa and later 1st Druk Gyalpo. Ugyen Dorji was instrumental in advising the Penlop to aid the British Empire in its expedition to Tibet in 1904 and fostering friendly relations with the British after the Bhutan War (1864‚Äì1865). Operating from Bhutan House in Kalimpong, India, Ugyen Dorji used his position to open Bhutan to the outside world, establish Bhutan's foreign relations, and operate a lucrative trading outlet. Family He was a son of Dasho Sharpa Puchung, Dzongpon, and his wife, Thinley Pem, a lady from the Tsento in Paro. His sister was Ayi Thubten Wangmo. Ugyen Dorji's son Sonam Topgay Dorji was born in 1896. His descendants maintained and developed the political power of Ugyen Dorji, marrying into the royal House of Wangchuck. Life Ugyen Dorji served as Kazi from 1902 to 1907 to Ugyen Wangchuck the 12th Penlop of Trongsa, and then simultaneously as Penlop (Governor) of Haa, Gongzim (Chief Minister), and Deb Zimpon (Chief Secretary) (1907‚Äì1916) under the Royal Government as during its period of consolidation. Ugyen Dorji garnered increasing power through his connections to the successful House of Wangchuck and the British Empire. Kazi Dorji had advised the future First King to mediate between the British and Tibet, and later to allow the large-scale induction of Nepalis into Bhutan, establishing friendly ties with British India. In 1910, Sikkim Political Officer and Tibetologist Sir Charles Alfred Bell engaged Bhutan and signed the Treaty of Punakha and other agreements that had the effect of assigning land in Motithang (Thimphu) and a hill station between Chukha and Thimphu to the British, assigning a portion of Kalimpong to Bhutan, and doubling the per annum subsidy from Britain to Bhutan. The land around the Kalimpong estate had previously been ceded from Bhutan to British India at the conclusion the Bhutan War and as a condition of the Treaty of Sinchula in 1865. Kazi Ugyen Dorji settled the land and took advantage of the lucrative trade routes through Kalimpong, and by 1898 assumed the roles of Trade Agent and mediator between the British Empire and Tibet. The estate, which contained notable stables, contributed significantly to the development of the community and commerce in Kalimpong. From his estate in Kalimpong, India, Ugyen Wangchuck operated Bhutan House. Ugyen Dorji had the grounds consecrated by Chogley Yeshey Ngodrup on his return from a pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya. In 1912, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, stayed at the newly built Bhutan House for three months as the guest of Raja Kazi Ugyen Dorji and his sister Ayi Thubten Wongmo. Bhutan House itself was reportedly constructed by the Dorji family especially to host the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama dubbed Bhutan House Migyur Ngona Phodrang (\\"Palace of Unchanging Delight\\" or \\"Palace of Unchanging Supreme Joy\\") and presented the household with gifts of altars and consecrated statuettes, as well as many precious religious and secular robes. Once the Dalai Lama returned to Tibet, he sent Bhutan House a large gilded bronze statue of himself for the attached lhakhang (temple) he dubbed Dechen Gatsal (\\"The Happy Garden of Great Bliss\\"). In return, the household had offered the Dalai Lama silver to be dedicated for the production of a statue of the Thousand-armed and Thousand-eyed Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezi Chatong Chentong) in Lhasa, which the Dalai Lama had made. After the death of his host, the Dalai Lama gave the Dorji family a kashog (decree) written on yellow silk and sealed with his great seal; the kashog expressed his gratitude for the hospitality he received at Bhutan House, and for the efforts of the Dorji family to aid the Tibetan people. Because of its association with the Dalai Lama, Bhutan House is still known among Tibetans as Migyur Ngonga Phodrang. Honours Ugyen Dorji was granted the personal title of Rai Bahadur on January 1, 1907. He was also promoted to Raja on December 11, 1911. He received the Delhi Durbar Medal in silver twice (January 1, 1903 and December 12, 1911) and the Ugyen Wangchuck Medal 1st class (November 17, 1909).

The first part of the house was built by Robert Rudston circa 1567-75 on the site of an earlier manor house. It has been modified a number of times during its history achieving its present form in 1819. It has been a home to a number of members of parliament for Maidstone or for Kent, including Sir Francis Barnham (owner 1613-46), Sir Robert Barnham (1646-85) Sir Barnham Rider (1698-1728) and Thomas Rider (1805-47). The house sits on a south facing slope giving views across the extensive deer park and the Weald beyond. Kitchen gardens to the north of the house remain as remnants of 16th-century formal garden planting. The house is a Grade I listed building and its barn is listed Grade II. The parks and gardens are listed Grade II. History Prior to the sixteenth century, the manor of Boughton Monchelsea passed by marriage or sale through the ownership of several families of minor gentry. From 1214, the manor was in the possession of the Hougham family. On the death of Robert de Hougham in 1317, it passed to his daughter Benedicta, wife of John de Shelving. On her death in 1349 without a male heir, the manor was divided between her daughters Helen and Joan. The portion of the manor of which the Boughton Monchelsea Place estate was part passed to Joan de Shelving's husband John Brampton. The estate then passed to his daughter Benedicta, wife of Thomas Towne, and to her daughter Benedicta, wife of William Watton. Around 1460, Watton sold the estate to Reginald Peckham who recombined the two parts of the manor. On the death of Peckham's grandson Thomas Peckham in 1521, the manor was left to his daughter. Her husband quickly sold the estate to Sir Thomas Wyatt. His son, Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger, sold the estate to Robert Rudston in 1551. Following Rudston's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion against Mary I, he was fortunate to be reprieved from a death sentence, though his estate was confiscated by the Crown. It was restored to him when Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. Rudston had the first parts of the current house built circa 1567-75 as an extension to an earlier house to the west. Rudston's son Isaac next owned the house. On his death without a son, he left the house to his brother Belknap Rudston, who, on his death in 1613, left it to Sir Francis Barnham, several times member of parliament for Maidstone. Sir Francis's son Sir Robert Barnham next occupied the house, taking the manor's name as his territorial designation when created a baronet in 1663. Sir Robert served as MP for Maidstone in the Convention Parliament of 1660 and in the Cavalier Parliament from 1661 to 1679. His son Francis predeceased him and, on his death around 1685, the estate was inherited by his daughter Philadelphia Barnham, wife of Thomas Rider. Thomas Rider was MP for Maidstone in 1690 and from 1696 to 1698. He carried out a number of alterations to the house and its grounds between 1685 and 1690. Following his death in 1698, the estate was inherited by his son Sir Barnham Rider, MP for Maidstone from 1722 to 1727, and then his son, Thomas Rider. The second Thomas Rider left the house to his cousin Ingram Rider in 1786. In 1805, Ingram Rider left it to his son Thomas Rider, MP for Kent and West Kent from 1831 to 1835. The third Thomas Rider rebuilt parts of the house and extended and re-landscaped the park. On his death in 1847, he left the house to his nephew, also Thomas Rider, who let the house to a series of tenants. From 1903 to 1998, the house was occupied by the Winch family, firstly as leaseholders then, from 1960, as freeholders. The Winches sold the house in 1998; it remains in private ownership and belongs to the Kendrick family. Buildings \\"Boughton Court\\" by Thomas Badeslade (1719), showing the house with the original north and west wings and formal gardens intact The two-storey L-shaped main house forms the east and south sides of a courtyard with single-storey stables forming the north and west sides. To the south-west of the house, is a second, larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings. The house is the remainder of a former courtyard house built for Robert Rudston circa 1567-75 as an extension to an earlier, pre-16th-century house. It is built of Kentish ragstone, roughly coursed on the north half of the east range and more regularly coursed on the south half of the east range and on the south range. The centre of the east range features a two-storey porch with galleted stonework on the upper level. The roof is of plain clay tiles, stone gabled at the north end of the east range but otherwise hipped, with four stone gabled dormers on the east fa√ßade and five smaller ones on the south fa√ßade. A frieze band with cornice and moulded stone base runs above the first floor windows on the east fa√ßade but is not repeated on the south, where only a moulded string course appears. Battlements were added to the eaves on both fa√ßades in 1819 as part of the third Thomas Rider's works. Windows on the east fa√ßade are rectangular with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames. On the south fa√ßade, the ground floor windows are taller with a number being two- and three-lighted and stone framed. A chamfered two-storey bay is located slightly to the right of centre. Windows on the first floor are simpler and less tall. The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range. The north range is built up in red and grey brick from the stone walls of the demolished range. The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647. West side of the barn Internally, the south range includes three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that have probably been reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room on the first floor include 16th- or early-17th- century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th- century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass. The timber-framed western barn was constructed in the 15th or early 16th century with an extension or alternations made at the north end in the late 18th or early 19th century. The walls are constructed in a combination of methods - stone walling, weatherboarding or brick infill between timber studs. The steeply pitched plain tiled roof contains six dormers on the west side and one on the east side and is hipped with a gablet to the south end and half-hipped to the north end. A carriage entry passes through the centre of the barn. A single-storey extension runs at a right angle to the south end of the east side, probably built in the 16th century. The two-storey extension to the east side of the north end is lower than the main barn with a half-hipped roof. The house and courtyard buildings are Grade I listed buildings. The barn is listed Grade II. Within the grounds are a sundial, a mounting block and a stone arch, each Grade II listed. Park The house seen from the park looking north-west The house sits in grounds of approximately on a south-facing escarpment giving views south and east across the Weald. The formal entrance is north-west of the house, which is approached through woodland along a drive of approximately . Immediately to the east and south of the house are open lawns. To the north of the house are three enclosed gardens, two of which are arranged as kitchen gardens. These are remnants of a 16th-century formal garden scheme which was removed and replaced by informal landscaping during the third Thomas Rider's tenure. The steeply sloping ground to the south and south-east of the house is maintained as a deer park with a lake about south-east of the house. The estate is private property and is not usually open to the public, but the Greensand Way long distance walk crosses the parkland east-west to the north of the house.

Painted in 1926‚Äì28, it was the largest painting he had done at the time, and required 192 sittings to complete. The painting, which is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, contains the most explicit references to Dickinson's roots and loved ones. Analysis The Fossil Hunters is a dark, monochromatic scene depicting an old man and a young woman asleep in an ambiguous setting amid draperies and rocks. The word \\"Sheldrake,\\" incised on rock above the old man, names a town on the west side of Saranac Lake where the young Dickinson spent summers exploring the glens near the family's summer cottage, where he hunted for fossils and to which he returned periodically as an adult to visit.Ward, 2003, pp. 39, 65, 67, 109, 123, 236: note 15. The rocky ground on which the figures rest is meant to suggest this terrain. \\"F2,\\" written in the sail hanging at the left, refers to Frances (Pat) Foley, his fianc√©, and the letters B.D., beneath the mask of Beethoven are the initials of the artist's older brother Burgess Dickinson‚Äîknown as Beethoven to his classmates at Yale‚Äîwho had died by suicide in 1913. The female figure in the lower right corner was posed for by his sister, Antoinette, or \\"Tibi\\".Driscoll, 1985, pp. 83, 121: note 10.

A few trilobites are included, the Beethoven mask lies on a large brachiopod,Driscoll, 1985, p. 89. and the corner of a photograph of a fossil is visible under the man's right elbow. The picture was unnamed in his letters or journals until after he had read a history of men who had developed vaccines to combat debilitating diseases, Microbe Hunters,Dickinson. Journals, 22‚Äì23 September 1927; 16 April 1928. Reel D93. including tuberculosis, which killed his mother. The author compared scientists searching for cures to artists and stated that the search of microbe hunters was risky, sometimes fatal.Ward, 2003, p. 113. Rather than hunters, the principal figures appear to be sleeping or dead. Driscoll believes that all of the picture's imagery are \\"memory stimulants\\" and takes a passage Dickinson had underlined from Proust as the picture's inspiration.Driscoll, 1985, p. 90. Remarkable, however, is the absence of any detail in this painting inviting association with the properties Proust singled out in the cited passage as the bearers of \\"the vast structure of recollection\\": \\"the smell and taste of things\\". Clinical psychologist Eliot Adler (invited by art historian Matthew Baigell to make some observations about four of Dickinson's pictures, based evidently only on the information in Lloyd Goodrich's 1965 catalogue) took Dickinson's remark about searching for fossils \\"in his native country\\" as linking the picture's terrain with \\"the earth from which he sprang\\".Adler, 1982, p. 125. In addition to references to death and a return to the earth, Adler points to imagery that suggests birth from an Earth Mother, including the \\"distinctly labial\\" drapery. Ward agrees, pointing to the woman apparently emerging from a void in the rocky cliff (in the preferred birth orientation, head first) through the drawn-back curtains. He suggests that the idea of Mother Earth as the picture's setting is deliberate, as indicated by a clue Dickinson left. Just above the emerging woman is a breast presented as part of the rock formation. Although it matches the rocks in value and hue, its spherical shape, reinforced by its cast shadow, and the suggestion of a nipple, make the metaphor clear. Dickinson at one point had painted a seated nude at the top of the picture,Goodrich, p. 8 and Adler identifies her as the mother from which his sister at the lower right and he himself (whom Adler identifies as the old man) were born. The identification of his brother with Beethoven (not known of by Adler) strengthens the idea. The breast, then, may be understood as a more subtle reference to Mother Earth than the nude it replaced. Dickinson described the two reclining figures as sleeping,Kuh, 1960, p. 73. which suggests that the scene may be dreamed by the old man, who imagines himself as asleep on his mother's body, comforted by the memories of loved ones. Ward suggests that a specific dream Dickinson described in a letter may also explain an important part of the painting's meaning, particularly because he seems to have been reminded of it by the topic he had just been discussing. On November 12, 1926, four days before he began painting his picture, but eleven days after he began planning it,Dickinson. Journals, 1 and 16 November 1926, Reel D93. he wrote of the upcoming Beethoven centennial and of a Buffalo man who had met Beethoven. Then with no transition he wrote, \\"Dreamed last night I saved a man from drowning in Havanna [sic] harbor.\\"Dickinson. Sawyer letters, 12 November 1926, Reel 901: 0766. Since writing about Beethoven seems to have reminded him of his dream, Ward suggests that the man he saved in his dream was his brother, that it expressed a wish that he could have saved his brother's life when he leaped from Edwin's sixth floor apartment.Ward, 2003, p. 114. He argues that the dream has a specific art reference to John Singleton Copley's painting, Watson and the Shark, in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It depicts the young Brook Watson being rescued from a shark (and from drowning) in Havana Harbor. Dickinson may well have intended the painting he was about to be a means of \\"rescuing\\" Burgess through art. The following March, Dickinson wrote that he was given a death mask of Beethoven.Dickinson. Journals, 18 March 1927. Reel D93. Significantly, the death mask shows his eyes closed. Dickinson opened the eyes in his painting, and in so doing, not only immortalized his brother, but gave him back the life he remembered him having. Adler sees the old man as holding a stick (a symbolic paintbrush) to the grindstone as expressing the artist's \\"'labor' to give birth to something eternal,\\" as signified by the fossil-like Beethoven mask by his hand,Adler, 1982, p. 126. the reference to a hunt for fossils referring to this desire to leave behind remains‚Äîart‚Äîthat will survive death, as a woman's children outlive her. Dickinson himself admitted that the desire to make something as lasting as the work of the old masters was manifested in the size of the work (at 96¬Ω inches high it was the largest painting he had done).Ward, 2003, p. 110.

From 1963 to 1966 he was an Assistant Massachusetts Attorney General. When Attorney General Edward Brooke was elected to the United States Senate, Cowin joined him as a legislative assistant. He returned to Massachusetts in 1968 as special counsel to Mayor of Boston Kevin White. In 1969 he was named Chairman of the State Public Utilities Commission by Governor Francis W. Sargent.

During the campaign, Cowin struggled to raise money and trailed Spaulding in polls. Cowin finished third in the Republican primary with 24% of the vote. After the primary, Governor Sargent asked for state Republican chairman William Barnstead's resignation and recommended that Cowin succeed him.

Description The length of the body varies between 7 mm and 25 mm. In this species the mantle can vary in color from reddish purple to pinkish orange. The mantle border is creamy white. Just inside the mantle border are a series of reddish purple streaks or smudged marks which are a more vibrant purple than the main body color. Along the midline of the animal is a white patch that matches the white border. This patch sometimes encircles the gills and extends anteriorly between the rhinophores. The line is often broken into two patches anterior-posteriorly. The rhinophores and branchia (gills) have an orange-red tint. Identifying individual purple sea slugs within the genus Noumea can be challenging because purple forms exist in several related species.

It was introduced in October 1985 as HP's first IBM- compatible PC. Hewlett-Packard, which originally made its name through selling test equipment, made its move into the computing field in 1967 with HP 1000/2100 minicomputers. Further minicomputer and terminal products followed in the coming years, and in 1983, the company finally released a microcomputer, the HP 150 series. It only lasted two years before HP embraced the IBM PC standard with the Vectra line. Mainly targeted at business, scientific, engineering, and other professional markets, the Vectra was HP's bread-and-butter computer range for over 15 years. InfoWorld stated that HP was \\"responding to demands from its customers for full IBM PC compatibility\\". Vectras were not entirely IBM-compatible, and in the early years, had a considerable amount of non-standard hardware features, including hard disk types, keyboards, and the mouse interface, and corresponding BIOS extensions named EX-BIOS, thus requiring their own custom OEM version of MS-DOS. Software that used strictly BIOS calls, would work, but anything that performed low- level hardware access, often had problems. Vectras notably failed to pass the most popular compatibility test of the day, which involved running Lotus 123 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. By the time 486 PCs became commonplace, however, most of the proprietary hardware in HP machines had been dropped. In 1995, HP added the Pavilion line as a lower-end range designed for the home and educational markets (which the company had ignored up to this point), including both desktop PCs and the company's first laptops, and in 2001, the Vectra was dropped, with the whole lineup consolidated under the Pavilion label.

It specializes in used philosophy and English poetry books. History The bookstore was started by Adrian King-Edwards and Luci Friesen of McGill University in 1973 in their own apartment living room as an \\"underground\\" bookstore, with a photo of George Bernard Shaw to their front window. The couple, who had first met at McGill University, had spent the previous summer hawking paperbacks out of their VW van in Northern British Columbia, prior to the opening of the store in their apartment. They moved their store next door into its current location on 469 Milton Street in 1975, which was the site of the former neighborhood Chinese laundry for 70 years. Housed in this 19th- century brick building with a main floor a little larger than your average living room, the store has changed very little since it first opened. There are still no computers or electronic cash registers and calls are still made on a rotary phone. On a frosty December afternoon you‚Äôre still likely to spot someone curled up in the antique armchair beside the warm gas stove, reading a mystery novel. And, of course, shelves overflowing with hundreds of books still run from floor to ceiling on every wall. When The Word opened for the first time, the McGill students and poets who had frequented the apartment next door for bi-weekly poetry readings and impromptu literary salons were among their first customers. Over the years, The Word has become a citywide institution, frequently ranking as the number one secondhand bookstore in the Montreal Mirror‚Äôs annual Best of Montreal list. In 2009, the Quebec Writers‚Äô Federation presented Friesen and King-Edwards with the QWF community award in honour of the couple‚Äôs contribution to local literary culture. The Word holds readings of poetic works and publication announcement of local authors and has been an important meeting place and inspiration for Canadian writers such as Artie Gold and Sheila Fischman. Specialization The Word Bookstore specializes in literature, philosophy and poetry. They also carry a unique assortment of books in such fields as drama, history, political science, theology, Eastern religion, and art. A section located at the front of the store beneath a framed black and white photo of Leonard Cohen highlights the latest work of Montreal poets. Take a glance at the shelf below and you‚Äôll find a wide array of Canadian literary magazines, independent books sold on consignment, and student-produced zines. The shopper on a tight budget need look no further than their one-dollar shelf and fifty-cent pile where fresh books of all kinds are added on a daily basis. The Word is also renowned for the high quality of its stocked items, with books purchased from the estates of retiring or deceased professors, or from its largely McGill-based scholarly clientele. It is a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Canada.

Built as one of the centrepieces of the hospitality and 'party zone' facilities for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, it can host up to 6,000 people, and was to originally cost $7.9 million. It was designed by Jasmax and built by Fletcher Construction. The venue's location and construction was at times controversial, being nicknamed 'The Slug' by opponents, and for intending to displace two historical storage warehouses that were considered worth saving by heritage campaigners. In the compromise solution, rather than demolishing both sheds, one was saved and will be retained as a separate venue space directly next to The Cloud. The work around The Cloud (construction $9.8 million) and Shed 10 (repairs for around $4 million) also included structural repairs to the wharf's piling, as well as significant installation of new services, including power and data cabling, water and wastewater lines, with most of the utilities fastened to the underside of the wharf. An evaluation report by Nielsen for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise said, \\"showcases at the Cloud on Queens Wharf changed international visitors' impressions of the country, convincing them that New Zealand could be innovative.\\" As of late 2012, the consensus is that the building will remain on the wharf at least for the medium term, used as an event venue. Rugby World Cups Auckland Regional Council has held this multifunction building as a party central for many events including the Rugby World Cup. In 2015, Auckland mayor Len Brown decided to show the final between New Zealand and Australia at the complex, as they decided that there are many cafes, restaurants and bars there for use of the public, as well as watching from the comfort of your own television.

She was one of the first American academics to be out during a time when gay rights were an unfamiliar concept. Early life and career Margaret Louise Cruikshank was born in Duluth, Minnesota on April 26, 1940 to George Patrick and Louise Wimmer. She attended The College of St. Scholastica, obtaining her Bachelor of Arts in English in 1962. In the early 1960s she came out as a lesbian within the Minneapolis lesbian-feminist community. She received her Ph.D in Victorian literature from Loyola University, writing her dissertation on Thomas B. Macaulay. Cruikshank taught English at Loyola, Central College and St. John's University. In 1975 she began teaching at Minnesota State University, establishing the first women's studies department at the university, serving as director. Upon her arrival at MSU she was closeted publicly as a lesbian, and by her leave in 1977, to move to San Francisco, she was open to her colleagues. Teaching career in San Francisco Upon moving to San Francisco, Cruikshank worked as resource director for the short-lived Gay National Educational Switchboard; an organization that provided information through a toll-free telephone number. In August 1980 she became head of a small program of the Continuing Education department at the University of San Francisco. She then went on to teach at the English department at the City College of San Francisco, teaching ESL and working with CCSF faculty to incorporate gay/lesbian studies into curriculum. Her successful efforts inspired CCSF to open their Castro/Valencia Campus, and in 1982 Cruikshank was the first woman to teach the college's lesbian and gay literature class, which she taught until 1996. During the 1980s she also served as an affiliate scholar at the Center for Research on Women at Stanford University. In 1992, she received her Master of Arts in gerontology from San Francisco State University. In 1992 and 1993 she taught a course in lesbian and gay aging at City College of San Francisco. She continued to teach at CCSF until her move to Maine in 1997. Writing Her research and educational work focuses on awareness and acceptance of lesbian academia and the exclusion of lesbian literature and criticism from traditional literature studies and women's studies. Her work has been published in Gay Community News, Radical Teacher, the Journal of Homosexuality and The Advocate. Her anthologies The Lesbian Path (1980), Lesbian Studies: Present and Future (1982), and New Lesbian Writing (1984) helped to establish lesbian studies as a part of women's studies in the academy. Cruikshank's 1980 anthology, The Lesbian Path, included short personal narratives of lesbians. Her 1982 anthology, Lesbian Studies: Present and Future, highlights the importance of lesbian studies in higher learning and includes experiences of lesbians in the academy. New Lesbian Writing, her third anthology, was published in 1984 and includes fiction and non-fiction from lesbians. Her 1995 book Fierce with Reality includes essays by lesbian writers and focuses on aging. Current life Cruikshank lives in a small fishing village on the eastern coast of Maine. After teaching English, gay/lesbian studies and women's studies for many years, she retired from the University of Maine in 2011. She continues as a faculty associate at The Maine Center on Aging. In 1997, she donated a selection of her archives to the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives in West Hollywood. She is a recipient of two Fulbright senior specialist awards, one for the University of Victoria's Centre on Aging (2007) and a forthcoming one at the University of Graz in Austria.

Begun in 1933 and completed in 1937, it is Dickinson's largest work. Painted in oil on canvas and nearly monochromatic, the allegorical composition depicts two headless nudes in a mysterious setting amid still life elements. The painting is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York. History In November 1933 Dickinson decided to put aside his large painting Woodland Scene, which he had been unable to bring to a satisfactory resolution, and began a new painting‚Äîhis largest‚Äîthat he eventually gave the neutral name of Composition with Still Life. Adopting a more systematic method of painting than he had used previously, he began by mixing batches of paints in incremental values, evidently limited saturation, and with the darkest value considerably higher in key than in his darker, earlier pictures,Ward, 2003, pp. 147, 148. a method that he employed in Stranded Brig as well. Work progressed steadily in 1934, except for the period Dickinson worked on Stranded Brig, followed by a hospitalization for back pain and ulcers, and for two months at the beginning of 1935, when he finished up work on Woodland Scene at the request of his patron, Esther Hoyt Sawyer. Despite teaching painting classes at the Art Institute of Buffalo in the fall of 1934 and the following spring, Dickinson, with the use of Esther's painting studio, managed 216 sittings by June 16, 1935.Ward, 2003, p. 147. But eleven days later, on the family's return to Provincetown, police stopped them to inform them that Edwin's eldest brother, Howard, had been murdered in Detroit.Baldwin, in Dreishpoon, et al., 215. Howard's death hit him hard, and he ceased work on the painting. Although he made some attempts to resume work on the painting, and despite his keen awareness of the importance to his career of completing the painting swiftly and well, it was not until May 1936 that he resumed steady work on it. From then on, he worked at it fairly steadily, despite a few interruptions, until March 14, 1937, when the sittings numbered 396. Nineteen sittings were done beginning June 27 and then a long break until September 20, after which, in a flurry of activity, he added another fifty sittings. He painted the final object in his picture, a pale blue rose, between October 30 and November 1, on which day he wrote in his journal that the picture was done. Analysis Adler found Composition with Still Life especially difficult to provide a psychological interpretation of, but thought it suggested \\"a picture of journey's end or of the last harbor.\\" He observed that the presentation of objects and figures \\"‚Äîempty, abandoned, useless, dropped‚Äîconveys a sense of impotence, frigidity, or death.\\"Adler, 1982, p. 126 Mitchell Kahan recognized in this work, as in other paintings by Dickinson, \\"an iconography of concealment,\\" created by showing only parts of things, blurring boundaries, and obscuring relationships. He perceived the effect to be \\"a haunting sense of loss,\\" the paradoxical product of \\"Dickinson's incessant gaze and prolonged study of form,\\"Kahan, 1983, p. 124. and in this work combined with a sense of decapitation and death.Kahan, 1983, p. 125. Driscoll recognizes water symbolism suggestive of disaster and death at sea in the imagery and relates it to shipwrecks that occurred in Provincetown, some of which he witnessed.Driscoll, 1985, pp. 111‚Äì16. Ward points out that the title that Dickinson gave the painting, as well as its original name, Figures and Still Life seem to reflect his determination to discourage interpretation. He suggests, however, that he must have become aware of the effect of the imagery as the painting developed and that it is perhaps significant that in 1945, expressing dissatisfaction with the picture's title, he wrote to Esther, \\"\\"I . . . think I should call it 'The Flying Dutchman,'\\" the name of the legendary ship doomed to sail forever with its crew of dead men, despite the fact that the imagery does not support that specific subject.Ward, 2003, p. 151. Ward agrees with other writers about the strong sense of death created by the headless figures, the denuded trees, the horizontal vases, the ruined steps and railing descending into darkness, the spiral object, used to circulate water, but lying useless, and a form suggesting a broken bone in the right foreground.Ward, 2003, pp. 151‚Äì52. He compares the picture's entrance, leading into the dark void below, to the entrance in The Glen (Andr√©e's Balloon)Ward, 2003, p. 152. It is comparable as well to the area of darkness in the foreground of Stranded Brig, which Dickinson called \\"a deep chasm,\\"Ward, 2003, p. 134. and the entrance to Inland Lake, although here not into, but over, a dark void. Ward suggests that Composition with Still Life is the Dickinson work most explicitly presented as a dream through the combination of solid, detailed forms with passages that melt into gaseous substances or dissolve into one another.Ward, 2003, p. 153. He observes that this is the first of the large pictures in which there is no central figure whose dream the imagery might depict and that the descent into darkness represents a descent into the artist's unconscious mind \\"to come to terms with his losses and heal himself.\\"Ward, 2003, p. 154. He argues that not only the imagery but the process represents a voyage into the unknown, one that for Elaine de Kooning represents a greater willingness to confront the unexpected than does the process of Abstract Expressionists. Ward suggests that the picture may well have been affected by Howard's death and that Dickinson's decision to declare it finished on November 1, despite having left large areas unresolved, such as the section at the upper left, may have been determined by the fact that it was the anniversary of Herbert Groesbeck's death.Ward, 2003, p. 153. See also Droscoll, 1985, p. 129, note 113. In a way, Dickinson saw the painting as a triumph over death, describing his rapid conclusion of work on it by writing that it was \\"snatched from the grave in a few weeks.\\" Ward points out that this painting was the one most closely connected to his life, being begun on the anniversary of the date he became romantically involved with his wife-to-be and just prior to which he had his father baptize his son in the studio. The rose appears again, and Ward associates it with the archetype of \\"the comforting, the nourishing, the 'good' mother‚Äîyoung and beautiful‚Äîwho was known to us, and even tasted, in the remotest past.\\" But it may also be seen (in light of its associations with the Swedish art student who gave Dickinson a rose when his brother died) as having been placed in the picture in memory of all his dead loved ones.

Life and career Kerslake was born in Exeter in July 1812, proceeded in 1828 to Bristol, and soon afterwards commenced business in second-hand bookselling in Barton Alley, together with his brother-in-law, Samuel Cornish. In 1830 the partnership was dissolved, and Kerslake removed to a shop at the bottom of Park Street. A disastrous fire occurred here in 1860. Kerslake continued on the same site however, until 1870, when he removed to Queen's Road, and shortly afterwards retired. For over twenty years after his retirement he devoted himself to antiquarian controversy. Kerslake died at his private residence, Wynfred, Clevedon, on 5 January 1891. His wife, Catherine Morgan, a native of Bath, predeceased him in 1887. He had no issue. Previous to the fire, in which many works of great value and scarcity were destroyed, Kerslake had amassed a collection especially valuable in its antiquarian and arch√¶ological departments. He was also distinguished as an antiquary. Though self-taught, he had a good command of Latin and of modem languages, and his series of articles and pamphlets on antiquarian subjects is remarkable alike for shrewdness and originality.

This is one of the largest religious persecution in Tibet by the Tibetan lamas. In in 2 April 1905, the anti-catholic riot led by lamas massacred hundreds of Tibetan Catholic converts and burned churches. On 6 April, Fengquan (È≥≥ÂÖ®), the Qing's resident commissioner (amban) in Tibet and a Manchu himself, was assassinated by the lamas in Batang, Sichuan. Lamas incited xenophobia by claiming him to be a fake commissioner sent by the French and also falsely accused him of promoting French language and military uniform. On 14 April and 16 April, four French missionaries Jean-Andr√© Souli√©, Henri Mussot, Pierre-Marie Bourdonnec and Jules Dubernard were executed by lamas after two weeks of torturing, in Batang, Sichuan and D√™q√™n, Yunnan respectively. The Qing's army in D√™q√™n, whom the missionaries sought refuge to, were besieged by lamas for three months. In 24 May and November, the Qing's army captured Batang and D√™q√™n respectively, slaughtering lamas and rioters. Qing government signed a compensation agreement with the French consul in Yunnan in 23 July 1906. Qing paid 150,000 tael (roughly 5,000 kg) of silver sycees to the French and 9,000 tael (roughly 300 kg) of silver sycee to the Chinese Catholics. In the end, the imperial Chinese dynasty reasserting control of the northern frontier of Yunnan and the western frontier of Sichuan, where Tibetan monastery and the chiefs (tusi) used to have authority. Naming In Chinese sources, the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion is known as two events, the Batang incident and the Weixi missionary case (Áª¥Ë•øÊïôÊ°à). Weixi region (Áª¥Ë•øÂéÖ) is a broader region that include the modern D√™q√™n County, Weixi County and Gongshan County. French Catholic missions developed along the valleys of Mekong river and Salween river among these three counties. Background Under pressure from foreigners, the Qing Dynasty government allowed French Catholic missionaries into Tibetan Buddhist areas in Yunnan province. The Tibetan Lamas had long defied the rule of the Qing authorities and officials, and the Qing dynasty fought against a rebellion of the Lamas around 1905. The Tibetan Buddhist Lamas attacked and murdered Chinese officials, French Roman Catholic Priests from Paris Foreign Missions Society such as Jean-Andr√© Souli√© or Jules Dubernard, and Catholic converts in the area, in retaliation for the missionaries' success at converting the natives to Catholicism. The Buddhist Gelug (Yellow) Sect was primarily responsible for the revolt and deaths. Scottish Botanist George Forrest was the primary Western witness to the rebellion, having spent most of it trying to escape from Lamas intent on killing him. He wrote an account of the rebellion which was published in botanical related publications. In 1905, the Lamas started a revolt against the peasant converts from the monasteries. Chinese soldiers were sent to crush the revolt.(Original from Cornell University) Forrest wrote that the majority of the people in the Mekong valley in Yunnan were Tibetan. The Tibetan Buddhist Yellow Sect was the dominant power in the region, with their Lamas effectively governing the area. Forrest had a negative view of their reign since they used \\"force and fraud\\" to \\"terrorise the... peasantry\\". The Lamas completely ignored the Imperial Qing authorities in the region. Foreigners and Tibetan Catholics were often attacked and killed in the area. Attacks on French Catholic missionaries and converts The British invasion of Lhasa in 1904 had repercussions in the Tibetan Buddhist world, causing extreme anti-western and anti-French Catholic sentiment among Tibetan Buddhists. The British invasion also triggered intense and sudden Qing intervention in Tibetan areas, to develop, assimilate, and bring the regions under strong Qing central control. The Tibetan Lamas in Batang proceeded to revolt in 1905, massacring Chinese officials, French missionaries, and Catholic converts. The Tibetan monks opposed the Catholics, razing the Catholic mission's Church, and slaughtering all Catholic missionaries and Qing officials. Fengquan (È≥≥ÂÖ®/Âá§ÂÖ®), the Qing's resident commissioner in Tibet and a Manchu himself, was besieged and assassinated by the Tibetan Batang Lamas in 11 March 1905, along with other Manchu and Han Qing officials and the French Catholic priests, who were all massacred when the rebellion started in March 1905. Tibetan Gelugpa monks in Nyarong, Chamdo, and Litang also revolted and attacked missions and churches and slaughtered westerners. The British invasion of Lhasa, the missionaries, and the Qing were linked, in the eyes of the Tibetans, as hostile foreigners to be attacked. Zhongtian (Chungtien) was the location of the Batang monastery. The Tibetans slaughtered the converts and torched the building of the missionaries in Batang due to their xenophobia. Sir Francis Edward Younghusband wrote that At the same time, on the opposite side of Tibet they were still more actively aggressive, expelling the Roman Catholic missionaries from their long- established homes at Batang, massacring I many of their converts, and burning the mission-house. There was anti-French Catholic sentiment and xenophobia running rampant in Tibet. The French missions which were attacked were part of the Paris Foreign Mission Society (Soci√©t√© des missions √©vang√©liques de Paris MEP) and started by Fr Charles Renou. Tibetan monasteries constantly menaced the missions until the time the missionaries were killed in the 1905 rebellion. The Lamas besieged Bat'ang, burning down the mission chapel, and killing two French missionaries, Henri Mussot and Jean-Andr√© Souli√©. The Chinese Amban's Yamen was surrounded, and the Chinese General Wu Yi-chung was shot dead in the Yamen by the Lama's forces. The Chinese Amban Feng and Commandant-in-Chief Li Chia-jui managed to escape by scattering Rupees (money) behind them, which the Tibetans proceeded to try to pick up. The Ambans reached Commandant Lo's place, but the 100 Tibetan troops serving under the Amban, armed with modern weaponry, mutinied when news of the revolt reached them. The Tibetan Lamas and their Tibetan followers besieged Commandant Lo's palace, which also held local Catholic converts. In the palace, they killed all Catholic converts, both Chinese and Tibetan.(Original from Harvard University) At Yarragong and near the Yangtze the Tibetans murdered two Catholic French priests and in a gorge Feng Quan was murdered after he threw the rupees. The soldiers of the Qing at Batang were attacked by the Tibetans. The Manchu Fengquan was assassinated by the Tibetans with a gunshot to the head. George Forrest was residing at the Tzekou French Catholic Mission, which came under attack by the Tibetan Lamas. He fled through miles of mountains to flee the Tibetan Lamas who intended to \\"brutally\\" murder him. Along his escape route, he took refuge with Chinese soldiers, but his party was discovered when they passed by the Patang Lamasery; after the Tibetans heard of their presence, the Tibetans blew a \\"signal whistle\\" to alert everyone to their presence in the area.(Original from Cornell University) Around the Mekong river every Catholic priest was murdered by the Lamas; they mounted a Father Dubernard's head on the Atuntze Monastery's gate.(Original from the University of Michigan) Forrest was targeted by the Lamas, who pursued him until a Naxi \\"king\\" named Lee rescued him. On July 22, 1905, the Tibetan Lamas killed the French Catholic missionariesMission-Thibet (fr) P√®re Pierre-Marie Bourdonnec and P√®re Jules Dubernard(Original from Cornell University) around the Mekong.(Original from the University of California) A Chinese military mandarin informed Forrest on how exactly the Tibetans killed his friends. The Tibetans \\"disembowelled, beheaded and quartered\\" the body of Pere Bourdonn√© after he was shot to death. Chinese soldiers guarded Forrest from the Tibetans pursuing him.(Original from Cornell University) At Batang, the Tibetan Lamas massacred Chinese and Tibetan Catholic converts and the French priest P√®re Jean Andr√© Souli√©. The Tibetans used poisoned arrows and swords to kill the priest P√®re Bourdonnec and proceeded to massacre the Tibetan Catholics he was fleeing with, killing 66 of them while 14 escaped. All except one of Forrest's staff were slaughtered. The Lamas proceeded to hunt down the priest P√®re √âtienne-Jules Dubernard, breaking his arms and subjecting him to death by three days of torture, while lashed to a post at the destroyed mission. Jules Dubernard had been tortured for days by the Lamas. His upper limbs were both fractured and restrained, he was secured on a stake, his eyes were gouged out, his tongue, ears and nose severed, and while he was living, his extremities were severed. The body parts of the French priests were sent by the Tibetans to be displayed at Lamaseries. Forrest lost a great deal of his scientific data, photographs and specimens of plants he was collecting. A group of villagers helped Forrest sneak out by masquerading as a Tibetan after the Lamas blocked his escape routes. Besides the gun and ammunition he was carrying, over 2,000 of the samples of plants he was collecting were lost along with all of the rest of his possessions. Cordons were formed by the Lamas who used Tibetan mastiffs and watch fires to seal off his escape routes. Forrest was the sole survivor of the group with which he had fled the mission from the Lamas who wanted to massacre them. There were women and children in the group. At the Atuntze Monastery the Tibetans mounted the decapitated heads of the French priests.(Original from Cornell University) The church of Cizhong At Cizhong, another church was constructed after Tibetan mobs, under direction of their Lamas, wrecked the Catholic mission.(Original from the University of Michigan) Thorns were used by the Tibetans to whip Henri Mussot (1854-1905), a French Priest, and his severed hands and head were affixed to a monastery door after the Tibetans shot him to death. Methods of execution such as encasing victims in yak skins which were then sewn shut and left out to be exposed to the elements were used upon Catholics by the Tibetans. The Tibetans executed Father Souli√© and took to the Atunze monastery the head and liver of Bourdonnec after they slayed him and Dubernard, and they vowed \\"to exterminate all inhabitants ... even the dogs and chickens, up to the least blade of grass.\\". Tibetan Catholic families were gunned down after refusing to give up their religion at Yanjing at the hands of the 13th Dalai Lama's messengers at the same time during the 1905 rebellion when Father Dubernard was beheaded and all the French missionaries were slaughtered by the Tibetan Buddhist Lamas. The name \\"Field of Blood\\" was given to the place where the slaughter happened. The various Tibetan monasteries in Kham tried forming a united coalition against the Qing and supported Batang in its rebellions. The Qing responded by quickly working to cut off contact between Tibetans in Kham and Lhasa and to isolate and divide the Khampas to stop the rebellion from spreading. From Batang, an escaped French priest fled to Weixi in Yunnan to warn of Tibetans Batang coming down to attack Weixi's church. The Qing fought with Khampas at the church on April 5. Green Standard Army soldiers under Ma Weiqi fought rebellious Tibetan monks from Garthar Monastery from April to June 8. On July 20, Batang rebels and the Green Standard Army under Ma Weiqi clashed in battle for the first time since the Batang monks assassinated the Qing Manchu official Fengquan on April 5, which started the rebellion. Retaliatory expeditions The Chinese responded to the Tibetan rebellion with punitive expeditions. In the summer, the Sichuan Army under the command of Chinese General Ma Wei-ch'i launched the retaliatory \\"expedition\\" against the Tibetan Lamas and their rebels, crushing the Tibetan rebels at Batang, totally destroying their monastery. Tibetan Lamas and the Tibetan population around the area were subjected to execution, and dousing with fire. Tibetan leaders were beheaded. The bloody campaign of the Qing dynasty Han Bannerman General Zhao Erfeng in western Sichuan and eastern Tibet (Kham) was also a response to the Tibetan uprising. In Kham, monasteries were targeted by Zhao's forces. Zhao was killed by Chinese Republican revolutionary forces after the Xinhai Revolution. The Chinese military in Yunnan crushed the Tibetan rebels in Atuntze, the Chinese under Zhao took brutal measure to subdue the Tibetan population, and appoint Chinese officials to rule over them. Zhao besieged the remnant Tibetan rebels at Chantreng monastery (Chantreng now known as Xiangcheng County, Sichuan). The swift Chinese response, with the crushing of the rebels in Batang and Litang ended the revolt. In the following year in 1906, the monastery fell to the Chinese forces, who used deception to defeat the besieged. All Lamas were executed with the entire monastery razed. The Manchu Lianyu (Lien Yu) was finally allowed to enter into his position as Amban of Tibet at Lhasa, due to Zhao's campaign in destroying the Tibetan rebels. Lien Yu was despised by the Tibetan population for his policies. Zhao Erfeng replaced the Tibetan chiefs with Chinese magistrates, beheaded the remaining Tibetan chiefs and eradicated the official position of \\"Chief\\", and the power of the Lamas and monasteries was curtailed. After the Xinhai Revolution Lien Yu and his Chinese soldiers fled Tibet in 1912. Because of their part in the rebellion, the monks of the Bathang and Chatring monasteries were slaughtered and the monasteries were totally razed. A Chinese commander ordered 10 Tibetan Lamas to be decapitated.(Original from the University of Michigan) The Tibetan Prince of Batang was beheaded for taking part in the rebellion. The Chinese destroyed the monastery and decapitated the leaders of the uprising. A former Tibetan Khampa soldier named Aten, gave the Tibetan account of the war in his book, which does not match up with western accounts.(Aten was not present during the war, he was giving a historical account in his book) He claimed that the war started in 1903 when the Manchu Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to seize control of Tibetan areas, to control Batang and Lithang. Aten recounted Zhao's destruction of Batang, and claimed that Zhao used holy texts as shoeliners for his troops and that \\"Many Tibetans were executed by decapitation or by another typically Chinese method, mass burial while still alive.\\" Aten also called the Manchus \\"alien conquerors\\". Tsering Woeser defended the Tibetan side, saying that Zhao Erfeng invaded the region to \\"brutally stop Tibetan protests\\", listing atrocities committed by Zhao. A letter was sent to officer Qiao with official seals, congratulating him for his defeat of the Tibetan rebels. It is currently in the possession of s stamp collector.Geoffrey Flack's stamp collection from Tibet William M. Coleman wrote a work on the 1905 Tibetan rebellion at Batang monastery called, ‚ÄòThe Uprising at Batang: Khams and its significance in Chinese and Tibetan history‚Äô, in Epstein (2002), pp. 31‚Äì5. The changes brought about by the Qing military after they crushed the anti-Qing, and anti-missionary Tibetan rebellion at Batang changed the power structure in the region fundamentally. The Qing takeover led by Zhao Erfeng abolished the centuries-old system of the feudal Tibetan \\"native chiefs\\" ruling Kham and putting the area under direct Chinese control, pushing the border of the area under direct Qing administration all the way to Giamda (Gyamda) in Kongbo (Kongpo). The British were unhappy with the Qing intervention, since the Chinese were sowing dissent among peoples in British India living near the Tibetan border. The thought of engaging in another uprising was effectively deterred among the Batang Tibetans due to the actions of Zhao Erfeng against the rebels. Guns manufactured in Germany were used by Qing soldiers under Zhao Erfeng. Tibetan women were wedded by the troops and traders of Chinese origin who moved into the area after the 1905 uprising. Wine making vineyards were left behind by them. Songpan was the location of an uprising in 1905.

It is native to the southeastern United States, where it is present in North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. It is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. This perennial herb produces long, slender stems up to 2 meters (80 inches) long, sometimes growing erect. The leaves are each made up of several narrow leaflets, and some of the leaflets are divided further into lobes. Leaves near the base of the plant are borne on petioles. The inflorescence is a raceme or a panicle containing a few flowers each. The species is dioecious, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The flower lacks petals. It has four or five sepals which are white or yellowish in the male flower and greenish in the female. The male to female ratio is 3:1.Thalictrum cooleyi. Center for Plant Conservation. Blooming occurs in June and July.Thalictrum cooleyi. Flora of North America. There are nine populations of this plant consisting of 32 subpopulations. Twenty-four of the subpopulations are located in North Carolina and there is one in Florida. Seven subpopulations of plants have been recently discovered in Georgia; these are treated as members of this species but their taxonomy is not certain.USFWS. Thalictrum cooleyi Five-year Review. January 2009. This plant grows in the Atlantic coastal plain province. It grows in open, moist habitat types such as savannas, bogs, and swamp forests. The soil is generally a sandy loam which is neutral or slightly acidic and wet at least part of the year. The plant can be found in spots that are moist or saturated but have no standing water. The plant also requires sun. The habitat is maintained by disturbance that keeps it clear of encroaching vegetation. Naturally this occurs during periodic wildfires. In the absence of a normal fire regime the plant grows in areas that are kept clear and open by other means, including human activities such as mowing. The plant may occur on roadsides, an area of high disturbance. Plants growing in deep shade are stunted.Thalictrum cooleyi. The Nature Conservancy. They also have less erect stems and delayed flowering. Sunny areas that have recently burned produce the most robust plants.USFWS. Thalictrum cooleyi. North Carolina Ecological Services. Threats to the species include habitat degradation in areas where fire suppression is practiced. In these areas ecological succession occurs and large, woody vegetation moves in. The meadowrue and other herbs are shaded out or outcompeted. Habitat has been claimed for silviculture operations, and the plant cannot grow in these converted areas. While the plant is more likely to occur in disturbed areas, it does not tolerate severe disturbance such as bulldozing or herbicide application.

Biography  Born in Messina, Sicily, Santi Visalli left Italy in 1956 to begin a three-year journey around the world by jeep that ultimately landed him in New York City.Dicks, Brett Leigh: Maverick Photographer Santi Visalli Calls His Own Shots, Santa Barbara Independent, December 6, 2007. It was in New York, that he began his career in photojournalism. From 1961 to 1984, Visalli's photos appeared in and on the covers of some 50 magazines and newspapers worldwide, including The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, Life, U.S. News & World Report, Forbes, American Heritage, Paris Match, Stern, Oggi, Epoca, and L'Europeo. Santi Visalli chose the camera as an instrument of communication in order to reach a large audience. As he himself says, \\"Photography speaks a universal language.\\" During the 1960s and '70s, people around the world saw America through his eyes.Weltner, Anna: Tarnished by Light, New Times, January 6, 2011. Throughout the course of his career, he photographed five presidents of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. He also worked on films with such directors as Federico Fellini, Lina Wertm√ºller, and Peter Yates and photographed numerous film stars and other famous personalities in various fields, including Andy Warhol. He started photographing Warhol early in 1963 and continued until December 31, 1986, three months before Warhol's sudden death.Sarica, Antonino: Il fotografo di Hollywood, Gazetta del Sud, June 1, 2011.

Animal People was founded in 1992 with the mission of ‚Äúexposing the existence of cruelty to animals and educating the public of the need to prevent and eliminate such cruelty; conducting or sponsoring animal care projects, both to directly alleviate animal suffering and to demonstrate humane methods of handling and responding to animal-related dilemmas; and studying animal-related issues via research, surveys, and investigative reports.‚Äù From 1992 until 2013, the organization's main project was publishing the newspaper Animal People News, which covered current events related to animal issues worldwide. The newspaper was retired in 2014 following a split within the board of directors, and in 2015 Animal People launched a new project, the Animal People Forum, an online magazine and social networking site for people interested in animal rights, welfare, and conservation.  History  Kim Bartlett was hired as editor of The Animals' Agenda news magazine in August 1986, where Patrice Greanville was already associate editor. Merritt Clifton had been freelancing for The Animals' Agenda, and was hired by Bartlett and Greanville as the feature writer in November 1986. In mid-1988 several of the staff at The Animals' Agenda left to form E: The Environmental Magazine and Bartlett hired Clifton as news editor. In May 1992, shortly after the second annual Where the Money Goes report was published, Clifton was fired by The Animals' Agenda board. Bartlett resigned in protest and on the following day, Bartlett and Clifton incorporated Animal People. The board of directors was later expanded to four members. In 2014, Merritt Clifton resigned to start his own online publication, Animals 24-7 as editor with his wife Beth as social media editor and photographer. As of 2016, Animal People's staff consists of president Kim Bartlett, executive director Wolf Gordon Clifton, publisher Patrice Greanville, archivist and photo editor Dylan Forest, and social media coordinator Anita Mayangpuspa.  Programs  = Domestic = The Animal People founders initiated neuter/return trials for feral cat population control in 1991, and in 1992 the program expanded to eight sites. In mid-1992 Bartlett and Clifton presented their findings at a conference sponsored by the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. This was among the several developments which established trap‚Äìneuter‚Äìreturn in the U.S. as a viable approach. The findings were later reported in the November 1992 issue of Animal People. Animal People has subsequently engaged in many other hands-on research projects, particularly in the areas of improved housing for shelter animals, disease control, living in harmony with wildlife, and censusing street dogs and feral cats. = International = Animal People increased their emphasis on international coverage beginning in 1997, and in 1998 began relaying funding from U.S. donors to selected overseas projects. This program quadrupled in size after the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, when Animal People funded and mobilized 12 animal disaster relief teams, working in India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand (and later in Indonesia). These were the first international animal welfare charities to respond after the tsunami. From 2000 to 2010 Animal People directly sponsored several start-up African animal charities. Youth for Conservation, and the African Network for Animal Welfare, both of Kenya, have grown and developed considerable influence. Another, the Homeless Animals Protection Society of Ethiopia, did pioneering work in the Gobe and Addis Ababa regions but has since disbanded. In 2014, Animal People provided financial support to local activists in Nepal for public awareness work against animal sacrifice at the Gadhimai festival, and sponsored the Blue Cross of India's deployment of patrol teams along the border of India and Nepal to enforce an Indian court order banning transport of animals for sacrifice at Gadhimai. Animal People has co-sponsored the Asia for Animals conference series since 2001, the Middle East Network for Animal Welfare conference held in 2007, and the Africa Animal Welfare Action conference, first held in 2010.  Publications  From 1992 until 2013, Animal People, Inc. published the newspaper Animal People News, as well as a stand-alone supplemental report, the annual Watchdog Report on Animal Protection Charities, which provided information on the leading animal-related charities. Both were retired in 2014. Since 2015, Animal People publishes articles and media submitted by users on the Animal People Forum. It also hosts the online exhibit Beyond Human: Animals, Aliens, & Artificial Intelligence, which explores current scientific evidence for animal intelligence and consciousness, ongoing efforts to discover extraterrestrial life and develop artificial intelligence, and the ethical implications of sentience in non- human beings.  Awards and recognition  * Award for excellence in horse coverage from the International Generic Horse Association/Horse Aid (1994) * Award for excellence in coverage of exotic wildlife issues from Wildlife Waystation (2002) * Recognition for coverage of animal birth control issues from both Ahimsa of Texas and from the McKee Project in Costa Rica. Kim Bartlett has received awards for leadership in disaster relief from the Asia for Animals conference, and for leadership in humane work in the Middle East from the Middle East Network for Animal Welfare. In 2010 Merritt Clifton received the 15th annual ProMED-mail Anniversary Award, presented by the International Society for Infectious Diseases for contributions to the identification and control of emerging disease. Clifton was honored for contributions that led to identifying fruit bats as the host species for Nipah virus in April 1999; helping to identify the roles of cockfighting and falconing in the migration of H5N1; identifying aspects of halal slaughter as the probable source of outbreaks of the tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever among Central Asian meat industry workers in 2009-2010; and especially, said ProMed-mail editor Larry Madoff, for contributions to epidemiological understanding of the cultural factors involved in the spread and control of canine rabies in India, China, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

Design and development The MA-5 Charger was designed and developed by Ed Marquart with the first prototype being built and flown by Daniel W. Fielder Jr. at Flabob Airport. It is an all-new design based around Marquart's single place homebuilt biplane, the MA-4. The aircraft was designed to perform mild aerobatics. Marquart sold plans for scratch building the aircraft, no kits were manufactured. For a number of years, Ken Brock offered kits of the metal brackets utilized in the construction of the Charger's wings and fuselage. The aircraft uses a welded steel tube fuselage with doped aircraft fabric covering. The wings use wooden spars and ribs. The biplane uses conventional landing gear and has two tandem open cockpits. The wings are constant chord and swept 10 degrees. The first prototype took seven years to build. Since Ed Marquart's death in 2007, the plans have been placed in the public domain, and are available as free PDF files via the Marquart Charger MA-5 website, marquartcharger.org, or the Charger groups on either Facebook or groups.io (formerly Yahoo).

It was commissioned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art for their 100 Acres Park sculpture garden, which opened in 2010. It consists of two 30' aluminum rings suspending in midair, aligned such that their shadows merge at noon on the summer solstice. Description Team Building (Align) consists of two 30' aluminum rings suspended with steel cables from telephone poles. They are carefully oriented so that their two shadows merge into one at noon on the summer solstice.. Creation This work was created by Type A in collaboration with a team of IMA staff from nearly every department (security, curatorial, grounds, conservation, etc.), a variety chosen to serve as a microcosm of Indianapolis. This is the reason for the first half of the artwork's title: Type A wished to examine the subject of team-building, now so prevalent in popular culture. Type A frequently described the artwork as a \\"gesture\\" rather than a sculpture, as their primary interest was the examination of the team members' engagement with both one another and the artistic process. For a year, beginning in the spring of 2007, the team would meet for five-day rope course workshops of the sort favored for corporate retreats. These were held at the High 5 Adventure Learning Center in Brattleboro, Vermont. One of the members of the team was Lisa Freiman, chairwoman of the contemporary art department of the IMA. Her focus on collaborative art, dating back to her doctoral dissertation, has been cited as a main reason for the preponderance of artistic duos and collectives featured at 100 Acres. Freiman's interest in the give-and-take between artist and curator was tested by degree of collaboration experienced during the creation of Team Building (Align), which resulted in a \\"fraught\\" relationship. Even though the team was focused on the process rather than the result, Type A still had to design a physical sculpture representing that process in order to fulfill the IMA's commission. The original plan was a 40' climbing tower with handholds shaped from casts of the teammates' hands, suspended in midair so as to be inaccessible and absurd. However, the team disliked this idea, as they had used ropes rather than climbing towers in their sessions, and furthermore did not appreciate the implication that their work was useless or silly. In response to this, Type A designed a second sculpture, the one that was ultimately created. This design was inspired by many factors, such as the emotional resonance of a circle; the concept of two bodies joining to form a third, distinct entity without losing their own identities; and a specific teamwork exercise called the Bull Ring Initiative involving a tennis ball, two rings, and the careful application of tension to a number of cords. The team was much more enthusiastic about this concept. They selected the summer solstice as the appropriate date for the alignment in order to coincide with the opening of 100 Acres. Type A determined the correct orientation of the rings in consultation with Prof. Brian Murphy from the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium of Butler University. The 30' diameter was based on the size of the circle produced by all the teammates holding hands. The actual construction of the sculpture was handled by the local company Indianapolis Fabrications. iFab roll formed 3\\" diameter aluminum tubing to form the 30' diameter rings, then covered the rings with a thin aluminum plate, which was then ground and sanded smooth. iFab was also responsible for the placement of the three 55' telephone poles and the rigging of the rings according to Prof. Murphy's specifications. Artist Type A is an artist collective consisting of the New York-based duo Adam Ames and Andrew Bordwin. Their partnership began in 1998 with a five-minute video of the two of them wrestling, entitled Dance. Since then, they have created many artworks in a variety of media, including videos, photographs, sculptures, and drawings. Their work examines masculinity, identity, intimacy, power, individuality, and collaboration, and frequently stars themselves. Humor and absurdity also often play a large role in their art. A major turning point in the history of the collective occurred in 2006 when the Addison Gallery of American Art of the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts offered them residency. That enabled to them to recruit others to participate in their artworks, although they maintained strict control of the process. The logical extension of that experience was the team- based process that led to Team Building (Align).

The city quickly fell into rebels hands with soldiers from Libyan Army units defecting. Zawiya was the rebel city which was closest to Tripoli, and it became the main focus of Gaddafi troops. The city was besieged and regularly attacked by loyalists with rebels defending the center of the town. The final assault lasted one week and was led by the Khamis Brigade, the best trained unit of the Libyan army. The rebellion was ultimately crushed in the city and Gaddafi troops took complete control of the town, searching for suspected rebels and erasing any sign of the rebellion. Along with the Battle of Misrata, the First Battle of Zawiya was one of the bloodiest clashes of the Libyan Civil War. The battle = Rebels take control, initial loyalist counterattacks = ;24 February ‚Äì 1 March The battle began on 24 February, when Libyan troops loyal to Gaddafi attacked a mosque where protesters were holding an anti-government sit-in. The troops opened fire with automatic weapons and hit the minaret with an anti- aircraft gun. After the attack, thousands of people rallied in Green Square by the mosque shouting \\"Leave! Leave!\\" On the same day, anti-Gaddafi forces repelled the attack on the city.. ABC News. On 26 February, government forces opened fire on anti-government protesters and Egyptian migrant workers. By this point, most of the city was under rebel control ‚Äî however, security forces controlled surrounding areas and had set up checkpoints on the outskirts. In addition, some government militia and security forces were still present in the city and at least one tank was seen. 24 rebel fighters were killed during the two previous days of fighting. On 28 February, government troops conducted a counter-attack against the city with 200 soldiers coming in from the east, supported by snipers, tanks and artillery. The first attack came just after midnight when loyalist soldiers tried to come through the eastern city gate in pick-up trucks. The attack was repelled. In the early evening, a second attack of three more trucks tried to break through the west gate. Two of the trucks were destroyed. At the same time, six more pick-ups again attacked the eastern gate. Two were captured by rebel forces. During the clashes one government tank was damaged by a rocket propelled grenade. After six hours of fighting, government troops were unable to reclaim the city. 10 soldiers were killed in the street fighting and 12‚Äì14 were captured, of which eight switched sides and joined the rebels. = Continued loyalist gains, Darbouk killed = ;2 March ‚Äì 4 March On the night of 2 March, rebel forces attacked government lines around the city killing two loyalist soldiers. By this point, shortages of food and medical supplies in the city had started as a result of the siege. On 4 March, government troops attacked once again bombarding the rebels with mortars, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft guns and a prolonged artillery barrage coming from at least eight Grad missile launchers. Troops attacked on both sides of the city. In the initial fighting, the rebel forces commander, colonel Hussein Darbouk, was killed along with three more fighters. Later, the casualty toll was raised to \\"up to 50 dead\\" and 300 wounded on that day. Two government soldiers were also killed. In the evening, the rebels were pushed back to the central square in Zawiya, where they were preparing to make a last stand. Government forces claimed to have captured 31 tanks, 19 armored personnel carriers and other weapons including rocket-launchers and anti-aircraft guns that were used by the rebels. = Fighting for central square, intensifying loyalist assaults = ;5 March ‚Äì 8 March By the morning of 5 March, pro-Gaddafi soldiers were reported to have been beaten back from the centre of the city, after overnight fighting, however they still controlled the town's entry points. At six in the morning, another assault was underway, which started with a surprise barrage of mortar shells. At 7 a.m., at least 20 tanks entered the city and heavy street fighting started with loyalists storming residential buildings and reportedly killing people inside to secure the rooftops for snipers. Initially, the rebels retreated to positions deeper in the city and government tanks were seen pouring onto the square. Still, after a few hours, a rebel counteroffensive was launched and loyalist forces were again beaten back from the centre of the city to the city's edge by 10 a.m. During these morning battles, thirty-three people were reported killed. Twenty-five of them were rebels and eight were pro-Gaddafi soldiers. Five government armored vehicles were destroyed at the square, among them two or three tanks. At 4 p.m. in the afternoon, a third pro-Gaddafi attack commenced, accompanied by an artillery barrage, but it too was repulsed. During this attack, government troops positioned themselves once again at the square and tank and rocket fire was directed at buildings around it, before retreating. However, the loyalists managed to secure the hospital and, because of this, the rebels moved all of their wounded to a makeshift clinic at a mosque. 10 loyalist soldiers were captured during the fighting and later executed in a hotel at the square. During the night, it was confirmed that government tanks were seen roaming the city. On 6 March, a fourth attack in two days was launched against the city centre and it too was repelled. 26 government soldiers and three rebels were reportedly killed and 11 soldiers captured during the latest charge by loyalist troops. On 7 March at 9 a.m., a fifth attack started and continued well into the afternoon. Government forces had once again managed to take the city's central square and also a nearby mosque. By 8 March, most of the city had been left in ruins with tanks firing in all directions. During the night, rebels had once again taken back the square. However, with dawn, the strongest attack yet came with 50 tanks and 120 pick-ups charging towards the city center. During the evening, a force of 60 rebels slipped out of the city in an attempt to attack a military base 20 kilometres from the city. By the next day, they had not returned and their fate was not known. = Loyalists capture the city = ;9 March ‚Äì 11 March On 9 March, the city was reported to be ninety-five percent under loyalist control as rebels retreated from the main square and troops moved in. Later that evening, rebels and a few local witnesses claimed that the rebels had retaken the main square and that the regime's forces were driven back to from the city centre. Forty opposition members and several loyalists were reported killed during the day's fighting, including a general and a colonel. Nine rebels were killed in the battle for the square. The suburbs of the city had been confirmed as cleared and captured by loyalists after the government bussed journalists to a floodlit stadium where some 300 Gaddafi supporters were celebrating with fireworks. On 10 March, the city was retaken by loyalist forces. Reporters from The Times and the ITV television network reported from the square in Zawiya where they confirmed it was under government control and clean-up operations were underway. Later, locals confirmed that tanks were lined along the square. The mopping-up operations were focused on smaller remaining pockets of resistance and some street fighting continued during the day. On 11 March, rebels claimed they were still in control in Zawiya. However, just a few hours later, a pro- Gaddafi rally, arranged by the government, was held in the centre of the city, witnessed by 100 foreign journalists, confirming the city was under loyalist control.

Miller. \\"Writing Up a Storm\\", The Wall Street Journal. 13 August 2011. It has been called the first substantial work of modern journalism, the first detailed account of a hurricane in Britain. It relates the events of a week-long storm that hit London starting on 24 November and reaching its height on the night of 26/27 November 1703 (7/8 December 1703 in the Gregorian Calendar. Known as the Great Storm of 1703, and described by Defoe as \\"The Greatest, the Longest in Duration, the widest in Extent, of all the Tempests and Storms that History gives any Account of since the Beginning of Time.\\" The book was published by John Nutt in mid-1704. It was not a best seller, and a planned sequel never materialised. Within a week of the storm Defoe placed newspaper ads asking readers to submit personal accounts, of which about sixty were selected and edited by Defoe for the book. This was an innovative method for the time before journalism that relied on first-hand reports was commonplace. Defoe considered the accounts reliable because \\"most of our Relators have not only given us their Names, and sign'd the Accounts they have sent, but have also given us Leave to hand their Names down to Posterity.\\" The Storm has thus been called the first substantial work of modern journalism. Defoe described the storm as \\"the tempest that destroyed woods and forests all over England\\". He wrote: \\"No pen could describe it, nor tongue express it, nor thought conceive it unless by one in the extremity of it.\\" Coastal towns such as Portsmouth \\"looked as if the enemy had sackt them and were most miserably torn to pieces\\". He thought the destruction of the sovereign fleet, in which about one-fifth of the navy was lost, was a punishment for their poor performance against the Catholic armies of France and Spain during the first year of the War of the Spanish Succession. \\"Most People expected the Fall of their Houses,\\" wrote Defoe. Even so, they judged it safer to stay put than to seek new shelter: \\"Whatever the Danger was within doors, 'twas worse without; the Bricks, Tiles, and Stones, from the Tops of the Houses, flew with such force, and so thick in the Streets, that no one thought fit to venture out, tho' their Houses were near demolish'd within.\\" Some of the first-hand accounts include that of Elizabeth Luck from Tunbridge Wells, who reported hundreds of trees fell down, a church lost its steeple, and two horses perished beneath a smashed stable. One Rev. James King of London told of a chimney that crashed through a house and buried a maid who was thought crushed dead, but then appeared the next morning from the rubble unharmed. Thomas Powell, a shopkeeper in Deal, was so appalled when his neighbors did not help rescue stranded sailors on a sand bar, he paid them five shillings for each rescued sailor; Defoe credited him with saving 200 lives. Defoe recounts another story of the captain of a ship who committed suicide rather than drown, only to have his ship rescued but too late for him.

Hutschenreuther Porcelain Factory in Hohenberg an der Eger, Bavaria.  Early years  Carolus Magnus Hutschenreuther was born in Lichte (Wallendorf), Thuringia, the 15th child of Johann Heinrich Hutschenreuther, a porcelain painter and owner of the Wallendorf Porcelain Manufactory. He earned his living selling porcelain items such as pipe-bowls and so-called Turkish cups in eastern Bavaria and especially in the spa towns of Bohemia. In 1814, Hutschenreuther discovered deposits of kaolin, used to make fine white porcelain, near the River Eger, and decided to manufacture porcelain himself in Hohenberg,Klemens Stephan, Marktredwitz: Die wirtschaftliche und soziale Umgestaltung eines Marktfleckens im Zeitalter des Kapitalismus, Dresden: Risse, 1933, p. 99 Theodor Bohner, Der ehrbare Kaufmann: vom Werden und Wirken deutscher Wirtschaft, Hamburg: Meiner, 1956, p. 112 where a relative of his, Ernst Ludwig Reu√ü, was chief forester. Reu√ü made space available to him in Hohenburg Castle, and he began painting porcelain there and learning to manufacture it. In 1816 he married Reu√ü' daughter Johanna.  Foundation of the C.M. Hutschenreuther Porcelain Manufactory On 10 September 1816, he applied for permission to establish a porcelain manufactory in Hohenburg; after many difficulties, the concession was finally granted on 7 November 1822. By this time he had acquired a disused alum works, Auf der Freundschaft (Friendship), on the site of the present-day Hutschenreuther factory. Initially, Hutschenreuther appears to have personally mixed the raw materials and overseen the firing, to guard the knowledge of the process. He was also probably responsible for most of the painting and shipping. Only after a second kiln and a larger watermill were constructed and additional porcelain decorators were added, including the sale of white wares to free-lance decorators, did the company become successful.  Legacy of C.M. Hutschenreuther  C.M. Hutschenreuther died at Hohenberg on 10 November 1845. His widow Johanna and his sons Lorenz and Christian succeeded him as operators of the company, which withstood a serious fire in 1848, and Lorenz' departure in 1856 to form his own Hutschenreuther Porcelain Company in the neighbouring town of Selb. In 1969 this merged with the company founded by his father.

He trained and practiced as an architect in Munich until 1911, when he moved to Berlin and switched to poster design. Early years Hohlwein was born in the Rhine-Main region of Germany, though he and his work are associated with Munich and Bavaria in southern Germany. There were two schools of \\"Gebrauchsgrafik\\" in Germany at the time, North and South. Hohlwein's high tonal contrasts and a network of interlocking shapes made his work instantly recognizable. Career He travelled to the United States in the 1920s to conduct commercial work. A large portion of his work dates to 1912-1925. His style usually consists of sharply defined forms, bright colors, a good portion of humor and textured patterns. By 1925, he had already designed 3000 different advertisements. During World War II, he was a member of the Nazi party and worked closely with Joseph Goebbels and The Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment. And as an ardent nationalist, indicated by his work for the government during both World Wars, he urged other artist to join the effort when Hitler came to power in 1933. > ‚ÄúMay the best among us realize fully the significance of what is at stake > and their own responsibility, and may we labor creatively and with > conviction at the preservation of our cultural civilization and its > restoration to perfectly healthy conditions.‚Äù \\"Holhwein‚Äôs posters for Nazi Germany are the most dramatic examples of National Socialist realism.\\" 1910 poster for a Richard Strauss festival His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. Recognition Poster historian Alain Weill comments that \\"Hohlwein was the most prolific and brilliant German posterist of the 20th century... Beginning with his first efforts, Hohlwein found his style with disconcerting facility. It would vary little for the next forty years. The drawing was perfect from the start, nothing seemed alien to him, and in any case, nothing posed a problem for him. His figures are full of touches of color and a play of light and shade that brings them out of their background and gives them substance\\"Weill, Alain, The Poster a Worldwide Survey and History, G K Hall, 1985, References External links *Collection of posters by Hohlwein 1874 births 1949 deaths German graphic designers German poster artists Olympic competitors in art competitions ","title":"Ludwig Hohlwein"},{"id":"32740938","text":"Malltraeth Marsh flatlands near the village of Pentre Berw Malltraeth Marsh (alternate: Malldraeth; Welsh: Cors Malltraeth) is a large marsh area in Anglesey, North Wales, located north east of Malltraeth village, along the flatlands of Trefdraeth Bodorgan, Llangristiolus and south of Cefn Cwmwd.Rhostrehwfa. It is reclaimed from estuarine marshes after the construction of the Malltraeth Cob (dyke), a long embankment, and the subsequent canalisation in 1824 of the Afon Cefni. The name Malltraeth comes from Mall (\\"bad\\"), and Traeth (\\"sandy shore\\"). The marsh measures in area. The area is recognized as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and has a range of reedbeds, marshes, wet grassland and small pools/lakes. History Malltraeth Marsh and the Cefni flood embankment In the Middle Ages the Maltraeth estuary was tidal, stretching as far inland as Llangefni and Ceint. In 1790, an act of parliament was obtained for more effectually embanking the marshes called Malltraeth and Corsddeuga, under the provisions of which were allotted to the several proprietors of land in the parish of Llangaffo. The of reclaimed alluvium at the mouth of the River Cefni subsequently underwent considerable improvements in the late 18th century and early 19th century with the introduction of embankments and flood mitigation measures. During World War I, further improvements were made due to the concern of farmers. However. the reclamation became neglected and by the end of the war, it had fallen into a bad state and was subject to numerous heated conflicts between the drainage engineer, the CWAEC, and the underfunded catchment board managing the drainage of the marsh. Bitter disputes over the marsh reached a climax with the chairman resigning from the Malltreath Marsh and Cors Ddyga subcommittee in March 1942 and unusually high rainfall during the harvest in the following year devastating most of the cereal crops in the area. Due to pressure from local farmers, Lord Anglesey met with Robert Hudson and Megan Lloyd George in 1944 to outline ideas for improving the local habitat problem. Some ¬£100,000 was allocated to developing what was about 50% derelict marsh during the war and by 1947, ¬£147,000 had been spent on the scheme. The marsh near Morfa Brennin Geography Pool alongside the railway line on the Malltraeth Marsh View across Malltraeth Marsh towards Pen-y-Bont Farm Located in the cwmwd of Malltraeth, Cors Malltraeth Marsh is situated on the western side of the Afon Cefni valley which crosses Anglesey parallel to the Menai Straits, approximately to the northwest. The habitat of Cors Ddyga on the eastern side of Afon Cefni has been reverted to wetlands and reeds. The wetland reserve is officially called RSPB Cors Ddyga. It consists of marshy grasslands, lakes, pools, fossiliferous coal and shales. Both marshes- Cors Malltraeth and Cors Ddyga geology is characterized by carboniferous limestone, millstone grit, soft coal-measure shales, sandstone, beds of coal, and Permian strata. The Afon Cefni valley is long and runs almost exactly parallel to the valley of the Menai Straits. Many years ago, at its north-eastern end, deep glacial striatums on the Millstone Grit ran straight down the shallow valley towards Caernarfon Bay. Malltraeth Marsh is a wide and perfectly flat expanse of reedy pasture. On its far side, there is an embanked tidal river that opens to Malltraeth Sands, to the south. A short tunnel‚Äîthe first one in Anglesey‚Äîpierces the low hills which extend along the west side of Malltraeth Marsh before reaching Bodorgan railway station. Above Malltraeth lies the extensive Common of the marsh, which is bounded on the northwest by the parishes of Llangadwaladr, Trefdraeth, and Llangristiolus; on the northeast by Llangefni and Llanffinan. Cors Ddyga (Tygai's Marsh) lies in the commote of Rhosyr. It is situated on the eastern side of the Afon Cefni River or Afon Fawr Llanfihangel-y-Ceifiog, Llanidan, Llangaffo, Llangeinwen, and Newborough. Vegetation The vegetation reported from the Malltraeth Marshand and Cors Ddyga consist of reed canary-grass, water-plantain, branched bur-reed, club rush and reed sweet-grass. Spiked water-milfoil, blunt-leaved pondweed, horned pondweed are also reported in the marsh land, apart from rare species of flowering rush, water-violet and marsh stitchwort. Fauna European water voles inhabit the marsh. Birds such as northern lapwing, Eurasian curlew, common redshank and common snipe are reported from the lowland wet grassland. Eurasian teal, northern shoveller, gadwall and common pochard occupy the open water. Other birds recorded are Eurasian bittern and grey heron. Invertebrates include water beetles (Hydrochus brevis) and hairy dragonflies. Conservation Reclaimed farmland on the western edge of the Malltraeth Marsh Malltraeth Marsh and Cors Ddyga are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in West Gwynedd. They are notable for their breeding bird community, their lowland damp grassland, their reedbeds, the threatened habitat of wet meadows, and the botanical importance of their ditches and watercourses. A Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve is situated in the northeast corner of the SSSI. Management options undertaken to conserve the marshland consists of: Maintaining water levels by proper upkeep of clay-lined ditches to conserve flora and fauna; maintaining an exclusive swamp area to breed bittern; creation of shallow water ditches along old water courses to drain large land areas where waders can feed; establishing water control structures on secondary drains to maintain high ground water table during the spring season; control of introduced invasive plant species such as fairy fern, Australian stonecrop and Himalayan balsam; reduce risk of predation (by predators such as crows and minks) of birds by constant conservation and preservation of hedges; encouraging grazing during the winter season and reducing it during summer to attract ground nestling birds, and controlled agricultural management to provide nestling sites for waders.

It is approximately long and maintained by the Towns of Victor and Farmington and Victor Hiking Trails.http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/ The trail mostly follows the alignment of the Auburn and Rochester Railroad. Additional disconnected portions of the Auburn trail are found in the Towns of Pittsford and Brighton, Monroe County, NY. A detailed description and map of the Auburn Trail are available from Victor Hiking Trails. Victor - Farmington Route North and west of Wolston Rd, the Town of Pittsford continues the Auburn Trail for a ways as a footpath. This section was constructed and is maintained by the Town of Victor, New York and Victor Hiking Trails Inc. as a multiuse trail. Their detailed map of the Auburn Trail and trail description is available. It is mostly 8-foot to 10-foot wide stonedust surface. Most of the route is on the bed of the Auburn and Rochester Railroad (later New York Central Railroad). It passes through village, suburban, rural, parkland, light industrial, and considerable \\"suburban wild\\" areas. The Auburn Trail runs southeast from Woolston Rd and Powder Mills Park (extended in 2012-'13) and crosses Railroad Mills Rd. There are two bridges over Irondequoit Creek, one the original railroad stone culvert, the other a new (2011) steel bridge where the old culvert collapsed. There is limited parking available at the trailhead in Powder Mills Park, at Railroad Mills Rd, and Fishers Rd. A pocket park is located at the steel bridge. The trail crosses Fishers Road approximately north of the New York State Thruway, and then crosses under the Thruway shortly thereafter (because the Auburn Railroad was active when the Thruway was constructed, the Thruway was built over the alignment; this tunnel under the Thruway continues to serve the trail.) From the Thruway, the trail continues south, over Irondequoit Creek, and through the hamlet of Fishers, New York. In and around Fishers is an area known as \\"Art Along the Auburn.\\" Some of the art includes a mural in the Thruway underpass (2014-2018), an innovative bike rack as a train cowcatcher, a \\"troll\\" next to a bridge on the connecting Domine Trail, and others for trail users to discover. A cobblestone pump house, built in 1845 and used to water the steam locomotives, is just south of Main Street Fishers. Parking is available at the trailhead and kiosk behind the Fishers Fire House. The trail continues to the southeast of Fishers, past Phillips Road. In this block is a major sports facility (2015).http://www.pinnacle-athletic.com/ Limited parking is available at Phillips Rd. Approximately southeast of Phillips Road, the trail passes under the steel truss bridge of the old Lehigh Valley Railroad, now the multiuse Lehigh Valley Trail.http://www.monroecounty.gov/Image/LEHIGHTRAILPARK.pdfhttp://www.VictorHikingTrails.org/map/trails/lehigh.php As the Auburn Railroad was built forty years before the Lehigh Valley, the newer road was obligated to build its bridge over the older line. The Dryer Trail crosses There is available parking in the nearby FLCC facility and in Lehigh Crossing Park. The Auburn Trail continues southeast from the Lehigh Valley, passing Victor-Mendon Road (Rt. 251) and Rawson Road to School Road in the Village of Victor. Limited parking is available at NY251 and at Rawson Rd. The Seneca Trail shares some of this section as it crosses the Auburn Trail. The Trolley Trail also shares with both along here. Here the Auburn Trail detours briefly from the old Auburn Road, to bypass an active rail siding. The trail follows School Street northeast for a short distance, before turning southeast on the old Rochester, Syracuse and Eastern Rapid Railroad alignment. This interurban electric railway ran trolleys from Rochester to Auburn from 1906 to 1930, and the Auburn Trail follows the alignment for from School Street to Maple Avenue in the Village of Victor. The trail then follows Maple Street south to the intersection with the Auburn Railroad alignment at Railroad Street. The trail continues to the southeast past the old Victor Passenger Station of the Auburn Railroad, now a gift shop. Parking is available at the far end of the lot here. A trailhead kiosk is at Maple St. East of the old station, the trail continues on past Ketchum Street/Proximity Lane to Brace Road, by Break of Day Road and onto East Victor Road. Limited parking is at both Brace and Break of Day Roads. This section was fully opened in late 2018. The trail then continues to the east, entering the Town of Farmington, crosses over Mud Creek on an enormous railroad embankment and then passes by the former railroad hamlet of Mertensia NY. Parking is available in Farmington's Mertensia Park. The Farmington portion of the Auburn Trail crosses Mertensia Road and follows through a modern subdivision to Boughton Hill Road (County Road 41.) The trail then goes past the undeveloped Beaver Creek Park and onto the Canandaigua-Farmington Townline Road, where it temporarily ends. There is an alternative branch trail to NY Route 332. Most of this section opened in 2019. =Future= The town of Canandaigua together with the City of Canandaigua have completed a plan in 2012 for completing that link in the Auburn Trail. They are now seeking funding sources. In the city, Ontario Pathways is planning extending their trail northwest to meet this section. Auburn Trail in Brighton and Pittsford Portions of the old Auburn Railroad alignment in the Towns of Brighton and Pittsford, Monroe County, NY are also open to the public as trails. One portion, about , runs through Brighton from Highland Avenue at Village Lane, south past Elmwood Avenue to Allens Creek Road, parallel to and just east of Interstate 590 (that portion of the interstate was originally the bed of the Enlarged Erie Canal, and, after the canal was rerouted south of Rochester, the alignment of the ill- fated Rochester Subway.) Southeast of Allens Creek Road the alignment of the old Auburn Railroad passes behind various commercial properties on the east side of Monroe Avenue. The Auburn Trail resumes as a right-of-way through open land approximately southeast of Clover Street in the Town of Pittsford. The trail crosses French Road and continues into the Village of Pittsford, connecting with the Erie Canal trail at Grove Street. The old Auburn Railroad continued through the Grove Street area (the old railroad station is currently part of the Del Monte Hotel), crossing North Main Street (Route 96) and continuing parallel to, and east of, Schoen Place. Another section of the Auburn Railroad in Pittsford is currently usable as a trail, starting on Pittsford-Palmyra Road (Route 31) approximately east of the State Street bridge over the Erie Canal, and approximately opposite the intersection of Route 31 and Wood Creek Drive. The Auburn trail picks up at this point and follows the old railroad alignment south, past Mitchell Road. This short section of the Auburn trail, about in length, ends at the Erie Canal Trail. The abutments for the trestle that once carried the Auburn Railroad over the Canal are still visible. Another stub of the Auburn trail can be found on the south side of the former trestle over the Erie Canal, starting on Knickerbocker Road, about south of East Jefferson Road (Route 96.) This section of the trail continues south to Mill Road, about southwest of East Street. The old Auburn Railroad followed along the east side of Mill Road, and portions of the trail appear and disappear as modern development encroaches on the original alignment. Yet another stub of the Auburn trail follows south of Thornell Road, just east of Mill Road, in Pittsford, to LaDue Circle and East Street. The trail continues to the southeast of East Street, along the south side of Park Road and continuing to the southeast behind modern housing, crossing Railroad Mills Road at Sturbridge Lane, and continuing to Railroad Mills Road and Woolston Road. The alignment of the original Auburn Railroad followed along the east side of Railroad Mills Road to Probst Road (see Victor - Farmington Route, above.) In 2002, the Regional Trails Initiative proposed a master plan for biking and hiking trails in the Greater Rochester Area, which, among other things, recommended connecting up the different stubs of the Auburn trail in Brighton and Pittsford, to join the more fully developed Victor - Farmington trail.http://atfiles.org/files/pdf/RochesterNY.pdf Historic Topographical Maps of the Auburn Railroad A Topographic map dated 1900, posted online by the University Of New Hampshire, shows the Auburn Railroad, now the Auburn Trail, from Railroad Mills Road to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Junction.

It lives in a tube projecting from the sea floor in shallow seas around the world. Description P. psammophila constructs and lives in a rigid, chitinous tube about 10 cm long, incorporating sand grains and detritus. The extended worm is up to 19 centimetres long but it can contract down to about one fifth of this length.Phoronida The body is pinkish and is divided into two sections. The anterior part, the mesosome, has a cavity, the mesocoel, that extends into the tentacles and keeps them rigid by hydrostatic pressure. The mesosome bears the lophophore, a specialist feeding structure which consists of a ring of up to 190 translucent tentacles arranged in a horseshoe-shape encircling the crescent-shaped mouth. The posterior and larger body section is the metasome and contains the metacoel. It is swollen at the base into an ampulla which may provide grip inside the tube. The gut is U-shaped and extends from the mouth to the ampulla before doubling back to the anus which is situated just below the mouth. The gonads are located in the metacoel. There are two blood vessels running along the ventral and dorsal sides of the body with capillaries in the tentacles. These are made easily visible by the haemoglobin in the red blood cells. There is a single nerve fibre on the left side of the body. Distribution and habitat The distribution is cosmopolitan and the type locality is Messina in Italy. P. psammophila is found in the intertidal zone and at depths down to 70 metres. It favours a substrate of fine sand with a moderate silt content and sometimes occurs at densities of up to 20,000 individuals per square metre.Paleopolis: Phoronida Biology P. psammophila is a filter feeder and the lophophore is used in both feeding and respiration. It is orientated so that it faces the prevailing water current. Cilia on the inside of the tentacles create a feeding current and draw in particles. The diet consists of diatoms, microalgae, flagellates, invertebrate larvae and detritus and these are caught and transported to the mouth by the cilia. P. psammophila is dioecious with individuals being male or female. The gametes are released into the metacoel to mature and for storage. Sperm pass out into the water column through nephridiopores, which are also used for the excretion of waste products. The sperm are formed into little balls called spermatophores by specialist organs. When dispersed, they become amoeboid and make their way through the body wall of an adult worm before fertilising eggs in the metacoel. The resulting zygotes make their way out through the nephridiopores and become planktonic larvae. They may be brooded as an egg mass in the lophophoral cavity for a period. The larva is known as an actinotroch and was thought for a long time to be an adult organism in its own right and given the generic name Actinotrocha sabatieri. The actinotroch larva is transparent and has a ring of ciliated tentacles just behind the mouth, a straight gut and an anus at the posterior end. Metamorphosis is very rapid and in the course of half an hour, new tentacles appear and the body is transformed. The metasomal sac protrudes from the ventral surface and turns inside out, with the posterior end of the worm uniting with the anterior end while the previous ventral region becomes the new posterior end. In the process, the gut is bent double into the U-shape typical of this phylum. Asexual reproduction also takes place, usually by transverse fission, and may result in groups of individuals clustered in close proximity to each other, sometimes tangled together.

A prolific and successful designer, he is known to have designed some 300 buildings, including 203 houses, 9 banks, 14 churches, 44 commercial buildings, 11 hotels, 15 institutional buildings such as hospitals, 45 shops and 6 large town halls.  History  Tudor House, Williamstown, 1884 John Beswicke was the son of Charles Beswicke and Elizabeth Keys, who had both arrived in the Port Phillip district in the 1840s. In 1847 Charles married Elizabeth when he was aged 40 and Elizabeth was 18. They had 3 daughters and 2 sons, John being their second son. John went to Geelong Grammar School and in 1862 was apprenticed to the firm Crouch & Wilson at age 16, where he continued to work for 18 years, finishing as head assistant. While there he worked on such prominent projects as the Deaf School and Blind Institute, both built in the 1860s on St Kilda Road, the main building for MLC in Hawthorn in 1882, and numerous churches, as well as some of his own projects. 180x180pxThe practice of Crouch & Wilson passed to the sons of the principals in 1881, when Crouch retired, and Ralph Wilson left to join with Bewicke to create Wilson & Beswicke on 2 January 1882, until Wilson's death in 1889. After this he was often in sole practice as J. Beswicke, but also in other partnerships including Beswicke & Hutchins (1889-90), and Beswicke & Coote (1890-93). Amongst his prolific output was a series of grand houses in Harcourt Street in Hawthorn, many for his family, from the 1870s to 1900; of 15 buildings built in this area, 14 are still standing. His father Charles had bought land in Harcourt Street in 1873 and moved from Geelong into a house at No 5, which John designed while he was still at Crouch & Wilson (‚ÄòLes Avents‚Äô, later ‚ÄòCarn Brae‚Äô, altered in the 1920s). John Beswicke's own residence ‚ÄòRotha‚Äô at No 29 was built in 1887, and in 1900 he built the even grander ‚ÄòTalana‚Äô on the corner of Auburn Road for his wife, but she preferred to stay at ‚ÄòRotha‚Äô. 240x240px Beswicke was associated as a consulting designer with a number of property and building companies in the Boom period of the 1880s. One of these was the Australian Property and Investment Co; he had designed houses and subdivisions for one of the directors, and his brother in law had been a manager. He was invited to a limited competition called in 1888 by the company to design a 12 storey office building on the corner of Elizabeth Street and Flinders Lane, which was won Henry Hardie Kemp, who soon took on partners to become Oakden, Addison and Kemp. Beswicke was included in the project as he had studied tall buildings, and probably provided technical advice, while the Queen Anne style of what became known as the Australian Building (aka APA Building) was Kemp's.

Karl Scheidemantel Life and career Born in Weimar, the son of a Weimar court artist, Scheidemantel found great success in various roles in the operas of Richard Wagner. Among his supporters were Bodo Borchers in Weimar, well known voice teacher Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt, and composer Franz Liszt. At the age of 25 he joined the ensemble of the Dresden Hofoper where he was named Kammers√§nger, \\"Chamber Singer to the Saxon Grand Duke\\" in 1884. He sang at the 1886, 1888, 1891, and 1892 Bayreuth festivals. He frequently corresponded with Cosima Wagner about the happenings of the stage. He then sang at most of the great European opera houses, especially the Vienna State Opera, where in April and May 1890 he sang the rolls of Heiling, Renato, Zampa, Wolfram, Luna and, Sachs. He was a guest singer at La Scala in 1892. His closest friend was singer Karl Perron. He married Hedwig Lehnert in June 1897 at the Dresden Annankirche. His final career appearance was on 8 June 1911 as Hans Sachs. Scheidemantel sang over 170 roles in his career. Notably, he created the role of Herr von Faninal in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier in 1911. His German singing translation of Mozart's Don Giovanni was widely used. It was first used in his own new production at Dresden in June 1914, in which Richard Tauber first sang Don Ottavio. He also edited a song anthology for music publisher Eulenberg. After his stage career he returned to Weimar where he taught singing. His students included Hermann Uhde and Herbert Heyner. He returned to Dresden as director of the Dresden Opera in from 1920-1922. Scheidemantel is buried in Dresden- Tolkewitz. Dresden named a road in his honor.

His major painting of the 1940s, the work occupied Dickinson between 1943 and 1953. The painting, which is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is an architectural fantasy in red and gray tones. History Ruin at Daphne was inspired by the Roman ruins that had impressed Dickinson while visiting Europe during 1937‚Äì38. It began as \\"a 60/48 of antique peristyle, villa of 1820 & pool,\\"Dickinson. Journals, 1 January 1943. Reel D94. done from imagination and, after moving to New York in 1944, also from library research on Roman buildings.Gruber 1957-58, p. 90. As he explained to his patron Esther Sawyer, it represented a decision to move away from the \\"less gay\\" subjects that had been the focus of his major studio paintings and to paint to enjoy himself as much as possible. Yet his interest in history was closely allied to his interest in memory, and Dickinson wanted to dedicate the picture to his brother Burgess (who committed suicide in 1913), an intention he had harbored long before the painting began.Ward 2003, p. 193 For the painting, Dickinson reused a canvas on which he had begun a self-portrait, which he scraped off and covered the remains with a red-brown paint. On this, he began a detailed perspective drawing in pencil that he modeled with three values of the red-brown paint. Although the architectural subject fascinated him, the formal concerns were primary in his mind. In 1945, he wrote to Sawyer, \\"The color (long since decided upon) and the composition are what it is to be about.\\"Dickinson. Sawyer letters, 27 November 1945, reel 901: 1351-53. He was excited about the challenge posed by having to invent the buildings, which permitted him compositional freedom to indulge in a complex interplay of form much like that permitted to a purely abstract painter, as well as a freedom to make multiple revisions of the arrangement. At the end of 1943, he had decided to title it Three Periods of Architecture in Provence;Ward 2003, p. 184 after realizing that in southern France, people were living in homes next to ancient Roman architecture and that the distant past was woven into their daily lives. At the beginning of 1946, he rechristened it Villa Chedanne in honor of Georges Paul Chedanne, a turn-of- the-century French architect who had an interest in Roman architecture.Ward 2003, p. 185. His revised idea was that his architectural invention represented a Roman ruin in Syria that Chedanne bought and landscaped, and to which he added a pool. = Difficulty working on the painting = By May 1946, Dickinson had nearly ceased work on the painting, and for six months beginning in the fall of 1946 he went regularly to the Metropolitan Museum to paint a copy of El Greco's View of Toledo.The copy is reproduced in Ward 2003, p.188. Ward believes that Dickinson had come to feel that in his prolonged work on Ruin at Daphne he had lost the sense of purpose that had given his art its direction, and that by copying El Greco's painting he not only renewed contact with the artist he most admired but the depicted city where had seen the El Greco painting of which he once said, \\"When I saw the Burial of Count Orgaz, I knew where my aspirations lay.Ward 2003, pp. 71, 187. Dickinson continued to have difficulty returning to work on the painting, although in 1947 and early 1948 he attempted to introduce figures into the painting, none of which remain.Ward 2003, pp. 190‚Äì91. In March 1948, he resumed steady work on the painting, but during the following two years, little was done on it. In 1949, Elaine de Kooning wrote an article on the painting for ARTnews in its series, \\"[name of featured artist] Paints a Picture.\\"De Kooning 1949, pp. 20‚Äì23; 50-51. It was illustrated by photographs of three stages in the painting's progress (the first two misdated).The dates were November 1945 for the first; April 1947 for the second. See Ward 2003, pp. 185, 190. In 1951, he put in more work on the painting, but only in early 1952, anticipating its exhibition in the Fifteen Americans exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (together with Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and other major modernists), did he finally begin to overpaint the preliminary reds and pinks in which he had worked out the picture's design. Working from the center outwards, he had only painted 30% of the canvas in the new, off-gray color when, in 1954, while the painting was being moved to an exhibition, a gust of wind blew it over, knocking over the men who were carrying it and tearing a hole in the lower right corner. The hole was repaired, but heavy varnish was applied by the restorer, making future work difficult. Elaine de Kooning's article, with photographs of its transformation, had a significant role in boosting Dickinson's recognition. It is likely that the photographic record of the painting's lengthy evolution gave Elaine's husband, Willem de Kooning, the idea of working on a painting (Woman I) over an extended period (June 1950 to January or February 1952) and documenting the changes with photographs. The 1949 photo of Ruin at Daphne and the photo of the first two states of De Kooning's painting in 1950 were photographed by the same photographer, Rudolph Burckhardt.the article does not credit the photographers of Ruin at Daphne, but Ward uses the photo Burckhardt took for her in 1949 (Ward 2003, p. 191). For the credits for photos of De Kooning's picture see Carmean et al. 1978, p. 159, fig. 4, and p. 161, fig. 7. Not only were both works \\"process paintings\\", in which the artists' ideas evolved in response to the changing appearance of the pictures,De Kooning 1952, 66-67. but neither artist regarded his painting as finished when he stopped work on it.Ward 2003, pp. 193, 195-96; Carmean et al. , p. 163.

P. Donnelley. Leader of the posse involved in the Battle of Kelley Creek. The signature is taken from a registered mail signing book from Carson City, NV - 1812 - 1813. In the private collection of H. Blair Howell. The Battle of Kelley Creek, also known as the Last Massacre, is often considered to be one of the last known massacres carried out between Native Americans and forces of the United States, and was a closing event to occur near the end of the American Indian warfare era. In January 1911 a small group of Bannocks and Shoshones killed four investigative agents in a ranch after they had been pursued for abducting cattle. A posse of policemen and citizens was sent to track the natives, who were found encamped near Winnemucca, Nevada, in a region known as Kelley Creek. A largely one-sided battle ensued on February 25 that ended with the direct deaths of nine people, eight Daggetts and one mortally wounded American. At the time the affair was briefly characterized as a Native American revolt, though it is now mostly regarded as a family's attempted escape from law enforcement. Background Mike Daggett, or Shoshone Mike (only after his death), was the chief of the small band and in the spring of 1910, he led his group of eleven off the Fort Hall Reservation at Rock Creek, Idaho. All but two men of the group were members of Mike's family, which included three women and four or five children. They first headed south into northern Nevada and then wandered west to Oroville, California, before heading back into Nevada to spend the winter at Little High Rock Canyon in northern Washoe County. In January 1911 the Daggett party was running low on food, so they abducted and butchered some cattle belonging to a local rancher. A sheepherder named Bert Indiano witnessed the event and alerted the people of Surprise Valley, California, who sent a posse of three men to investigate the incident and protect the ranch. The three men, Harry Cambron, Peter Errammouspe and John Laxague, were to go to the ranch and join up with the sheepherder so the four could investigate the scene. Upon arrival the posse of four men instead ran into Mike Daggett and two of his sons, who were reported to be waiting for them. =Last Massacre= The Daggetts had apparently realized the agents would be coming to find them, so when the posse entered the canyon on January 19, the natives opened fire with rifles and pistols, killing all four of them. The bodies were allegedly picked clean and found with numerous gunwounds on a creekbed, weeks later on February 8, by a search party from Eagleville, California.The 4 murder victims were buried in Eagleville Cemetery, Eagleville, California. The scene also showed signs of looting. When word of the killings reached the surrounding settlements many who felt at risk temporarily evacuated the area, and the men who stayed behind remained armed and alert at all times. Initially it was thought that a gang of outlaws from Oregon or a band of Modocs were responsible. The Nevada and California State Police organized a posse under the command of Captain J.P. Donnelly to find the suspects, who had decided to flee towards the Duck Valley Indian Reservation. Other posses were also organized (though only Donnelly's would ever make contact with the Daggetts), and a large cash bounty was promised to anyone who managed to arrest or kill the fugitives. Battle Donnelly's posse included at least five policemen, a few armed civilians, and the \\"county coroner and physician\\". After stopping in Little High Rock Canyon on February 13, they continued despite extreme cold and winter weather. Over 200 miles further and on February 25, the posse found Daggett and his family hiding in an area known as Kelley Creek, northeast of Winnemucca. It is unclear which side shot first, but a battle erupted that lasted for around three hours. The women reportedly fought equally alongside the men. Father and chief Mike Daggett was one of the first casualties during the battle, but his death only made the members of his family desperately fight back harder; even as they were inevitably forced back. At some point during the conflict the remaining Daggetts had run out of ammunition for their guns and were forced to resort to bows, spears and tomahawks. By the end of the battle only four of the original twelve Dagget family members were still alive: a sixteen-year-old girl and three young children, who were taken into police custody. One American, Ed Hogle of Eagleville, was mortally wounded during the fight. Two other young Daggett children were also reported to have been shot inadvertently. After the battle was over, the posse found evidence linking the killings in Little High Rock Canyon to the natives. Other than Mike's war bonnet, the posse found guns and a watch that had belonged to Harry Cambron, identified by brother Ben Cambron. The bodies of the natives were taken by wagon to Golconda, Nevada, and buried in a mass grave made from the crater of a dynamite explosion. A tall pole was placed at the site as a grave marker. The remains of Ed Hogle were returned to Eagleville, where he was buried. Sheriff Charles Ferrell, who was in command of the investigation (but not present at the battle) arrived back in Reno on March 2 with the four surviving captives, and they claimed that while the man had indeed been Shoshone Mike, their mother and the others were Bannocks. The four were informally adopted by Reno's civilian population until in May 1911 they were enrolled in the Stewart Indian School near Carson City, Nevada. By 1913, three of the children had died of natural causes, and only one of the survivors, Mary Jo Estep was left alive; she died in 1992. The reward offered to anyone who could catch or kill the Daggett party was initially denied to the posse by Governor Tasker Oddie, due to the fact that there were state policemen involved, but the case was later settled in favor of the posse by the Supreme Court.

Life Eaton was the third son of Richard Eaton, vicar of Great Budworth, Cheshire, and was born in the hamlet of Crowley in Great Budworth. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1624 and M.A. 1628. He has a place in the Athen√¶ Oxonienses, because his relations informed Anthony Wood that he had been educated at Oxford, \\"but in what house they could not tell\\". Eaton took orders and was beneficed, but being unable to conform to the regulations of the church as interpreted by Archbishop Laud, he accompanied his eldest brother Theophilus Eaton to New England in 1637, and became the colleague of John Davenport at New Haven. A difference of opinion afterwards arose between him and Davenport. At the convention of 4 June 1639 (O. S.) Eaton took exception to the fifth article of the constitution, which limited the right of voting and of holding public office to church members only on the ground that ‚Äòthe free planters ought not to surrender this power out of their hands.‚Äô After his brother and Davenport had replied, he found so little support that he withdrew his dissent. The following year he set out for England with the design of gathering a company to settle Toboket, afterwards Branford, of which a grant had been made to him. On his way he preached for some time in Boston, but declined an invitation to settle there permanently. Arrived in England at a time when his own party was everywhere triumphant, he found more encouragement to remain there than to return to the ‚Äòwilderness.‚Äô He soon showed himself a vigorous asserter of independency. Annexed to the Royalist Sir Thomas Aston's Remonstrance against Presbytery, 4to, 1641, are ‚ÄòCertain Positions preached at St. John's Church in Chester, by Mr. Samuel Eaton, a minister lately returned from New England, upon Sunday, being the third day of January 1640,‚Äô as well as ‚ÄòCertyn other Positions preached by the same man at Knuttesford, a great Market Toune in the same County.‚Äô Aston bears unwilling testimony to Eaton's powers as a preacher in asserting that by his ‚Äòdoctrines many of the common people are brought into that odium of the Book of Common Prayer, that divers of them will not come into the church during the time of divine service.‚Äô In August 1641 ‚Äòthe New England Mr. Eaton‚Äô is reported as having delivered at Barrow, Cheshire, a violent tirade ‚Äòagainst the bishops and their government'. He became an assistant to the parliamentary commissioners of Cheshire. He was afterwards chosen teacher of a congregational church at Dukinfield in Cheshire, whence he removed to the neighbouring borough of Stockport, where he preached in the free school. In this place he had difficulty with his people, some of whom, says Edmund Calamy, ‚Äòran things to a great height, and grew wiser than their minister‚Äô. Upon being silenced in 1662 he attended the ministry of John Angier at Denton, near Manchester, where, it is said, many of his old hearers who had disliked him much while he was their minister ‚Äòwere wrought into a better temper‚Äô. He died at Denton 9 Jan. 1664‚Äì5, aged 68, and was buried in the chapel there on the 13th. He left no children. In his funeral sermon he is stated to have suffered not only from the persecution which raged against the silenced ministers, being ‚Äòseveral times brought into trouble and imprisoned,‚Äô but from grievous bodily affliction; he had ‚Äòbeen dying many years.‚Äô Works Eaton and his Dukinfield colleague Timothy Taylor entered into sustained controversy with Richard Hollingworth, and Eaton later attacked the theology of both the antitrinitarian John Knowles and the Quakers. Eaton's writings were favourably regarded by the council of state, who, convinced of his ‚Äòmerit and good affection,‚Äô augmented his stipend on two occasions (ib. 1651, p. 213, 1654, p. 293). * (with Timothy Taylor) A Defence of sundry Positions and Scriptures alledged to justifie the Congregationall-way; charged at first to be weak ‚Ä¶ and unsufficient, by R[ichard] H[ollingworth] M.A., of Magd.

Hollingworth published An Epistle in reply the following year. * (with Timothy Taylor) The Defence of sundry Positions and Scriptures for the Congregational-way justified, etc., 4to, London, 1646.

At the beginning, it was printed in black and white using a rotary owned by Diario Critica. In the 1980s, Diario Frontera became a generalist newspaper, printed in black and white, and with 20 pages. Since 1989, it has printed a page or a section dedicated to the University of the Andes, due to the high number of students and the importance of the University in the life of the city. In June 2005, it printed an inquiry about a student of the university killed by the police. Diario wrote that the student had been hit by the policemen, but also revealed his belonging to an armed political group. The headquarters of the newspaper was attacked by groups of students; it was the beginning of riots that then spread all over the city. The pleas of Reporters Without Borders remained unheard.

He received a medical education in London, becoming a member of the Surgeons' Company, and about 1766 went to the West Indies, where he practised for three years in the island of Nevis, returning in 1769. After this he went to St. Petersburg, where he became a practitioner of the College of St. Petersburg, as he afterwards described himself. Returning to England, Foot was appointed house- surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital, and on the conclusion of his term of office began practice in London, in Salisbury Street, Strand, later moving to Dean Street, Soho. He died at Ilfracombe on 27 October 1826. Works Foot wrote a slanted Life of John Hunter.

Life Fletcher was the eldest son of Robert Fletcher of Innerpeffer and Beucleo, Forfarshire, a burgess of Dundee. He succeeded Sir John Wemyss of Craigtoun as an ordinary lord of session, 18 December 1623, and retained his seat in 1626, when many of the lords were displaced. In 1630, he was placed on a commission upon Scots law, and in 1633 was a member of commissions to revise the acts and laws of Scotland with a view to constructing a code, a project which was not proceeded with, and to report upon the jurisdiction of the admiral and chamberlain. He was also ordered to examine Sir Thomas Craig's work Jus Feudale, with a view to its publication. In 1638, he was a commissioner to take subscriptions to the confession of faith of 1580. He was employed in 1639 in regulating the fees of writers to the signet and others, and parliament adopted the scales which he laid down. On 13 November 1641, Fletcher, with others, was appointed to his judgeship afresh by the king and parliament, and his appointment was objected to by the laird of Moncrieff, upon the ground that he was incapacitated by having purchased lands the subject of litigation before him. The matter was referred to the privy council, and as Fletcher retained his seat the charge was presumably disproved. In the same year he was a commissioner for the plantation of kirks, and about this time was elected member for Forfarshire, but his election was avoided for illegality. He represented the county, however, in parliament in 1646, 1647, and 1648. On 1 February 1645 he was appointed a commissioner of the exchequer, was on the committee of war for Haddingtonshire in 1647, and on the committee of estates for Haddingtonshire and Forfarshire in 1647 and 1648. He was fined ¬£5,000 by the Protector in 1648. On the question whether conditions should be obtained from the English army on behalf of Charles I, he was one of the four who voted against abandoning the king, and was removed in 1649 from his offices of judge and commissioner of the exchequer, on account of his accession to \\"the engagement\\", for the carrying on of which he had subscribed in the previous year ¬£8,500 (Scots), repaid by order of parliament in 1662 after his death to his son Robert. He was also \\"ordained\\" to lend money . In March 1650, he died at his house in East Lothian. Family Fletcher married a daughter of Peter Hay of Kirkland of Megginch, brother to George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull, by whom he had a son Robert, afterwards knighted, who was father of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun.

It was the directorial debut for the director, Francisco Laresgoiti. Regarding the title, Laresgotiti said that he \\"initially call it VCR 2026, (Viva Cristo Rey 2026), the motto of the Cristeros, as this would define the ideology of the tape, but decided to use 2033 as this will be the two thousandth anniversary the death of Jesus Christ.\\" The film was intended to be a trilogy, but the two sequels had not been written as of 2008. Synopsis The film is set in the year 2033 in a dystopian view of the future, in the Mexico City which by that time has been renamed Villaparaiso (Paradise City). The totalitarian militaristic/corporate government has outlawed the freedom of expression and religion in general. The government maintains control through pharmaceutical additions to the food and drink supply, which at the same time includes toxic chemicals. The protagonist is Lozada a lawyer whose true identity is \\"Father Miguel\\", the leader of a revolutionary movement. He is a priest of a religion that is a fusion of many religions, the focus in the film is a kind of theology of freedom; he is also a leader of the revolutionary movement that wants to free people from the government. He befriends Pablo, a rich and pampered man who believed that he was orphaned, who is in the leadership program of the military government. Lozada informs him that his father is actually a prisoner of the government. After hearing this, Pablo joins the organization to rescue his father and overthrow the government. Reviews Reviews for the film were mixed. Newcity recommended the film while rating it a \\"B-\\" Time Out Chicago reviewer Kevin B. Lee called the film \\"A dystopian Mexican thriller emphasizes mood at the expense of character\\" and that \\"the screenplay‚Äôs political provocations collapse into generic telenovela suspense.\\" Releases *24 September 2009 ‚Äì Fantastisk Film Festival, Lund, Sweden (premiere) *5 February 2010 ‚Äì Mexico *1 May 2010 ‚Äì Sci-Fi-London Film Festival Cast *Miguel Couturier ...

Twenty years later, in the spring of 1910, Daggett led his family off the reservation and they traveled to Nevada and California where they worked at various jobs. Cattle theft Finally, in January 1911, the Daggetts were encamped in Little High Rock Canyon in Washoe County, Nevada. Their winter stores were running low so Mike decided to steal and slaughter some cattle belonging to a local rancher. Death and legacy The theft did not go unnoticed and a posse of four men went to the canyon to deal with the situation, but when the four entered, Mike and two of his oldest sons ambushed the posse and killed all of them on January 19. The bodies were later found mutilated and piled inside a cave by a search party on February 8, after which a posse of Nevada and California policemen and citizens were sent to apprehend the Daggett party. On February 25, 1911, the posse discovered Shoshone Mike and his followers at a place known as Kelley Creek in Humboldt County, Nevada. During a battle that lasted three hours, Mike was killed, along with eight others, and four of his children were taken into police custody.

The vessel has a complement of 115 naval personnel plus 90 military and civilian technicians. =Radar systems= Monge arriving in Reykjavik Harbour in May 2012 The systems in Monge allow the vessel to track missiles and satellites. There are two navigational radars operating on the I-band, one for control of the helicopters, and a Thomsen DRBV 15C air surveillance radar operating on the E and F-bands installed. The intelligence systems are a Stratus radar operating on the L-band for trajectory tracking, a Gascogne, two Armor, and one Savoie radars for missile tracking operating on the C-band. Furthermore, there are six Antares telemetry-tracking radars operating on the E and F-bands, a laser-radar, and an optical tracking unit, and 14 antennas for telemetry. In 2009, the Stratus and Savoie radars were replaced by a Normandie radar for the trials of the M51 missile. Service history The ship was ordered on 25 November 1988 as a replacement for the aging . The ship's keel was laid down on 26 March 1990 with the yard number H39 by Chantiers de l'Atlantique at their yard in Saint-Nazaire, France. Monge, named for the 18th century mathematician Gaspard Monge, was launched on 6 October 1990. Monge entered service with the French Navy on 5 November 1992, given the hull number A 601, and is based at Brest, France. In September 1999, Monge took part in tests in the Bay of Biscay. From 27 March to 1 April 2000, Monge visited Lisbon, Portugal. After the end of a refit in December 2000, Monge validated the launch of the French military satellite H√©lios II in December 1999. On 17‚Äì18 April 2001, Monge took part in the test firing of an M45 missile off the coast of Brittany. In September 2002, the ship visited Toulon for the first time before travelling to Piraeus, Greece for the Armament Fair. This was the ship's first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. The deployment ended in October, when Monge returned to the Atlantic, passing Gibraltar on 10 October. On 15 June 2004, as Monge was manoeuvring in Brest's harbour, the propellers churned up the body of a man. The man was later identified and no foul play was suspected. On 1 February 2005, the ship monitored a test firing of an M45 missile off the coast of Brittany. From 31 May to 24 June, the vessel travelled north, visiting Spitzbergen, Norway before crossing the Arctic Circle and visiting Greenland. Before returning to Brest, the ship visited Edinburgh, Scotland. On 9 November 2006, Monge monitored the first launch of an M51 ballistic missile over the Atlantic Ocean from the Landes Test Centre. Beginning in 2007, Monge began trials and testing of the Ariane rockets. On 27 November 2010, the test-fired an M51 ballistic missile from Audierne Bay. Monge monitored the launch. In September 2011, the ship monitored the re-entry of the US Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. On 24 September, the satellite crashed into the Pacific Ocean. On 1 October 2015, Monge monitored the launch of a new version of the M51 missile. On 27 September 2018, Monge lost power while returning to Brest.

History The factory was founded by Philip V after Spain lost its Belgian territories, and their tapestry workshops, as a result of the Peace of Utrecht. A master weaver was recruited from Antwerp. The project was followed by a number of other mercantilist initiatives undertaken in the eighteenth century in the Madrid area to supply luxury goods. Another example was the Real F√°brica del Buen Retiro porcelain factory. Like its French counterpart the Gobelins Manufactory, the Royal Tapestry Factory supplied the court with tapestries. While still in his 20s the painter Francisco Goya was commissioned to provide designs (known as cartoonsCartoon) for tapestries to furnish El Escorial and El Pardo, two of the palaces in the Madrid region. Many of the Goya tapestry cartoons are displayed at the Museo del Prado. The Parasol. A 1777 design by Goya. It is one of the cards that Goya delivered to the Royal Factory in 1775, the year he arrived to supply models that were later converted into tapestries. Current activities In the 1990s the factory was running at a loss and received a bail-out from public funds. It became a foundation under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture with the aim of providing a secure basis for the future. Although further issues related to profitability have been reported, the factory still produces traditional tapestries and carpets. As well as producing new pieces, it is involved in the conservation of historic textiles.

He was the son and heir of Thomas Fitzmaurice, 16th Baron Kerry. Fitzmaurice was sent at an early age into England as a pledge of his father's loyalty. When he had attained the age of twenty he was allowed by Elizabeth to return to Ireland. In 1580 he joined in the rebellion of the Earl of Desmond, but shortly afterwards with his brother Edmund was surprised and confined to the castle of Limerick. In August 1581 he managed to escape with the connivance, it was suspected, of his gaoler, John Sheriff, clerk of the ordnance. In September 1582 he was reported to have gone to Spain with the catholic bishop of Killaloe; but he was in January 1583 wounded at the Dingle, and in April 1587 captured and committed to Dublin Castle. In 1588 Sir William Herbert made a laudable effort to procure his release, offering to pawn his bond to the uttermost value of his land and substance for his loyal and dutiful demeanour, ‚Äòknowing him to be of no turbulent disposition'. He was, however, opposed by St. Leger and Fitzwilliam, and despite a loving attempt on the part of his wife to obtain his freedom he remained in prison till 1591‚Äì2. During the last great rebellion that convulsed Ireland in Elizabeth's reign he, perhaps more from compulsion than free choice, threw in his lot with the rebels; but the evident ruin that confronted him and the loss of his castle of Lixnaw so affected him that he died shortly afterwards, August 1600. He was buried with his uncle Donald, earl of Clancar, in the Grey Friary of Irrelaugh in Desmond. He married Joan or Jane, daughter of David, Viscount Fermoy, and by her had three sons, Thomas, who became 18th Baron Kerry, Gerald, and Maurice, and two daughters, Joan and Eleanor.

It is noted for its baroque interior decoration. It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1973. History The 17th-century church is built in the Baroque style and was designed by Pedro S√°nchez. The highly decorative High Altar and three side altars belong to the 18th century and were commissioned by the last Habsburg kings of Spain. The church was built in the 1620s-1630s by King Felipe III along with a hostel and hospital for the Portuguese migrants who moved to Madrid when Portugal was under Spanish rule. For this reason it was originally called Hospital de los Portugueses. When Portugal gained independence, Phillip IV's Queen, Mariana de Austria, dedicated the refuge to German immigrants, and changed names. King Phillip V gave the administration of the church over to the Hermandad del Refugio (Fraternity of Sanctuary), and this group continues to manage it today, offering food and shelter to the homeless of Madrid. The Church is dedicated to St Antony of Padua, patron saint of the poor. St Antony was born in Lisbon, Portugal in 1198, and became a first an Augustinian, then a Franciscan order monk, well known for his eloquent sermons. He preached in France and Italy, and died in Padua in 1231 at the age of 36. St Antony is considered the patron saint of those with items lost or misplaced. GoMadrid tourism entry. The church houses frescos by Luca Giordano and Francisco Ricci. The prolific Neopolitan painter Giordano was court painter (1692-1702) to Charles II of Spain, and active for the Royal Palace and the Buen Retiro Palace. He was renowned for his speed of painting, and had been nicknamed \\"Luca-get-it-done-fast\\" (Luca f√†-presto\\"). On one occasion at the Spanish court, the Queen apparently asked him what his wife looked like, and he proceeded to include her image in the painting he had before him.

He published academic papers on the chemical composition of meteorites in both Germany and the United Kingdom. He also worked for the British Museum, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and on a committee appointed by the British Science Association, then known as the British Association. Early life Walter Flight was the son of William P. Flight of Winchester, and was born in Winchester on 21 January 1841. He was educated at Queenwood College in Hampshire, where he was taught chemistry by Professor Debus and physics from Professor Tyndall, and in after life Debus was his constant friend. After coming of age Flight proceeded to Germany and spent the winter session of 1863-1864 studying chemistry under Professor Heintz at the University of Halle. He passed the next two years at Heidelberg, and acquired a thorough knowledge of chemistry. His studies in Germany were completed at Berlin, where he acted for some time as secretary and chemical assistant to Professor Hofmann. Career In 1867 Flight returned to England, and took the degree of doctor of science at London University. In 1868 he was appointed assistant exammer there in chemistry under Professor Debus. On 5 September 1867 he became an assistant in the mineralogical department of the British Museum under Professor Nevil Story-Maskelyne. In the laboratory, which was now specially fitted up, he commenced a series of researches upon the mineral constituents of meteorites and their occluded gases, which rapidly brought him into notice. He was appointed examiner in chemistry and physics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1868, and in 1876 examiner to the Royal Military Academy, Cheltenham. He also acted for several years as a member of the committee on luminous meteors appointed by the British Association. Publications Flight wrote twenty-one papers on scientific subjects, of which the first three, all on chemical subjects, appeared in German periodicals in 1864-5-70. The later papers were chiefly upon meteorites, dealing in detail with the recorded circumstances of their fall, and with their mineralogical and chemical constituents; several, written in conjunction with Professor Story-Maskelyne, give accounts, published in the Philosophical Transactions, of the meteorites which fell at Rowton in Shropshire, at Middlesbrough, England, and at Cranbourne, Australia. A paper, thus jointly written, on Francolite, Vivianite, and Cronstedtite from Cornwall, appeared in the Journal of the Chemical Society for 1871. The last paper Flight wrote was on the meteorite of Alfianello in Italy. Between 1875 and 1883 Flight contributed a series of twenty-three papers to the Geological Magazine, entitled A Chapter in the History of Meteorites (published in book form in 1887). Later life Flight was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1883. In 1884 he was taken so seriously ill that he was compelled to resign his post in the British Museum, and died on 4 November 1885, leaving a widow and three young children. He had married Kate, the daughter of Dr Fell of Ambleside.

Background Flindell was born in 1767 at Helford, in the parish of Manaccan, Cornwall, and was, to use his own words, 'bred an illiterate half- seaman.' He was apprenticed to a printer, and in 1790, when twenty-three years old, was sent to Yorkshire to conduct the 'Doncaster Gazette,' the circulation of which he largely increased through his happy audacity in anticipating the decision of the jury in the trials of Hardy and Horne Tooke by publishing the verdict of 'not guilty.' About 1798 he returned to Helston in his native county, where he opened business as a printer, starting the 'Stannary Press,' and publishing several works by the Rev. Richard Polwhele and Dr. Hawker, as well as an edition of Pope's Essay on Man. In 1800 he removed to Falmouth, and in that year was published the first volume of his impression of the Bible, which he issued in numbers. The introduction and notes to three of the books of the Old Testament were contributed by the Rev. John Whitaker, and Polwhele wrote the notes on the other books; but the work was left incomplete, and copies are now very scarce. The first number of the 'Cornwall Gazette and Falmouth Packet,' a weekly paper, was started at Falmouth under his editorship on 7 March 1801, and it lasted until 16 October 1802, when it ceased through the bankruptcy of his partners. Energy and style Flindell establish a newspaper called the 'Royal Cornwall Gazette.' Its first number appeared on 2 July 1803, and it still survives. He parted with his interest in this paper in 1811, but he continued the printing business at Truro during the next year. His next venture was the 'Western Luminary,' a weekly newspaper of tory principles, which he set on foot at Exeter early in 1813. It prospered for some years, until the fierceness of his political zeal led him to stigmatise Queen Caroline as 'notoriously devoted to Bacchus and Venus,' when Wetherell brought the matter before the House of Commons (24 and 25 July 1820), and moved that it was a breach of the house's privileges. This was not unreasonably resisted by Lord Castlereagh, and as it appeared in the subsequent discussion that a prosecution would be instituted the motion was withdrawn. For this indiscretion Flindell was prosecuted, and on 19 March 1821 was sentenced to an imprisonment of eight months in Exeter gaol. During his confinement he composed a volume entitled Prison Recreations: the philosophy of reason and revelation attempted, with a view to the restoration of the theory of the Bible on the ruins of infidelity. The discussion of religious topics was one of his chief pleasures, and the pages of his Exeter paper contained a lengthened controversy from three divines, named Cleeve, Dennis, and Carpenter, on the Trinitarian question, which Flindell 'closed at last in a somewhat perplexed manner,' and provoked from Colton the epigram printed in Archdeacon Wrangham's catalogue of his English library, p. 564, to the effect that the three parsons had proved 'not one incomprehensible but three,' and Flindell had shown 'not three incomprehensible but one.' His prison restraint impaired his health ; he wrote in January 1824 that he was breaking up fast, and his illness was aggravated by his indignation at the severe treatment which he had received, while others who had used equally strong language had escaped scot-free. Death After a protracted illness he died at Exeter on 11 July 1824, aged 57. His wife and a numerous family survived him; he had eight children in 1806, some of whom are mentioned in Boase's 'Collectanea Cornub.,' p. 251. Several letters by Flindell are in Jonathan Edwards Ryland's 'Kitto,' pp. 124‚Äì9, 155; Polwhele's 'Traditions and Recollections,' ii. 778‚Äì81; 'Reminiscences,' i. 125‚Äì6; and 'Biographical Sketches in Cornwall,' ii. 57. 'A man of strong understanding, though by no means polished or refined,' was Polwhele's estimate of Flindell's character.

Life Flowerdew, fourth son of John Flowerdew of Hethersett, Norfolk, a large landed proprietor, was educated at Cambridge, but took no degree. He became a member of the Inner Temple 11 October 1552, and in the autumn of 1569 and Lent of 1577 was reader, and in 1579 treasurer. He obtained considerable celebrity as a lawyer in his own county. In 1571 he became counsel to the dean and chapter of Norwich, and in 1573 to the town of Great Yarmouth. He was counsel also to Sir Thomas Gresham. The town of Norwich gave him a silver cup in 1571, presumably for professional services, and various grateful clients settled annuities on him, Thomas Grimesdiche settling 40s. and John Thornton 26s. 8d. in 1573, and Simon Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, one third of five marks in 1575. On 12 February 1584 he received a grant from the clerk of the royal kitchen of a buck in summer and a doe in winter yearly from any royal forest in Norfolk or elsewhere. He was elected M.P. for Castle Rising in 1572, but replaced by Sir William Drury in 1581 when he reported sick. He was then returned as MP for Norwich in 1581 when their MP fell sick. The replacements were later ruled inadmissible and invalid. He became a serjeant- at-law and recorder of Great Yarmouth, 16 October 1580, and on 23 October 1584 third baron of the exchequer, when he resigned his recordership. On 20 February 1585 he was a member of the special commission for the county of Middlesex, before which Dr William Parry was tried and convicted for high treason. In the winter of 1585 and 1586 he went on circuit in South Wales, and in March held the notorious Lent Black Assize of Exeter from 14 March 1586. Here gaol fever broke out from which he, together with many others, died between 14 March and 4 April. He was buried at Hethersett Church. He was a man of grasping temper, but apparently not of fine feelings. In 1564 he purchased Stanfield Hall and its furniture from John Appleyard, in order to live there, and also married Elizabeth, daughter of William Foster of Wymondham, who had long been Appleyard's mistress. In 1575 he acquired the site of the dissolved abbey of Wymondham. The parishioners, wishing to preserve the church, petitioned the crown to be allowed to buy it at a valuation, and paid the money. Flowerdew, however, stripped it of its lead and carried off a quantity of freestone, whereupon the exasperated parishioners dismantled it. His lands were dispersed on his death, and he left no issue. According, however, to another account, he had a daughter, who married Thomas Skelton. References *History of Parliament online - FLOWERDEW, Edward (c.1534-86) of Hethersett and Stanfield Hall, Norf.

Between 2008 and 2011, the UFC booked three contests between the fighters. Edgar, the quicker of the two, utilized speed and precise striking. Maynard, the more accomplished wrestler, relied on power and ground control. In April 2008, Maynard won their first meeting by decision. On January 1, 2011, the two met in a highly acclaimed rematch, in which Maynard challenged Edgar for the UFC Lightweight Championship. After the rematch resulted in a draw, Edgar won the third meeting by knockout in October 2011. Background Prior to fighting in mixed martial arts, Frankie Edgar and Gray Maynard each competed in amateur wrestling. Edgar became an All-American at Clarion University, graduating in 2005. Maynard, a three-time All-American who competed in the NCAA Championships, graduated from Michigan State University in 2003. In making the transition to MMA, Edgar utilized a successful combination of boxing, speed, and wrestling. Maynard, a powerful striker, largely relied on his ability to out-wrestle opponents. First fight Edgar cited the first fight as an inspiration for new training. After joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship's lightweight division, Gray Maynard and Frankie Edgar fought for the first time on April 2, 2008 at UFC Fight Night 13. The event took place in Broomfield, Colorado. At the time of this encounter, both were undefeated. Edgar expressed confidence prior to the event, but remarked that he was \\"expecting a tough fight.\\" Maynard stated, \\"Unless I get a good clean one in for the KO, I'm expecting a three-round brawl.\\" Maynard utilized superior wrestling to earn a unanimous decision victory by a score of 30‚Äì27. In 2009, Edgar credited this fight as a positive turning point in his career. \\"The Maynard loss definitely opened my eyes. I started training with Ricardo Almeida and the [Renzo] Gracie team. That's where I've been the past year, and I think it had helped me tremendously.\\" He also anticipated an eventual rematch with Maynard. \\"I think if [Maynard] keeps going where he's going, and I go where I plan on going, I think we'll eventually have to meet up. That would be something that I'd like to see in the future, but I'm not dwelling on it because I think if you dwell on losses you're not really going to focus on what you have ahead of yourself.\\" On April 10, 2010, Edgar won the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 112. He defended the belt in August at UFC 118, while Maynard won a title shot on the same night. Second fight Maynard fought Edgar to a draw in their second fight. Edgar and Maynard fought for the UFC Lightweight title on January 1, 2011 at UFC 125. The event took place in Maynard's hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada. In the opening round, Maynard appeared to be on the verge of winning the fight after stunning Edgar with a left hook and landing a series of follow-up punches. However, Edgar recovered and out-struck Maynard 22‚Äì8 in the second round, executing a slam in the process. The fight went to a judges' decision and was declared a draw. As a result, another rematch was scheduled. Edgar and Maynard's second meeting earned \\"Fight of the Night\\" honors and was named \\"Fight of the Year\\" by the World MMA Awards. Sports Illustrated's Jeff Wagenheim called the contest \\"legendary\\", and noted it as \\"one of the most memorable fights in recent UFC history.\\" Sherdog's Todd Martin lauded the bout as a classic. Sergio Non of USA Today praised Edgar's resiliency, stating, \\"The fact that Edgar made it out of the first round at all stands as a testament to his fighting instincts.\\" In the post-fight interview, Edgar remarked that he did not remember much of round one. Maynard commented, \\"I kind of punched myself out in the first, so round two, I couldn't really go that hard.\\" He later cited nervousness as a factor, but noted that he had learned from the experience. When asked about his outlook on a third fight, Edgar stated, \\"It's hard to say who has the mental edge, if anyone. You know, he may have tasted it from being so close, and now he's super-motivated. And there are a lot of ways for me to look at that last fight, too: as a guy who barely got through it or as a survivor. I don't know how he approaches it, but I know I'm fired up to settle things.\\" Both remarked that they were excited about fighting for a third time. Third fight A third meeting between the two was initially scheduled for May at UFC 130. However, both men withdrew due to injury. The fight was rescheduled for UFC 136 and took place on October 8, 2011 in Houston, Texas. As in the second fight, round one featured a dominant performance by Maynard, who again staggered Edgar with a series of punches. However, Edgar recovered and went on to win the fight in round four by KO (punches) to retain the UFC Lightweight Championship, giving Maynard his first professional loss. Following the third bout, Maynard posted a Twitter message in which he stated, \\"Hats off to Frank Edgar. Great competitor and person, true champ!\\" Edgar also posted a message via Twitter, stating, \\"I wanna wish Gray the best in the future, he was my toughest opponent as he forced me to bring the best out of myself.\\" References Mixed martial arts rivalries Ultimate Fighting Championship rivalries ","title":"Frankie Edgar vs. Gray Maynard"},{"id":"32742672","text":"Xenohormones or environmental hormones are a group of compounds showing endocrine hormone-like properties.

His exploits have since become legendary, with numerous accounts of his life, deeds, and death. Language map of western right Biography Pitung was born in Pengumben, a slum in Rawabelong (near modern-day Palmerah Station) to Bung Piung and Mbak Pinah; he was the fourth son born to the couple. His real name was Salihoen. Based on oral tradition, the name Pitung is derived from pituan pitulung (Javanese for \\"group of seven\\"). As a child, Salihoen studied at Hadji Naipin's Islamic boarding school. Aside from learning his prayers, he also received training in pencak and situational awareness. Pitung's criminal career started after money earned from the sale of his father's goats was stolen in Tanah Abang. His father forced him to compensate the loss. As a result, he chased down the thief. This incident made him known as a jago', a cocky person or local legend. Later Pitung invited his friends Dji-ih, Rais, and Jebul to rob Hadji Sapiudin, a wealthy landowner who lived northeast of Batavia, on 30 July 1892. One telling has it that the four men posed as civil servants and stated that Sapiudin was under investigation for fraud, but offered to keep his money in safekeeping. Sapiudin surrendered the money, unaware that he was being conned. The police suspected that the robbers had used guns to threaten the house owner and neighbors. Some tellings have Pitung stealing money only from rich persons who had collaborated with the Dutch colonial overlords. According to the daily Hindia Olanda, on 18 July 1892 a schout (kind of police officer) in Tanah Abang rummaged through Bitoeng's house in one of villages of Sukabumi. During the search, a black coat, a police uniform, and a cap were discovered. Those items were allegedly used by Pitung and his comrades to rob a village. The next month, 125 guilders were found concealed under the house. The money was supposedly from the robbery of a Mrs. De C. and Hadji Sapiudin. His crimes received the attention of A.W.V. Hinne, a police officer who was stationed in Batavia from 1888 to 1912. Hinne wanted to capture Pitung and had caught him once. However, Pitung had escaped with the help of his gang members; folklore attributes the escape to Pitung's magical powers. Reports differ on what happened next. One account gives Hinne convincing Pitung's former teacher Hadji Naipin to reveal what talisman (jimat) gave Pitung his powers. Another version has Hinne asking Pitung's comrades (excluding Dji-ih, who was highly loyal to Pitung) the same question; these comrades betrayed Pitung. The jimat itself differs depending on the retelling. One source says it was his kris (a kind of dagger). Another says it was his hair, and his power would weaken if his hair was cut. Some sources suggest that Pitung would lose his supernatural powers if he was pelted with rotten eggs. Eventually, Hinne was able to kill Pitung. According to the report in the Dutch-language Locomotief, the historical Pitung was caught in an ambush and killed by Hinne and several assistants; some Indonesian tellings indicate that Pitung's family had been arrested and tortured to draw him out. A detail found in folklore, but not present in accounts from the period, is that Hinne shot and killed Pitung with a golden bullet. Pitung was buried in a cemetery in Sukabumi (now part of Jakarta). Hinne was awarded the title (Brother of the Dutch Lion) for his part in stopping Pitung. When the city began to develop, most of the cemetery where Pitung was buried was built over with the head offices of Telkom Indonesia. However, the grave remained undisturbed and was often the site of pilgrimages for those seeking mystical powers. Another mythic figure, a Moluccan named Jonker, is buried nearby. Description In the lenong version, Pitung is described as a humble person, a good Muslim, a hero of Betawi people, and an upholder of justice. According to Indonesian author and screenwriter Lukman Karmani, who wrote about Pitung in the 1960s, the bandit was an Indonesian Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to the poor. In Si Pitoeng, a 1931 film and the first produced about Pitung's life, he was shown as a real bandit. However, in the 1970 film of the same name, Pitung's characteristics were closer to the traditional Indonesian depictions. The Indonesian-run newspaper Hindia Olanda described Pitung as a \\"colorful figure\\" in its first reports. According to the Dutch scholar Margareet van Till, views of Pitung vary depending on ethnicity. The Dutch despised him, while the Chinese and natives respected him. Popular culture Rumah Si Pitung (\\"Si Pitung's House\\"), now a museum. Pitung's story appears in rancak (a kind of ballad), syair (narrative poems), and lenong (folk-plays performed by semi-professional actors). Several modern depictions of Pitung's story exist. One of the earliest, and the first film, was made in 1931. It was entitled Si Pitoeng and produced by the Wong brothers, American-trained directors of Chinese descent. The film starred Herman Shin as Pitung and the keroncong singer Ining Resmini as a love interest. Several novels were published in the 1970s, with several films also released in that decade. One of the most successful films about Pitung from that period was Si Pitung, which was released in August 1970 and became the most watched of the year, viewed by 141,140 persons; this version also introduced a love interest named Aisjah. In May 1971, the film Banteng Betawi was released as the sequel of Si Pitung, which tells of the death of Pitung; two other sequels followed, in 1977 and 1981. There were also television series made about him. Si Pitung Museum, a house which reportedly belonged to Hadji Sapiudin, is located in Marunda. The house has also been said to be Pitung's.

The book was first published in 2002 by Edinburgh-based publisher Canongate. It has won several awards including the 2002 Saltire Society First Book Award. Plot summary The novel, set in Glasgow, revolves around the central character, Rilke, an auctioneer who has agreed to quickly process and sell an inventory of largely valuable contents belonging to a recently deceased old man in exchange for a considerable fee. While sorting through some of the possessions in an attic, he comes across a collection of violent and potentially snuff pornography that appears to document the death of a mysterious young woman. Starting with local pornography trade contacts, Rilke sets out to discover this woman's identity and uncover the story behind her appearance in the disturbing photographs. Critical reception The novel received a highly positive reception from critics. The Guardian described it as a \\"gleefully black, knowing first novel\\", also noting that it \\"effortlessly glides [from a detective novel] into literary fiction\\". For The Independent, the novel presented a \\"hugely commendable debut, assured and memorable\\" and \\"a genuinely creepy, grisly little tale\\". The Sunday Times described The Cutting Room as: \\"one of the most intriguing, assured and unputdownable debuts to come out of Scotland in recent years\\". The List was particularly impressed by Welsh's portrayal of Glasgow: \\"...the city becomes a character in its own right; Gothic, dismal, decaying and frightening in equal measure\\". The novel won several awards, including the Saltire Society First Book Award 2002, the Crime Writers‚Äô Association John Creasey Memorial Dagger Award 2002 and the BBC Underground Award 2003. Adaptations The novel was adapted for the stage a year after publication, the world premiere taking place in the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow in October 2003. Plans to produce a film version of the novel were at an advanced stage in 2004. The film was set to star Robert Carlyle as Rilke with a screenplay from Andrea Gibb, and was due to be filmed on location in the West End of Glasgow, but the project failed to materialise. Carlyle did, however, contribute to an audiobook version of the novel in 2006.

She served against the French, Danes and Dutch in the Napoleonic Wars and was assigned to the Downs station. She participated in a number of operations in the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel, and the North Sea. In 1814 the British government transferred Piercer to the Kingdom of Hanover for use as a guard ship. Hanover decommissioned her in 1850. British service Lieutenant Thomas Carew commissioned Piercer in September 1804. The next year she came under the command of Lieutenant John Sibrell, who had just transferred from the hired armed cutter Duchess of Cumberland, and who sailed her amongst the Channel Islands. In June 1805 Lieutenant Carter assumed command, apparently temporarily. On 3 August 1805, Piercer was in a squadron with , , , , and when they captured the Frederick Wilhelm. At the time, Sibrell was in command of Piercer. Then on 8 April 1806, Basilisk captured Mercurius. Piercer shared in the prize money by private agreement. In January 1807, Sibrell sailed Piercer for the North Sea. On 15 October Piercer, and were in company at the capture of the Danish bark Narbvalen. Piercer shared by agreement in the proceeds of 's capture of the Danish ship Gamble Norge. On 15 October Piercer was in company with and at the capture of the Danish brig Narhvalen and so later shared in the proceeds. In November 1808 Sibrell captured the Danish vessels Catherina (4 November), and Speculation (6 November). In January 1809, Piercer was driven ashore on the coast of Sweden. She was refloated, repaired, and returned to service. During the Gunboat War, a flotilla of 25 Dano-Norwegian gunboats attacked a British convoy on 9 June 1809 off the island of Saltholm in √òresund Strait near Copenhagen. Piercer was one of the four British warships escorting the convoy. During the engagement the Danes captured 10 or 12 merchant vessels, as well as the gunbrig . captured two French chasse marees, the Camilla and the Bonne Rencontre, on 6 May 1810; Piercer and were in company. Piercer and the gun-brig were in company with Surveillante when on 23 June she captured the chasse marees Margaret and the Eclair. On 12 September 1810, Piercer was in company with a squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Sir H.B. Neal when captured the chasse maree Sophie. The vessels sharing in the prize included Caledonia, Valiant, , and the hired armed cutter Nimrod. The next day, Piercer captured the French sloop Saint Pierre. Piercer was part of a squadron under Captain James Newman-Newman in when the squadron captured the American vessel Beauty on 1 February 1811. Sibrell died in June and Lieutenant Joshua Kneeshaw assumed command. On 14 August 1811 Piercer captured the chasse marees Marengo and Phillippe, off the Sables d'Olonne. Two weeks later, Piercer was in company with when they captured the Catharina Augusta. In December Piercer witnessed an unfortunate occurrence for the Royal Navy. On the 27th, and sent 120 men in six boats to attack a French convoy sailing along the shore in the Basque Roads. As the boats approached their quarry just south of the Chatillon Reef, the wind shifted, which permitted the convoy's escorts, three gun-brigs, an armed lugger and several pinnaces, to sally out and get between the British boats and their parent vessels. The French then attacked the boats, which tried to board their attackers. One British boat escaped, but a French gunboat captured Colossuss barge. The other four British boats ran onshore where the French captured them and their crews.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 27, pp.65-6. The French account differs slightly, in that the brigs are reported as gunboats no.s 184, 186, and 191, and the other French attackers are ships' boats. Furthermore, M. Jacob, the commander of the French naval forces, states that he had anticipated the British attack and had made no overt response until the British boats were compromised. The French reported capturing 113 men, perhaps including five British sailors who were killed, two who died soon after, and several who were dangerously wounded.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 27, pp.105-7. When he saw the French attacking, Captain Lord William Stuart of Conquestador signaled Piercer to protect the British boats and sent her a boat with eighteen seamen and marines as reinforcements, but she was unable (or unwilling) to do so. The captured British sailors remained prisoners of war until the end of the war.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, pp.232-3. On 10 December 1812 Piercer was in sight, and so shared in the prize money, when Arminde captured the chasse maree Civilit√©. On 9 March 1813, Piercer recaptured the brig King George, of 100 tons (bm) and five men, which had been captured while sailing from Dublin to Newport. By mid-1813, Piercer had been assigned to the Heligoland squadron commanded by Captain A. Farquhar in . On 10 July the squadron captured 19 boats on the rivers Elbe and Weser. Desiree arrived at Cuxhaven from Bremerlehe on 28 November to join the squadron that , Captain Greene, had gathered. The British vessels had come to support the Russian troops under Colonel Alexander Radlinger, who were besieging the town. The squadron comprised , , Piercer, , , and the gun-boats No.s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. The two key positions were the French forts Napoleon and Phare. While the gunboats fired on Phare, the British landed a number of guns and established a battery of six 18-pounders, two 32-pounders, and two 6-pounders. Before the battery could start firing on the 30th, the French surrendered both forts. The French surrendered 26 heavy guns, two 13\\" mortars, and a blockhouse with a garrison of three hundred men and officers, all of whom became prisoners of war. From late December 1813 Farquhar's squadron, comprising Desiree, Hearty, Blazer, Piercer, Shamrock, Redbreast, and eight gun-boats (the seven from Cuxhaven plus No. 12), supported Swedish forces under the command of General Baron de Boye against the Danes in the attack on the town and fortress of Gl√ºckstadt at the Elbe river during the War of the Sixth Coalition. The British arrived on 23 December and by 25 December had erected a battery of two 32-pounder guns. (They had landed six but the poor quality of the roads meant that only two were in place.) To support the bombardment on the next day, Farquhar sent in the gunboats and the brigs, whose armament he had reinforced with two 18-pounders each from Desiree. The bombardment continued to the 28th. Gl√ºckstadt having failed to surrender, Farquhar established three more batteries, one of two 18-pounders, one of four 32-pounders, and one of the two 13\\" mortars captured at Cuxhaven. An English rocket brigade under Lieutenant Amherst Wright contributed to the bombardment. These batteries commenced bombarding the town on 1 January 1814, keeping it up for the next two days. On 4 January Farquhar sent in a flag of truce, and after negotiations, the governor surrendered on 5 January. British casualties overall were light and Piercer had none. Kneeshaw and Piercer brought the news back to Britain, arriving at the Admiralty on 12 January. That same day the Admiralty promoted Kneeshaw to Commander and re-rated Piercer as a sloop, congruent with his rank. On 15 July 1816 there was a first payment of ¬£5000 in prize money to the navy for the capitulation of Gl√ºckstadt. The hired armed cutter Princess Augusta, shared in the prize money. In appreciation of this operation the Swedish government awarded Kneeshaw, amongst others, a gold medal. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Gluckstadt 5 Jany. 1814\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Transferred to Hanover On 4 June 1814, George III's birthday, Piercer was transferred in an official ceremony to the Kingdom of Hanover, following an Admiralty Order of 29 March. (The Kingdom of Hanover represented the restoration to George III of his Hanoverian territories after the Napoleonic Wars.) The Hanoverians appointed Joachim Deetjen as captain of Piercer, and he remained her captain, and commander of the customs service, until his death in 1827. Piercer thus became the only warship in the rather short history of the newly created kingdom (1814 ‚Äì 1866) and she served as a customs guard ship on the river Elbe with Stade as her homeport.The customs service also maintained a cutter and some sloops. Deetjen's successor was Major Carl August Delius, who had served with the British at the Battle of Talavera, where he had lost an arm. He died in 1833 and on 22 November lieutenant colonel Andreas Schl√ºter became the last commander of the Elbe customs service. Although Piercer was initially suitable as a customs vessel, she and the other sailing vessels could not cope as steamships replaced sail. In 1850 the King ordered Piercer to be laid up, and on 20 October Schl√ºter tendered his resignation. Fate She was decommissioned in 1850 without replacement.Graewe (1963).

Documentary evidence for a church first occurs in the mid-12th century. Following the Dissolution in the 16th century, the parish came under the ownership of the Dean of Lincoln, and in the 17th and 18th centuries the village gradually became depopulated.

The club was founded in 1923 by members of the Irish civil service. It currently field two adult hurling teams, in Division 5 and 8 and play in the Junior A and E Hurling championships. They share a ground at Islandbridge with the Civil Service Gaelic Football Club.  History Founded in 1923, the founder members were Art O‚ÄôDriscoll, Tadgh Casey, Padraigh OhAodha, Liam Malone, Joe Crossan, J.Lennon, Harry McHugh, Tom Mchugh, Colm O‚ÄôSullivan, Harry Carrick, Dennis O‚ÄôSullivan, Paddy McCarthy and Seamus Murphy and the three O‚ÄôBraonain brothers among their founding members, Seamus, Chriostoir and Sean. The first hurling practice took place in October at the former British Army Polo grounds on the Navan Road. The Club played its first match in the Dublin Junior hurling league on 19 May 1924 against Pioneers, losing by two goals. In 1926 the club won its first league title and its first championship having gone the season unbeaten. In 1929 the club won the Intermediate league and in 1934, an Under 21 league. In 1935 Service won the Corn Ceitin. There path to victory was somewhat unusual however. The club had received a walk over in the semi final from Crokes, and as a result were to play Banba in the final which they did ending in a draw. In the meantime Crokes persuaded the board to refix their semi final and so Service were now forced to play Crokes who they beat. The replay against Banba took place which the club won. In 1938 an interclub committee meeting between Civil Service Hurling, Gaelic football and Camogie clubs took place in order to attain a common goal; their own grounds. It was chaired by Colm O‚ÄôSullivan of the hurling club, Joe Moylan represented the hurling club, Tom Wolfe the football club and Delia Kelly the camogie club. Islandbridge came on stream as a result in 1944. A former dump, transformation to a level playing pitch was a difficult task with arable soil difficult to come by. The clubs managed to obtain around 600 tons of good soil from Ballyfermot where building was in progress for the foundations of what is now suburb of Dublin. The club was able to cover the cost of the soil through a grant from the unemployment relief scheme. The club developed a club house and changing rooms starting out with a two mini apartment wooden hut ‚Äì without water or sanitation. Development was difficult due to the scarcity of building materials after World War II, resulting in a statutory limit of ¬£750 outlay on recreational buildings. Using voluntary labour the club dug out the foundations for a new four-apartment concrete building with hot and cold showers and sanitation in 1947 and developed by 1951. The club's senior status which they had obtained in when they won the Intermediate Championship was lost in 1948 and regained again in 1949 when they won their second Intermediate championship. In 1949 the club was fielding two teams at senior and junior level. The senior team won the Corn Ceitin while the junior team reached both league and championship final, losing in both. The club's success resulted in four members of the club being selected to the Dublin panel which won in the Leinster junior hurling championship in 1950. The Junior team won the Junior A league and Smyth cup in 1952. The Senior team reached their first ever Senior hurling championship final having beaten Young Irelands in semi final. They were defeated by St. Vincents. Nine members of the team that had played inter county hurling at some stage with counties Wicklow, Dublin, Clare, Laois, Cork and Waterford. The club reached the semi final of the Senior championship the following year but won the senior league. The junior league won the Miller Shield in 1958. In 1961 the junior team won the championship and the following year they won the intermediate championship. In 1964 the club won Senior League Division 2. The 1960s saw new difficulties facing the club and indeed other Dublin clubs who depended on players from the country resident in Dublin. The advent of the five-day week, the allowing of players resident outside their native county to play with that county, transport out of Dublin becoming more easily available. These and others resulted in the end to the days where people would arrive in Dublin from the country in the summer and not travel home again until Christmas time. The club continued to compete despite these difficulties at senior level and in 1973 were runners up in Senior league Division 2 and promoted to Division 1. The junior team won the Junior A league in 1976. The club embarked on a successful run from 1983-1986 winning the 1983 Intermediate League after a top Four playoff, the Intermediate League in 1984, the Junior League in 1985, an Intermediate league and championship in 1986, Doyle Cup in 1986, the Naas Tournament in 1986 and the Leixlip Tournament in the same year. The club returned to Senior status in 1987 however by 1989 they were reduced to fielding a single team and nearly disbanded. The club dropped down to Junior status winning the Miller shield in 1992 and in 1993 won the Junior League, Junior B championship and retained the Miller Shield. The club continued to experience difficulty in fielding until 1995 when a successful recruitment drive gave them sufficient numbers. The club won the Corn Fag a Bealach in 1996. The club won the Corn Fag a Bealach again and reached the Junior hurling championship final the following year, losing to Setanta of Ballymun. The club celebrated 75 years in existence in 2001. Since 2002 the club has had a golf society. One of the club's players who is from Buenos Aires, Argentina was featured in an article in the Irish Independent called Juan Facundo Contreras. The club were subject of a short documentary by Dutch media students in 2011.

Early evening programming saw DJs introducing their favourite tracks to listeners in a unique mix of chat and music. From 10pm each night the station broadcast live from a different nightclub, using ISDN codec including Heaven (nightclub).

Ecuador, Peru Phylogeny and biogeography Arcytophyllum is a monophyletic genus when A. serpyllaceum is excluded, as this species has been shown to be more closely related to Bouvardia but has not been formally transferred to another genus. The remaining species are most closely related to the North American and Caribbean genus Houstonia (including Stenaria) and one species of the polyphyletic genus Oldenlandia (Oldenlandia microtheca) distributed in Mexico and Central America, indicating that Arcytophyllum may be one of the few cases in the family Rubiaceae of a southward migration to reach the Andes. The center of diversity is in South America; namely in Ecuador, where 10 species are documented. Floral morphology and evolution Flowers of Arcytophyllum are distylous, meaning that two morphs exist differing in the vertical orientation of anthers and stigmas. Pin morphs have stigmas positioned above the anthers, while thrum morphs have stigmas positioned below the anthers. A study of 11 species showed significantly higher seed production in thrum than pin morphs of A. aristatum, A. lavarum, and A. vernicosum, and a similar tendency in all other sampled species. In contrast, pin morphs of A. lavarum cross pollinate more efficiently than thrum morphs, thus transmitting more of their genes to the next generation via pollen than seed. As better exporters of pollen to flowers of the opposite morph, long-styled A. lavarum give rise to disassortative pollen flow and a division in reproductive functions between the morphs. If pollinators promote the condition of distyly and asymmetric pollen flow over evolutionary time, it is plausible that gender specialization will evolve into dioecy.

He was labelled as Melbourne's most improved player and was named as a potential All-Australian. After his direct opponent, Travis Cloke, kicked seven goals in the Queen's Birthday clash, McDonald found himself lose form and he was moved into the forward line to help regain his confidence. He spent the second half of the year playing in both the forward and back line, which drew the praise of both then-senior coach Paul Roos and backline coach, Jade Rawlings, for his versatility. He played every match for the year, which earned him a third-place finish in Melbourne's best and fairest. On the eve of the 2016 season, McDonald was named in Melbourne's leadership group. Due to finish the season out-of- contract, speculation surrounded his season as to whether he would re-sign with the club. He ultimately re-signed with the club in August on a two-year deal, tying him to Melbourne until the end of the 2018 season. The round sixteen match against at TIO Stadium in a thirty-two point win saw McDonald record a career-high thirty-one disposals, ten marks, and six rebound-50s, which earned him the centre half-back position in AFL Media's team of the week. He played his 100th AFL match in the two-point win against Gold Coast at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round nineteen. He played every match during the year and finished sixth in Melbourne's best and fairest count. =2017-Present: Melbourne's key forward, leading goalkicker= Following Max Gawn's early season hamstring injury, McDonald was redeployed as a back-up ruckman to assist the undersized Cameron Pedersen. McDonald also played as a wingman, where he could apply his elite running capacity. Playing in this role, McDonald was awarded three Brownlow votes for amassing 26 disposals, twelve marks and a goal against the Essendon Bombers in round 5. With the loss of key forward Jesse Hogan due to health issues, McDonald was later moved forward during the second half of Melbourne's upset victory against the Adelaide Crows where he kicked two early goals in the third quarter as Melbourne defeated the Crows by 41 points. McDonald's move forward eventuated in a match winning performance against the West Coast Eagles round 14 where McDonald kicked five goals, including the matchwinner; a miraculous snap in the dying seconds as he was tackled by Jeremy McGovern. McDonald finished with 23 goals for the season after kicking eight in total during his previous six seasons at the club, with his contested marking and aerobic capacity demonstrating that he could play as a key forward despite playing as a defender for his career to date. Following his breakout in the forward line during the previous season, it was believed that McDonald would continue in his newfound role while assisting in the ruck when required. However, a niggling toe injury during the following pre-season kept McDonald sidelined for the opening five rounds of the 2018 AFL season, before he finally returned with two goals and 16 disposals in a 36 point win against Essendon. In a six week streak between rounds 6 and 11 where Melbourne won all of their matches, McDonald made a successful and dynamic return to Melbourne's forward half, highlighted by a 24 touch, four goals best on ground performance against the Western Bulldogs in Round 11. During the 2018 Queen's Birthday match, McDonald kicked a career high six goals as Melbourne lost to Collingwood by 42 points. Mid-way through the season, McDonald signed with the Demons for a further four years. By the end of the season, Melbourne qualified for their first finals campaign in 12 years. McDonald played a key role in Melbourne's 33 point Semi- Final win against Hawthorn, kicking a match high four goals as Melbourne triumphed to the tune of 33 points. Following Melbourne's loss to West Coast in the preliminary final the following week, McDonald had amassed a total of 53 goals for the season, the most since any Melbourne player since Brad Green's 55 goal haul in 2010.

In modern Western history, he is the first atheist known by name and in person.W. Schr√∂der, in: Matthias Knutzen, Schriften und Materialien (2010), p.8, calling Knutzen \\"the first author we know of who self-identified as an atheist\\". Cf. also Rececca Moore, The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought (2011), calling Knutzen \\"the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective\\"  Life  Matthias Knutzen was born at Oldenswort (Schleswig-Holstein) early in 1646. His parents were Berend Knutzen, organist in Oldenswort and his wife Elisabeth (Elsebe). In the same year Knutzen was born his father died. As a boy, Knutzen was sent to his brother Johann Knutzen, an organist in K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia, and attended there a secondary school (the Altst√§dtisches Gymnasium) from 1661 to 1664. In 1664, he registered at the university of K√∂nigsberg and in 1668, at the University of Copenhagen to study theology. In between he earned some money as a private tutor. In 1673, he took a position as a village schoolteacher and auxiliary preacher in the Kremper Marsch (Schleswig-Holstein). However, he was dismissed at the end of that very year 1673, because he had sharply criticised the ecclesiastical authorities in his sermons. In February 1674 he went to Rome and September 1674 to Jena (Thuringia). There, Knutzen distributed handwritten pamphlets with atheistic contents. The town and the university of Jena carried out an investigation. In order not to be arrested, Knutzen went first to Coburg and then to Altdorf near Nuremberg. On October 22, 1674, he was last seen in Jena. Then his track is lost. The author Johannes Moller wrote in his biography of North German writers, Cimbria Literata (printed in 1744), that Knutzen had died in an Italian monastery, but that was probably only an invention made up to discredit both Knutzen and the Roman Catholic church.W. Schr√∂der, in: Matthias Knutzen, Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 14  Teachings  In his three pamphlets of 1674 (listed below under 'Writings'), Knutzen claimed that there was a sect or community called the ‚ÄúGewissener‚Äù or ‚ÄúConscientarians‚Äù (i.e. the conscience-people). According to him, the Conscientarians had many members at different places (Hamburg, Jena, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome), allegedly more than 700 at Jena alone. However, this claim is regarded as a disguise and the teachings which Knutzen spread as an alleged member of the Conscientarians were in fact his own. According to Knutzen, there are no transcendent entities such as God, the devil and immortal souls. The Bible is not plausible because of its many contradictions. The guidelines for human behavior should be reason and conscience. Therefore, both secular and ecclesiastical authorities are superfluous. In his Latin letter Amicus Amicis Amica! Knudsen summarizes his beliefs as:W. Schr√∂der, in: Matthias Knutzen, Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 37 > Insuper Deum negamus, Magistratum ex alto despicimus, Templa quoque cum > omnibus Sacerdotibus rejicientes. > Moreover, we deny God, we despise authorities from above and we reject the > churches together with all ministers. The uppermost rule is for Knutzen, ‚ÄúLive honestly, do not harm anybody and give everybody what they deserve‚Äù (in Latin, Honeste vivere, neminem laedere, suum cuique tribuere), an old Roman legal principle according to Ulpian.  Sources and reception  Knutzen was obviously inspired by Socinianism. Other influences (Spinoza?) are hard to tell and disputed. However, it can be shown that Knutzen was well versed in the philosophical literature of his time even when it comes to insignificant details.Schr√∂der, Matthias Knutzen (1998), p. 421 Knutzen‚Äôs views provoked the violent rejection of ecclesiastical authors. E. g. in 1677, the German theologian Tobias Pfanner claimed that Knutzens work surpasses the infamy of all enemies of religion known until then.Schr√∂der, Matthias Knutzen (1998), p. 420 Pierre Bayle included Knutzen in his dictionary Dictionnaire historique et critique (first edition in 1697, further editions throughout the 18th century). Thus, for the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, Knutzen became the first modern atheist known by name.

Whilst not particularly prominent, the hill is historically significant as the site of a medieval castle.  Topography and access  With a height of 225.8 m above sea level (NN), the Meesenkopf is topographically unspectacular for this part of the Wiehen Hills. There are much higher summits in its immediate vicinity, such as the Heidbrink, just under one kilometre away to the south, and the and better-known Reineberg, L√ºbbecke's local hill, which is 300 metres to the east, west of the Ronceva valley. Today the Meseberg has no particular importance for hikers, and on most maps it is not even shown. The hill can be climbed on forest tracks in around 30 minutes, although there is no established way to the summit itself, only a path that a few hikers over the years have beaten, which aids those making for the top.  The Meesenburg  A castle, the Meesenburg, was built on the Meesenkopf, probably by Count Otto I of Tecklenburg (1209‚Äì1263). This Tecklenburg fort was later conquered and destroyed by the Bishop of Minden, Conrad I of R√ºdenberg in a joint military operation with the Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck. The castle on the Meesenkopf is believed to have been subsequently demolished around 1216 at the instigation of Bishop Conrad of Minden. The stone was then used to build St. Andrew's Church, L√ºbbecke, according to a more recent bishop's chronicler. Today only the rampart and ditch of the castle can still be made out.

Early life Vogtherr was born in Dillingen an der Donau, his father Conrad was an eye doctor and surgeon. His brother Georg (1487-1539) preached as a priest and reformer, and his brother Bartholomew (149?-1536) was the Bishop of Augsburg and author of medical books. His son was the painter Heinrich Vogtherr the Younger (1513-1568). Vogtherr's art training seems to have taken place in Augsburg. It is believed that in 1506-1509 he studied under Hans Burgkmair. His years of travel led him to Erfurt and Leipzig. In 1518 he returned to Augsburg and assisted in painting and writing a large part of his work, the doctrine of Martin Luther (\\"The sale of indulgences in a church\\", the \\"dead eaters\\"). Between 1522 and 1525 he lived in Bad Wimpfen to paint frescoes for the parish church on behalf of the Reformation-minded Hans Dietrich von Gemmingen. He also published in the spirit of the Reformation numerous writings and pamphlets like \\"The deified man\\", or \\"The Bom (tree) of faith\\". His most beautiful spiritual song poem \\"Out of the depths I cry to you\\", he handed out there in 1524 as a broadsheet. War In Wimpfen Vogtherr was with the peasant leader Wendel Hipler and also had contact with G√∂tz von Berlichingen, which is how he got involved in the German Peasants' War. As colonel of Hegauer farmers, he was involved in mid 1524 until the end (in July 1525) where they failed siege of cell (Radolfzell) on Lake Constance there. He managed to escape and was several months later safely found in the reformation friendly Strasbourg, where he in 1526 settled with his family. Due to the local religious situation, however, his booking orders for his works had greatly reduced. Later career From the Strasbourg artists of that time actually only Hans Baldung, one of the most important painters of the time of D√ºrer, was considered for any painting jobs (mainly portraits), which is why Vogtherr now found his living mainly in the production of book illustrations. He has worked for almost all of the Strasbourg printers. In 1536 he founded his own printer business in which he printed only his own works, such as \\"Christian Losbuch\\", two \\"Anatomies\\", and the immensely popular, several times reprinted \\"Art Booklet\\", a type specimen book for artisans. Starting in 1538, he began lived for a while in Basel. His family in Strasbourg he would only sporadically see (as of 1542), as if he was forced, for financial reasons, to travel around all the time. So he went to Speyer, Basel, back to Strasbourg, several times to Augsburg and finally to Zurich, where he lived from 1544 to 1546 at Christoph Froschauer's premier printing workshop. For whose workshop he created in this relatively short period, a surprisingly comprehensive and quality- full work, including more than 400 woodcuts for the \\"Swiss chronicle\\" (1547/48) by Johannes Stumpf. Vogtherr's finally had to leave Strasbourg due to the lack of jobs for book illustrations. In 1550, he was summoned to Vienna by Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor (Emperor at that time was still his brother Charles V who abdicated in 1556, the year of Vogtherr's death). Personal life Vogtherr was married three times and father of seven sons and three daughters. He also periodically used the pseudonym \\"Henricus (or Heinrich) Satrapitanus\\", signing works \\"H.P.\\". References * Karl Schorbach: Mr. Vogt, Heinrich. In: General German Biography (ADB).

It is not a zoonosis, meaning that it cannot be transmitted to humans. Symptoms and diagnosis Neurological signs such as ataxia, tremor of the head and neck, drooping wings, weakness, paralysis, exercise intolerance and blindness are seen in chicks less than 3 weeks old. In laying hens the disease causes a temporary reduction in egg production. Antibodies can be detected using an ELISA or virus neutralisation. Definitive diagnosis of the disease is by histopathology or virus isolation.Avian Encephalomyelitis expert reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011. Treatment and control Currently, no treatment is available, but chicks that survive infection are immune. Control is achieved by vaccination of the flock.

In 1833, the Manbhum district was carved out of the Jungle Mahals district, with headquarters at Manbazar. In 1838, the headquarters was transferred to Purulia. After independence, when Manbhum district was a part of Bihar, efforts were made to impose Hindi on the Bengali-speaking majority of the district and it led to the Bengali Language Movement (Manbhum). In 1956, the Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal under the States Reorganization Act and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act 1956. =Red corridor= 106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of the left wing extremism activities, constitutes the Red corridor. In West Bengal, the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor. However, as of July 2016, there had been no reported incidents of Maoist related activities from these districts for the previous 4 years. The CPI (Maoist) extremism affected CD blocks in Purulia district were: Jhalda I, Jhalda II, Arsha, Baghmundi, Balarampur, Barabazar, Manbazar II and Bandwan. Certain reports also included the Manbazar I and Joypur CD blocks and some times indicted the whole of the Purulia district. The Lalgarh movement, which started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area of the Paschim Medinipur district, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed, had also spread over to these areas. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large number of CPI (M) activists were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts ‚Äì Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of the CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and the change of government in West Bengal.

Church Rev. Lloyd Douglas Brown was born December 10, 1907, in Waterford, Ontario, Canada into the home of a Baptist minister, to the daughter of a Baptist minister, James Beach Moore who was the son of a Quaker. He is notable for having migrated theologically from a conservative Baptist tradition to Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, and within that tradition distinguishing himself as a servant of the people even to the point of administering free dental care in the basement of his church. He died May 29, 1964, while serving in Cayuga, Ontario, Canada. L.D. Brown started his theological training at the Toronto Bible College, a conservative Protestant training institution. After graduating from there, he continued in 1931, at Wycliffe College, an evangelical Anglican training institution in Toronto and graduated with a B.A. in 1934. He was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1934 and as a priest June 16, 1935 in the Diocese of Niagara, Ontario. He served as Assistant Rector from 1934-1938 at St. George's Anglican Church, Guelph. On Nov. 1, 1938 he became the Rector of the Anglican churches in Jarvis and Nanticoke, Ontario. From July 15, 1941 to March 15, 1944 he was Rector of St. James Anglican Church, Guelph. \\"The rector of the war years also changed liturgical practices. R.(sic) Douglas Brown, who served from 1941 to 1943, was a handsome, single young man of Baptist background who inadvertently incited the mothers of the parish to try and marry off their eligible daughters. He did a lot of physical work around the church building. Decidedly high church, he told parishioners that he was intent on bringing things down from the mountain. Some were offended by the way he conducted services. Brown later converted to Roman Catholicism.\\"For All Time: a centennial history of St. James the Apostle Anglican Church, Guelph, Ontario. by Terry Crowley published in 1990. March 15, 1944 he received transfer papers to the Diocese of Tennessee and served at the Calvary Episcopal Church in Memphis. He resigned from Calvary Church, Memphis, Tenn. Sept. 1946. He was still listed in the Memphis area throughout 1947, but by June 1948 he was studying at the Roman Catholic Loyola College, Montreal, P.Q. By 1949, he had taken ordination as a Roman Catholic Priest. In that same year, his brother W. Gordon Brown was founding another conservative Baptist seminary in Toronto, Ontario. In June 1950, he was living at St. Thomas More Rectory (R.C.) in Arlington, Virginia. In 1956, he was installed as the Pastor of St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church, Cayuga, Ontario, Canada. \\"Father Brown was a man of vision and also a man who was prepared to take the action to see that it was accomplished. Without a doubt he will always be remembered as the man who brought the long time dream of a separate school to reality. He oversaw the building of St. Stephen's School as well as the Bishop McCarthy School on Highway 56, in Seneca Township. With change always comes uncertainty, and St. Stephen's was to go through a troubled time until the community accepted the change to a two school system. A benevolent person, he often used his own resources to achieve what the parish or diocese could not afford at the time. This included a free dental clinic in the basement of the rectory, as well as major and beautiful changes to the sanctuary and church as a whole. Along with an addition to the sacristy, Italian marble and beautiful art work adom St. Stephen's today. Father Brown also worked hard to increase attendance and return those to the fold who had drifted away. He was a very social person and had many functions like the Open House at the new rectory in September of 1956, as no formal ceremony had been held since its erection. A community- minded priest, he gave land for the new Scout Hall and underwrote the cost of many church, school, and community project. In the midst of his active priesthood, he was diagnosed with cancer and became ill in 1963 and was assisted by Father Cartwright. Father Brown died in 1964 and was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Hamilton. Bronze plaques commemorate this priest and his achievements and are mounted in the entrance to St. Stephen's Church as well as St. Stephen's School.\\" The Story of St. Stephen's Parish, Cayuga, Ontario (Canada).Published in 1997, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary . To meet the needs of the community, Father Brown offered dental services in the basement of St.Stephen's Church rectory. He was not a licensed dentist prior to being a priest. His first cousin was a licensed dentist in Hamilton, Ontario and perhaps he offered training and equipment when L.. Douglas Brown described the need for these services in the community. His dentist chair and dental instruments were donated to Haldimand County Museum & Archives (Cayuga, Ontario) by St. Stephen's in 2006. Father Brown was the maternal nephew of William Henry Moore MP for Stouffville, Ontario from 1930 to 1945. He was a descendant of Samuel Moore, a leader in the Quaker movement in Nova Scotia after the American Revolution, and a descendant of Samuel Moore, a leader in the early settlement of New Jersey in the 1660s.

The majority sugar is maltose. It is less sweet than high- fructose corn syrup and contains little to no fructose. It is sweet enough to be useful as a sweetener in commercial food production, however. To be given the label \\"high\\", the syrup must contain at least 50% maltose. Typically, it contains 40‚Äì50% maltose, though some have as high as 70%. By using Œ≤-amylase or fungal Œ±-amylase, glucose syrups containing over 50% maltose, or even over 70% maltose (extra-high-maltose syrup) can be produced.p. 465 This is possible because these enzymes remove two glucose units, that is, one maltose molecule at a time from the end of the starch molecule. Uses High-maltose corn syrup is used as a substitute for normal glucose syrup in the production of hard candy: at a given moisture level and temperature, a maltose solution has a lower viscosity than a glucose solution, but will still set to a hard product. Maltose is also less humectant than glucose, so that candy produced with high-maltose syrup will not become sticky as easily as candy produced with a standard glucose syrup.p. 81 Since maltose has a low freezing point, HMCS is useful in frozen desserts. It is also used in brewing, because it has a balanced fermentability, can be added at high concentrations to the wort kettle, increasing throughput, and reduces haze caused by varying malt quality. Another of HMCS's uses is to preserve food. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, HMCS preserves food by inhibiting fermentation and bacterial growth. Health effects In recent years, HMCS has seen an increase in use as a food additive due to the negative reputation of HFCS, as well as the absence of fructose, which is the source of the concern about the health effects of high fructose corn syrup. High-maltose syrups produced from corn are gluten-free, but certain syrups produced from wheat or barley may contain small amounts of gluten.

There is also good evidence in this writing (lost, but carefully reconstructed by Daniel Liechty based on Caspar Schwenckfeldt's refutation of it) that Glaidt strongly believed that Christ's Second Coming was to occur in the very near future (this shows the extent of Hans Hut's influence on Glaidt at this time).

History  = 2003‚Äì2006 = Hope Lies Within began originally as A Crimson Victory, a Western Massachusetts garage band formed by original members Mike Hines, Marco Bonilla and Thomas Snyder in 2003. In late 2003 early 2004 Alex Patsenko was added to the band's line up as vocalist and the band was officially renamed Hope Lies Within. After a short stint with Hope Lies Within, Alex went on to further his college education. In 2005 Frank Dixon was brought on as replacement singer for Alex and Kevin Casey joined as a second guitar player. The band began writing what was to be a never released EP for the current line up, however creative differences began to arise with the new members. Kevin Casey was interested in a different path musically and the remaining members were not pleased with Frank Dixon's singing style. James Zabik stepped in as Kevin Casey's replacement. While attending music school, in Holyoke Massachusetts the band's creator Michael Hines met Uriah Rodriguez. Uriah had been studying classical voice but was very much interested in other musical projects. Mike convinced Uriah to join Hope Lies Within as its new vocalist. = 2006‚Äì2008 = Over the next two years the band spent writing new material. The Old material had been scrapped mainly because Uriah is a baritone and most of the music had been written for a tenor, in addition the band's style and influence had begun to change as each member grew musically. The band quickly formed a tight musical bond and friendships grew. Hope Lies Within began recording its first release the 6 song EP \\"The Silent City\\" which was released in 2007. Shortly after tensions began mounting between the band and their ever-absent drummer. Thomas Snyder began to distance himself from Hope Lies Within for his own personal reasons and ultimately left Hope Lies Within. Thomas went to visit family in Florida and decided he was going to stay, he broke the news to Hope Lies Within through email. \\"We were shocked but not surprised. We felt him growing further from us all the time.\\" said Uriah Rodriguez. Damien Tetrault of the band I Am Disaster joined to fill the gap and help keep the band's momentum, while a more permanent replacement could be found. = 2008‚Äì2010 = In late 2008 band members James Zabik and founding member Mike Hines decided to part ways with band. This served to be one of the band's lowest yet defining moments. James cited he was no longer interested in making music and Mike was looking to enter the Christian Music world (Mike went on to form the band Astoria). Left without guitar players Damien was no longer needed and he too parted ways with the band. With just its vocalist and bassist Hope Lies Within stood in ruin. However the two remaining members persisted on. Over the next two years vocalist Uriah Rodriguez and bassist Marco Bonilla set out to replace the lost members of Hope Lies Within. They created open auditions and had seen hundreds of musicians. Hope Lies Within's remaining members were not only looking for replacements, they used this opportunity to strengthen the musicianship of the band. During this time members Jacob Lentner and Bryan Klien had short runs with Hope Lies Within and they served to help bring in its current members. Jacob Lentner was the first guitarist brought on, shortly after Bryan Klein joined on drums. At the time they seemed like great fits however finding a second guitarist was proving to be more difficult. Daniel Nawskon, a good friend of Uriah and Marco, agreed to fill in temporarily but ultimately was convinced to join full-time, however problems began to arise with Bryan and his personal life. Guitarist Dan Nawskon suggestion the band ask a long time personal friend and drummer Steven Padla if he'd be interested in joining Hope Lies Within. Hope Lies Within agreed collectively that letting Bryan move on and bringing in Steve was the best thing for everyone, so the change was made. The band quickly began writing new music however in the summer of 2009 Jake decided he would no longer be available. The band persisted without a second guitarist. Soon after Jake was replaced by now current Band member William Forbes. = 2011 = After finally resolving the line up changes Hope Lies Within began writing and quickly turned out 7 new songs in the process. They began playing again and began recording their first full-length album. = 2012 = In May 2012 Hope Lies Within released its first Full Length Album entitled \\"Hope Lies Within\\". This album features a remake of the classical German piece Der Erlk√∂nig by composer Franz Schubert. In addition the 4th track Blindside features a guest guitar solo by guitarist Oli Herbert of the American heavy metal band All That Remains.  Musical style and influences  Hope Lies Within's genre is largely considered progressive metal or progressive rock, combining elements of metal, classical voice, jazz & R&B.; Hope Lies Within incorporates both singing and screaming vocals in their music.  Der Erlk√∂nig  While studying at the University of Massachusetts Amherst vocalist Uriah Rodriguez was introduced to the famous classical piece Der Erlk√∂nig by composer Franz Schubert. So taken by the composition that Hope Lies Within sought to create a more modern variation of the piece. Released as the 9th and 11th(The English version is unlisted on the CD) tracks on the 2012 release of \\"Hope Lies Within\\", the piece has been completely updated with modern instruments including; guitar, bass and drums, yet maintains the same harmonic progression and much of the same thematic material of the original Franz Schubert piece in both the German version, with original text from the librettist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and an English adaptation of the poem translated and rewritten by Hope Lies Within. In conjunction with the band's musical release, permission was granted to Hope Lies Within by artist Benjamin Zelkowicz to adapt his already released sand art video The ErlKing (animated short) to their musical version of Der Erlk√∂nig.

ATLAS utilises the inherent step-and- terrace structure of the surface as a template for such nanostructures.F. Cuccureddu, V. Usov, S. Murphy, C. O. Coileain, I. V. Shvets, Planar nanowire arrays formed by atomic-terrace low-angle shadowing, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 79, 053907 (2008), The technique involves the low angle incidence of flux material on vicinal substrates. Vicinal substrates are composed of atomic terraces separated by atomic steps. The ATLAS technique allows for the fabrication of well defined planar arrays of plasmonic nanostructures, of dimensions unachievable by lithography. A collimated beam of atoms or molecules is evaporated at an oblique angle to the substrate. This causes the steps to \\"shadow\\" the beam, and the molecules to be adsorbed only on the exposed parts of the steps in direct line of sight of the evaporator. The principal attraction of the technique is its relative simplicity, as it does not involve multiple lithography steps and can be applied to metal, semiconductor or oxide surfaces alike. The technique is a \\"bottom-up\\" approach and allows great control over the separation of nanostructures within the array, as well as their individual widths. The separation is controlled by the size of the atomic terraces of the substrate, which is determined by its miscut from the principal index; and the width of the nanostructures is controlled by the oblique angle of the deposition. ATLAS has been shown to be a very versatile technique, with the growth of metallic, semi-conducting and magnetic nanowires and nanodots demonstrated using a variety of source materials and substrates.Floriano Cuccureddu, Shane Murphy, Igor V. Shvets, Mauro Porcu, H. W. Zandbergen, Plasmon Resonance in Silver Nanoparticles Arrays Grown by Atomic Terrace Low-Angle Shadowing, Nano Lett., 2008, 8 (10), pp 3248‚Äì3256,  Basic Principles  Figure 1. Deposition at a shallow angle on a vicinal surface (a) deposition of nanostructures on the outer step edges; beam at an angle Œ≤ along the \\"downhill\\" direction, (b) substrate is rotated by 180¬∞ and the beam is directed in the \\"uphill\\" direction. Figure 1(a) shows a schematic of the deposition in the \\"downhill\\" direction, that is, from an outer step edge to a lower terrace. The deposition angle Œ≤ between the beam and surface is small (1¬∞-3¬∞) so that some areas of the terraces are exposed to the beam, and others are geometrically shadowed. The deposition angle Œ≤ determines the width of the nanostructures, according to the following relation: : w approx a left( frac{1}{alpha} - frac{1}{alpha + beta} right) where w is the nanostructure width, a is the height of one step, Œ± is the miscut angle and Œ≤ is the deposition angle between the incident beam and the surface (Œ± and Œ≤ are assumed to be small and are measured in radians). Figure 1(b) shows a similar situation, but this time with the substrate rotated by 180¬∞ so that the incident beam is now in the \\"uphill\\" direction, and nearly parallel to the surface. In this case, the step faces provide the bonding sites and the deposited material grows along the steps, similar to the step-flow growth mechanism. In order to grow nanowires with a width of fifteen nanometers or less, the deposition temperature for both orientations should be chosen such that the mean free path of the adatoms on the surface is limited to a few nanometers.  Experimental Development  The ATLAS system was developed within the Applied Physics Group at the School of Physics, Trinity College, Dublin. The experimental procedure is relatively straightforward, when compared to lithography or other approaches, meaning that only standard equipment is needed. The set-up consists of an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (base pressure in the low 10‚àí10 Torr range), with the sample mounted at a large working distance (40-100 cm) from the evaporation source. This large distance provides the high collimation required for the ATLAS technique. The sample itself is mounted on a rotation stage and can be tilted through 200¬∞ with a precision of ¬±0.5¬∞. The substrate can be heated during deposition by either passing direct current through the sample for semiconductors or by driving current through a separate heating foil underneath the substrate for insulating oxides.  Versatility  The capabilities of the system were first tested by growing arrays of 10-30 nm wide metallic nanowires on two types of vicinal substrates, step-bunched Si(111) and Œ±-Al2O3(0001). Deposition of Au and Ag onto these substrates yields arrays of wires with a width and height of 15 nm and 2 nm, and separated by approximately 30 nm. Since its introduction in 2008, ATLAS has been demonstrated as a simple technique to produce nanowires of a variety of materials down to a width of 15 nm and thickness of 2 nm, on several stepped substrates.  Limitations  Although ATLAS is a versatile technique, some limitations do exist. The initial growth of the nanowires is nucleated on certain preferential adsorption sites. This can form epitaxial seeds, which grow independently of each other, until they meet, which forms an overall polycrystalline wire. This polycrystallinity can affect the stability of the wire when exposed to air, and can increase the resistance due to its defective nature. It is an ongoing topic of research to increase the epitaxiality of nanowires by lattice matching, or increasing initial mobility through heating of the substrate. Despite these limitations, ATLAS's results of a 15 nm width is approximately a five-fold reduction in size compared to other shallow-angle techniques.J. Oster, M. Kallmayer, L. Wiehl, H. J.

It is situated between the rivers Zagyva and Galga and is located 9 km from Hatvan.  History  Boldog is inhabited continuously for several millennia. Boldog is situated between the rivers Zagyva and Galga and at the point of intersection of three counties (comitatus), that of Heves, J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok and Pest. The place is rich of historical evidences. In the south of the municipality, the remains of the Devil's Dykes take course, that had been built by the Sarmatians between 324 and 337 and that connects the rivers Danube and Tisza. The villages was mentioned first time in the year 1395 (as Boldogazzonhothvana). The municipality matured continuously: since 1867, vine is cultivated here and also the cultivation of melons became more and more important since that time. Boldog is in terms of keeping traditions, one of the most faithful towns in Heves County. The first book about stitchery in Boldog was published in 1942: it also introduced the white work of Boldog. The costumes of Boldog can be viewed in action yearly on the J√©zus Sz√≠ve B√∫cs√∫ (third Sunday after Pentecost). Several groups have been founded to keep the old songs and customs alive: the Kal√°ris-folk-dance-group, the men's choir of Boldog as well as the women's choir. = Legend about the origin of the name = When in 1552, during the occupation of Hungary through the Ottoman Empire, Turkish troops advanced into the area, the inhabitants of Boldog had to leave the original place Boldog was located at and settled down at the village's present location (then a marsh). According to the legend, the \\"move\\" was done within a single night and the village leader, judge Istv√°n Bonta, bumped his stick into the ground of the marsh island saying: \\"Itt lesz√ºnk mi boldogok!\\" (in English \\"Here we will be happy\\"; the Hungarian word boldog means happy). Actually, the name is probably derived from Nagyboldogasszony ‚Äì a Hungarian name for the Virgin Mary.  Population  In 2001, 96% of the population were Magyars, 4% considered themselves Roma.

History =Roman Era= Where only a small Roman settlement was located at a ford over the Enns, the Legio II Italica built a legion camp around 200AD, after the abandonment of an older site in Albing, during the subsequent 400 years of its occupation as headquarters and next to Virunum (In the area of today's Zollfeld at Maria Saal) and Ovilava (Wels) as administrative center for the Roman province of Noricum. The legionary camp was subsequently also part of the fortifications of the limes and probably from the 3rd to the 5th century continuously occupied with Roman troops. In the north and south-west was an extensive civilian settlement, which was probably raised to the municipality in the early third century and rose to the bishop's seat of the northern Noricum in the 5th century, which was until now only historically demonstrable. Grave fields could also be found at numerous places inside and outside the settlement area. Lauriacum on the Tabula Peutingeriana. In the late period, it became the base for a patrol boat fleet and the production site of a state shield factory. After the abandonment of the border in Noricum and Rhaetia as a result of the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, Lauriacum once again played a historically important role in the evacuation of the Roman population by Severin of Norikum. The bulk of the ancient building fabric fell victim to the extraction of stone material in the Middle Ages and in modern times, various building activities, agricultural use and soil erosion. The best preserved ancient and early medieval testimonies are the remains of their predecessors accessible in the lower church of the today's Basilica of St. Laurence, Lorch. =Middle Ages= Although today part of the city of Enns, the district was in the Middle Ages its own settlement. The town has emerged from the Roman town of Lauriacum, named for St Lawrence. Roman Lauriacum (Lorch) was mentioned in the Vita Sancti Severini and the Lauriacensis scutaria (fabrica).

There Krautwald came into close contact with Caspar Schwenckfeld, personally but also as a scholar and theologian. In particular Krautwald influenced Schwenckfeld's doctrine of the Eucharist. It was unacceptable to Luther, who attacked Krautwald in a pamphlet of 1526. The controversy drew in the Breslau bishop Jakob von Salza, without a resolution in sight.

Six such flag assemblies were planted on the Moon. The nylon flags were hung on telescoping staffs and horizontal bars constructed of one-inch anodized aluminum tubes. The flags were carried on the outside of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), most of them on the descent ladder inside a thermally insulated tubular case to protect them from exhaust gas temperatures calculated to reach . The assembly was designed and supervised by Jack Kinzler, head of technical services at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston, Texas. Six of the flags (including one for Apollo 13 which was not planted on the Moon) were ordered from a government supply catalog and measured ; the last one planted on the Moon was the slightly larger, -wide flag which had hung in the MSC Mission Operations Control Room for most of the Apollo program. Background Richard Nixon during the 1969 inauguration Building on President John F. Kennedy's 1961 plan to land a man on the Moon in the 1960s and bring him safely back to Earth, in January 1969 President Richard Nixon set an international tone for the Apollo program in his inaugural address: This inspired an idea within NASA to have astronauts plant a United Nations flag on the first landing. Top brass at NASA were surveyed, and the overwhelming consensus was to plant an American flag. The American public was canvassed and supported the idea. Deke Slayton was fine with leaving symbolic items on the Moon as long as they did not affect the crew's training schedule and that the items met dimensional and weight requirements. Acting NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine created the Committee on Symbolic Activities for the First Lunar Landing and appointed Willis Shapley as the chair on February 25. Paine instructed the committee to select symbolic activities that would not jeopardize crew safety or interfere with mission objectives; that would \\"signalize the first lunar landing as an historic forward step of all mankind that has been accomplished by the United States\\", and that would not give the impression that the United States was \\"taking possession of the moon\\" in violation of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. The committee was to decide on three things: items to be brought to the Moon and left there, items to be attached to the descent module, and items to be taken to the Moon and back to Earth. For items to be left on the Moon, the committee considered several options, including leaving the UN flag, a United States flag, a set of miniature flags of all nations, and another commemorative marker on the surface. The committee solicited suggestions from the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, the NASA Historical Advisory Committee, the Space Council, and congressional committees. The most common proposal among those solicited was to plant a flag. The committee recommended planting the U.S. flag on the Moon. They also recommended installing a plaque onto the lunar module (LM) descent stage (which would be left on the Moon) bearing the inscription: \\"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\" Some Americans anticipated possible controversy over planting the United States flag on the Moon, since the Outer Space Treaty prohibited territorial claims to any extraterrestrial body. Since it was made clear the United States had no intention of making a territorial claim to the Moon, no serious controversy materialized. Four months after the Apollo 11 landing, the United States Congress passed a bill in November 1969, which was signed into law by President Nixon, stating: Design The first Lunar Flag Assembly, carried on Apollo 11, prior to packing and mounting on the Apollo Lunar Module ladder About three months prior to the July 1969 Apollo 11 mission, Robert Gilruth, director of the MSC and a member of the Committee on Symbolic Activities, still needed to select someone to design the flag assembly. He asked Jack Kinzler, head of technical services at MSC, also known as \\"Mr. Fix It\\", to take on the task. Inspired by the memory of his mother hanging curtains during his childhood, Kinzler came up with the idea of inserting a horizontal pole through a hemmed pocket in the top of the flag to support it. This would make it appear to fly on the airless Moon as it would float in the wind on Earth. He worked out the details over several days, assisted by Deputy Division Chief Dave McCraw. Kinzler also suggested, designed, and oversaw the creation of the commemorative plaques affixed to the Apollo Lunar Modules. Though the flag itself was a simple, government supply nylon flag altered only by sewing the top hem, its packaging, tolerance of environmental conditions, and means of deployment presented minor engineering challenges. The horizontal and vertical poles were each made of one-inch aluminum tubes in two telescoping parts, anodized with a gold color. Due to the limits of the astronauts' spacesuits, the total height of the flagpole was limited to their minimum and maximum reach. The flag cost $5.50 and the tubing cost $75. The assembly had to be designed with the astronauts' physical limitations in mind. Because of their thick spacesuits, the astronauts had limited range of motion and manual dexterity. The flag assembly was designed to work within those limitations. Diagram showing the astronauts' vertical range of motion. The flag assembly was stored immediately behind the left side of the LM ladder. Due to the heat of the exhaust from the descent engine, temperatures were calculated to be for most of the landing, however they would increase to during the final 13 seconds at touchdown. To insulate the flag from these extreme conditions, it had to be packed inside a dual-walled protective shroud consisting of a stainless steel outer case separated from an aluminum layer by Thermoflex insulation, with several layers of Kapton thermal insulation foil between the inner case and the flag. The insulation limited the temperature to which the flag was subjected to . The shroud was estimated to cost several hundred dollars. The flags deployed on the last three landing flights were carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA, an equipment drawer which opened from the side of the Lunar Module) rather than on the ladder. This eliminated the need for the thermal protection shroud. Apollo 12 flag with faulty latch mechanism The complete package needed to be as light as possible so as not to cut into the lunar payload and weighed . Cernan and Schmitt presenting the flag flown on Apollo 17 to Kranz The flag, which had hung in the Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR) in the Mission Control Center through the prior Apollo landings, was flown to the Moon on the final mission, Apollo 17. This flag measured 20% wider and taller than the others requiring a long horizontal pole. Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt carried a second, identical flag to the Moon and back, and presented it to flight controller Gene Kranz after the flight, to replace the one left on the Moon. Flags deployed Harrison Schmitt poses by the American flag deployed on Apollo 17, December 11, 1972. Flags were planted on each Apollo mission that landed on the Moon. Deploying the flag during the Apollo 11 mission proved to be a challenge. Armstrong and Aldrin had trouble inserting the pole into the lunar surface, and only managed to get it about seven inches deep. When they backed away from the flag, it proved it could stand on its own. Scientists discovered later that the lunar dust has a different profile than terrestrial dust. Dust from Earth has rounded edges; dust from the Moon has sharp edges. The sharp edges of the lunar dust make them catch against each other, making it difficult to insert items into them. Buzz Aldrin reported that the Apollo 11 flag, placed about from the centerline of the Eagle landing craft, was blown over by the blast of the rocket exhaust during takeoff. As a result, care was taken by subsequent crews to place the flags at greater distances from the Lunar Module. Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, the crew of Apollo 12, had trouble with the latch mechanism which was supposed to keep the supporting pole horizontal, so the flag they deployed drooped at an angle. In response to this, the assembly was improved to include a double-latch locking mechanism for later missions. The landing of Apollo 13 was aborted due to a major spacecraft malfunction encountered before reaching the Moon. The flag was stored externally in the MESA, and was destroyed with the Lunar Module Aquarius when it reentered the Earth's atmosphere. Because of issues the Apollo 15 crew had deploying experiments, the flag planting happened later in the mission than intended; at the end of the second EVA rather than the first. The LFA was stored in the MESA on the side of the descent stage of the LM. Astronauts David Scott and James Irwin had practiced on Earth how to arrange themselves, the flag, and the Lunar Roving Vehicle around the LM for the best photography. The flag deployed during Apollo 17 has a unique history. It traveled to the Moon and back on Apollo 11, and hung on the wall of Mission Control afterwards. On the first day of the mission, Gene Cernan erected it in Taurus‚ÄìLittrow lunar valley. As he deployed it, Cernan said, \\"This was one of the proudest moments of my life. I guarantee it.\\" Current status Since the nylon flag was purchased from a government catalog, it was not designed to handle the harsh conditions of space. Some experts theorize that the colors of some flags may have turned white due to sunlight and space radiation, or that the fabric might have disintegrated entirely. A review of photographs taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) indicates that flags placed during the Apollo 12, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 missions were still standing as of 2012. Due to the resolution of the LRO cameras, shadows from the fabric of the flag can be seen but the pole cannot, showing that the flags did not disintegrate entirely. A photo review of the Apollo 11 site shows that Aldrin's observation that the flag fell over was likely correct, as no flag was seen in the images. As of 2012, experts were unable to determine if the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 flags were still standing. Conspiracy theories Animation shows no flag movement between two different photos Conspiracy theorists claim that the flag's apparent motion proves the lunar landing videos were shot on a body with an atmosphere. NASA, aware that there is no wind on the Moon, designed a horizontal latching mechanism so the flag would not droop.

He had contact with David Joris, probably before 1525, but his movement was not Anabaptist.Jan Lampo, Eligius Pruystinck, alias Looi de Schaliedekker. Een Antwerps ketter uit de 16de eeuw, December 2011 (in Dutch) In March 1525, Pruystinck visited Melanchthon and Luther in Wittenberg. In a letter he wrote immediately afterwards, Luther warned the Protestant community at Antwerp against him (and \\"blustering and noisy spirits\\" in general) by summarizing Pruystinck's doctrines as: every man possesses faith and the Holy Spirit, where the first is the desire to treat one's neighbor as oneself and the second is human reason and intelligence; all souls enjoy eternal life; only the flesh and not the spirit suffers hell; no sin has been committed when not acting on an evil thought and small children cannot sin.Alastair C. Duke Reformation and revolt in the low countries, A&C; Black, 1990, pp.26-27. These doctrines have been compared to those of the much older Brethren of the Free Spirit and Beghards and the 15th-century Homines Intelligentiae of the Low Countries,Herman Haupt, LO√èSTS, in The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Volume 7, Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1910, p. 14 and Pruystinck's movement was a form of Panentheism. The notion of radicalism was fueled by their rejection of religious marriage, lent, praying and other basic church regulations. Called before the Inquisition of Antwerp in January 1526, Pruystinck and his followers recanted and were sentenced to public penance. They were let free on orders of Mary of Austria, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Despite the recantation, his teaching spread through the Low Countries in the following years. In 1535 he met Christophe H√©rault, a French Lutherian who had fled from Paris to Antwerp and who became a follower. While a pauper himself, his movement attracted many followers amongst merchants, rich citizens and even nobility. Pruystinck's teachings were written down, probably by Dominicus van Oucle, but this writing is lost. On July 14, 1544, H√©rault and Pruystinck were arrested and tortured on accusation of interactions with David Joris and other Anabaptists. Many other Loists were captured, though quite a few managed to escape to England and Germany. In September and October of that year Dominicus van Oucle committed suicide in prison and H√©rault and some other leaders were decapitated. Pruystinck himself was brought back to Antwerp, and after a sentencing on October 24, 1544, he was burned at the stake outside the city. It is unknown if he recanted before he died.

The church was first set up in the Russian Empire, and was later active in both the Soviet Union and Romania. Its founder was Romanian monk Ioan Levizor, known under his monastic name, Inochen»õie. The Inochentists, regarded as heretics by Orthodox denominations, traditionally organized themselves into an underground church, and were once thriving in parts of Bessarabia region. Inochen»õie and his followers were singled out for their alleged preaching of free love and other controversial tenets, but the movement managed to survive Russian persecution and earned a dedicated following, especially among Romanians. It went into decline following its leader's death, and, during World War II, suffered mass deportation to Transnistria. Weakened by Soviet rule, with its anti-religious campaigns and Gulag deportations, it survives in small communities from the general area of Bessarabia‚Äîin Romania, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. History =Beginnings= The roots of Inochentism relate to Russian rule in Bessarabia (the Bessarabia Governorate), when the Russian Orthodox Church was prevalent and official. According to Inochentist tradition, CosƒÉu»õi-born 19-year-old Ioan Levizor was sent by his father to carry some papers to the starosta of the nearby village of Iorjni»õa (now both villages are in Moldova). When he passed the chapel marking the place of an ancient monastery, he is alleged to have heard voices saying \\"Ioan! The time has come! Hurry up!\\" three times and three days later, while passing by the same place, he saw the Mother of God, an appearance which convinced him to become a Russian Orthodox monk at the nearby Monastery of Dobru»ôa.Clay, pp. 251‚Äì252. Levizor spent three years at the monastery, where he acted as a holy fool, pretending to be a madman in order to push the others toward spiritual awakening. According to his hagiography, the other monks disliked him and Levizor suffered from this, finding his comfort in the Holy Mother's supernatural visits. Despite of his unpopularity among the monks, his superior Archimandrite Porfiri entrusted him with the keys of the monastery, a position from which he used to help those in need, including giving monastery property to the nuns of a nearby convent.Clay, p. 252. In 1897, Levizor left the monastery and wandered across the Russian Empire, moving from monastery to monastery, eventually returning to the Bessarabian Noul Neam»õ Monastery, founded by Romanian Orthodox monks from Neam»õ.Clay, p. 253. In 1899, the new Bishop of Kishinev, Yakov, became more open to the use of Romanian language in religious contexts. This allowed the creation of a Moldavian monastery in Balta (now in Ukraine) dedicated to Feodosie Levitzky, a priest known for his philanthropic activities. It was here that Levizor took the monastic name Inochen»õie.Clay, p. 254. With the Holy Synod's approval, in 1909, Inochen»õie moved Feodosie's remains from the cemetery into the church of the monastery. According to hagiographic accounts, a miracle occurred: the \\"pharisees\\" who tormented Feodosie during his life found themselves unable to reach the founder's tomb, and it was only Inochen»õie who was able to get there, for which reason the bishop had to ordain him a priest (a simple deacon, story goes, would have not had the proper authority to accomplish that task). Inochen»õie used his oratory skills to promote the cult of Feodosie. =Inochen»õie's leadership= Inochen»õie of Balta in a contemporary photograph Inochen»õie, a \\"Heavenly Emperor\\", began constructing a \\"New Jerusalem\\" in BaltaSanielevici, p. 105. and, by 1911, became known as a miracle worker.Charles Upson Clark, Bessarabia. Russia and Roumania on the Black Sea: Chapter XI, \\"Russification of the Church\\", University of Washington Electronic Text Archive.Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia and the Politics of Culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford, 2000, pp. 74‚Äì75. The ensuing phenomenon was a mass religious movement of peasants from various parts of Bessarabia, but also from Podolia and Kherson; scholar Charles Upson Clark describes Inochen»õie's Balta as a \\"Moldavian Lourdes\\". The new converts considered Inochen»õie the personification of the Holy Spirit.Walter Kolarz, Religion in the Soviet Union, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1961, pp. 365‚Äì367. The hieromonk was at first encouraged by his monastic superiors, but the Imperial Russian government was alarmed by the political implications and the spread of unorthodox practice, including glossolalia. Officials brought in psychiatrists to investigate the \\"Balta psychosis\\"; their reports had it that Inochentism was either an issue of poor nutrition and lack of education (V. S. Yakovenko) or just charlatanism from its leaders (A. D. Kotsovsky).Clay, pp. 254‚Äì256. When the large crowds of Bessarabian Romanians (Moldavians) who gathered around Inochen»õie's cloister were identified as a threat, in February/March 1912 he was transferred to a monastery north of Saint Petersburg, in Murmansk, Olonets Governorate.Clay, p. 258. The community of Balta continued to thrive even in the absence of their leader and in December 1912, in response to a letter of Inochen»õie,Clay, p. 259. hundreds of Bessarabian peasants sold their belonging to move in with him in Murmansk. On February 5, 1913, the local abbot, Archimandrite Merkuri, called on the authorities to remove Inochen»õie and his disciples from the monastery. Within a few days, the Russian Army arrested Inochen»õie, who was sent to prison in Petrozavodsk, while his followers were sent home in a military convoy. On August 23, 1913, the Holy Synod condemned Inochen»õie, whom they found responsible for \\"spreading demonic and nervous illnesses and even deaths among the people\\". He remained in prison until he repented; on November 26, 1914, he was released under the supervision of the local bishop. He continued to preach, but in May 1915, he was exiled to Solovetsky Monastery, on the White Sea, living in a skete on the remote Anzersky Island. Reportedly, the group preserved a mythical version of these events, which presumes that the church founder died a martyr's death: \\"In 1914, the Russians set fire to New Jerusalem, and Inochen»õie was subject to the most horrifying tortures and torments. For 40 days, he was chained, crowned with thorns and made to sit naked on broken glass. The saint's hair and nails were torn out with pliers; and for the course of seven days his left rib was poked at with a spear. Upon seeing that the Holy Prophet has braved all these torments, they proceeded to bury him in the earth, leaving only his head above ground, and for 33 more days they kept feeding him poison. On the fortieth day of torture and martyrdom, the sun went dark, and the saint rose to heaven.\\" =Soviet takeover and Bessarabian survival= Inochen»õie was however freed following the February Revolution of 1917 and returned to Balta, reunifying the movement which had been divided by schismatic infighting during his absence. Together with several hundreds followers, mainly female and Romanian-speaking, he founded a commune in Ananyiv raion. The commune (named Rai or Raiu, \\"paradise\\"), was reportedly designed by a Bessarabian German, and divided along three streets. It covered some 45 hectares, including a vineyard, orchard and garden, a deep pond used in baptism, a wooden church which could hold 600, a hostel and an inner citadel with a tower.Sanielevici, pp. 108‚Äì111. Also featured was an intricate underground complex of galleries: from it, Inochen»õie would \\"ascend to heaven\\" every evening. These stone \\"caves\\" also held private rooms or prayer cells, and were supposedly the most attractive part of the religious complex.Sanielevici, pp. 109‚Äì110. Inochen»õie died only months later, toward the end of 1917. Sources attest that, around 1918, the commune was in the care of Simeon Levizor (Inochen»õie's brother), assisted in this task by fellow \\"Apostles\\" Iacob of DubƒÉsari and Ivan of CosƒÉu»õi.Sanielevici, p. 110. On September 14, 1920, the monastery was forcefully closed by the Bolsheviks, while Inochen»õie's family and the leaders of the Inochentists being either killed or arrested and tried in Odessa.Clay, p.259 The Rai establishment continued to function in the 1920s, when Ananyiv was included in the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The new Soviet administration tried to transform it into a kolkhoz named \\"From Darkness to Light\\". However, in 1930, the Soviet anti-religious newspaper Bezbozhnik announced that Inochentism had been stamped out of Soviet Moldavia, noting that the sect was still active in Romanian Bessarabia. According to one Romanian account of the mid 1920s, the Inochentists were even making converts in the west and south, among peasants from the \\"Old Kingdom\\".Sanielevici, p. 112. By the 1940s, the estimated total of Romanian Inochentists was 2,000.Deletant, p. 187; Ioanid, p. 293. The surviving Inochentist sections in Soviet lands suffered during the Great Purge: all the Inochentist nuns still living at Rai were put to death by the NKVD. Nicolae Dabija, \\"Katyn-uri basarabene\\", in Literatura »ôi Arta, Nr. 24/2010, p. 1. In Romanian territories, the movement became the subject of renewed media and political interest, while coming into conflict with the prevalent Romanian Orthodox Church. The new keepers of Inochentist doctrines, described as by \\"charlatans\\" by Clark, were self-appointed patriarchs, deemed incarnations of the Holy Spirit or Second Comings of Christ.Sanielevici, pp. 101‚Äì105. The government perceived the movement as \\"harmful\\" for Romanian society and in contradiction with public order, so, in 1925, the Inochentist church was officially banned.TƒÉnase, p. 35. In 1926, a church leader was arrested by Romanian authorities as he tried to set up a new congregation in Bude»ôti. =Romanian state repression= During mid 1930, the surviving branches were investigated by the authorities, who took with them field reporters from Diminea»õa daily. The resulting reports were compiled and analyzed by Romanian scholar and racialist Henric Sanielevici, who focused on their allegations about the Inochentists' sexual promiscuity.Sanielevici, p. 90, 100‚Äì115. At the time, the congregations had resorted to holding mass in Bessarabia's caves, forests and catacombs; from 1928, the church was presided upon by the 35-year-old Neculai BarbƒÉ Ro»ôie (\\"Red Beard\\"), formerly a Gendarme in Cetatea AlbƒÉ County, and two \\"eunuchs\\" (Ion Antiminiuc, Ivan Strugarin). Successive Romanian governments continued to issue anti-sectarian directives targeting the church. One such act, passed in 1937 by the Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu cabinet, prohibited the activities of Inochentists, whom it grouped together with the Old Calendar Orthodox, the Pentecostals, the Nazarenes, the Apostolic Faith Church of God, Jehovah's Witnesses and Bible societies. \\"Interzicerea sectelor »ôi asocia»õiilor religioase\\", in Vestitorul, Nr. 17‚Äì18/1937, p. 165 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library). Official Christian propaganda warned Romanians to shun the dissident preachers, who lacked \\"the godly gift of preaching God's law\\", be they Inochentists, \\"Tudorites\\" or Adventists.Pr. P. M., \\"Pilda talan»õilor\\", in GrƒÉnicerul. Publica»õie LunarƒÉ pentru Educa»õia Osta»ôului GrƒÉnicer, March 1935, p. 37. Interest in the activities of Inochen»õie's followers was kept alive by Romanian writer Sabin Velican, in his 1939 novel PƒÉm√¢nt nou (\\"New Land\\"); it fictionalizes the movement's alleged sexual practices.George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986, p. 928, 1027. Bessarabia's Inochentists fared badly during World War II. In 1941, the region changed hands between a Soviet administration and Nazi-allied Romania. The region's recovery through Romania's participation in Operation Barbarossa was welcomed by Romanian intellectuals. In a special issue of the official literary magazine, Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Orthodox theologian Gala Galaction paid tribute to \\"the Balta movement\\" as a Romanian mystical phenomenon, placing in doubt allegations made about the Inochentists' heretical stances.Gala Galaction, \\"MƒÉnƒÉstiri basarabene\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 8‚Äì9/1941, p. 369. However, in summer 1942, Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave the order that virtually all conscientious objectors belonging to the Inochentist church to be deported to the concentration camps in Transnistria, together with the Bessarabian Jews and nomadic Roma.Deletant, p. 187; Ioanid, pp. 198‚Äì199, 293; Michael Mann, The Dark Side of Democracy. Explaining Ethnic Cleansing, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc., 2006, pp. 305, 316. During the Antonescu years, Romanian Orthodox Church authorities also received help for setting up a special mission to Transnistria, which was designed to target local Inochentist and Baptist communities.Paul A. Shapiro, \\"Faith, Murder, Resurrection. The Iron Guard and the Romanian Orthodox Church\\", in Kevin P. Spicer, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence, and the Holocaust, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2007, p. 159. Some Baptists and Jehovah's Witnesses, taken together with the Inochentists, were deported from other areas to internment sites in Transnistria.Ioanid, pp. 198‚Äì199, 293. At his 1946 trial, Antonescu acknowledged some of these measures: \\"Many Romanians, unfortunately, joined these sects in order to escape the war [...]. What was the spiritual basis of these sects? To avoid taking up arms and fighting. So when we called them up, they refused to lay their hands on a weapon. There was a general revolt, and so I brought in a law introducing the death penalty. I did not apply it. And I succeeded in getting rid of these sects. The more recalcitrant ones I seized and deported.\\"Deletant, p. 73. =Gulag and later revival= 1965 Ukase granting amnesty to Operation North deportees, including the Inochentists. After Bessarabia was again incorporated in the Soviet Union as the Moldavian SSR, the Inochentists gathered their ranks and established a new center in the city of BƒÉl»õi. \\"Misterio»ôii adep»õi ai ieromonahului eretic Inochentie\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ online edition, May 22, 2010; retrieved August 15, 2011. They were accused by the Soviet authorities of sabotaging the state plan for agricultural deliveries and resisting the collectivization of agriculture by withholding grain from the authorities. This was, however, a thing common to the Moldavian peasants of all religions. In a memorandum dated October 17, 1946, B. Kozachenko, the Vice-minister of State Security of the Moldavian SSR, reported that virtually every village in four districts of Bessarabia (BƒÉl»õi, Soroca, Orhei and Chi»ôinƒÉu) each had a group of Inochentists, and that their priests were among the \\"most reactionary and backward\\".Clay, p. 259. This memorandum resulted in a repression of the Inochentists, which started only a few months later. In January 1947, ten Inochenist leaders were sentenced to terms between six and ten years in the \\"corrective labor camps\\".Clay, p. 260. On April 6, 1949, Operation South began, as a mass deportation to Siberia of people (and their families) who were suspected of anti-Soviet feelings. This included 35,000 people, not just wealthy peasants and former landowners, but also members of sects deemed illegal, including Inochentists. Two years later, on March 3, 1951, another wave of deportations began, as Operation North, which also deported all members of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The deportees were allowed to return home only after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin died and Nikita Khrushchev gave his famous De-Stalinization speech of 1956. According to a 1957 report, 150 Inochentists were back in the Moldavian SSR. In April and May 1957, another group of Inochentist leaders were arrested. The main local newspaper, Sovetskaya Moldaviya, ran attacks on the Inochenitists and a negative propaganda film was made in reference to them. The persecutions were intensified during Khrushchev's campaign of religious persecutions, which lasted between 1959 and 1964. By the end of the campaign, 20 illegal churches and all the monasteries that supported to the movement from its very beginning had been closed, all of them in the Moldavian SSR. Internal memos of the Soviet administration show that the campaign was relatively successful: in 1960, a report had it that the number of Inochenitists dropped from 2,000 to just 250. Nevertheless, their religious group survived and the Soviet authorities continued publishing pamphlets even in the 1980s. In 1987, it was reported that an Inochentist community still existed near the ruins of Inochen»õie's monastery in Balta, Ukrainian SSR.Clay, p. 261. Meanwhile, the location where Inochen»õie began his mission had been turned into a gym. Dorin Lozovanu, \\"Balta ‚Äì ora»ôul √Æn care rom√¢nii nu au spus niciodatƒÉ bunƒÉ ziua pe ruse»ôte\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ (ASTRA), Nr. 3/1998. Inside Romania, itself under a communist government from 1948 to 1989, the Inochentists continued to be explicitly banned alongside Jehovah's Witnesses, Bible students and the other groups listed in 1930s bans. The basic legislation was Government Decree 243, passed in September 1948. It resulted in a circular letter of the Internal Affairs Ministry, which included the listed Inochentists and other Orthodox splinter groups among the lesser threats by comparison with foreign-born new religions, and specified of the former: \\"These banned religious associations are intensely active in propagating anarchic ideas which damage public opinion and the security of the State. All those who are suspected of being affiliated with these sects are to be held under continuous supervision, tracked down in all their enterprises, and, once certified, they are to be sent to court.\\" Nicolae Videnie, \\"1948. Tragedia bisericilor din Rom√¢nia. Legisla»õie\\", at the Memoria Digital Library; retrieved August 15, 2011. Although Inochentism was not included among those movements who could seek assistance abroad, and who were therefore listed as especially dangerous, Romanian officials even assumed that the Inochentists were spying for the United States. William Totok, \\"Episcopul, Hitler »ôi Securitatea (I)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 252-253, December 2004. The discrepancies were noted by researcher Nicolae Ioni»õƒÉ, who found that homegrown sects, Inochentism included, were much more exposed to persecution than international churches. Nicolae Ioni»õƒÉ, \\" 'Martorii lui Iehova' √Æn arhivele SecuritƒÉ»õii rom√¢ne ‚Äì problema tolerƒÉrii activitƒÉ»õii cultului\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Nr. 2/2008, p. 201. An Inochentist revival was taking place in the two decades after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the late 1990s, an elderly Inochentist group was still residing in Balta, the \\"New Jerusalem\\" envisioned by Inochen»õie. Another presence was noticed elsewhere in Ukraine's Odessa Oblast. The story was covered in 2010 by Segodnya newspaper, who cited cases of Inochentists who awaited the Second Coming, built at a new subterranean monastery, and vocally demanded that Inochen»õie be recognized a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church (which still refers to them as to a heretic sect). Most adherents, however, are residents of either Romania or the Republic of Moldova‚Äîa few thousands, mostly descendants of 1920s converts. Beliefs =Identity= Inochentism was described by various outside witnesses as appealing only to ignorant and superstitious masses. Dr. V. S. Yakovenko described its adherents as afflicted by \\"abuse of liquor and poor food\\", \\"spiritual darkness\\", and a \\"low level of intellectual and moral development\\", arguing that this degeneration was favored by anti-Moldavian education policies in the Bessarabia Governorate, before 1917. Yakovenko adds: \\"In their ignorance [the Inochentists] are very credulous, and take as gospel all they hear, and particularly what comes to them from the church and in their own language.\\" A similar point was made later by Bessarabian historian Nicolae Popovschi, who mentioned some positive aspects of the movement, while also attributing its success to Bessarabian underdevelopment.Sanielevici, p. 106, 112. However, according to Romanian theologian Lauren»õiu D. TƒÉnase, the ideological source of Inochentism is to be found in the 17th-century Raskol phenomenon, which split Russian Orthodoxy and had a number of ramifications in Romania. TƒÉnase lists Inochentism together with Lipovan Orthodoxy, the Dukhobortsy, the Molokany, the Skoptsy, the Popovtsy and the Bezpopovtsy.TƒÉnase, p. 37. The Inochentists were monarchists: specifically, they supported the Romanov dynasty, even after the Russian Revolution and the union of Bessarabia to Romania, believing that Mikhail Fyodorovich, founder of the dynasty, was really Archangel Michael; the cult of Michael was merged by them with that of the Romanovs. In the 1940s, one preacher, named Ivan Georgitsa (Ion Gheorghi»õƒÉ) was alleged to have spread rumors that Nicholas II of Russia was still alive and that he would soon come to power again. Another incident happened in 1945 or 1946. One sect member, named Romanenko, allegedly posed as the Tsarevich Aleksei and another as the Grand Duchess Anastasia, wearing Imperial garments, as members of the sect fell on their knees in front of them and kissed their hands and feet. Paradoxically, Inochentism had most impact among Romanian-speaking peasants, as noted by Popovschi: \\"Even in cases where a village was inhabited by Romanians and foreigners [...], only the Romanians would adhere to Inochentism. In those Bessarabian counties were the population was of a different nationality, Inochentism found no adherents.\\" The replacement of Slavonic sermons with vernacular speeches gave the movement a boost and formed part of its culture. Ethnographer Dorin Lozovanu assessed that Inochentism itself was a grassroots form of Romanian cultural emancipation, offering a venue for Romanian speakers throughout southwestern Russian and Soviet lands. Lozovanu interviewed old Inochentists in Balta, who spoke the Moldavian dialect and refused to apply for Ukrainian citizenship. =Controversial beliefs= Millenarianism (or apocalypticism) is among the better known aspects of Inochentist teaching: as noted in 1926 by Nicolae Popovschi, Inochen»õie preached an impending arrival of the Antichrist. In 1912, while staying in Murom, the hieromonk allegedly stated that the world would end on April 12, 1913, demanding a ban on marriages and speaking in praise of free love.Sanielevici, p. 106. At Balta, Levizor allegedly kept several mistresses, danced with naked virgins, and invented a ritual for spreading chrism over the genitalia of women disciples.Sanielevici, pp. 106‚Äì108. Alongside spontaneous dancing, Inochentist meetings involved direct revelation and glossolalia.Clay, pp. 254‚Äì256; Sanielevici, p. 108. In Balta, the pilgrims trembled uncontrollably, shook their limbs, groaned, hiccuped, beat themselves and spoke in tongues. Sometimes, this happened even after they returned home and they even spread out to others. Many considered that these were signs sent by God, so that their innocent suffering would redeem the rest of the sinful world and prepare the world for the Kingdom of God. Those affected by them were called \\"martyrs\\" and thought to have supernatural powers, such as clairvoyance and the power to predict the future.Clay, pp. 254‚Äì256. The recourse to mortification is said to have originated during one of Inochen»õie's addresses, when an anonymous believer deliberately injured his own skull‚Äîthe blackened bruise was hailed by the church founder as a sign that a \\"New Man\\" with colored skin was about to emerge in the world.Sanielevici, p. 107. These habits, alongside suspicions that Inochen»õie was a confidence artist, escalated the conflict between Inochentists and the Orthodox Church: various Orthodox missionaries and scholars issued strong warnings against Inochen»õie's dogma. Some grave concerns about Inochentist teachings were raised by the Romanian press in and around 1930. Diminea»õa spoke at length about the movement's approval of mortification and selective castration, Christian communism, nudism, sacred prostitution, group sex and alcohol abuse.Sanielevici, pp. 101‚Äì115. The newspaper also reports that BarbƒÉ Ro»ôie's promotion to the rank of Patriarch was based on his claim to have been visited by the ghost of Inochen»õie, back in 1928.Sanielevici, pp. 104‚Äì105. The Inochentists held special prayer meetings during which they venerated the photograph of Inochen»õie, believing that they would experience miraculous visits of the Holy Spirit.Clay, p. 251. Sanielevici, who credited these reports, noted a resemblance between the Inochentists and earlier sectarian movements in Russia, as depicted by writer Dmitry Merezhkovsky; following up on his own global theory, Sanielevici concluded that all such phenomena originated with an underground \\"Semitic\\" and \\"Dionysian\\" culture.Sanielevici, passim.

She returned to France to learn how to pilot a helicopter, then flew one to Indochina. From 1952-1953, she piloted 129 helicopter missions into the jungle, rescuing 165 soldiers, and on two occasions completed parachute jumps to treat wounded soldiers who needed immediate surgery. One typical mission occurred on 11 December 1951, when casualties were in urgent need of evacuation from Tu Vu on the Black River. The only available helicopter, stationed near Saigon, was dismantled, flown to Hanoi by a Bristol Freighter and reassembled. Captain Andr√© then flew into Tu Vu despite heavy mist and anti-aircraft fire. There, she triaged the casualties, operated on the most pressing cases and then flew the urgent wounded back to Hanoi, two at a time. Later, she was put in command of a casualty evacuation flight.

Nicoladoni in his book Johannes B√ºnderlin von Linz (Berlin, 1893). He thought he had proved some connection between the Waldenses and the Anabaptists in Upper Austria, Life Johannes B√ºnderlin was born in Linz, Upper Austria and studied at the University of Vienna from 1515‚Äì1519 where he learned Hebrew, Greek and Latin, but left without taking a degree as he was unable to afford the tuition. He became a Lutheran preacher in the employ of an Austrian nobleman, but in 1526 received adult baptism as an Anabaptist in Augsburg, where he probably met Hans Denck. From Augsburg B√ºnderlin went first to Nikolsburg where Anabaptist leader Balthasar Hubmaier was arrested and later tortured and burned as a heretic. After two years, the continued persecution of Anabaptists prompted a move to the more free-thinking city of Strasbourg. B√ºnderlin was expelled from the city of Constance in 1530 because of his religious views. Belief B√ºnderlin believed in a two-fold revelation of God, as the living Word in the soul of man, and through external signs and events. He believed that through love, one could realize the inward Word, bring the human will to peace and harmony with God's will and become one with the eternal Spirit. The purpose of religion was to awaken the mind and to direct it to the inward Word. This union with the Spirit, of living upward toward the divine goodness instead of downward toward individual selfhood is an act of free will that results in Salvation.Jones pp 31-39 Works Johannes B√ºnderlin wrote three books: Ein gemayne Berechnung √ºber der Heiligen Schrift Inhalt, etc. (\\"A General Consideration of the Contents of Holy Scripture.\\") Printed in Strasbourg in 1529.

He typically communicates in single words that convey his desires - notably \\"fight,\\" \\"flight,\\" and \\"mate.\\" Teon accompanied the Lights to Tokyo to subdue Zero, whose powers had gone crazy.

He also trains with Hope and the rest of his new team in weapons and tactics. Kavita Rao conducts intelligence tests on Teon and comes to believe that he is of low intelligence.Generation Hope #8 Hope, however, demonstrates that he has normal if not high intelligence if given the correct incentive, but simply lacks the desire to complete his tests. When Hope and the Lights went to retrieve the Sixth Light, Teon (along with Zero) seemed uniquely immune to the infant telepath's abilities, as he is able to move freely about without any protection. Additionally, he is the only one able to convince the infant child, via telepathy, that it should embrace life and be born. Hope touches the newborn child, and is able to suppress its X-Gene until it becomes older. The Lights' celebration is cut short, however, as their liaison Shadowcat reveals that Teon's parents have sued for custody of the boy.Generation Hope vol. 1 #7 While both Cyclops and Evangeline Whedon both initially believe that Teon's case is hopeless, Teon surprises everyone by rushing the stand, and giving an eloquent, well-thought-out speech about how he has changed. He explains that the Teon his parents knew died when his X-Gene was activated, and asks his parents to find solace in the fact that he is now happier with Hope on Utopia than he would be at home. This speech wins Teon the right to stay on Utopia. Later, Zero wonders if Teon truly is happy, or if he is faking it to remain close to Hope.Generation Hope vol. 1 #8 =Schism= As Hope and Gabriel prepare to go on their first date, Teon is initially protective of Hope; she tells him to calm down, implying she can handle herself if Gabriel isn't a perfect gentleman.Generation Hope vol. 1 #10 Powers and abilities Teon has a primal mutation that enhances all of his physical abilities. Teon also possesses a type of \\"hyperinstinct\\" which allows him to process the world in the most efficient manner. He has competently demonstrated that he is fully capable of parsing effectively complex ideas (even being able to appear at a legal hearing and give a dramatic speech about his own personal desires and happiness in an instinctive form of protection when those are both threatened by his being returned to the custody of his parents in his native home country) but he has little to no interest at all in the mannered niceties of polite society.

It is usually around 25 cm long but the maximum length is 45 cm. It is the only member of its genus. Fishery Bonga is caught by inshore small-scale fisheries using seine fishing from a boat or by beach seine. It may also be caught by gill net. Food Bonga is very important in West African coastal and lagoon fishing communities and it is an important food source in West and Central Africa. It is usually smoke-dried for 2 to 5 days, depending on size and on the market. Smoke-drying is done over a fire. The fish is placed on sticks, bars or wire mesh trays about 1 m from the floor. A fire is lit on the floor and the fish is first cooked over a high fire, then the fire is reduced to a smoldering fire which is kept going for as long as necessary. Smoking \\"ovens\\" can be open without walls or closed with walls either in the outside air or inside a smoke house. A hard-smoked bonga can be kept for several months in ambient conditions. Smoke-drying of fish is essentially a drying process to preserve the product in the absence of refrigeration. It is different from fish smoking as it is known in Europe, USA, Canada, etc., where it is applied to impart taste, such as smoked salmon (cold smoked) or smoked eel (hot smoked) which must be stored under refrigeration.

The structure landed among a crowd of spectators, killing seven people and injuring 58 others. The members of Sugarland were in a tour bus preparing to come on stage when the collapse occurred at 8:46 p.m. Opening act Sara Bareilles had completed her performance prior to the incident. Events leading up to the collapse =Discussions about delaying the show= Throughout the day and evening of the concert, the National Weather Service issued notices and warnings predicting strong thunderstorms. Messages about the forecasts were relayed to various State Fair personnel via an automated text-messaging system.Witt Associates. An Independent Assessment of the August 13, 2011 Indiana State Fair Collapse Incident. December 4, 2014. At 8:00 p.m., Cindy Hoye, Executive Director for the Indiana State Fair Commission, held a meeting to discuss what effect the weather forecast would have on the 8:45 p.m. start time for the Sugarland show. Members of the meeting were told that the storm was forecast to arrive at 9:15 p.m., 30 minutes after the concert was to begin. Hoye wanted to delay the show until the weather had passed.Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas, \\"Faulty Planning, Stage Cited in Fair Collapse\\". April 12, 2012. An official took this message to Sugarland's managers, who said they preferred to go on with the show as scheduled and only stop if weather conditions worsened. The managers only knew about the rain, not the lightning, wind, and hail that were expected. They decided to start the show just 5 minutes late (8:50 p.m.) to allow the band time to warm up. When the band's decision got back to Director Hoye, she accepted, assuming the band had the final say. Since the storm was to arrive at around 9:15 p.m., there would still be time for them to perform some of the show. = Evacuation announcement and concert cancellation = At around 8:30 p.m., Director Hoye encountered State Police Captain Brad Weaver. Weaver was concerned that the approaching weather would pose a threat to public safety, and recommended that Hoye cancel the show. He also recommended they put together an evacuation plan for the crowd. Hoye directed her staff to make preparations for an evacuation. At 8:39 p.m., the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning indicating that hail with a diameter of and winds over were expected. This warning was not communicated to Executive Director Hoye or Captain Weaver, who were still anticipating the storm arriving at 9:15 p.m. At 8:40 p.m., Director Hoye dictated a message to an announcer, who delivered it to the audience at 8:45 p.m. The announcer stated that a storm was approaching but that the show would go on. He gave instructions on how to evacuate to the buildings nearby in case conditions got worse, but there was no directive to actually proceed with an evacuation.YouTube: IN St Fair bad weather announcement. The full announcement was as follows: > How are you? As you can see, to the west there are some clouds. We are all > hoping for the best that the weather is going to bypass us but there is a > very good chance that it won't. So just a quick heads up before the show > starts: if there is a point during the show where we have to stop the show > on stage, what we would like have you do is calmly move towards the exits > and then head across the street to either the Champions Pavilion, the Blue > Ribbon Pavilion, or the Pepsi Coliseum. And then once the storm passes and > everything is safe we are going to try our best to come back and resume the > show which we have every belief that that's going to happen. So please get > ready because in just a couple of minutes we are going to try and get > Sugarland on stage. Have a great show. =Collapse= After hearing an announcement that the show was going to continue, Captain Weaver confronted Director Hoye and reiterated that the show should be called off. The two agreed, and began walking to the stage to make a second announcement. However, at 8:46 p.m., a wind gust hit the stage structure. Just when it hit, the stage collapsed‚Äîbefore they were able to announce the evacuation. Tammy Vandam, 42; Glenn Goodrich, 49; Alina BigJohny, 23; and Christina Santiago, 29, all died at the scene. Stagehand Nathan Byrd, age 51; Jennifer Haskell, 22; and Meagan Toothman, 24, later died in the hospital from their injuries. Investigation The Indiana State Fair Commission hired the engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti to lead the technical investigation into why the stage collapsed. The same firm investigated the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and also investigated the Interstate 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis.CNN U.S. \\"New York-based engineering firm to investigate Indiana stage collapse\\". August 16, 2011. In addition, the public safety and crisis management firm Witt Associates was hired to investigate the State Fair's preparedness and response to the incident. James Lee Witt, the company's CEO, was the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the Clinton Administration.State of Indiana, Office of the Governor: press release. \\"Witt Associates hired to review State Fair preparedness and response\\". August 18, 2011. =Cause of the collapse= One of the Jersey barriers used as ballast for the stage roof guy lines after it was pulled down a flight of stairs by the collapsing stage (background). The lack of resistance provided by these barriers was found to be the primary cause of the collapse. According to the final incident report released by Thornton Tomasetti: The concrete barriers used as anchors for the guy lines were not fixed in place; they resisted loading only by friction with the ground and through their own weight‚Äîabout . Just before the collapse, wind loading caused several of the barriers to slide or pivot from their original positions, allowing the top of the truss structure to lean toward the crowd. The subsequent bending forces within the support columns were too large, and the structure collapsed under its own weight. Measurements indicated that the total weight was .25,687 lb (structure self-weight) + 44.33 kips (44,330 lb) (suspended equipment) = 70,017 lb. Thornton Tomasetti report, Appendix D. Multiple components within the lateral load resisting system were found to be insufficient: *Ballast system: The Jersey barriers, as arranged at the time of collapse, could only resist winds ranging from , depending on wind direction; however, the actual wind speed was about . The building code required the structure to withstand winds of . *Guy lines: Even if the ballast had been sufficient, the structure still would have failed, because the synthetic webbing ratchet straps and wire rope used as guy lines would have been loaded beyond their capacity. *Structure connections: The fin plate connections attaching the guy lines to the top of the truss structure also had insufficient strength and would have failed. The separation and billowing of the roof tarp was found not to be a cause of the collapse, because the collapse sequence had already begun before the membrane added additional forces. =Design, construction, and inspection= The report also points out a number of procedural factors that either contributed to the structural problems or prevented them from being discovered: *The catalog provided by the structure manufacturer, James Thomas Engineering, did not contain enough information to properly design the structure. *When the same structure was reviewed by an engineer from James Thomas Engineering in 2010, the analysis was inadequate. *There was no engineering review of the Sugarland rigging plot before it was affixed to the structure. *The installation of the structure deviated from the directions provided in the analysis by the engineer from James Thomas Engineering (in addition to the analysis being inadequate). *There was no engineering review of the structure after it was erected by Mid America Sound Corporation. *The State of Indiana governing code waived important requirements for temporary structures such as the one that collapsed. *The Indiana State Fair Commission staff did not have the appropriate information or knowledge about the structure to evaluate its use during the fair. =Preparedness, communication, and response= Several issues were found with the level of preparedness and the actions of State Fair officials and Sugarland representatives on the evening of the incident that contributed to the number of casualties: *The Indiana State Fair Commission had taken some steps to prepare for an emergency, but the overall state of preparedness was not adequate for an event the size of the Indiana State Fair. *The Indiana State Fair Commission also lacked formal protocols for delaying, postponing, or cancelling a production. As a result, it was not clear who had the authority to make decisions regarding the concert. *Weather forecasts were not properly communicated. *The response to the incident, however, was successful, with all severely injured patients being transported to hospitals within 80 minutes. Legal cases Several lawsuits were filed after the tragedy. In 2014, the largest lawsuit (representing multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants) was settled for $50 million in damages. In the aforementioned lawsuit, the State of Indiana settled for paying $11 million, and the other defendants (including Live Nation and Sugarland) settled for paying the balance of the $50 million award ($39 million). However, defendant ESG Security, Inc. (who lost one of its own in the collapse) denied liability and did not settle. On September 14, 2015, ESG won on summary judgement and was dismissed from the case. ESG was the only defendant dismissed from the case via the summary judgment process.

Symptoms include cutis laxa (loose hanging skin) as well as other eye, musculoskeletal, and neurological abnormalities. It is usually progressive, manifesting side effects that can include clouded corneas, cataracts, short stature, dystonia, or progeria (premature aging). It was first described in 1967 by De Barsy et al. and, as of 2011, there have been 27 cases reported worldwide. The genes that cause De Barsy syndrome have not been identified yet, although several studies have narrowed down the symptoms' cause. A study by Reversade et al. has shown that a mutation in PYCR1, the genetic sequence that codes for mitochondrial enzymes that break down proline, are prevalent in cases of autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL), a condition very similar to De Barsy syndrome. A study by Leao-Teles et al. has shown that De Barsy syndrome may be related to mutations in ATP6V0A2 gene, known as ATP6V0A2-CDG by the new naming system. Alternative names for De Barsy syndrome include corneal clouding-cutis laxa-mental retardation, cutis laxa-growth deficiency syndrome, De Barsy‚ÄìMoens‚ÄìDiercks syndrome, and progeroid syndrome of De Barsy.

From a development team named Coderunners based in Portugal, Interplay released Pinball Yeah! as their first game on iOS, it was also available on the PC, Interplay's main market. Pinball Yeah! features classic forms of pinball as well as new forms in which the player has to fight against AI such as the Kraken and help pirates search for treasure by using a pinball. Interplay re-released the game for the Android in 2011. The game features four pinball tables for the player to play from. The player must fight against an evil virtual AI system that wants nothing more than to see the demise of the players high score. The players can also play classic pinball as well as grab peanuts from the \\"Ye Old Irish Pub\\" to save up on Leprechaun life savings. = Tommy Tronic = Tommy Tronic is Interplay's second game by the Discovery program and was developed by Oasis Games and was the studio's first project. Tommy Tronic is a platformer that was released exclusively for the PC. The game was well received by critics. Tommy Tronic features classic platforming, 12 levels of mayhem in a child's opinion and an innovative new approach to platforming. The player must run away from Giant Carrots and fight mutated tomatoes. The game offers many bonus locations and secret areas for the player to search for as well as a progression system that contains weapons and power-ups. The game's story revolves around Tommy Tronic, a child whose pet dog is stolen by a cruel bully. = Homesteader = Despite being the fourth announced game for the Discovery program, Homesteader is the third game released for the Discovery program. The game is developed by Bogemic Games and is a match-3 puzzle game. The game was released for the PC and the only true issue that was had with the game was a framerate error. The player has to build a farm by matching three items, but not necessarily in a row. The game allows the player to move in eight directions rather than four which allows for more strategies. There are twenty-six levels featured per mission and four difficulty settings and chain reactions which can be turned off to increase difficulty. The game features two distinct modes, Blitz Mode in which players have a whole minute to complete the mission and Alaska Mode in which the players fight against an ever freezing ground. = Death and the Fly = Despite being the third game announced for the Discovery program, Death and the Fly is the fourth game released for the Discovery Program.

Life Folcard, a Fleming by birth, was a monk of St. Bertin's in Flanders (now Northern France), and is supposed to have come over to England in the reign of Edward the Confessor. He entered the monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, and was renowned for his learning, and especially for his knowledge of grammar and music; his manners were affable and his temper cheerful. Soon after the Norman Conquest the king set him over Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire; but he was never strictly abbot, for he did not receive the benediction. After holding the abbey about sixteen years Folcard retired, after a dispute with the Bishop of Lincoln, Remigius de F√©camp; and returned, as may be inferred from Ordericus Vitalis, to his own country. Either while he was a monk at Canterbury, or during his residence at Thorney, which seems more probable, he and his monastery were in some trouble, and were helped by Aldred, Archbishop of York, who persuaded the queen either of the Confessor or of the Conqueror to interest herself in their cause. In return Folcard wrote the Life of Archbishop John of Beverley for Aldred. Works * Vita S.

Life Foley was born at Tralee, co. Kerry, in 1815. His parents were poor people, and he had never worn shoes, when he obtained employment in the shop of Patrick Grey in Tralee. Under the influence of a clergyman in the neighbourhood he left the Roman Catholic church, and was sent to study for ordination in the then established Church of Ireland at Trinity College, Dublin. He was in time ordained, and took the degree of B.D., and obtained the prebend of Kilbragh, in the cathedral of Cashel, and the rectory of Templetuohy. Irish was his native tongue, and in 1849 he was appointed professor of that language in the university of Dublin, and held the office till 1861. While holding this office he wrote a preface to a small Irish grammar by Mr. C.H.H. Wright, and An English-Irish Dictionary, intended for the use of Students of the Irish Language (Dublin 1855). This work was based on a dictionary prepared early in the nineteenth century by Thaddeus Connellan, but published without a date, long kept in sheets, and issued in Dublin from time to time with a variety of false title-pages. Foley altered some of the Irish interpretations, and added a good many words. Many of the Irish words are inventions of his own, as \\"fuam-ainm\\" (sound-name) for onomato-poeia; or paraphrases, as \\"duine\\" (person) for microcosm, \\"eudaigh\\" (clothes) for caparison; or errors due to defective education, as \\"ainis\\" (anise) for caraway. The University of Dublin made a grant towards the publication, but as a dictionary it is of no authority. Foley took an active part in opposition to the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and lectured on the subject in England. He died at Blackrock, near Dublin, 7 July 1874, and was buried in the cemetery of Kill o' the Grange.

Itzam K ºan Ahk II may have fathered the following three kings of Piedras Negras: Yo ºnal Ahk III, Ha º K ºin Xook, and K ºinich Yat Ahk II. Following Itzam K ºan Ahk II's demise, he was succeeded by Yo ºnal Ahk III in 757 AD. Itzam K ºan Ahk II left behind several monuments, including stelae at Piedras Negras and a large mortuary temple now known as Pyramid O-13. In addition, the details of his life and his K ºatun-jubilee were commemorated on Panel 3, raised by K ºinich Yat Ahk II several years following Itzam K ºan Ahk II's death. Biography =Lineage= Itzam K ºan Ahk II, also known as Ruler 4, was born on November 18, 701 AD (9.13.9.14.15 7 Men 18 K ºank ºin in the Long Count). Of the three extant references to Itzam K ºan Ahk's birth, not a single one mentions his line of descent, suggesting that Itzam K ºan Ahk was not K ºinich Yo ºnal Ahk II's son. With this said, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube note that in one carving, the ajaw is shown with a turtle ornament on his belt, suggesting that one of his ancestors had the word auk (\\"turtle\\") in their name and was thus of royal blood.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 147. Additionally, Stela 40 shows what could be Itzam K ºan Ahk's mother in Teotihuacano garb, suggesting that Itzam K ºan Ahk was emphasizing maternal connections to Teotihuacan. Martin and Grube also note that this stela was erected exactly 83 Tzolk ºin, or about 59 years, following the death of Itzam K ºan Ahk I (a former ajaw of Piedras Negras whose Itzam K ºan Ahk II appropriated), which could suggest the existence of some \\"special link\\" between the two.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 148. =Reign= 300px Itzam K ºan Ahk II ascended to power on November 9, 729 AD (9.14.18.3.13 7 Ben 16 K ºank ºin). In 749 AD, the ajaw celebrated his one K ºatun, an event that was attended by many dignitaries, including a b ºaah sajal (\\"first ruler\\") named K ºan Mo º Te º who had served K ºinich Yo ºnal Ahk II. The events of this banquet were later recorded by the final ajaw of Piedras Negras, K ºinich Yat Ahk II on Panel 3; this artifact shows Itzam K ºan Ahk II lecturing the interim ruler of Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II, about Piedras Negras's local dominance. (This panel has lent support to the argument that during Itzam K ºan Ahk II's rule, Piedras Negras had eclipsed Yaxchilan in power.) The K ºatun celebration was followed by another event a few days later, at which Itzam K ºan Ahk II \\"performed a 'descending macaw' dance\\" and then had a drink made from fermented cacao beans passed around to his guests.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 149. Itzam K ºan Ahk II likely engaged in war, as a pyrite disc found in his tomb depicts the severed head of a leader from Hix Witz.Witschey & Brown (2012), p. 247. Houston et al. argue that Hix Witz was under Piedras Negras's control, largely based on the disk and because the Maya center is identified on Panel 7, erected earlier by Itzam K ºan Ahk I, as a \\"tributary bearing plumes and textiles\\" to Piedras Negras.Zender, \\"Hix Witz\\", (n.d.). =Death= Itzam K ºan Ahk II's reign was one marked by \\"hegemony over neighboring kingdoms\\".Fitzsimmons (2010), p. 154. The ruler died on November 26, 757 AD (9.16.6.11.17 7 Kaban 0 Pax) and was buried three days later.Martin & Grube 2000, p. 150. According to Panel 3, the burial took place at the mythical \\"'mountain' of ho janaab witz\\", which in this context referred to Pyramid O-13. Itzam K ºan Ahk II was succeeded by Yo ºnal Ahk III on March 10, 758 AD.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 151. Itzam K ºan Ahk II's burial site was venerated by the succeeding kings of Piedras Negras, which has led some to hypothesize that Itzam K ºan Ahk II produced a new ruling dynasty, and that the following three kings‚ÄîYo ºnal Ahk III, Ha º K ºin Xook, and K ºinich Yat Ahk II‚Äîwere his sons.Pitts (2011), pp. 157‚Äì168.Martin & Grube 2000, 152‚Äì153.Sharer & Traxler (2006), p. 426. Monuments =Stelae= Itzam K ºan Ahk II erected at least five stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40,Zender, \\"Piedras Negras Ruler 4\\", (n.d.). of which Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were raised in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, constructed in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety (meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche) and commemorates Itzam K ºan Ahk II's ascension to power.O'Neil (2014), p. 72.Sharer & Traxler (2006), p. 427. This monument depicts the ajaw flanked by witnesses to the ceremonies explored on the stela itself. The expanse in front of the stone slab \\"designates the space ... as one of offering and supplication\\", given the depiction of human sacrifice near the monument's bottom.O'Neil (2014), p. 76. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was well-preserved (even retaining some of its pigment), although the glyphs on the upper right were weathered. Sometime in the 1960s, looters broke up the fallen monument so they would have an easier time smuggling it out of the site. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH), whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland. Stela 9 had long been broken into thirds when it was discovered in 1899 by Maler. While these fragments had eroded slightly, the base was later found in situ by the University of Pennsylvania's University Museum. In the 1960s, looters carted off parts of the monument, namely a portion depicting a captive. Stela 10 is highly eroded, resulting in a loss of detail. In addition to this decay, the head ornament has presumably been lost.O'Neil (2014), p. 197. Stela 22 was dedicated on the East Group Plaza, located in front of Structure O-12, thereby \\"initiat[ing]\\" the East Group Plaza as a locus for sculpture and stelae.O'Neil (2014), p. 136. While previous stelae had faced other directions, Stela 22 faced northwest towards the site's acropolis, creating \\"a new axis of dialogue across the site.\\" Stela 40 contains the depiction of the aforementioned woman dressed in Teotihuacano garb; it shows Itzam K ºan Ahk II dispersing somethinghypothesized to be either blood or incenseinto a \\"psychoduct\\" (that is, \\"a vent leading into a subplaza tomb\\"). Simon and Grube argue that \\"the connection between the living and the dead is manifested [on this stela] as a 'knotted cord' or breath which travels down to enter the nose of the deceased\\". The female on the stela, denoted only by an \\"upside down vase\\" glyph, is likely Itzam K ºan Ahk II's mother; Pitts argues that the monument \\"offers an interesting vignette of Itzam K ºan Ahk II and his loyalty to a female ancestor, probably his mother.\\"Pitts (2011), p. 121. =Pyramid O-13= There are substantial similarities between Pyramid O-13 and the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque (pictured), seeming to suggest a relationship between the two sites. Pyramid O-13 is the name given to the hypothesized mortuary temple of K ºinich Yat Ahk II.Zender, \\"Piedras Negras Ruler 7\\", (n.d.). According to Stephen Houston et al., it was nearly \\"twice as large\\" as any of Piedras Negras's previous structures.Houston et al. (1998), pp. 40‚Äì56. The pyramid was modified substantially following Itzam K ºan Ahk II's demise: K ºinich Yat Ahk II, for instance, reset the older Panel 2 and installed Panel 1 and the now-famous Panel 3. Megan O'Neil argues that these changes were made in order for the ruling ajaw to \\"engag[e] with the past\\".O'Neil (2014), p. 153. Given that the last known rulers of Piedras Negras erected their stelae on or near this pyramid and all three of these leaders also revered the site as some sort of dynastic shrine, it is possible that they were K ºinich Yat Ahk II's sons. In 1997, H√©ctor Escobedo discovered a tomb (Burial 13) containing the bodies of an adult and two adolescents underneath the plaza floor at the front of the pyramid's frontal stairs. While some believe this to have been the resting place for Itzam K ºan Ahk II, Stephen D. Houston cautions that this has not been conclusively proven.Houston et al. (1999), pp. 16‚Äì22. Among the artifacts found within (including pieces of jade and ornaments), archaeologists uncovered evidence that the tomb had been reentered after it was sealed: many bones were missing from the three bodies, and it appeared that the skeletons had been charred by fire sometime after their initial entombment. Scholars eventually concluded that this apparent desecration was actually part of a ritual described on Panel 3 called el naah umukil (the \\"house-burning at the burial\\"), and that it was carried out by K ºinich Yat Ahk II. In terms of architecture, the O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque are very similar: both have the same number of substructure terraces, both pyramids' substructures have exactly five doors, and both were built into the sides of hills. Damien Marken and Kirk Straight, use this similarity‚Äîas well as inscriptions on stelae at Palenque‚Äîto argue that there existed some sort of relationship between Piedras Negras and Palenque.Marken & Straight (2007), p. 305.

Born in Arcadia, Wisconsin, Erickson used to play baseball with her father, uncles and five brothers at an early age. I had no previous formal or informal training in softball or baseball. Two of my uncles played weekend baseball and I was the tomboy shagging balls in the outfield, she recalled in an interview. Afterward she was allowed to shag balls for a neighboring town team, which drew the attention of the manager, who recommended her to the league. She was invited to a tryout and immediately was assigned to the Racine Belles in the 1948 season, which was already underway. She was used in relief duties and collected a 1‚Äì0 record with a 5.74 earned run average and 11 innings of work in three appearances. Erickson opened 1949 with the Rockford Peaches. She was added to the pitching rotation, becoming the third starter on an excellent staff behind Lois Florreich and Helen Fox. Erickson responded to more mound time with a 17‚Äì6 record and a 1.76 ERA in 216 innings, including seven shutouts, while ranking fourth in the league in wins and winning percentage (.739), gaining selection to the All-Star team.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

In the best-of-five first round, Rockford eliminated the Kenosha Comets in four games, with Erickson winning Game 3 while limiting Kenosha to four hits in an 8‚Äì3 victory. In the final series Rockford claimed his second title in a row, four games to three, over the Fort Wayne Daisies. In Game 2, Erickson limited the Daisies to five hits in a 5‚Äì2 victory, but lost a pitching duel against Maxine Kline in Game 6. Rockford wound up winning last game thanks to a 3‚Äì1 pitching performance by her teammate Fox. It would be the last season for Erickson.

Everything was great, except the bus rides to the four state destinations. I could never sleep on the bus, so those trips got boring after a 126 game schedule ‚Äì all night games, she explained. Lou married Burton Sauer in 1950 and became a housewife. Her husband was a postmaster and they produced a daughter and a son and two grandsons.

The hamlet is located directly south of Timberland, and stretches from Thorpe Tilney on the B1189 eastwards through Thorpe Tilney Fen to Thorpe Tilney Dales beside the River Witham. Thorpe Tilney was a civil parish between 1866 and 1931 when it was abolished to enlarge Timberland. Locale In 1545 three houses in Thorpe Tilney, a possession of the dissolved Kyme Priory, were granted to John Broxholme and John Bellowe. A farm on a slight hill east of the Car Dyke may represent the site, which is known locally as Priory Hill. Evans Farmhouse, originally an inn on the then Billinghay to Metheringham road, is also a listed building, built of red brick and dating from 1782.  Thorpe Tilney Hall  Thorpe Tilney Hall is a Grade II listed red brick country house dating from 1740 with later alterations and additions. Also listed are the Orangery and attached garden dating from 17th Century, and the stable block and cottage dating from 1740. The current Hall replaces an earlier medieval building, the ruin of which was demolished in 1969, which stood away on the site of Hall Farm. This earlier Hall was struck by lightning and destroyed in 1705, and the Orangery and its associated walled garden relate to this earlier building, and are dated c. 1680. The Hall was used by the Whichcote family as a dower house for their main seat, Aswarby Park, the other side of Sleaford, and one of their tombs can be seen in the adjacent Timberland church. The Whichcotes continued to own Thorpe Tilney, with a estate, until 1918, when much of the land was bought by the County Council to provide small-holdings for returning soldiers. Latterly, Thorpe Tilney Hall was owned by the aristocratic Stockdale family who restored the building. Freddie Stockdale was a well regarded opera impresario, in 1977 he oversaw the construction of the Opera Pavilion to a design by Francis Johnson, with stained glass by John Piper in the grounds of the hall. At this time the Hall became well known for operatic performances. Thorpe Tilney Hall was used as a filming location in two separate television productions of Pride and Prejudice, first in 1980 and then in 1995.

It addresses key questions which challenge all entrepreneurs: how much money can and should be raised; when should it be raised and from whom; what is a reasonable valuation of the startup; and how should funding contracts and exit decisions be structured. The problem Depending on the industry and aspirations of the entrepreneur(s) they may need to attract money to fully commercialize their concepts. Thus they must find investors ‚Äì such as their friends and family, a bank, an angel investor, a venture capital fund, a public stock offering or some other source of financing. When dealing with most classic sources of funding, entrepreneurs face numerous challenges: skepticism towards the business and financial plans, requests for large equity stakes, tight control and managerial influence and limited understanding of the characteristic of growth process that start-ups experience. On the other hand, entrepreneurs must understand the four basic problems that can limit investors' willingness to invest capital: * Uncertainty about the future: in terms of start-ups development possibilities, market and industry trends. The greater the uncertainty of a venture or project, the greater the distribution of possible outcomes. * Information gaps: differences in what various players know about a company's investment decisions. * \\"Soft Assets\\": these assets are unique and rarely have markets that allow for the measure of their value. Thus, lenders are less willing to provide credit against such an asset. * Volatility of current market conditions: financial and product markets can change overnight, affecting a venture's current value and its potential profitability. History Venture capital as the business of investing in new or young companies with innovative ideas emerged as a prominent branch of Entrepreneurial finance in the beginning of the 20th century. Wealthy families such as the Vanderbilt family, the Rockefeller family and the Bessemer family began private investing in private companies. One of the first venture capital firms, J.H. Whitney & Company, was founded in 1946 and is still in business today. The formation of the American Research and Development Foundation (ARDC) by General Georges F. Doriot institutionalized venture capital after the Second World War. In 1958, the Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) license enabled finance companies to leverage federal US funds to lend to growing companies. Further regulatory changes in the USA ‚Äìnamely the reduction of capital gains tax and the ERISA pension reforms- boosted venture capital in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, the venture capital industry grew in importance and experienced high volatility in returns. Despite this cyclicality and crisis such as Dot Com; venture capital has consistently performed better than most other financial investments and continues to attract new investors. Sources of entrepreneurial financing =Financial bootstrapping= Financial Bootstrapping is a term used to cover different methods for avoiding using the financial resources of external investors. It involves risks for the founders but allows for more freedom to develop the venture. Different types of financial bootstrapping include Owner financing, Sweat equity, Minimization of accounts payable, joint utilization, minimization of inventory, delaying payment, subsidy finance and personal debt. =External financing= Businesses often need more capital than owners are able to provide. Hence, they source financing from external investors: angel investment, venture capital, as well as with less prevalent crowdfunding, hedge funds, and alternative asset management. While owning equity in a private company may be generally grouped under the term private equity, this term is often used to describe growth, buyout or turnaround investments in traditional sectors and industries. Business angels A business angel is a private investor that invests part of his or her own wealth and time in early-stage innovative companies. It is estimated that angel investment amounts to three times venture capital. Its beginnings can be traced to Frederick Terman, widely credited to be the \\"Father of Silicon Valley\\" (together with William Shockley), who invested $500 to help starting up the venture of Bill Hewlett and Fred Packard. Venture capital Venture capital is a way of corporate financing by which a financial investor takes participation in the capital of a new or young private company in exchange for cash and strategic advice. Venture capital investors look for fast-growing companies with low leverage capacity and high-performing management teams. Their main objective is to make a profit by selling the stake in the company in the medium term. They expect profitability higher than the market to compensate for the increased risk of investing in young ventures. In addition to this, there are also corporate venture capitalists (Corporate venture capital) that strongly focus on strategic benefits.R√∂hm, P., K√∂hn, A., Kuckertz, A. and Dehnen, H. S. (2017) world of difference? The impact of corporate venture capitalists‚Äô investment motivation on startup valuation. Journal of Business Economics. doi:10.1007/s11573-017-0857-5 Key differences between business angels and venture capital: * Own money (BA) vs. other people's money (VC) * Fun + profit vs. profit * Lower vs. higher expected IRR * Very early stage vs. start-up or growth stage * Longer investment period vs. shorter investment horizon Buyouts Buyouts are forms of corporate finance used to change the ownership or the type of ownership of a company through a variety of means. Once the company is private and freed from some of the regulatory and other burdens of being a public company, the central goal of buyout is to discover means to build this value*. This may include refocusing the mission of the company, selling off non-core assets, freshening product lines, streamlining processes and replacing existing management. Companies with steady, large cash flows, established brands and moderated growth are typical targets of buyouts. There are several variations of buyouts: * Leveraged buyout (LBO): a combination of debt and equity financing. The intention is to unlock hidden value through the addition of substantial amounts of debt to the balance sheet of the company. * Management buyout (MBO), Management buy in (MBI) and Buy in management buyout (BIMBO): private equity becomes the sponsor of a management team that has identified a business opportunity with a price well above the team's wealth. The difference is in the position of the purchaser: the management is already working for the company (MBO), the management is new (MBI) or a combination (BIMBO). * Buy and built (B&B;): the acquisition of several small companies with the objective of creating a leader (highly fragmented sectors such as supermarkets, gyms, schools, private hospitals). * Recaps: re-leveraging of a company that has repaid much of its LBO debt. * Secondary Buyout (SBO): sale of LBO-company to another private equity firm. * Public-to-private (P2P, PTOP): takeover of public company that has been 'punished' by the market, i.e. its price does not reflect the true value.  Major entrepreneurial financial planning =Importance= Financial planning allows entrepreneurs to estimate the quantity and the timing of money needed to start their venture and keep it running. The key questions for an Entrepreneur are: * Is it worthy to invest time and money in this business? * What is the cash burn rate? * How to minimize dilution by external investors? * Scenario analysis and contingency plan? A start-up's chief financial officer (CFO) assumes the key role of entrepreneurial financial planning. In contrast to established companies, the start-up CFO takes a more strategic role and focuses on milestones with given cash resources, changes in valuation depending on their fulfilment, risks of not meeting milestones and potential outcomes and alternative strategies. =Determination of the financial need of a start- up= The first step in raising capital is to understand how much capital you need to raise. Successful businesses anticipate their future cash needs, make plans and execute capital acquisition strategies well before they find themselves in a cash crunch. Three axioms guide start-up fund raising: * As businesses grow, they often go through several rounds or stages of financing. These rounds are targeted to specific phases of the company's growth and require different strategies and types of investors. * Raising capital is an ongoing issue for every venture. * Capital acquisition takes time and needs to be planned accordingly. Four critical determinants of the financial need of a venture are generally distinguished: * Determination of projected sales, their growth and the profitability level * Calculation of start-up costs (one-time costs) * Estimation of recurring costs * Projection of working capital (inventory, credit and payment policies. This determines the cash needed to maintain the day-to-day business) Typically, venture capitalists are part of a fund. Their average size in Europe includes five investment professionals and two supports. They generate income through management fees (on average 2.5% annual commission) and carried interest (\\"Carry\\", on average 20‚Äì30% of the profits of the fund). Valuation in entrepreneurial finance Financial planning also helps to determine the value of a venture and serves as an important marketing tool towards prospective investors. Traditional valuation techniques based on accounting, discounting cash flows (Discounted cash flow, DCF) or multiples do not reflect the specific characteristics of a start-up. Instead, the venture capital method, the First Chicago or the fundamental methods are usually applied. =Venture capital method= To determine the future value of a start-up, a venture capital investor is guided by the question: What percentage of the portfolio company should I have at exit to guarantee that I get the IRR committed with my investors? The valuation of the future company can be broken down into four steps: * Determination of company's value at exit * Requested fraction (percentage) of the VC at exit? * Number of shares to be bought in the current round of financing to get the desired percentage of the company * Estimation of maximum price per share willing to pay in current round of financing Usually there is more than one round of financing. Venture capital investors generally prefer staged investments to reduce the money invested at the higher risk and control entrepreneurs via milestones. Entrepreneurs benefit from dilution in future rounds by reducing the price of the shares to be exchanged for financing. University education Entrepreneurial finance courses are offered in different universities, for example at Babson College, the Stern School of Business, the Kellogg School of Management, Peking University HSBC Business School, and ESADE.

He was a Libertarian candidate for Governor of Florida in 2014 and is the former Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Florida. Wyllie is a host of a syndicated AM radio program that focuses on libertarian issues. Wyllie is known as a constitutional activist for challenges to the Real ID Act and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Libertarian Party of Florida Wyllie was elected as Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Florida (LPF) in April 2011, after serving as media director for the 2010 campaign of Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Alexander Snitker. Wyllie did not seek re- election when his term as LPF Chairman ended in 2013, expressing his intention to focus on the Governor's race. Under his leadership, the LPF took a more active role in media relations and activism, and LPF membership increased by over 1,200%. Wyllie was reelected to as Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Florida in June 2015. He resigned in October of same year in opposition to Augustus Sol Invictus's candidacy for U.S. Senate as a Libertarian. Radio program Wyllie partnered with Alexander Snitker in 2010 to form the 1787 Network. Wyllie is co-host and producer of the network‚Äôs flagship program, Liberty Underground, which airs on four AM and one FM radio stations, and can be heard in eight states. Liberty Underground is broadcast on WTAN 1340 AM in Tampa, Florida, on WDCF 1350 in Dade City, Florida, and KLRG 880 AM in Little Rock, Arkansas. Investigative journalism In a series of investigate reports for the 1787 Network, Wyllie was the first to reveal that Florida law enforcement agencies are now using facial recognition scans taken at the time of driver‚Äôs license renewals as a source database for covert video surveillance. In a related investigation, he was the first to report that the Florida Senate had inserted an amendment into a transportation bill that would authorize the introduction of biometric radio frequency identification chips into Florida drivers' licenses. Wyllie also alleged corruption surrounding the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, as well as Florida Senator Charles S. Dean, Sr. and others in a series of articles surrounding the treatment of whistle blower Bob Burton. Burton, who recorded an allegedly incriminating telephone conversation with Dean's chief of staff, had his home raided and his alleged evidence seized by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement after attempting to release the recording and other evidence he had gathered. Burton was later arrested and charged with felony wiretapping. Real ID activism On May 17, 2011, Wyllie surrendered his driver‚Äôs license in protest of the REAL ID Act. He then attempted to be cited for violating the law by contacting all local law enforcement agencies to turn himself in. No agency would respond to his provocation. Two months later, he berated the sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida on his radio program, which resulted in his receiving a citation hours later. On May 9, 2014, Wyllie was arrested after parking his car to attend a charity event at the Safety Harbor Spa and Resort. He was charged for driving a vehicle without a driver's license and his automobile was impounded. After being held for seven hours in a Pinellas County jail, Wyllie was released on his own recognizance. TSA activism On July 4, 2011, Wyllie sent a letter to all of Florida‚Äôs 67 sheriffs urging them to arrest Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents who violate the US and Florida Constitutions, as well as statutes regarding sexual battery as it applies to individual TSA employees during enhanced pat-down procedures. When the sheriffs failed to respond to his letter, he and former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack organized a protest at the Florida Sheriffs Association annual convention in Daytona Beach on July 31, 2011. This prompted the sheriffs to respond with a joint statement contending that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prevented them from enforcing laws against federal authorities. 2014 Florida gubernatorial candidate On October 26, 2012, Wyllie announced the formation of an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian nomination for the 2014 Florida gubernatorial election. On January 10, 2013, he formally declared his candidacy. On April 29, 2014, Wyllie announced that he had been invited to the 2014 Florida Gubernatorial Debate at Broward College on October 15. On June 2, 2014, Adrian Wyllie officially qualified to be included on the 2014 Florida ballot. He was invited to partake in another debate of Florida gubernatorial candidates hosted by Florida Blue Key and local Fox stations to be held at the University of Florida on September 29, 2014. On June 20, 2014, Wyllie was declared the only Libertarian running for Florida Governor in the 2014 election and was listed third on the ballot after the Republican and Democratic nominees. Wyllie received 223,356 votes,http://results.elections.myflorida.com/SummaryRpt.asp?ElectionDate=11/4/2014&Race;=CAB&DATAMODE;= the most of any third party candidate for governor in Florida's history, but placed third in the 2014 general election behind incumbent Republican Rick Scott, who won, and Democrat Charlie Crist.  Fiction Author  In August 2016, Wyllie published his first novel, \\"The Cassandra Trigger.\\" The dystopian thriller tells the story of a working-class American family as they struggle to survive an economic collapse, surveillance society and police state in 2028, and outlines his prediction for the future expansion of privacy infringements and government abuse of power. Personal life Wyllie, a third-generation native of Pinellas County, Florida, has been married since 1991 to Dawn Cieskiewicz Wyllie, and has two sons. He served in the U.S. Army and Florida National Guard, and is president of White Hat Info Tech Corporation.

Skinner was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was born in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency and educated at Oundle School in England. Skinner made his debut for Buckinghamshire against the Kent Second XI in 1927. He played Minor counties cricket on a regular basis up to 1933, even making two first-class appearances for the Minor Counties in 1933, against Oxford University and the touring West Indians. While serving in the Raj in 1935, Skinner made his debut for the Europeans against the Muslims. Early the following year he made his debut for Bengal against Central Provinces and Berar in the Ranji Trophy. He would make 6 further first-class appearances for Bengal, the last of which came against Southern Punjab in 1938/39 Ranji Trophy. In his 7 first-class appearances for the team, he scored 365 runs at an average of 33.18, with high score of 125. This score, which was his only first-class century, came against Nawanagar in the final of the 1936/37 Ranji Trophy. He also took 7 wickets for Bengal, which came at a bowling average of 36.85, with best figures of 3/44. Late 1936 saw him make a further first-class appearance for the Europeans against the Parsees. Skinner next made appearances for Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship in 1938, making 9 appearances in that season. With the start of World War II, he was mentioned in dispatches in the London Gazette in June 1940 as having passed out of the Officers' Training Corps with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. While on active service in the Raj, he later made his final first-class appearance for the Europeans, which came against the Hindus in the 1943/44 Bombay Pentangular Tournament, as well as making his final career first-class appearance for a Services XI against an Indian XI in February 1944. Following the war, he returned to play for Buckinghamshire in 1952, making an appearance each against Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Norfolk. He later died in Kensington, London on 19 January 1997.

He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 758 to 767 AD. Yo ºnal Ahk III ascended to the throne upon the death of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, who may have been Yo ºnal Ahk's father. He was succeeded by his probable brother, Ha º K ºin Xook in around 767 AD. Yo ºnal Ahk III left behind two surviving stelae at Piedras Negras, namely Stelae 14 and 16, the former of which has been called one of the finest niche stelae, according to Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube. Reign Yo ºnal Ahk III, also known as Ruler 5, was likely the son of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, based on Yo ºnal Ahk III's veneratiion of Itzam K ºan Ahk II's mortuary temple. Yo ºnal Ahk III, whose name translates to \\"Black House Great Turtle\\",Witschey & Brown (2012), p. 247. ascended to the throne of Piedras Negras on March 10, 758 AD (9.16.6.17.1 7 Imix 19 Wo in the Long Count), following the death of Itzam K ºan Ahk II. Not much is known about either Yo ºnal Ahk III or his successor Ha º K ºin Xook, which led Flora Clancy to refer to both their reigns as \\"shadowy\\".Clancy (2009), p. 135. James L. Fitzsimmons argues that, politically, Yo ºnal Ahk III was weaker than previous leaders of Piedras Negras, given that the ajaw erected only a handful of monuments and did not enforce his power beyond the existing Piedras Negras hegemony.Fitzsimmons (2010), p. 154. Monuments at El Cayo record that Yo ºnal Ahk III was involved in burial ceremonies for a sajal in 763 AD, although he was not involved in picking the leader's successor. It is also known that during his reign, a k ºini º ajaw (\\"prince\\") of Piedras Negras, T ºul Chiik, was captured by Yaxun B ºalam IV of Yaxchilan; it has been hypothesized that Yo ºnal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and Yax Niil was a tactic to build up a \\"base of support\\" to combat the growing threat that Yaxchilan posed.Zender (n.d.). Yo ºnal Ahk III was succeeded by Ha º K ºin Xook, who was possibly his brother.Sharer & Traxler (2005), p. 428. Monuments Only two monuments that Yo ºnal Ahk III erected survive today: Stelae 14 and 16. The first of these, Stela 14which Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube called the \\"finest of all 'niche' monuments\\"is the king's accession memorial. Raised AD 761, it depicts an effigy of the king in a small hollow (or \\"niche\\") scattering incense. The monument was placed on the lower part of Structure O-13, and according to O'Neil, the stela's \\"form, imagery, and location acknowledged and responded to Structure O-13's participation in the processional circuit\\" of the site.O'Neil (2014), p. 185. The front of the monument features not only the ajaw, but also his mother standing \\"as witness\\" to her son. Her positioning likely suggested that she has just arrived from the West Group Plaza via a sacred route. Stela 14 also includes the names of several sculptors and artists. These names are difficult to translate, since many are unique and not found in any other extant Mayan glyphic texts.Pitts (2011), pp. 146‚Äì153. Stela 16 celebrates the accession of a local sajal (or lesser Maya leader) at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. This stela caused Tatiana Proskouriakoff to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras as this sajal, instead of Ha º K ºin Xook. The uniqueness of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, at the time of Yo ºnal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance \\"within the Piedras Negras hegemony\\".Martin & Grube (2000), p. 151.

St. Andrew's The present-day Evangelical-Lutheran parish church of St. Andrew (St. Andreas) in L√ºbbecke is one of the ancient parishes (Urpfarreien) of the Bishopric of Minden.  Construction history  The originally single-nave, cross-shaped building with a west tower was built, probably from 1160 to 1180, in the Romanesque style. In 1350 it was converted into a Gothic hall church by the addition of two side aisles. This change of style can still be clearly recognised in the interior of the church. As the inscribed stone dating to 1350 states in Latin \\"In the year 1350, when the plague came, when the Geisler was carried out and the Jews were killed, this church was extended.\\" During restoration work in 1959‚Äì62 the remains of wall and ceiling paintings inside the church were uncovered, some of which dated to as early as the 13th century. The church's fittings include a cup-shaped Gothic baptismal font, a lifesize Christ on the cross made around 1200, and an organ casing from 1628, that was modified in 1642. In addition, a large number of epitaphs have been preserved. The tower is almost 70 metres high, making it one of the highest church towers in a town anywhere in Germany.  History  The collegiate church of St. Andrew in L√ºbbecke had been founded as a chapter of St. John (Johanneskapital) at Ahlden on the Aller, before it moved to L√ºbbecke in 1295. In 1280 it was at first moved to Neustadt am R√ºbenberge and in 1295, for security reasons, to L√ºbbecke. The Church of St. Andrew in L√ºbbecke was elevated to a collegiate church. In 1550 the Reformation was introduced at St. Andrew's and the church became a Lutheran parish church. In 1624 there were five Lutheran and a Roman Catholic canon.Westf√§lisches Klosterbuch, Vol. 1, p. 546f. The collegiate chapter was not abolished until 1810 by the French government in Kassel (Kingdom of Westphalia). The stone of the former castle of Meeseburg on the summit of the Meesenkopf in the Wiehen Hills was supposed to have been used to build the church.  Oberbauerschaft dependency  Until the construction of the church in Oberbauerschaft in 1899 the inhabitants of that village, which lies to the south on the other side of the Wiehen ridge, had to make their way to L√ºbbecke if they wished to attend services. A forest track to L√ºbbecke, the Alte Kirchweg (\\"Old Church Way\\") and a separate entrance door on the north side of St Andrew's are witness to this historical situation.Officially, Oberbauerschaft did not become independent of the parish of L√ºbbecke until 1 January 1971. Until then its services were taken by a priest from L√ºbbecke; the building only having the status of a chapel. Since the end of 2008 the tower of the church has been externally lit at night by floodlights.

When twenty-three years old she married George Follows, Quaker, of Castle Donington in Leicestershire, with whom she lived sixty years, and by whom she had two children. When about thirty years of age she received a certificate enabling her to travel as a minister, and visited and preached at the majority of the Quaker meetings in the United Kingdom. Her first sermon was preached in 1748 at Castle Donington, whence she proceeded to London, attending over eighty meetings on her way. She remained in London until the middle of 1749, from which time till 1758 she appears to have done little more than attend to meetings in the neighbourhood of her own residence, and those at Atherstone and Matlock. In 1758 she visited Yorkshire and Lancashire, and in 1760 made an extended tour, which embraced most of the meetings in the western and midland counties, as well as London and Norfolk. During the following year she visited Ireland, where she remained several months, working so arduously as to seriously injure her health. Quakerism was at this time at a low ebb in Ireland, and her letters show that she was greatly dispirited. In 1764 she laboured in Wales, and between that time and 1788 she visited nearly every part of England and Wales, and made several excursions into Scotland. In 1782‚Äì3 she spent several months in ministerial work in Ireland. From 1788 till her death she was almost incapacitated by the infirmities of age; but she was able to make occasional journeys, the last she undertook being in 1795, when seventy-seven years old.

Using skills and technology acquired through early training as a blacksmith, Joyce addresses the environmental, political, and social implications of using iron in his work. Exhibited internationally since the 1980s, his work is included in 30-plus public collections in the U.S. and abroad. Joyce works from studios in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and since 2012, in Brussels, Belgium, producing sculpture, drawings, prints, photographs, and videos that reference themes of iron in the human body, iron in industry, and iron in nature. Early life and career Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1956, the oldest of four siblings, Joyce attributes accompanying his father on summer archeological excavations conducted for the University of Oklahoma in the 1960s as a significant influence toward choosing a life of working with his hands. Joyce stated in a 2008 lecture at the Segal Design Institute at Northwestern University in Chicago: \\"As a pre-teen adolescent, unearthing disparate shards of once complete objects, made from diverse materials, and attempting to visualize the whole form from fragments, has instructed my practice as an artist to the present day.\\" When his family moved to El Rito in Northern New Mexico in 1970, at age 14 Joyce began an informal apprenticeship with neighbor Peter Wells, a letterpress printer and blacksmith. Joyce learned to handset type on foot-operated 19th century printing presses and was taught the rudiments of hand forging while assisting Wells on the restoration of historic printing equipment for the Museum of New Mexico's Print Shop and Bindery. At 16, after three summers of working with Wells, Joyce was offered the blacksmith shop when Wells relocated his printing business, the former Sunflower Press. Joyce quit high school to devote himself full-time to learning the trade and developed a classically oriented curriculum of studying historic ironwork in the storage collections of New Mexico's many museums. He supported himself through a wide range of commissions from farmers, ranchers, builders, architects, designers, and other artists. In 1977 Joyce moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, establishing a larger studio to design and produce contemporary objects for homes, architecture, and public art. He initiated an apprenticeship program in 1979 that offered training to students from the U.S. and abroad. A McCune Foundation grant received in 1996 expanded the program to include \\"at risk\\" middle and high school students, giving New Mexico youth an opportunity to learn metalworking techniques in free, after-school classes. Since Joyce's first lecture on his work at the University of Wisconsin, De Pere in 1982, he has presented at numerous institutions, universities and college campuses throughout the United States and abroad. As an invited U.S. delegate, panelist, and keynote speaker, he has participated in conferences and symposia in Canada, Czech Republic, Belgium, England, Finland, Ireland, Italy, South Africa and Sweden. In 1989, while lecturing at the First International Festival of Iron in Cardiff, Wales, Joyce, along with German artist Achim Kuhn, were given the Highest Honorary Fellowship into the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths with the Addy Taylor Cup. It was the first time the award had been given to a non-British blacksmith since the charter was formed in 1571. Throughout the 1990s, Joyce gradually reduced the number of commissions to focus more exclusively on series of work for galleries, including folded bowls based on formal geometric proportions, wall pieces made from remnant material accumulated from his previous commission works, and sculpture incorporating plaster, books, newspaper, wood and iron. In 1996, eighty works of art were exhibited in a mid-career retrospective, Tom Joyce: Twenty Years, organized by the National Metal Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, the first major survey of the artist's work. In 2001, Joyce began exploratory working relationships with several forging and casting facilities to realize sculpture and drawings on a larger scale. In an ongoing series of work titled Sotto Voce, alluding to the hidden origins of the material he utilizes, Joyce conceptually references the part industrial blacksmiths perform within the current era since the 19th century industrial revolution. Working hands-on in various industrial settings, multi-ton remnants from parts being manufactured for multinational corporations, government agencies, and military forces around the world are forged into sculptures that appear at first as soft as clay. Cutting, folding and eroding the material transforms what were once semi-recognizable shapes, into sculptures that refer to the parent material's current use, wherever it may be employed in the world.

The papyri, containing a number of Greek philosophical texts, come from the only surviving library from antiquity that exists in its entirety.Interview with Daniel Delattre: the Herculaneum scrolls given to Consul Bonaparte (2010), Napoleon.org Most of the works discovered are associated with the Epicurean philosopher and poet Philodemus of Gadara. Discovery Dionysus, Plato, or Poseidon sculpture excavated at the Villa of the Papyri. Map of Villa of the Papyri. Due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, bundles of scrolls were carbonized by the intense heat of the pyroclastic flows. This intense parching took place over an extremely short period of time, in a room deprived of oxygen, resulting in the scrolls' carbonisation into compact and highly fragile blocks. They were then preserved by the layers of cement-like rock. In 1752, workmen of the Bourbon royal family accidentally discovered what is now known as the Villa of the Papyri. There may still be a lower section of the Villa's collection that remains buried. Ethel Ross Barker noted in her 1908 Buried Herculaneum: =Excavations= In the 18th century, the first digs began. The excavation appeared closer to mining projects, as mineshafts were dug, and horizontal subterranean galleries were installed. Workers would place objects in baskets and send them back up. With the backing of Charles III of Spain (1716 ‚Äì 1788), Roque Joaqu√≠n de Alcubierre headed the systematic excavation of Herculaneum with Karl Jakob Weber. Barker noted in her 1908 Buried Herculaneum, \\"By the orders of Francis I land was purchased, and in 1828 excavations were begun in two parts apart, under the direction of the architect. Carlo Bonucci. In the year 1868 still further purchases of land were made, and excavations were carried on in an eastward direction till 1875. The total area now open measures 300 by 150 perches (1510 by 756 metres). The limits of the excavations to the north and east respectively are the modern streets of Vico di Mare and Vico Ferrara. It is here only that any portion of ancient Herculaneum may be seen in the open day.\\" It is uncertain how many papyri were originally found as many of the scrolls were destroyed by workmen or when scholars extracted them from the volcanic tuff. The official list amounts to 1,814 rolls and fragments, of which 1,756 had been discovered by 1855. In the 90s it was reported that the inventory now comprises 1826 papyri,(1986) IV. The Herculaneum Papyri, Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies 33, pp. 36‚Äì45 with more than 340 are almost complete, about 970 are partly decayed and partly decipherable, and more than 500 are merely charred fragments. In 2016, academics asked in an open letter the Italian authorities to consider new excavations, since it is assumed that many more papyri may be buried at the site. =Post-excavation history= In 1802, King Ferdinand IV of Naples offered six rolls to Napoleon Bonaparte in a diplomatic move. In 1803, along with other treasures, the scrolls were transported by Francesco Carelli. Upon receiving the gift, Bonaparte then gave the scrolls to Institut de France under charge of Gaspard Monge and Vivant Denon. In 1810, eighteen unrolled papyri were given to George IV, four of which he presented to the Bodleian Library; the rest are now mainly in the British Library. Unrolling center Since their discovery, previous attempts used rose water, liquid mercury, vegetable gas, sulfuric compounds, papyrus juice, or a mixture of ethanol, glycerin, and warm water, in hopes to make scrolls readable. According to Antonio de Simone and Richard Janko at first the papyri were mistaken for carbonized tree branches, some perhaps were even thrown away or burnt to make heat. Opening a scroll would often damage or destroy the scroll completely. If a scroll had been successfully opened, the original inkexposed to airwould begin to fade. In addition, this form of unrolling often would leave pages stuck together, omitting or destroying additional information. With X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), no ink can be seen as carbon-based ink is not visible on carbonized papyrus. =Early attempts= Abbot Piaggio machine was used to unroll scrolls as early as 1756 in the Vatican Library. Following the discovery of the Herculaneum papyri in 1752, per the advice from Bernardo Tanucci, King Charles VII of Naples established a commission to study them. Possibly the first attempts to read the scrolls were done by the artist Camillo Paderni who was in charge of recovered items. Paderni used the method of slicing scrolls in half, copying readable text, by removing papyri layers. This transcription procedure was used for hundreds of scrolls, and in the process destroyed them. In 1756, Abbot Piaggio, conserver of ancient manuscripts in the Vatican Library, used a machine he also invented, to unroll the first scroll, which took four years (millimeters per day). The results were then swiftly copied (since the writing rapidly disappeared: see below), reviewed by Hellenist academics, and then corrected once more, if necessary, by the unrolling/copying team. In 1802, King Ferdinand IV of Naples appointed Rev. John Hayter to assist the process. From 1802 to 1806, Hayter unrolled and partly deciphered some 200 papyri. These copies are held in the Bodleian Library, where they are known as the \\"Oxford Facsimiles of the Herculaneum Papyri\\". In January 1816, Pierre-Claude Molard and Raoul Rochette led an attempt to unroll one papyrus with a replica of Abbot Piaggio's machine. However, the entire scroll was destroyed without any information being obtained. From 1819 until 1820, Humphry Davy was commissioned by the Prince Regent George IV to work on the Herculaneum papyri. Although it is considered that he had only limited success, Davy's chemical method, using chlorine managed to partially unroll 23 manuscripts.Page 203 of In 1877, a papyrus was taken to a laboratory in the Louvre. An attempt to unravel it was made with a \\"small mill\\", but it was unsuccessful and was partially destroyed, leaving only a quarter intact. By the middle of the 20th century, only 585 rolls or fragments had been completely unrolled, and 209 unrolled in part. Of the unrolled papyri, about 200 had been deciphered and published, and about 150 only deciphered. =Modern attempts= A copy of identifiable text of papyrus 152-157 The bulk of the preserved manuscripts are housed in the Office of Herculaneum papyri in National Library of Naples. In 1969, Marcello Gigante founded the creation of the International Center for the Study of the Herculaneum Papyri (Centro Internazionale per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi; CISPE).CISPE Il Centro Internazionale per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi With the intention of working toward the resumption of the excavation of the Villa of the Papyri, and promoting the renewal of studies of the Herculaneum texts, the institution began a new method of unrolling. Using the 'Oslo' method, the CISPE team separated individual layers of the papyri. One of the scrolls exploded into 300 parts, and another did similarly but to a lesser extent. Since 1999, the papyri have been digitized by applying multi-spectral imaging (MSI) techniques. International experts and prominent scholars participated in the project. On 4 June 2011 it was announced that the task of digitizing 1,600 Herculaneum papyri had been completed.Digitization of Herculaneum Papyri Completed Insights 22/6 (2002) Maxwell Institute, Brigham Young U.BYU Herculaneum Project Honored with Mommsen Prize Insights 30/1 (2010) Maxwell Institute, Brigham Young U. Since 2007, a team working with Institut de Papyrologie and a group of scientists from Kentucky have been using x-rays and nuclear magnetic resonance to analyze the artifacts. In 2009, the Institut de France in conjunction with the French National Center for Scientific Research imaged two intact Herculaneum papyri using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to reveal the interior structures of the scrolls.W. Brent Seales, James Griffioen, Ryan Baumann, Matthew Field (2011) ANALYSIS OF HERCULANEUM PAPYRI WITH X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY Center for Visualization & Virtual Environments; U. Kentucky The team heading the project estimated that if the scrolls were fully unwound it would be between long. The internal structure of the rolls was revealed to be extremely compact and convoluted, defeating the automatic unwrapping computer algorithms that the team had developed. Manual examination of small segments of the internal structure of the rolls proved more successful, unveiling the individual fibres of the papyrus. Unfortunately, no ink could be seen on the small samples imaged, because carbon-based inks are not visible on the carbonized scrolls. However, some scrolls were written with ink containing lead. =Virtual unrolling= According to Bukreeva et al. 2016, \\"The procedure of virtual unrolling can be divided into three main steps: volumetric scanning, segmentation, layered texture generation and restoration.\\" Seales et al. 2005 and 2013 developed promising software that integrates functions of flattening and unrolling based on mass-spring surface simulations. Samko et al. 2014 proposed algorithms to solve problems of touching points between adjacent sheet layers.

X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) can reveal various letters hidden inside the precious papyri without unrolling them. [...] This pioneering research opens up new prospects not only for the many papyri still unopened, but also for others that have not yet been discovered, perhaps including a second library of Latin papyri at a lower, as yet unexcavated level of the Villa.\\" The microscopic relief of letters ‚Äì a tenth of a millimetre ‚Äì on the papyri seems to be enough to create a noticeable phase contrast with the XPCT scans. This team was even able to identify some writing on a still-rolled scroll. With the aim of making these scans cogent, a team is working with the National Science Foundation and Google to develop software which can sort through these displaced letters and figure out where they are located on the scroll. Following the pioneering results of Dr. Mocella et al., in 2016 another team led by Dr. G. Ranocchia and Dr. A. Cedola announced encouraging results by means of the non-destructive Synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) technique. In September 2016, a method pioneered by University of Kentucky computer scientist W. Brent Seales was successfully used to unlock the text of a charred parchment from Israel, the En-Gedi Scroll. According to experts, this new method devised by Seales may make it possible to read the carbonized scrolls from Herculaneum. The virtual unwrapping process begins with using a volumetric scan to scan the damaged scroll. These scans are non-invasive, and generate a 3D mapping which differentiates between the ink and the paper. The virtual unwrapping process is independent of which type of volumetric scan is used, which allows scientists to test out different scanning methods to find which distinguishes ink from paper best and which easily accommodates scanning upgrades. The only data needed for the virtual unwrapping process is this volumetric scan, so after this point the scroll was safely returned to its protective archive. In the case of the Herculaneum papyri, the volumetric scan used X-ray phase- contrast tomography, which proved most beneficial for the study of ancient papyri in a feasibility test conducted in 2015. This method of volumetric scanning is most beneficial for the Herculaneum papyri because these papyri have carbon-based ink, which will have the same material characteristics as the carbon-based papyrus. This makes it difficult to image using many of the traditional imaging techniques, which often use differences in the light absorption/emission characteristics of different materials to create these volumetric scans. XPCT, on the other hand, examines the phase of x-ray radiation after it emerges from the scroll to determine its composition. Because the ink is raised relative to the papyrus, the radiation will be traveling in the material of the scroll slightly longer when it passes through a spot with ink than when it passes through a spot with a blank space. This means that when the radiation emerges from the paper, its phase will be slightly different than that of the empty space, allowing researchers to distinguish ink-covered spots from blank spots. While this technique does allow researchers to visualize places with ink, it is much less clear than techniques such as CT scans which distinguish between different materials because slight changes (thinner ink, thicker papyrus, folds in the papyrus) all contribute to noise in the volumetric scan. The volumetric scan allows the computer to associate the composition of the scroll with corresponding positions, called voxels or volume-pixels. The goal of the virtual unwrapping process is to determine the layered structure of the scroll and try to peel back each layer while keeping track of which voxel is being peeled and what composition it corresponds to. By transforming the voxels from a 3D volumetric scan to a 2D image, the writing on this inside is revealed to the viewer. This process happens in three steps: segmentation, texturing and flattening. Segmentation The first stage of the virtual unwrapping process, segmentation, involves identifying geometric models for the structures within the virtual scan of the scroll. Because of the extensive damage, the parchment has become deformed and no longer has a clearly cylindrical geometry. Instead, some portions may look planar, some conical, some triangular, etc. Therefore, the most efficient way to assign a geometry to the layer is to do so in a piecewise fashion. Rather than modeling the complex geometry of the entire layer of the scroll, the piecewise model breaks each layer into more regular shapes that are easy to work with. This makes it easy to virtually lift off each piece of the layer one at a time. Because each voxel is ordered, peeling off each layer will preserve the continuity of the scroll structure. Texturing The second stage, texturing, focuses on identifying intensity values that correspond with each voxel using texture mapping. From the volumetric scan, each voxel has a corresponding composition. After virtually peeling off the layers during the segmentation process, the texturing step matches the voxels of each geometric piece to their corresponding compositions so that an observer is able to see the text written on each piece. In ideal cases, the scanned volume will match perfectly with the surface of each geometric piece and yield perfectly rendered text, but there are often small errors in the segmentation process that generate noise in the texturing process. Because of this, the texturing process usually includes nearest-neighbor interpolation texture filtering to reduce the noise and sharpen the lettering. Flattening After segmentation and texturing, each piece of the virtually deconstructed scroll is ordered and has its corresponding text visualized on its surface. This is, in practice, enough to ‚Äòread‚Äô the inside of the scroll, but for the arts and antiquities world, it is often best to convert this to a 2D flat image to demonstrate what the scroll‚Äôs parchment would have looked like if they could physically unravel without damage. This requires the virtual unwrapping process to include a step that converts the curved 3D geometric pieces into flat 2D planes. To do so, the virtual unwrapping models the points on the surface of each 3D piece as masses connected by springs where the springs will come to rest only when the 3D pieces are perfectly flat. This technique is inspired by the mass-spring systems traditionally used to model deformation. After segmenting, textualizing, and flattening the scroll to obtain 2D text fragments, the last step is a merge step meant to reconcile each individual segment to visualize the unwrapped parchment as a whole. This involves two parts: texture merging and mesh merging. Texture Merging Texture merging aligns the textures from each segment to create a composite. This process is fast and gives feedback on the quality of the segmentation and alignment of each piece. While this is good enough to create a basic image of what the scroll looks like, there are some distortions which arise because each segment is individually flattened. Therefore, this is the first step in the merging process, used to check if the segmentation, texturing, and flattening processes were done correctly, but does not produce a final result. Mesh Merging Mesh merging is more precise and is the final step in visualizing the unwrapped scroll. This type of merging recombines each point on the surface of each segment with the corresponding point on its neighbor segment to remove the distortions due to individual flattening. This step also re-flattens and re- textures the image to create the final visualization of the unwrapped scroll, and is computationally expensive compared to the texture merging process detailed above. Using each of these steps, the computer is able to transform the voxels from the 3D volumetric scan and their corresponding density brightnesses to a 2D virtually unwrapped image of the text inside. These techniques, while successful at isolating the layers of the papyri, had difficulty detecting text clearly due to the complex geometry of the sheets, such as the criss-cross structure of the papyrus fibres and the sheets, pleats, holes, tears, and contamination from the extensive damage. One potential source of error might be the 3D volumetric scan itself or the flattening procedure used to read it since the algorithms are not able to perfectly prevent distortions in the reading of these papyri. Seales presented in 2018 readability of parts of a Herculaneum papyri (P.Herc. 118) from the Bodleian Libraries, at Oxford University, which was given by the King Ferdinand of Naples to the Prince of Wales in 1810. The imaging method Seales used involved a hand-held 3-D scanner called an Artec Space Spider. The same year he demonstrated readability success of another Herculaneum scroll, with help of the particle accelerator Diamond Light Source, through a powerful x-rays imaging technique, letter ink which contains trace amounts of lead were detected. This technique could possibly open the door in reading the remaining unopened 500 Herculaneum scrolls. Prior to this he demonstrated successful virtual unrolling without detecting ink on Herculaneum scrolls. Significance A papyrus copy depicting the Epicurean tetrapharmakos in Philodemus' Adversus Sophistas ‚Äì (P.Herc.1005), col. 5 Until the middle of the 18th century, the only papyri known were a few survivals from medieval times.Frederic G. Kenyon, Palaeography of Greek papyri (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1899), p. 3. Most likely, these rolls would never have survived the Mediterranean climate and would have crumbled or been lost. Indeed, all these rolls have come from the only surviving library from antiquity that exists in its entirety. These papyri contain a large number of Greek philosophical texts. Large parts of Books XIV, XV, XXV, and XXVIII of the magnum opus of Epicurus, On Nature and works by early followers of Epicurus are also represented among the papyri. Of the rolls, 44 have been identified as the work of Philodemus of Gadara, an Epicurean philosopher and poet. The manuscript \\"PHerc.Paris.2\\" contains part of Philodemus' On Vices and Virtues. The Stoic philosopher Chrysippus is attested to have written over 700 works,Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, vii. 180 all of them lost, with the exception of a few fragments quoted by other authors.John Sellars, Stoicism. University of California Press, 2007. - p. 8 Segments of his works On Providence and Logical Questions were found among the papyri; a third work of his may have been recovered from the charred rolls.\\"The first of Chrysippus' partially preserved two or three works is his Logical Questions, contained in PHerc. 307 ... The second work is his On Providence, preserved in PHerc 1038 and 1421 ... A third work, most likely by Chrysippus is preserved in PHerc. 1020,\\" Parts of a poem on the Battle of Actium have also survived in the library.Gregory Hays, \\"Keeping Things Platonic: A new discovery of a possible lost book by Apuleius on Plato\\" [review of Justin A Stover, A New Work by Apuleius], Times Literary Supplement 20 May 2016 p. 29.

It was a single-engined biplane intended to meet a requirement for a night reconnaissance aircraft for the Imperial Japanese Navy, but was not selected for production, the single prototype being converted to a transport and operated as the Navy Type 94 Transport. Design and development In 1934, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a specification for a night reconnaissance aircraft, intended to shadow enemy ships at night, allowing submarines to be directed to their targets, and in a surface action, to spot for the guns of the fleet. This concept had been tested with the Aichi Experimental 6-Shi Night Reconnaissance Flying boat, which had proved unsuitable for service use. The aircraft was required to have good endurance and slow speed stability to help its crews in flying long missions at night, while it also needed to be suitable for catapulting from warships.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 138. Contracts were awarded to both Aichi and Kawanishi to design and build prototypes to meet the requirement. Kawanishi's design, with the company designation Kawanishi Type T was a single-engined tractor configuration biplane of all- metal construction. Its single-bay wings, which folded backwards for storage on ship, were based on those of the Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance floatplane, while the Nakajima Kotobuki radial engine was mounted forward of the top wing. The stressed-skin hull held a crew of three, with pilot and co-pilot sitting in an enclosed cockpit, while the gunner/observer sat in the nose, armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 138‚Äì139. Operational history The Type T made its maiden flight on 10 September 1934. Testing proved unsuccessful, with water handling problems and poor stability in the air, and the Navy considered it unsuitable for the night reconnaissance role, instead ordering the competing Aichi design into production as the E10A. Kawanishi converted the Type T to a utility transport, fitting it with a retractable beaching gear, and as such it entered service with the Navy as the Navy Type 94 Transport, but no production followed. Specifications (Type 94 Transport) See also Notes * In the Japanese Navy designation system, specifications were given a Shi number based on the year of the Emperor's reign it was issued.

It also freed the Assyrians to turn their attention to conquering their westerly neighbor and former overlord the Mitanni. The Hittite succession He would no doubt have been aware of the Battle of Kadesh, in 1274, the dramatic climax of the Hittite conflict with Egypt and probably the largest chariot battle ever fought. The Hittite king Muwatalli II died around 1272 and was succeeded by his son, Ur·∏´i-Te≈°≈°up, who took the name Mursili III, and reigned for seven years.Apology of ·∏™attu≈°ili III ¬ß11, ‚ÄúI submitted for seven years‚Äù. But he found himself increasingly at odds with his uncle, ·∏™attu≈°ili III, the heroic general of Kadesh, who eventually overthrew him.

First, ·∏™attu≈°ili demanded the handover of the fugitive. Then he sought support from Kada≈°man-Turgu complaining of the pharaoh's lack of complicity. Kada≈°man-Turgu was apparently sympathetic and willing to recognize the usurper as Hatti's legitimate king, motivated perhaps more by the need for a strong alliance with the Hittites to counter the threat of the Assyrians and maintain the uneasy peace. He promised to provide ·∏™attu≈°ili with military support in any conflict with Egypt and ‚Äúkept the messenger of the king of Egypt at bay‚Äù, i.e. terminated diplomatic links. According to ·∏™attu≈°ili, they agreed that ‚Äúthe survivor shall protect the children of the one who goes first to his fate‚Äù. Relations must have warmed for at least a short time, before Kada≈°man-Turgu died, because ·∏™attu≈°ili records in a letter to Kada≈°man-Enlil that his father loaned to the Hittite the services of a sculptor, who was subsequently returned. He had earlier loaned a physician named Rab√¢-≈°a-Marduk and an exorcist to ·∏™attu≈°ili‚Äôs brother Muwatalli II (\\"as for the exorcist about whom my brother wrote me, saying 'the exorcist whom my brother wrote me has arrived [‚Ä¶] and has begun the ritual'‚ÄùKada≈°man-Turgu letter to ·∏™attu≈°ili III (tablet Bo 6358 / KUB 3:71 / CTH 174) (Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin)) but these experts were never returned (\\"perhaps the exorcist has died\\").6 CAD ≈†/III, 250b Domestic affairs His construction efforts are witnessed at the E‚Äôigi-kalama ziggurat of the tutelary deity Lugalmarada, in the city of Marad, and also in the ziggurat area at Nippur.

The title to real estate pledged as security to debt valued in copper, rather than the gold or silver citations of the period, reflects a later era after 1175 BC, when the trade routes for these precious metals had been compromised and supports doubts about its authenticity.

Writings on Reich Wilhelm Reich had quit lecturing on medical psychology at the New School for Social Research, after having been invited to teach there in 1939. Brady was curious about his orgone accumulator and its purported ability to concentrate orgone energy. In 1947 Brady approached Reich for an interview at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. She intended to gain evidence to portray Reich as a conductor of a confidence trick, but did not get any special information from her visit. Shortly thereafter Brady wrote two articles arguing that Reich was engaged in dangerous behavior. In her first article, she wrote that he engaged in a Bohemian lifestyle. In her second article, she attributed to Reich the claim that orgone accumulators increase orgastic potency. Brady wrote: \\"Orgone, named after the sexual orgasm, is, according to Reich, a cosmic energy. It is, in fact, the cosmic energy. Reich has not only discovered it; he has seen it, demonstrated it and named a town-- Orgonon, Maine--after it. Here he builds accumulators of it, which are rented out to patients, who presumably derive 'orgastic potency' from it.\\" Brady argued that the \\"growing Reich cult\\" had to be dealt with.Sharaf, Myron (1994). Fury on Earth: A Biography of Wilhelm Reich. Da Capo Press, p. 361. Reich came to believe that Brady was a Stalinist acting under orders from the Communist Party, a \\"communist sniper,\\" as Reich called her.Sharaf, p.367. The article's reception contributed to a downturn of Reich's reputation which ultimately led to his conviction and imprisonment. Personal life She was married to Robert A.

Both creations are extinct. The Pryse Baronetcy, of Gogarthen (or Gogerddan) in the County of Cardigan, was created in the Baronetage of England on 9 August 1641 for Richard Pryse, subsequently Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Richard, the second Baronet, who also represented Cardiganshire in Parliament. Both he and his younger brother and successor, Sir Thomas, the third Baronet, died childless. Sir Thomas was succeeded by his nephew, Sir Carbery, the fourth Baronet, the son of Carbery Pryse, third and youngest son of the fourth Baronet. Sir Carbery also sat as Member of Parliament for Cardiganshire. The title became extinct when he died without issue in 1694. The Pryse estates eventually devolved on his kinsman Edward Pryse and then on Lewis Pryse, Member of Parliament for both Cardiganshire and Cardigan. Lewis Pryse had no sons and the estates devolved on his cousin Thomas Pryse, Member of Parliament for Cardigan in the 1740s. Thomas Pryse's son John Pryse represented both Cardiganshire and Merionethshire in Parliament. John Pryse died unmarried in 1774 and his cousin Lewis Pryse (1716‚Äì1779), son of Walter Pryse, of Painswick, Gloucestershire, succeeded to the Pryse estates. Lewis Pryse's only son Lewis Pryse died unmarried in 1776 and the latter's sister Margaret Pryse became heir of her father. She was the wife of Edward Loveden, of Buscot Park, Berkshire. Margaret predeceased her father and her son Pryse Loveden succeeded to the family estates on her grandfather's death in 1798, assuming the surname of Pryse in lieu of his patronymic. Pryse Pryse was Member of Parliament for Cardigan from 1832 to 1849. His son and namesake Pryse Pryse also represented Cardigan in Parliament. The baronetcy of Gogarthen was revived in 1866 in favour of the latter's son Pryse Pryse (see the 1866 creation below). The Pryse, later Webley-Parry-Pryse, later Pryse-Saunders, later Saunders-Pryse Baronetcy, of Gogardden in the County of Cardigan, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 July 1866 for Pryse Pryse (see the 1641 creation above for earlier history of the family). The second Baronet assumed the surname Webley-Parry-Pryse. The third Baronet used the surname Pryse only. The fourth Baronet assumed the surname Pryse-Saunders. The fifth Baronet assumed in 1949 the surname Saunders-Pryse. The title became extinct on his death in 1962.

According to TICA's official standard for the Minuet, these breeds represent the only permissible outcrosses one may use to create the Napoleon.TICA Minuet Standard TICA Minuet Standard This includes the combinations Minuet √ó Minuet, Minuet √ó Munchkin, and Minuet √ó one of the Persian-type breeds (including Persians, Himalayans and Exotic Shorthairs). Napoleons come in both long-haired and short-haired varieties.  Origin  The breed was created by Joseph B. Smith, a Basset Hound breeder and American Kennel Club (AKC) judge. He was inspired by the Wall Street Journal's front-page feature of the Munchkin on June 12, 1995. He was a fan of the Munchkin, but felt that the unavoidable long-legged versions were indistinguishable from similar mixed breeds commonly seen in animal shelters. Smith decided that something had to be done to create a cat unique in both short- and long-legged versions, something that looked purebred. He chose the Persian breed group as an outcross to the Munchkin for two reasons: beauty and boning. The original Napoleon standard was written with this in mind. In January 2015, TICA's board of directors voted to change the name of the breed to the Minuet. The breed group is still recognized as the Napoleon by the Cat Fanciers Federation. It is not currently recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association, American Cat Fanciers Association, or F√©d√©ration Internationale F√©line.  Description  The Napoleon inherited its distinctively short legs from the Munchkin, which, in that breed, were caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation. The short legs do not hinder the cat's agility. They are able to run, jump, and play easily. From the Persian group (including Persians, Exotic Shorthairs and Himalayans) the Napoleon has inherited its round face, eyes, dense coat and substantial boning. The boning provides a good support system for its uniquely short legs. The Napoleon is not merely a short-legged Persian nor a hairy Munchkin. It is a unique combination of these two groups, making it easily distinguishable from any other breed of cat. Care The Napoleon/Minuet has very few health issues. Because of the incorporation of the Persian bloodline, which has a high incidence of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), breeding stock are tested for it. Napoleons cats are bred specifically away from other common Persian cat problem, such as epiphora (excessive formation of tears), stenosis (narrowing and blockage) of nasolacrimal ducts, flattened facial features, and coats prone to matting. Napoleons/Minuets can still be prone to breathing problems and infections when exposed to feline coronavirus or herpes. They can also develop health issues like arthritis at a young age due to munchkin genetics, some developing arthritis as young as 5 years old. This can cause grooming to become difficult, so make sure to regularly brush your minuet. https://www.ufaw.org.uk/cats/munchkin-limb-deformity See also * List of cat breeds * List of experimental cat breeds * Bambino (cat) * Minskin  References  Cat breeds Cat breeds and types with short legs ","title":"Minuet cat"},{"id":"32745080","text":"Parinati (English: The Inevitable) is a 1989 Hindi film directed by Prakash Jha.\\"Retrospective of Prakash Jha movies in Fiji this week\\", Indian Express, 16 August 2010 The film is based on a short story written by Vijaydan Detha Awards * Silver Lotus - Best Costume Design - 1989 (National Award) * Presented as An Outstanding Film at the London Film Festival, 1989.

During the Second World War, the bookstore was used to clandestinely print and publish works of poetry and other literature. In the series De Vijf Ponden Pers, which Balkema started in 1942, fifty works were published during the war, including works by Dutch poets like A. Roland Holst and Martinus Nijhoff as well as books in English and French, languages banned by the German occupiers. The prominent typographer Jan van Krimpen handled many of these publications. In 1945 Balkema published a catalogue of the series under the name Catalogus van vijftig boeken en boekjes zonder toestemming uitgeven in de jaren 1942-1945 (\\"Catalogue of fifty books published without permission in the years 1942-1945\\").Hanli Deysel, \\"AA Balkema ‚Äì seminal publisher at the Cape of books on South African architecture\\", Artefacts.co.za\\"UB Amsterdam verwerft archivalia van boekhandel/uitgeverij A.A.

That same year, he published his first book in South Africa, Vyjtig Gedigte by the South African poet C. Louis Leipoldt. Balkema quickly established his name by publishing specialist books which had often been refused by the more established publishing houses. These included such works as the Hertzog Prize- winning Die Vrou op die Skuit by Elise Muller (1957). Before long, many South African writers began to approach Balkema of their accord to request that he publish their work. These included Jan Rabie whose Ons, die afgod was the first Afrikaans-language anti-apartheid novel, evoking much criticism and controversy when it was published in 1958. Balkema's status was definitely established when he was asked to handle the official publication of the Daghregisters (journals) of Jan van Riebeeck in 1952. Balkema was known for the high quality of the books published by him, in particular the typography and design. He was one of the first South African publishers to switch to an IBM typewriter for typesetting. He also introduced non-justified text to the country. His perhaps greatest contribution was to Afrikaans-language nonfiction. A large number of books on South African nature, architecture, culture, and history were authored and published on his initiative, and are still considered standard works in their respective fields. He also published English-language literature and academic books and journals. = Later years= In the 1960s, Balkema decided to end his career as a publisher. During a visit to his family in the Netherlands in 1986, he fell severely ill. He and his wife Annie decided to settle in the Netherlands, where they remained until their deaths, hers in 1994 and his in 1996.

It was built in 1905, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. This home was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Register on June 19, 1996. Description =Jesse Knight= Perhaps the wealthiest man in Provo at the time, Jesse Knight was born in 1845 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Jesse's family migrated west, and reached Utah in 1850. Eighteen years later Jesse married a woman by the name of Amanda McEwan, and soon began a ranch in Payson, Utah. Following an impression that he had, Jesse began a mining operation in the Eureka area and became rich. He subsequently bought other mines, founded a bank, purchased real estate in Provo, bought the Provo Woolen Mills, and started farming and cattle interests in Canada. Throughout all of these efforts Jesse remained an active supporter of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his mines were called the ‚Äúcleanest mining camps in the west (Utah State Historical Society p. 2).‚Äù Jesse Knight died in 1921, designating much of his amassed fortune to BYU and various other institutions. =Structure= Two and a half stories tall, the Jesse Knight home was built in the Colonial Revival Style. Possessing a symmetrical facade, the detailing of the home exhibits ‚ÄúA broad entablature with a boxed cornice with egg and dart ornament and dentils on the frieze, swan‚Äôs neck pedimented dormers, Ionic capitals on quoins that are meant to resemble pilasters, pilasters on the corners of the dormers and flanking the first floor windows, and the Ionic columns (Utah State Historical Society p. 2).‚Äù =The Victorian Mansions of Provo= Built between the years 1893 and 1908 in Provo, Utah, this group of Victorian mansions are historically significant and represent not only fine architecture but some of the most successful men of the city and state at the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight-Allen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. All of these homes derive from the high style: Eastlake, Shingle, Craftsman, Italianate, Classical, Moorish, Colonial, and Romanesque. Made primarily of brick, these homes exhibit the finest architecture and most ornate detailing to be found in the city of Provo. =Jesse Knight and the Tintic Mining Industry= The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at $5 million. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon- free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the U.S. His strict adherence to doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made the town one inhabited primarily by members of that Church. Jesse Knight was able to expand farther than the tintic mines, reaching to the power plant in Santaquin, the Tintic drain tunnel project, the Knight Dry farm, and the smelters at Silver City. The Bonneville Mining company, the Knight Woolen Mills, Ellison Ranching Company, The American-Columbian Corporation, The Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company, The Spring Canyon Coal Company, Utah Savings Bank, The Layton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company all represent facets of the Knight Investment Company. The architects Walter E. Ware and Alberto O. Treganza either separately or together were engaged in the construction of the Jesse Knight House. =Preservation= The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as part of a multiple property submission that nominated seven and listed six Provo houses. The listed houses are the Knight-Mangum House, the John R. Twelves House, this, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Allen House, the William H. Ray House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House.

Biography  The daughter of a lawyer, during her adolescence Augspurg worked in her father's law office until she reached the age of majority. In Berlin she completed a teachers training course for teaching at Women's colleges and also took acting classes in parallel. From 1881 to 1882 she was an apprentice to the Meiningen Ensemble, and took part in concert tours across Germany, the Netherlands and Lithuania. Her maternal grandmother, who died in 1887, left her a considerable inheritance, which made her financially independent. Augspurg and her feminist associates \\"Verein f√ºr Frauenstimmrecht\\": Anita Augspurg, Marie Stritt, Lily von Gizycki, Minna Cauer and friend Sophia Goudstikker, Photographed at the Elvira Studio, Munich in 1896 \\"The woman and the state\\" a monthly magazine released by Dr. Anita Augsprung After a five-year career as an actress, she went with her friend Sophia Goudstikker to Munich, where in 1887 they jointly opened a photography studio, the Hofatelier Elvira. The two women wore short hair, unconventional clothing, and frequently made public their support for the struggle for the liberation of women and their free lifestyle. Because of that unusual lifestyle, Augspurg was exposed to personal attacks by anti-feminists far more than were other personalities of the women's movement. Nonetheless, her contacts made through the stage and the studio quickly made her well-known, and she eventually had the Bavarian royal family as a customer. By 1890 Augspurg was deeply involved in the German women's movement and practised as a public speaker. Her commitment to women's rights led her to decide, after several years of successful work, to study for a law degree. She went to the University of Zurich, Switzerland, because women in Germany still did not have equal access to universities. Alongside Rosa Luxemburg, with whom she had a turbulent relationship, she was one of the founders of the International Female Students Association (Internationaler Studentinnenverein). She completed her studies with a doctorate in 1897, the first doctor of law of the German Empire. However, she could not practise as a lawyer, since women were not yet allowed to do so. Lida Gustava Heymann. Meanwhile, in 1895 Augspurg had begun to collaborate with the newspaper Die Frauenbewegung (\\"The Women's Movement\\"), writing articles denouncing the discrimination to which she was subjected in social legislation, describing in particular marriage as a form of legalised prostitution. In 1896 she participated in the International Conference of Women held in Berlin, where she met the radical feminist Lida Gustava Heymann, who became her companion for the remainder of her life.

Bottom left: Unidentified, Anna Bugge (Sweden), Anna Howard Shaw (USA), Millicent Fawcett (Presiding, England), Carrie Chapman Catt (USA), F. M. Qvam (Norway), Anita Augspurg (Germany). At the turn of the century, Augspurg campaigned for women's rights in the German Civil Code: she brought together her political friends, Minna Cauer and Marie Raschke, producing petitions on the new marriage and family law, which was only partially effective. Augspurg published a sensational \\"Open Letter\\" in 1905, in which she appealed for change to the then prevailing patriarchal marriage law to enable entry into \\"free marriage\\", in defiance of state-approved marriage. This was interpreted as a call to boycott marriage and brought a storm of indignation. During this time, following the radical split from the conservative women's organisations, many women considered radical women's suffrage as a priority. Augspurg and her partner Lida Gustava Heymann worked together on the board of the Association of Progressive Women's Organizations. They formed an association for women's suffrage in Hamburg (1902) and in Bavaria (1913). From 1907 Augspurg contributed to Zeitschrift f√ºr Frauenstimmrecht, and was represented in 1919 in the magazine Die Frau im Staat, in which feminist, radical democratic and pacifist positions were published.

Louise Keilhau - Norway During the First World War Augspurg and Heymann held illegal gatherings in their Munich apartment. They participated in the International Congress of Women in The Hague, Netherlands, in April 1915, which led to the founding in 1919 of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (IFFF), of which Heymann was Vice President. They found a common anti-war ground with the Independent Social Democrats, which had split off from the Social Democratic Party. In this context, their former differences with Socialist women such as Clara Zetkin became less important. Augspurg collaborated with Kurt Eisner, and after the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in 1918, became a member of the provisional Landtag of Bavaria. In following elections they soon ran on the list of Independent Social Democrats, but gained no mandate. Until 1922 a JD did not enable women to practise law in Germany, but new equality legislation under the Weimar Constitution finally allowed Augspurg to practise. Since other women had obtained a JD before her, especially in Z√ºrich, Freiburg, Munich, or Leipzig (Johanna von Evreinov), references to her as Germany's first woman lawyer are erroneous. Opposed to war, she proposed forms of active boycott. In addition to supporting the policy of ending capitalism and organising a matriarchy as a future society, she continued to fight against all forms of discrimination by gender and nationality, for general disarmament, and for the independence of all nations oppressed by colonialism. She was opposed to antisemitism and the nascent Nazism. Heymann and Anita Augspurg were Two major leaders of the German women's movement, during the first 30 years of the 20th century, who combined their feminism with pacifism, insisting that the nations of Europe would be spared future wars only when women had the right to vote. https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/heymann-lida-and-anita-augspurg In 1933, due to the takeover of the Nazi Party, Augspurg and Heymann did not return to Germany from a winter trip; they feared reprisals. A crucial factor was that she and Heymann had in 1923 appealed to the Bavarian Interior Minister for expulsion of the Austrian Adolf Hitler, on grounds of sedition. The Nazis in power did indeed confiscate their property, and all written material in their home was lost. She went to live in exile in Switzerland, together with Heymann. They went on to deeper exile in South America, but later returned to Europe to settle in Z√ºrich. There Augspurg died in 1943, a few months after her partner. Like Heymann, she is buried in the Fluntern Cemetery in Z√ºrich, Switzerland.

He is most recognized for his work on Magnum Kings and Queens of Dancehall - the Jamaican dancehall version of American Idol, The Wray & Nephew Contender - The Jamaican version of Mark Burnett's original boxing reality series The Contender, and Mission Catwalk The Jamaican version of Project Runway. He is the CEO of DSE Media and founder of Edward Cushnie Films. Early life Cushnie was born at The University of the West Indies Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, to mother Beverline and father Albert, and is the youngest of three children. He attended the Wolmer's Schools for Boys, and went on to pursue a course in engineering at the University of Technology, Jamaica, before dropping out to pursue his passion of story telling and television. Career After dropping out of University, Cushnie interned at Jamaican cable station Hype TV where he tried his at hand at directing, filming, and editing. This piqued his interest as a director, which led to him directing a few music videos for Jamaican reggae-dancehall acts such as Capleton, Richie Spice, & I-Wayne under the tutelage of established directors Delano Forbes of Phase Three, and Asha Michael. In pursuit of becoming certified, Cushnie enrolled at The New York Film Academy where he studied film and script writing. In 2007, he returned to Hype Tv for a short stint, before deciding to form his own company DSE Media, an acronym for Direct. Shoot. Edit. DSE media, is considered one of Jamaica's leading post production houses, and was founded with the vision of creating a complete production facility, where an idea could be developed from start to finish. DSE Media produces and offering post production services for commercials, music videos, reality TV series, short films and documentaries. One of the companies most recognizable commercials, so-called behind the scenes features, was for the Jamaica Tourist Board's Project Gold, which featured Usain Bolt in a series of Jamaican advertisements. Under the DSE Media banner, he also founded Edward Cushnie Films, which is intended to develop, expose and train youths in post production and filming. =Film= In 2007, Cushnie worked on two Jamaican movie projects for FireFly Films. The first was Betta Mus Come, where Cushnie was a camera operator under the direction of Jamaican film director Storm Saulter, and for the second film Candy Shop, where he retained the role of assistant director. =TV series= His passion for telling stories would pay off, when DSE Media partnered with College Lifestyle magazine to create and produce the College Lifestyle TV series. This would lead to DSE media being hired for post production services for Barbadian international model and BET host, Leah Marville's reality series Passport 246. However, it would be Cushnie's work with the Irish-born, Jamaican producer Mark Kenny, that would establish DSE Media, and Cushnie, as one of Jamaica's premiere post production facilities. Cushnie's work on reality series The Wray & Nephew Contender and Magnum Kings and Queens of Dancehall, resonated throughout the industry after both shows shot to local popularity. In 2011, Cushnie used his creative direction and post production services on the Jamaican reality series Mission Catwalk, which was fashioned from Project Runway. In 2010, in partnership with Jamaica producer Kibwe McGann, Cushnie directed and shared executive producer responsibilities on BET-Centric's lifestyle series SPLASH! which, in 2011, was commissioned to produce a second season. =Documentaries= In 2009, Cushnie was invited by Kimala Bennett to supervise post production on her social documentary Combing through the Roots: Politics of black hair in Jamaica. In the same year, Guyanese attorney and film director Dr Claimont Chung chose DSE Media for W.A.R. Stories, a documentary on the life of the historian, author and activist, Walter Rodney. The documentary was screened at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica and at the Reggae Film Festival in late 2009 and, by January 2010, the documentary debuted in New York and in February at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, Africa. In August 2012, Cushnie left Jamaica for Africa with Donisha Prendergsat - granddaughter of Bob Marley - and reggae singer Kelissa McDonald, to film his new documentary, 50 Days in Afrika. The documentary was filmed in 50 days and journeyed across five African countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. The documentary highlighted Africa's contribution to the global film industry. The name of the documentary 50 Days in Afrika is also significant, as it was coined to recognize Jamaica's 50th celebration of independence from slavery and British rule. =Music videos= Cushnie first started music videos while working at Hype TV. While there he worked alongside established Jamaican directors such a Ras Kassa, Ras Tingle, Jay Will and Kimala Bennett. Since branching out to open DSE Media, he has worked on video projects for some of reggae and dancehall's biggest acts such as: Stephen Marley, Damian Marley, Etana, I Wayne, Busy Signal, Jah Cure, Sean Paul, Tami Chynn and Floyd West. Cushnie's most successful videos include the Ras Kassa's \\"Tic Toc\\", which was Busy Signal/VP Records nominated video of the year, and The Matrimoney movie video, featuring Sean Paul, Tami Chynn, Lady Saw, Fambo, DJ liquid, Tifa and Wayne Marshall, considered to be the new standard by which Jamaican music medley's are judged.

He is considered one of the greatest exponents of watercolour painting, both in the Canaries and Spain, of the last quarter of the 20th century.Exposici√≥n antol√≥gica de Comas Quesada en el CICCA. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 210, November/December 1994, p. 15. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.  Artistic beginnings  House where the painter lived. Comas started in the art of painting at the early age of 15. His interest in it already excelled in the subject of drawing of the old high school, spending many hours to practice with pencil and charcoal. In those difficult times of the post-Civil Spanish War, his family did not consider painting a profession with future, as he explained in an interview: His interest in watercolour, pictorial technique which he would not leave and would become a vehicle of expression for the rest of his life, began when he was between 18 or 20 years, while he was looking at a watercolours by Francisco Bonn√≠n Guer√≠n in the \\"Gabinete Literario\\" of Gran Canaria's capital, saying about them: Commemorative plaque. Watching at the paintings by Bonn√≠n, Jose Comas learned the technique of watercolour indirectly, but about the style he felt more identified with that of Antonio Gonz√°lez: Due to the economic situation of the 1940s he could not afford a teacher, although this was not an obstacle to learn by himself, taking his first steps in the techniques of pencil, wax, sanguine, oil and watercolour. He also practiced other artistic disciplines such as carving and sculpture modelling in clay, plaster or plaster cast, although his great hobby was always drawing. During this first stage of his artistic career, he participated in several collective exhibitions, such as the Club PALA (1947) where he presented four small-format watercolours, as well as during the exposition of new painters on the occasion of the awards \\"Nicolas Massieu\\", in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. He took part as well in the Biennial of Fine Arts of Las Palmas in 1950, 1952, 1958, 1960 and participated in the selection \\"Arti Grafiche Ricordi\\" (Milan, 1954). After these first exhibitions he disappeared of the Canarian art scene for nearly twenty years because of family and work matters.  Establishment as a watercolorist  Painter's signature. In 1974 he took up his true vocation, painting, and he became known in different art galleries of the moment. The unleashing that led to it was his work as representative of a company of moldings. At that time, the watercolourist felt like starting again and doubted on the artistic quality of these early pictures, hence he signed under the pseudonym of \\"Masca\\".Mar√≠a Dolores Arroyo Fern√°ndez, La pintura contempor√°nea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 663. In 1975 he began exhibiting with the \\"Agrupaci√≥n de Acuarelistas Canarios\\" (Canarian Watercolour Association), first in the art gallery Cairasco in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and one year later at the Fine Arts Society in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In 1976 he exhibited again in the above-mentioned Cairasco gallery, where he won the bronze medal of the Association for the watercolour entitled \\"√Årboles y bruma\\" (Trees and mist).  Commemorative watercolours: \\"The painter of the city\\"  Special mention deserve the collections created between 1977 and 1981, where he executed, among others, several successive series of watercolours whose leitmotiv was about the different spots of Vegueta and Triana neighborhoods and that coincided in time with the 500 anniversary of the founding of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It was about evocative images of the old town, both contemporary to his time and retrospective of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which were expressed the spirit of the historic town; intimate, impeccable and secluded places, deserted passages and alleys, churches, traditional Canarian balconies or kiosks witnesses of another era and time. Some of the paintings reflected the city as it was in the late seventies, but the spaces which had been transformed or disappeared victims of progress, the artist turned to recreate them to his own memories and photographs from his personal archive. He knew how to capture with great sensitivity the environment and the atmosphere of yesteryear, leaving a documentary record for future generations, as no other painter of the time devoted to immortalize and portray the city to commemorate such an important event in the Canary Islands history. Until the arrival of Comas Quesada, except for certain paintings by Nicolas Massieu, Felo Monz√≥n, Jorge Oramas and a few more authors, Las Palmas was a city without painters who portray her.Exposiciones en nuestras salas de arte. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 118, December 1979. And if Massieu is regarded as the painter of Gran Canaria, Comas Quesada is the painter of its capital city, because until then no other artist had produced so many works on it. This is the reason why he is known as \\"the painter of the city\\",Alfredo Herrera Piqu√©, Pinturas de la vieja ciudad de Las Palmas. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 102, August 1978. he was a kind of historian, a \\"pictorial chronicler.\\" For those pictures in particular, he sacrificed his usual technique by glazes and a certain tendency to abstraction, by an absolute fidelity in drawing and approaching to the local colour,Mar√≠a Dolores Arroyo Fern√°ndez, La Pintura Contempor√°nea de paisaje en las Canarias Orientales (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 669. moving us to bucolic and romantic scenes from the past, transmitting all the beauty and charm which every place irradiated and that only a master of watercolour as he was, knew how to grasp and understand. The first of the collections came out in June 1977, when the artist presented in a folder 6 watercolours published in limited and numbered series,Vegueta y Triana. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 88, June 1977, p. 12. in which were captured picturesque scenes from the founding neighborhoods of Vegueta and Triana. A month later, on 4 July 1977,Una nueva galer√≠a de arte en Las Palmas. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 89, July 1977, pp. 28-29. three years after his return to the art world and in his own words, without being totally convinced of the quality of his paintings, he carried out his first solo exhibition. With it, was inaugurated the art gallery \\"Madelca\\", then located at Santa Ana main square in the Canary Islands' capital. It was a collection of 20 watercolours which depicted different parts of the old town, going ahead to the commemoration of the V Centenary of the founding of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria which was marked the next year. That year he won the contest of the late Cairasco gallery, receiving the silver medal by the \\"Agrupaci√≥n de Acuarelistas Canarios\\" (Canarian Watercolorist Association) for the work \\"Bruma\\" (Mist), as well as the award of \\"collection of work\\" by the Saving Bank of Gran Canaria. In July 1978, he offered another solo exhibit at \\"Madelca\\" presenting again themes on the historic centre to mark the 500th Centenary of the constitution of his hometown, on this occasion the collection comprised 30 watercolours. In December he won the gold medal of the Canarian Watercolour Association Association, during the IV competition held at the Cairasco exposition gallery, for \\"Bruma\\" (Mist).Mar√≠a Dolores Arroyo Fern√°ndez, La Pintura Contempor√°nea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 667. In 1979, another series of watercolours about the old quarter of Gran Canaria's capital entitled \\"Homenaje a la vieja Ciudad\\" (Homage to the old city). That same year he won the first prize for the painting called \\"Crep√∫sculo en el Sur\\" (Twilight in the South) at the First Biennial of Watercolour \\"Ciudad de Las Palmas\\".1¬™ Bienal de la acuarela Ciudad de Las Palmas. Magazine \\"Aguayro\\" n¬∫ 117, November 1979. Due to the successful reception of the 1977, 1978 and 1979 series on the historic areas of Vegueta and Triana, these cityscapes are depicted again in some watercolors and prints in the Art Gallery of Gran Canaria Savings Bank, in December 1981. While not forgetting that he also created different collections with other landscape thematic during those years. From 1981 he decided to bring to a close this thematic (although Las Palmas would be his \\"muse\\" for the last time in 1991), stating: During the 1980s and early 90s he continued to participate in various individual and collective exhibitions, in several cultural centers and galleries of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Fuerteventura. In 1985 he became a member of the newly founded \\"Asociaci√≥n Canaria de Acuarelistas\\" (Canarian Association of Watercolorists), also taking part in their expositions.  Last phase: 1982-1992  Comas Quesada memorial in his hometown. In the last stage of his artistic career he broke with the illustrative and tried non-traditional compositions, he became more sober in colour and blend tonalities looking for a wider range of colours. This synthetic and suggestive line though not new, it is at this stage of creative maturity when it get a creative peak. As he stressed at the time: In September 1991, which would be the last exhibition held during his lifetime, presented a trilogy called: \\"La Vieja Ciudad\\" (The Old Town), \\"Rincones Isle√±os\\" (Island Spots) and \\"Espacios Abiertos\\" (Open Spaces). Regarding the first, the watercolorist recovered again the subject Las Palmas old quarter, but dealt with a renewed technique with an agile and vigorous brushwork, more decision in drawing and a greater chromaticism in his palette,Carlos Platero Fern√°ndez, Comas Quesada en el CICCA. Magazine Aguayro n¬∫ 194, July/October 1991, p. 32. highlighting he was a painter whose artistic expression was always in constant evolution and searching new ways of expression. What characterizes and defines the pictorial production of Comas is a constant interest in both the traditional architecture and natural landscapes of the coasts, midlands and highlands of Gran Canaria, seascapes, houses with tile roof, patios and balconies, and so on. Likewise, he also painted many of the most representative places of the island of Tenerife, as well as some of Fuerteventura. The style of the watercolorist is completely identifiable, from the colour to the atmosphere, -that extraordinary use, but without exceeding, of the sfumato- everything has an emphasis in the area of the card: line and perspective, differentiation of plans, wash fluency, etc.Agust√≠n Quevedo P√©rez (art critic). Catalogue from the exhibition held in \\"El Corte Ingl√©s\\", from 24 November to 12 December 1989, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. There is a constant preference to reproduce certain effects and atmospheric elements that give many of his paintings a distinctive feature; fog, skies of various coloured clouds, water reflections, puddles, rainy days, etc. Seascapes where the form becomes evanescent, treatments of blue, white and golden exquisites which remind of one of the great masters of watercolour of all times, of Turner.Paloma Herrero (art critic). Catalogue from the exhibition held in \\"El Corte Ingl√©s\\", from 24 November to 12 December 1989, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. He joined to the tenets of the so-called \\"experimental watercolour\\", name that opened two exhibitions in 1966 and 1971 respectively in La Laguna (Tenerife). This trend advocated for experimentation, surpassing the traditional molds that dominated the genre and offering a renewed vision in keeping with the style of the moment.Mar√≠a Dolores Arroyo Fern√°ndez, La pintura contempor√°nea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales. University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, pp. 633-634.

It is a large piece, and one of Matejko's best known. It memorializes the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, a milestone in the history of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and a high point of the Polish Enlightenment. Like many Matejko works, the picture presents a grand scene populated with numerous historic figures, including Poland's last King, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski; Marshals of the Great Sejm Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski and Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha; co-authors of the Constitution such as Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj and Ignacy Potocki; and other major contemporary figures such as Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. Some twenty individuals have been identified by modern historians; another ten or so who had been reported in older sources as being present, await definitive identification. The picture was painted between January and October 1891 to commemorate the Constitution's centenary. It was one of the last works by Matejko, who died in November 1893. The painting was displayed in Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine) until 1920, when it was moved to Krak√≥w. It was hidden during World War II and later moved to Warsaw, where it now hangs in the Royal Castle. Constitution of 3 May 1791 Larger resolution The Constitution of 3 May 1791 was adopted as a \\"Government Act\\" (Polish: Ustawa rzƒÖdowa) on that date by the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. It has been called \\"the first constitution of its type in Europe\\" and the world's second oldest constitution. It was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's system of \\"Golden Liberty\\", which conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility, had increasingly corrupted the Commonwealth's politics. The Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (szlachta) and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo the legislation adopted by that Sejm. The adoption of the 3 May Constitution met with hostile political and military responses from the Commonwealth's neighbors. In the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792 (sometimes called the \\"War in Defense of the Constitution\\"), the Commonwealth was attacked by Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia allied with the Targowica Confederation, a coalition of Polish magnates and landless nobility who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence. The Commonwealth's ally Prussia, under Frederick William II, broke its alliance, and the Commonwealth was defeated. In the end, the Constitution of May 3 remained in force for little more than one year. Despite the Commonwealth's defeat in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War and the ensuing partitions which eliminated the Commonwealth, the May 3 Constitution remained for more than 123 years a beacon in the struggle to restore Polish sovereignty. In the words of two of its co- authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, it was \\"the last will and testament of the expiring Country.\\" History A sketch of the work was presented in the cycle, History of Civilization in Poland. Matejko began work on the painting in mid‚ÄìJanuary 1891, to coincide with the Constitution's centenary. Although the painting was not finished until October, by 3 May it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Krak√≥w's Sukiennice. On 7 April 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanis≈Çaw Sanguszko, marshal of the Galician Sejm in Lw√≥w, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of Lviv University). The painting was one of the last by Matejko, who died in November 1893. In 1920, two years after Poland regained independence, the painting was moved to Krak√≥w, where from 1923 it was displayed in the building of the Polish Sejm. The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been in the collection of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007. Significance and historiography The painting is one of Matejko's best known works and today it is commonly seen as one of his masterpieces, an \\"education in national history.\\" However, it was less well received by his contemporaries, with turn-of-the-century reviews criticizing it for being \\"too crowded\\" and with unclear composition; supporters of Matejko's previous works were much more guarded in their praise of this painting. Matejko's technique in this painting was subtly but noticeably different compared to his other paintings; authors Wrede et al. attribute this to Matejko's exploration of new techniques, but note that contemporary critiques saw this departure from his old style as the weakening form of the dying master, and did not applaud the changes. They also note that Matejko usually dedicated two years to paintings of that size; this one was completed in less than a year, during a period in which Matejko was working on other projects and suffering from stress and depression. Matejko himself was not fond of the 18th century and the Polish Enlightenment, remarking that he \\"would rather prefer to paint any other century\\". He felt compelled, however, by the anniversary of the Constitution to create an artwork commemorating the event, which he recognized as historically significant. Matejko commonly identified the characters in his paintings with a written legend, but he did not create one for the Constitution. Consequently, some characters in the painting have not been identified. A partial legend was written by Matejko's secretary, Marian Gorzkowski, and even though it provides a list of 39 characters, Wrede et al. write that his \\"chaotic description\\" is not very helpful. Modern analysis has been done by Polish historians Jaros≈Çaw Krawczyk and Emanuel M. Rostworowski. Content Identified individuals (see text for legend) The painting, set in the late afternoon of 3 May 1791, shows the procession of deputies from the Royal Castle (background), where the Constitution has just been adopted by the Great Sejm, to St. John's Collegiate Church (left, now an archcathedral), where a Te Deum will be sung. The procession moves down St. John's Street (ulica ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska), surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors. The deputies are protected by soldiers. While the procession was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons who were not in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of the final years of the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment. =Center= The painting is centered on the Sejm marshal Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski (1), who is wearing a white, French- inspired costume. Ma≈Çachowski holds the marshal staff in his left hand and in his right hand, he triumphantly raises the text of the Constitution. Although the historical document was titled Ustawa rzƒÖdowa (Government Ordinance), Matejko chose to make the title page of the document as portrayed in his painting more explicit‚Äîand at the same time put the name of the painting right in its center. He is carried by deputies Aleksander Linowski of Krak√≥w (2) (on his right) and Ignacy Zakrzewski of Pozna≈Ñ (3) (on his left). Their significance is that Krak√≥w and Pozna≈Ñ are principal cities of two major regions of Poland: Lesser Poland and Greater Poland, respectively. Under Ma≈Çachowski's right hand there is a figure with a bandaged head holding a flag; this is Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko (4), and his head wound is a reference to the battle of Maciejowice, which took place during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in 1794, three years after the event depicted in the painting. To the left of Ko≈õciuszko, is a figure identified by Wrona et al. as Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, although this is disputed by other sources. Another figure, to the right of Ma≈Çachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian confederation and the second Sejm marshal. He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing. Between Ma≈Çachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known writer, is visible. He appears to be carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is Micha≈Ç Zabie≈Ç≈Ço (7). In the lower center of the painting, Matejko shows a scene that took place in the Royal Castle. Jan Suchorzewski (8), deputy from Kalisz and an opponent of the Constitution, has fallen to the ground, holding his young son with one arm; his other hand, holding a knife, is held by Stanis≈Çaw Kublicki (9), standing to his right. Kublicki was a deputy from Inflanty, a supporter of the townsfolk and peasant causes, and of the Constitution. The artist here alludes to Suchorzewski's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the king from signing the Constitution, during which he threatening to kill his own son to save him from the \\"slavery of the Constitution\\". A deck of cards has fallen out of Suchorzewski's pocket, a reference to the manner in which he was bribed by the anti-Constitution Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and hetman Branicki; Suchorzewski suddenly started winning large sums of money in games, despite his poor skills as a gambler. Branicki (10) can be seen standing between the king and Suchorzewski, dressed in a Russian uniform, foreshadowing the rank of general he received several years later in the Russian Army. In reality Suchorzewski, like most of those opposed to the Constitution, refused to participate in the procession. Notable figures in the center of the painting, to the left of Ma≈Çachowski, include other supporters of the Constitution. Priest Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski. Several other figures in the vicinity are described in sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably Feliks Turski, although some identify him as Tymoteusz Gorze≈Ñski. The figures to the right of Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, Ignacy Potocki (13), and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Ko≈õciuszko). Surrounding Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli (15) and Tadeusz Matuszewicz or Matusiewicz (16). =Left= On the stairs of the church, King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (17) is ascending. Matejko was not very fond of Poniatowski, and he portrayed him in a rather pompous posture, with his hand extended to be kissed, and in the company of numerous pretty ladies, supporting his reputation as a \\"lady's man\\". Poniatowski's inclusion in the procession is one of Matejko's artistic liberties, as he had arrived at the church before the procession. A woman hands him a laurel wreath (18); sources have identified her as the Courland princess Dorothea von Medem (Dorothea Biron) or R√≥≈ºa z Martynkowskich, wife of former Warsaw mayor Jan Dekert. Behind her (leftmost in the group of two women, with only her face showing) stands El≈ºbieta Grabowska (19), the king's mistress and mother of his children. Bowing at the church doors is the former mayor of Warsaw, Jan Dekert (20). He is accompanied by his daughter Marianna (in a yellow dress, facing away from the viewer) taking a prominent position near the king (38). Dekert's inclusion in the painting is another example of Matejko taking liberties with history, as he died in October 1790; he was an important burghers figure associated with the Free Royal Cities Act, which was incorporated into the Constitution. Behind the king, holding his hands to his head, is Prince Antoni Stanis≈Çaw Czetwerty≈Ñski-≈öwiatope≈Çk (21), another opponent of the Constitution, known for being on a Russian payroll. Below him is another opponent of the Constitution, Antoni Z≈Çotnicki (22). An anonymous black-clad French royalist (23) is shown looking terrified at the scene, seeing another revolution in the making. He raises his hand over the king's head. In the group of people gathered below the king, in another acknowledgement of the burghers' importance, is burgher Jan Kili≈Ñski (24), one of the leaders of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. To his right, at the edge of the crowd, is the priest Clemens Maria Hofbauer (25), who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is canonized as a saint in the Catholic church. =Right= To the right of Sapieha are reformer Stanis≈Çaw Staszic (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, Andrzej Zamoyski (27), author of the Zamoyski Codex, an earlier attempt to reform the state. To the left of Staszic, the head of bishop of Smole≈Ñsk, Tymoteusz Gorze≈Ñski (28), is visible in the crowd. Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is Kazimierz Konopka (29), Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's secretary and one of the Polish Jacobins; Konopka has a French blue-white-red flower in his hat and a czekan, an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand. Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either Pawe≈Ç Ksawery Brzostowski, pioneer of agricultural reforms, or J√≥zef Stƒôpkowski, a less progressive figure. This line of figures ends with Antoni Tyzenhauz (32), Lithuanian official and reformer. To the right of Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms. To their right is the king's nephew, prince J√≥zef Poniatowski (34), in the uniform of the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse. The uniform is another instance of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and died during the Battle of Leipzig. At the time of the passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown keeping an eye on the procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street. To his right, partially obscured by Poniatowski's horse's head, is Stanis≈Çaw Mokronowski (35), deputy, general, and future leader of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in Lithuania. At the very bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are on the edge of the scene; the younger (36) one is usually described as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git (\\"that's good\\") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews‚Äîthe Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way‚Äîothers put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles. =List of characters= Historians have positively identified a number of characters.

When the middle-aged priest left his hometown of Ravenna and undertook a three-year voyage in Scandinavia, he became the first. Thus he was seen as unusual for an Italian by the Scandinavians in travelling independently, reflecting the contemporary image of his compatriots by other nations. As an example, King Frederick III of Denmark expressed surprise at seeing him so far from home. Negri wrote often with a scientific perspective, examining the flora and fauna of the region, and made a series of anthropological observations, especially on the physical characteristics of the natives of Lapland. His approach was far from being reliably scientific in the modern sense, however, and he took his native region of Italy as the norm for considering differences with other populations.

It first aired on the FX channel in the United States on August 11, 2011. The series stars stand-up comedian Louis C.K. as a fictionalized version of himself and this episode has him reconnecting with an estranged friend from the comedy club circuit who confesses that he is planning on killing himself and just wants to say good bye to the only person who will associate with him. The episode was received positively by critics. Plot After finishing a stand-up set, Louie runs into his old friend and colleague Eddie Mack (Doug Stanhope), whom he has not seen for years. Louie is happy to see his friend, but when Eddie becomes unnecessarily aggressive towards a fellow comedian, it becomes clear that something is wrong. It turns out Eddie is struggling with his career, lives in his car and drinks heavily. The two go out together, get drunk, and Eddie does an impromptu set at an open mic event. As the evening comes to an end, Eddie tells Louie that he's planning to end it. Louie thinks he is talking about his stand-up career, but Eddie is actually planning to commit suicide, and sought out Louie because he wanted someone to say goodbye to. Louie initially states that he has struggled with determining his purpose in life and had to discover it for himself and everyone must discover their own purpose. Louie at first attempts to dissuade him stating for instance, \\"You know what, it's not your life. It's life. Life is bigger than you. If you can imagine that. Life isn't something that you possess, it's something that you take part in, and you witness.\\" While Louie is expressing his concerns, they are both promptly interrupted by a random couple arguing within earshot and thus distracting them in the process. The moment ends with the two chuckling about how they were arguing just like the couple that passed by. The two part ways with the issue unresolved, and it is not revealed what eventually happens to Eddie. Reception James Poniewozik of Time's \\"Tuned In\\" blog, gave the episode a positive review. He commented on how the show had \\"evolved from a surreal comedy about one comic's take on life, to a funny show about the serious subject of how to live.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V.

According to Chee Soo, Chan Kam Lee established a Taoist Arts school in Red Lion Square in Holborn in 1930Taoist Yoga by Chee Soo published by Aquarian Press (Thorsons publishing group) 1983 - page 158 teaching Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan, Qigong, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Feng Shou 'Hand of the Wind' Kung Fu, and used his knowledge of Chinese Medicine and Herbalism to adapt the Ch'ang Ming diet for Westerners. Chan Kam Lee is referenced in several books written by Chee Soo and published by HarperCollins,The Taoist Art of Feng Shou published by Aquarian Press, Wellingborough, Northants 1983 (Thorsons/HarperCollins) pages 8, 13, 24, 224, 231-2Taoist Yoga published by Aquarian Press, Wellingborough, Northants 1983 (Thorsons/HarperCollins) page 33The Tao of Long Life published by Aquarian Press, Wellingborough, Northants in 1982 (Thorsons/HarperCollins) pages 19,120The Taoist Ways of Healing published by Aquarian Press (Thorsons/HarperCollins) 1986 () pages 12, 48, 137-8 but there is no corroboration of his existence independent of Chee Soo's accounts.

Lavinia says the Arts included martial arts and healing techniques including Tao yin breathing exercises which were not passed on openly during the time of the political upheavals of the Cultural Revolution in China 1966 - 1976 when Taoist practices like Tai Chi were banned. Business Chan Kam Lee is said to have been the last in line of the Lee family from Weihaiwei in northern China, and as he was an importer and exporter of precious and semi-precious stones, he travelled thousands of miles promoting his business, which was mainly between Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and England. After he had built up a stable business he finally set up his main office in London, and from there he did most of his trade. Arts Chee Soo says that, after a while, Chan Kam Lee began to get restless, and he sought an outlet for his physical, mental and spiritual needs. As a result, he established a small and select class in a schoolroom in Red Lion Square, near Holborn, in Central London, teaching and practising his Chinese Taoist arts. He catered only for his own personal friends and their sons, so the total number of his students was very small, and at the most there were only a dozen people attending. All of them were in business and travelled quite a lot, so the average attendance at any one time was only in the region of six people. However, this did not deter Chan Lee for he was able to keep up his own practice as well, which was the main objective in the first place, so he was very happy.Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo published by HarperCollins 1986 page 137 Death and legacy According to Chee Soo's account: \\"In the winter of 1953-4, Chan Lee died, off the coast of China, near Canton, when the ship he was travelling in sank in a severe storm,\\" Chan Lee's student went on to teach the Taoist Arts and during the cultural revolution his group was the largest group teaching Taoist Arts in the world. After the death of Chee Soo in 1994 several groups have continued to teach the Taoist Arts of the Lee family style in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and in other countries around the world.

It was resurrected in 1951 and remained active until 1958. Its final period of active service was from 1961 to 1991. Its final aircraft were Impala Mk IIs. It was based at Lanseria Airport at the time of final disbandment. History =Establishment and deployment= The squadron was initially equipped with Hawker Hartbees, Hawker Furys and Wapitis when it was first formed in April 1939 in Durban. It was disbanded soon thereafter (December 1939) and resurrected at AFB Waterkloof on 24 March 1941 flying Hurricanes. Operational training took place in Kenya and soon the squadron was responsible for protection against possible Italian attacks from Somaliland. While in Kenya, it received a number of Curtiss Mohawks which had been taken over from French orders. =World War II= On 1 September 1941 the squadron began to move to Egypt and converted to Tomahawks. Its first combat patrol came on 12 November, early in Operation Crusader as a fighter-bomber squadron. The squadron remained in Egypt to take part in all of the desert battles from Operation Crusader to El Alamein. The squadron also supported the advance into Tunisia as well as the invasions of Sicily and Italy. The Kittyhawks were replaced by Spitfires in July 1943. In August it moved on to Sicily and to the Italian mainland in September from where it concentrated on ground attack missions until the end of hostilities. 4 Squadron remained in Italy for two months after the end of the war; on 12 July its personnel began returning to South Africa. The squadron was disbanded in October 1945. =Post World War II= 4 Squadron was reformed in January 1951 at AFB Waterkloof as the Active Citizen Force element of 1 Squadron with Harvards and Spitfires until once again disbanded in October 1958. On 1 November 1961, it was reformed at Swartkop, flying Harvards and in August 1972 the first Impala Jets were received. The squadron moved from Swartkop to Waterkloof and then to Lanseria Airport where it received Impala Mk IIs. It saw numerous deployments to South- West Africa and Mpacha and Rundu airfields in southern Angola. Its home base remained at Lanseria until it was disbanded in September 1991.

In the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century, one room schools were commonplace throughout rural Kansas. In most rural schools, all of the students met in a single room. One room meant one teacher who taught basic reading, writing, and arithmetic to both boys and girls of all grades. When one-on-one instruction was necessary, the teacher would call a student forward to the recitation desk. Supplies might be limited. There was a blackboard, desks or planks for children, a teacher's desk, maps, sometimes a globe and, if the teacher was musical, a piano. In the earliest days, students would often provide their own books, usually from the selection of McGuffey Readers. Within the school, there was always a water pail and dipper to keep one's cool during the hot summer months. Outside, not far from the front door, was the water pump. And, at a safe and hygienic distance from the school house itself, an outhouse. In central Kansas, it was common to find a storm shelter where children could go in the event of a tornado. One-room schools are no longer used in Kansas, falling victim to the declining number of farms and students, the increasing use of automobiles, and school unification. History =Early Kansas= The area which now includes Kansas was home to many Indian tribes for thousands of years. Non-natives visited the area of Kansas as early as Francisco V√°squez de Coronado 1540 - 1542. He encountered Indians he called the Quiverans, probably ancestors of the Pawnee people. Between 1802 and 1804 Merriweather Lewis and William Clark crossed the northeastern portion of Kansas territory on their way to the Pacific meeting the Kansa Indians from whom the state takes its name. Adventurers and hunters later visited the area known as the Great American Desert, an area, at first, considered unfit for human settlement. In 1846 Francis Parkman toured western Kansas, hunting the American bison, otherwise known as buffalo. His two-month adventure in Kansas and other western states to be would become the subject of the best selling The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life. James R. Mead, one of the founders of Wichita, explored Kansas between 1859 and 1863, and later settled in Wichita. He knew such colorful characters as Kit Carson, Jesse Chisholm, Buffalo Bill, and Chief Santana. His recollections became a book, Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains,1859-1875. Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains,1859-1875. By James R. Mead, edited by Schuyler Jones and introduction by Ignace Mead Jones. Kansas territory was crossed by at least three major trails. These included western Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail, and the south to north Chisholm Trail. These trails served first as routes through Kansas territory or for commercial purpose, but later served to bring settlers to the territory. =First Schools= Indian Mission schools A two story brick building with one room school on the first floor, located in Fairway, Kansas. The Shawnee Indian Mission in Fairway, Kansas was the first school for children in Kansas Territory, serving Shawnee, Delaware and other Indian nations from 1839-1854. In 1847, the Jesuits established a mission school for the Osage Indians in Neosho County at present day St. Paul, Kansas. Like the Shawnee Indian Mission School, education was available for both boys and girls. The curriculum included both academic studies and manual trades. The Jesuits who taught the children blended Native American customs with Christianity.The Mission Story, http://www.osagemission.org/missionstory2.html In 1869, following the cessation of Indian lands by the Osage tribe in Kansas, the school became St. Ann's Academy for girls and St. Francis Institution for boys, attracting students from several states.Osage Catholic Mission marker https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-markers/12884 Kansas Territory On May 30, 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and on August 30, 1855, the first Territorial Legislature made provision by law for a school in each of the counties of the territory. By 1858 the legislature recognized the right of all children regardless of color or religious background to an education. Section 71 of Chapter 8 of the laws of 1858, declares: \\"All school districts established under the authority of this act shall be free and without charge for tuition to all children between the age of five and twenty-one years, and no sectarian instruction shall be allowed therein.\\" William G. Cutler's History of the State of Kansas, Part 19, http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/eraop/era-of- peace-p19.html#SCHOOLS_OF_KANSAS Immigration Settlement in Kansas territory before the Civil War was hampered by the issue of slavery. Kansas became a state in 1861, but not before experiencing a period known as Bleeding Kansas. Even with statehood, questions concerning land titles continued because of Indian claims. Despite this danger and uncertainty, settlement in Kansas continued. In the Spring of 1863, James R. Mead, noted plainsman and one of the original founders of Wichita, Kansas, first arrived in the Walnut Valley at the extreme western settlement. He came across the tiny community of Towanda where, in addition to the several families staking claims, he saw a \\"very rough log building called a school house\\".James R. Mead, Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859-1875, page 133. Following the Civil War, immigration renewed with passage of the Homestead Act and the final removal of the Osage Indians to Oklahoma, a result of the Drum Creek Treaty. One room schools were added at a furious pace to keep up with the new communities and farms. A typical example is Lanesfield school near Edgerton, Kansas, and close to Kansas City. The first school session began in 1863 at a house owned by William Gans. By 1867, eighteen pupils attended class in a log schoolhouse on the Burton Dillie farm. In May 1869, nine townsmen met and voted to issue $1,000 worth of school bonds to construct a school built of native Kansas limestone. Even in sparsely populated rural counties, the demand to build schools for the children of new settlers was intense. In the heart of the Flint Hills Marion County, Kansas for example, had a population of 60 in 1860, and by 1878, its population had increased to 8,306. This same year, the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, reported the number of students and schools for each county, including Marion.Kansas State Board of Agriculture, First Biennial Report, Marion County,1878, Mohler. http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1878/marion.html \\"Schools. - Number of organized districts, 65; school population, 2,913; average salary of teachers, per month, males, $35.45; females, $29.20. School houses built during 1878, 2; frame, 1; stone, 1. Total number of school houses, 64; frame, 50; stone, 14. Value of all school property, $72,918. A few districts have planted maple and cottonwood trees in their school grounds.\\" The large ratio of children (2,913) to population (8,306) speaks to the large size of families in the early years. Just as remarkable by today's standards, but not by those of early Kansas, is the number of school districts in Marion (65) compared to the relatively small population. Construction The materials with which schools were built varied by location and population. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, often with the school bell on a cupola. Especially, in the Flint Hills, native Kansas limestone was used. Sod construction was used in early western Kansas schools, where trees were scarce. The brick chimney was usually set at the rear of the school room, but in some cases, the chimney was placed between the front door and the class itself. A wall was then constructed to keep away the cold from the classroom, and this area would serve as a chamber room for coats and lunch pails. An interesting feature of many schools were the two front doors which allowed for separate entrances for boys and girls. What is the Matter with Rural Schools The conflict between rural communities and cities has always existed and still does. Rural children loved the small communities from which they sprang and enjoyed the freedom of life in the country. But education in rural communities could never hope to compete with that of the city. By the beginning of the 1920s, the situation in rural one room schools had shown an insurmountable gap in the quality of education. A one-room school was also a one-teacher school. And, in the years 1921 and 1922, a study revealed that 76% of the teachers were new in their positions, and less than 10% had been teaching for more than a year.Twenty-Fifth Biennial Report of the State Board of Agriculture, Kansas, Volume XXX, Mohler, 1925-1926, page 24. These teachers were usually young and female. Marriage often accounted for their short tenure. Notable Schools =Acorn= Acorn Schoolhouse, Franklin CountyThe Acorn Schoolhouse is located in Franklin County on ancient John Brown Highway where it intersects with Iowa Road. The white wooden clapboard school was built in 1900, replacing an earlier structure built in the 1870s. The inscription over the door reads \\"Acorn School, District 74, built 1900\\".http://kansasoneroomschools.blogspot.com/search/label/Acorn%20School =Arvonia= Arvonia, Kansas one room schoolOnce upon a time it had three stores, one hotel, one blacksmith and wagon shop, a post-office, two churches and a schoolhouse.http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html Today, Arvonia is reduced to a few homes and the beautiful stone school. Arvonia was settled in 1869, by a company of Welsh people who had formed a colony, with J. Mather Jones as their leader. When the town was started, it was hoped that railroad tracks would be laid along the Marais des Cygnes valley. This failed to happen and the community withered.http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html =Bazaar= Bazaar, Chase County, KansasBazaar was first settled in 1856, three years before Chase County was organized. The town was a stopping point on the Chisholm Trail and, in 1887, became a shipping point for cattle when the Santa Fe Railroad arrived. =Bichet= Bichet school from front gateBichet school was built in 1896 for the children of French families who settled along the Cottonwood River near Florence, Marion County, Kansas. The first term of 1896 - 1897 included 19 children from 8 families. The names included Bichet, Goffinet, Lalouette, Louis, Martinet, Reverend, Rensen, and Featherkile.http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Marion_BichetSchoolDistrict34NR.pdf Listed in the Historic Register. =Cato= Cato was founded in 1854 at the northern edge of the Cherokee Neutral Lands, now Cherokee and Crawford Counties. The first school was built in 1867. A stone school built in 1869 still stands, after serving as a schoolhouse and a meeting house until the mid 1950s. The school is maintained by the Cato Historical Preservation Association. Never a large town, Cato's population peaked in 1910 with 112 residents. http://catoschool.com/ =Kellas= Kellas school front right sideKellas School, built in 1873, in Newton, Harvey County, Kansas, was located at southeast 12th Street & Hillside. The small wood frame building was moved to the Harvey County Historical Society in Newton, where it can be visited today. Extinct Schools One room schools in Kansas could not hope to compete against larger, better equipped schools in the cities. Rural one room schools had their own problems, especially the inability to retain teachers from year to year because of low pay and declining student enrollment. The automobile also made transportation possible for rural students to cities. The end of an era was at hand. With the unification of school districts, one room schools were abandoned. In many cases, the schoolhouse reverted to the property owner. Then again, the school itself might be converted into a home or auctioned off. Where the building was on farmland, farmers would burn the structure to revert the land to farm or pasture. Finally, many structures just wasted away with time and weather. Preservation There are various projects to preserve the memory of Kansas one room schools. Foremost perhaps is the Kansas One Room School House Project, a Kansas Heritage Project.. Many of the Kansas one room schools still standing are preserved and maintained by local land owners and community groups.

The outfit signed a cease- fire agreement for one year with the Union Government on May 23, 2002. However, this led to a split in the UPDS with one faction deciding to continue with its subversive activities while the other commenced negotiations with the Government. Currently, there are two factions: pro-talks and anti-talks. On May 16, 2004, the UPDS (Anti-Talks) rechristened itself as the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF) and its armed wing as the Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Resistance Force (KNPR). Leadership Kiri Rongphar was the founder ‚Äòchairman‚Äô of the outfit. He was arrested on October 22, 1999. On August 22, 2002, UPDS 'commander-in-chief' Long Kumar Kiling died of injuries sustained during a feline attack in the forests of Karbi Anglong district. Although this has not been proved. At present, the outfit is headed by its Chairman Longder Singner alias H E Kathar and General Secretary Haren Sing Bey. T Nongloda is the outfit's Publicity Secretary and Lindok Ronghang its Finance Secretary. The total cadre strength of the UPDS is estimated to be a little more than 150, of which at least 50 are believed to be armed with sophisticated weapons. Areas of operation The outfit's main area of operations is in the Karbi Anglong district, with a relatively minor presence in Dima Hasao district. Linkages The outfit is known to have grown with the active assistance of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak- Muivah (NSCN-IM), which provided it with arms and ammunition. It is reported to have procured arms and ammunition from Bhutan and Bangladesh. The UPDS also shares a ‚Äòworking relationship‚Äô with the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). Funds Abductions for ransom and extortion are the main sources of income for the UPDS. The outfit generates a considerable amount of revenue by targeting the ginger producing Kukis in the Singhason Hills area. The non-Karbi traders are also targeted for extortion. In some cases, even Karbi's have been the targets. Peace talks The outfit held six rounds of peace talks with the State and Union Government representatives between 2002 and 2006. Tha last round of talks was held on July 26, 2006. Subsequently, the outfit pulled out of the talks process complaining of lack of progress on its core demands. The outfit's cadres are lodged in one Government guarded designated camp at Diphu with 60 cadres, two main camps and several sub-camps. On August, 2011, The Government of India released a statement wherein it planned to sign peace pacts with UPDS. As of November 25, 2011, the Outfit has signed a tripartite peace accord with the Government Of India for reorganizing the existing autonomous district (Karbi Anglong) under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution into four administrative districts for better administrative and developmental administration. As part of the restructuring and empowerment process, the existing autonomous council will be renamed the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council. The proposed Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council will have 50 members to give greater representation to people living in remote and isolated clusters of villages. Of these, 44 will be elected members and six will be nominated by the governor of Assam. According to the MoS, the increase in seats will be applicable from subsequent elections, due in the year 2016-17 or mid-term poll, if any, whichever is earlier. Altogether 39 subjects will be transferred to the proposed Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council and its chief and deputy chief will have status equivalent to that of the cabinet minister and the other executive council members equivalent to the minister of state. In the MoS, it was also mentioned that the state government would provide support for relief and rehabilitation of the members of the UPDS, besides organizing vocational classes for them. It stated that special psychological counseling and career guidance classes would also be held at the designated camps of UPDS to facilitate rehabilitation of its cadres. As of 14 December 2014, The UPDS has formally disbanded following the mass surrender of all it cadres and leaders.

It was disbanded at the end of the war and was re-commissioned in 1950. It remained active until 2 October 1992, when it was disbanded; its Atlas Cheetah E aircraft were also decommissioned. History The squadron was initially designated as a fighter-bomber unit and formed in Cape Town in April 1939. It was only active for eight months and was disbanded in December that year. It was re-formed on 7 May 1941 as a fighter squadron operating from Zwartkop Air Station equipped with Mohawk Vs. It deployed to Egypt in December 1941 re-equipped with Tomahawk IIBs. The squadron was initially tasked with providing anti-shipping patrols and subsequently deployed as a fighter squadron over the Western Desert battlefield area. At the end of 1942 it received Kittyhawk IIIs and later Kittyhawk IVs and began to specialize in the ground-attack role, although still being retained as an ordinary fighter squadron as required. After the cessation of hostilities in Africa, the squadron moved to Malta to support the invasion of Sicily, after which it moved to that island and then on to mainland Italy. By the time the squadron was deployed to Italy, it was used only in the ground attack role. While deployed to Italy, the squadron flew close air support and fighter- bomber missions, some over Yugoslavia. The squadron took part in the battles on the Sangro River, Monte Cassino and the Gustav and Gothic Lines. The Kittyhawks were replaced by Mustang IIIs (and later Mustang IVs) and these aircraft were retained until the end of the war in Italy when the squadron was disbanded. 5 Squadron was re-formed in Durban in December 1950 as an 'Active Citizen Force' unit flying Harvards. It was re-equipped with Impala Mk Is in July 1973 and Impala Mk IIs in early 1981. The squadron then moved to AFB Louis Trichardt to be equipped with Cheetah Es. It was finally disbanded on 2 October 1992 when its Cheetah aircraft were decommissioned.

On 10 September 1943 six pilots and a DC-3 Dakota with ground staff were ordered to Cyprus to set up an advanced base to provide air cover for the planned invasion of the Dodecanese Islands. It transpired that the initial intention was that the squadron, consisting of six Spitfire Mk Vs, was to be the total air cover contingent for the planned invasion. However, by 13 September the Squadron was joined by two more of the squadron's Spitfires all operating from the island of Kos. They were later joined by 74 Squadron RAF but by then the Luftwaffe attacks on Kos had severely damaged the primitive airfields and after intense aerial fighting, there was only one serviceable Spitfire left in the Squadron by 1 October. On 3 October German landings commenced and the grounded SAAF personnel were compelled to escape by whatever means possible - some crossed to Turkey in small boats and others were evacuated back to Egypt with the retreating allied ground forces. By the time of re-assembly in Egypt, the Squadron had lost six officers killed and 15 other ranks missing for the cost of 12 enemy aircraft having been shot down. The squadron remained in Egypt for a few months, and then in April 1944, equipped with Spitfire Mk lXs, rejoined No. 7 Wing in Italy. After the surrender of German forces in Italy, the squadron was sent to the Far East, but the war in the East ended before the squadron could be deployed. It then returned to Ceylon and thereafter back to South Africa. It was disbanded on 10 September 1945. The Squadron was reformed at Ysterplaat Air Station in August 1951 and was equipped with Harvards and was again disbanded in 1959. It was re-formed once more at Youngsfield in the Cape on 1 August 1961 and later moved to Ysterplaat in 1969. The squadron received Impala Mk Is in 1977 as a citizen force unit and was moved to Cape Town International Airport in 1978. It was again moved to AFB Langebaanweg and to AFB Pietersburg. The squadron was disbanded in December 1992.

After the war, the squadron was used in various roles, including that of a helicopter squadron until 1963 when it was equipped with Canberra light bombers, remaining a light bomber and reconnaissance squadron until disbanded in 1990. History 12 Squadron was formed in December 1939. On 16 June 1940 it flew the first SAAF bombing raid against Italian forces in Abysinna when it attacked the town of Moyale using Junkers Ju 86 bombers.Potgieter (1970), p. 264 12 Squadron later saw combat during the Second Battle of El Alamein operating Boston light bombers.Latimer (2002), p. 292 In May 1941 the squadron converted to the Martin Maryland, and moved to Egypt.

Wing (together with 24 Squadron SAAF and RAF 113 Sqn)Shores (2012), p. 231 and used its Marylands to attack Axis troop concentrations and bases. In January 1942 the squadron received the Douglas Boston, using these aircraft on the same roles from 15 March 1942 until the final German surrender in Tunisia. The squadron then moved to Malta, from where it supported the fighting in Sicily and on the Italian mainland, before moving to Italy in October 1943. Assigned to No. 3 Wing with 21 & 24 squadrons. The Bostons were retained until January 1944, when they were replaced with the new Martin Marauder. Both aircraft were used in a similar role, to attack enemy communications behind the front line, although the Marauder saw more service at day, and against strategic targets. After the war the squadron flew its aircraft back to Egypt, where in November 1945 it disbanded. Following the end of the war in Europe the squadron flew South African personnel home until it was disbanded. 12 Squadron was re-formed in October 1946 equipped with Avro Anson aircraft for anti-Tsetse fly spraying duties. It operated in this role in Zululand and Mtubatuba. The squadron was later re-equipped with Sikorsky S-51 helicopters that were at times also utilised in anti-Tsetse fly spraying duties, it but was eventually made a flight of 28 Squadron. The squadron was re-formed in late 1963 to operate English Electric Canberra bombers.Potgieter and Steenkamp (1981), p. 68 It was the only SAAF squadron equipped with Canberras, and they were used as both tactical bombers and high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. The squadron saw combat over Angola during the South African Border War,Lord (2008), pp. 70, 101, 139, 172 and remained active with these aircraft in 1981. 12 Squadron was disbanded in 1990.

Plot The book begins with an incident in 1781 when a small detachment of Hessian (German auxiliaries in the British service) soldiers encounter a mentally retarded man, Saul Clamberham, on a Connecticut hill-side. Clamberham follows the jagers out of confused curiosity, making meaningless markings on a slate. Misunderstanding the situation, an exasperated Hessian officer with little English becomes convinced that Clamberham is a spy and has the autistic villager hanged from a tree. Outraged, the local population ambush the Hessians and kill all but a drummer boy who escapes. The narrator of the story: the town physician and a Continental Army veteran, subsequently discovers that the young drummer Hans Pohl is being sheltered in a Quaker family's barn while township authorities hunt for him. Captured, the Hessian boy is tried for murder. Although his role in the earlier death was limited to beating his drum as the hanging took place, Pohl fatally admits that he would have carried out his duty as a soldier and participated directly in the execution if so ordered. The doctor, himself a victim of prejudice as an English-born Catholic in a small Puritan community, watches helplessly while the German boy is hanged. Theme The theme throughout the novel is one of futility, as two innocents are pointlessly killed by men who see themselves as having no choice in what they do.

The Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S; Squadron) consists of a Headquarters Troop, (Company C) Long Range Surveillance (LRS) unit (Airborne Infantry Company) for strategic level Long Range Reconnaissance and Surveillance missions (the backbone of the R&S; units and the BfSB), two ground (Troops A and B) Cavalry Troops for basic tactical Reconnaissance taskings and the Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S; Squadron) mounted Quick Reaction Force (QRF) and Ready Reaction Force (RRF) Security Force (SECFOR), dismounted Quick Reaction Force (QRF) and Ready Reaction Force (RRF) Security Force (SECFOR) and one line Infantry Company responsible for the Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S; Squadron) Base Security Force (SECFOR). History Lieutenant Colonel James Gaylord and Command Sergeant Major Eric Dostie present the company guidon at the 38th Cavalry Regiment's activation ceremony Thursday. Fort Bragg's newest unit unfurled its flag Thursday. The activation of the 1st Squadron of the 38th Cavalry Regiment added about 300 Soldiers to Fort Bragg. They included Staff Sergeant Roch Schenk, who sat on horseback in an Army uniform from the Indian wars of the late 1800s on the parade field. Squadron officers wore black Stetson hats at the ceremony in honor of their horse cavalry heritage. Each troop stood in formation with its red-and-white cavalry guidon. \\"Based on lessons learned from combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army leaders saw a need for a very special unit\\", Colonel Joe Cox said. Cox is commander of the 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, the host for the ceremony and the squadron's parent organization. The parade field is in the brigade area at Jackson and Letterman streets. The squadron is designed to conduct Reconnaissance and Surveillance operations for divisions, corps and joint task forces, Cox said. The commanders of those large units have a \\"near-insatiable appetite for persistent Surveillance during the day and night, in all weather conditions\\", he said. \\"Army architects developed a blueprint for a multifunctional organization that blends ground cavalry troops with a Long Range Surveillance company, which is Airborne\\", Cox said. The Long Range Surveillance company's Soldiers stood in the formation wearing the elite Maroon Beret of Airborne Soldiers. Other Soldiers wore the Army's standard black beret. The newly activated unit is the Army's first Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S; Squadron) within the newly formed Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB)s, Cox said. \\"Scouts, Snipers, Paratroopers, artillerymen, tactical air controllers, combat medics, coupled with communications and intelligence personnel, can just about accomplish any mission\\", Cox said. The squadron soon will add unmanned aerial vehicles, Cox said. The commander is Lieutenant Colonel Jim Gaylord, who graduated from West Point in 1992 and was commissioned as an armor officer. Earlier this month, he made his first parachute jump in more than 17 years, Cox said. \\"So he is no longer referred to as the item attached to the back of a chicken, that being a dirty, nasty leg\\", Cox said. \\"Leg\\" is a disparaging term used by some Paratroopers for non-airborne personnel. \\"Although we are activating a new unit, we have a wealth of experience in the ranks\\", Gaylord said. Of the squadron's Soldiers, 128 have been deployed and served a combined 1,560 months in combat zones, he said. Four have Purple Hearts for combat wounds, and four have valor awards. \\"I'd also like to point out we have at least one cavalryman who can ride a horse\\", Gaylord said. Command Sgt. Maj. Eric Dostie, who was trained as a cavalry scout, is the senior noncommissioned officer. He was a Sheridan tank gunner in the 194th Separate Armored Brigade at Fort Knox, Ky. The 282nd Army Band from Fort Jackson, SC, played \\"Gary Owen\\", a traditional cavalry tune, as the Soldiers marched off the parade field. Transformation Former units consisted of one active component and two inactive detachments, there are now both Active-duty and National Guard Surveillance Brigades, each having a specific Table of Organization and Equipment. The changes made were all part of an Army-wide transition to the Army Modular Force, future-concept (\\"Grow The Army Plan\\" of modernization) proposed by US Army Chief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker in 2007. The plan calls for ten Surveillance Brigades, three of which are active units: the 504th BfSB at Fort Hood, Texas; the 525th BfSB at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the 201st BfSB at Fort Lewis, Washington. The planned fourth active BfSB to have been stationed at Ft. Polk, Louisiana, had its activation cancelled. The remaining seven BfSB's are designated to the Army National Guard: the 58th BfSB from Maryland, the 67th BFSB from Nebraska, the 71st BfSB from Texas, the 142nd BfSB from Alabama, the 219th BfSB from Indiana, the 297th BfSB from Alaska, and the 560th BfSB from Georgia, all of which are moving to the objective designs by the scheduled completion of the Grow The Army Plan by fiscal year 2013. Contrast with Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) units The BfSB's R&S; Squadron and specifically its obsolete LRS unit (Airborne Infantry \\"Recon\\" Company) are not to be confused with the new Army concept of elite Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) units (a non-Airborne capable Cavalry basic tactical Reconnaissance unit). RSTA units are a part of the Army-wide transfer to Brigade Combat Teams, all combat divisions and separate brigades are transitioning to the RSTA format, The Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron is a specialized unit within the US Army's new Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB) that blends ground Cavalry troops with an Elite Long Range Surveillance (LRS) Airborne Infantry Company for the purpose of executing strategic level Long Range Surveillance missions deep within enemy lines. RSTA units are not Airborne capable, whereas all LRS units are (exceptions being the RSTA squadron of the 4th BCT (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division; the 173rd Airborne BCT; and the four in the 82nd Airborne Division). By doctrine, RSTA units do not require their leadership positions to be filled by Ranger qualified officers and NCOs as LRSU units do in addition to many more specialized skill qualifications through extensive training. Training LRSUs are Airborne Forces and most leadership positions are filled by Ranger qualified officers and NCOs. LRS leaders typically undergo the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC) at Fort Benning, where they learn long-range land navigation, communications, intelligence, vehicle identification, survival, and operational techniques. LRS troopers are often graduates of other specialized schools including: the U.S. Army Sniper School, Special Operations Target Interdiction Course (SOITC), US Army Ranger School, Waterborne Infiltration Course (WIC), Special Forces Combat Diver Qualification Course, HALO, Reconnaissance Surveillance Leaders Course RSLC (Formerly designated as the Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course (LRSLC)), Pathfinder, Air Assault School, Jumpmaster, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE). Long Range Surveillance Combat Medics, similar to the 75th Ranger Regiment are required to graduate the Special Operations Medicine Course and many US Army LRS Troopers attend the International Special Training Center (ISTC)'s, the ISTC trains NATO Special Operations Forces, and similar type units, in advanced individual Patrolling, Battlefield Medicine, Close Quarter Battle, Sniper, Survival, Planning, and Recognition Skills. It was established in 1979, and first called the International Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol School (ILRRPS) formerly located in Weingarten, Germany and later move to Pfullendorf, Germany. US Army LRS-Us conduct training exercises and exchange programs with various US allies. In recent years these exercises have included deployments to England, Germany, France, Hungary, and Italy. Joint training exercises have involved units from British TA SAS, France's 13 RDP, Belgium's ESR, Italy's 9 Para Assault Regiment, and Germany's Fernsp√§hlehrkompanie 200 Long Range Scout Companies or FSLK200 (roughly translated: Surveillance and Reconnaissance Instruction Company 200).

A maker of auto air conditioning units, the firm has diversified into the production of household appliances and cell phones, which are now its main source of revenue. History Mirgor was founded by Nicol√°s Caputo and Mauricio Macri in 1983. The Caputo family had established a construction firm in 1932, and in 1965 Caputo S.A. was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. Mirgor was created to supply air conditioning units for the nation's growing auto industry. In October 1983, the firm opened its first manufacturing plant in R√≠o Grande, Tierra del Fuego. Mauricio Macri, Francisco's scion and best friend of Nicol√°s Caputo (president of the Caputo group), was involved in the management of the company between 1983 and 1994, when he left in order to prepare his campaign for the presidency of Boca Juniors. Francisco Macri had purchased SEVEL, a joint venture between the local subsidiaries of automakers Fiat and Peugeot, in 1982. Mirgor became SEVEL's supplier of auto air conditioners, beginning with the Peugeot 504 manufactured in Argentina at the time. The company extended its contract with SEVEL to begin supplying the firm's Fiat and Chevrolet plants in 1985. It began manufacturing radiators, under license from the Harrison Radiator Corporation (a division of General Motors), and in 1986 obtained a license to produce climate control systems from French auto parts maker Valeo to supply SEVEL's Renault 9 & 11 lines. The economic recovery and resulting rise in auto sales during the early 1990s bolstered Mirgor's fortunes, and in 1994, the company was listed on the Buenos Aires and London Stock Exchanges; it also became available on the New York Stock Exchange on an ADR and ADS basis. The company continued to grow, and in 1995 purchased Interclima, a maker of condenser coils. It signed supply contracts for Daimler-Benz's and Volkswagen's Argentine operations in 1996, and its first export contracts, for Fiat Brazil and Citro√´n Uruguay, were signed in 1997. A condenser factory was launched in La Tablada (near Buenos Aires) in 1998, and new supply chains were established for Chrysler the following year. Valeo owned a stake in Mirgor from 1996 to 2005. Mirgor was diversified in subsequent years. It entered the household air conditioning sector in 2004 with the production of Interclima split units (popular in Buenos Aires apartment buildings) under license from Carrier Corporation. It signed similar contracts with LG and Whirlpool in 2008 and 2009, extending these to the manufacture of microwave ovens. This venture, IATEC, became the exclusive local manufacturer of Nokia cell phones, as well, in 2010. IATEC's Nokia assembly grew quickly, and in 2011 the company announced a US$86 million investment at its Tierra del Fuego plant to triple its capacity to 2.2 million units a year. Since 2014, IATEC also produces Samsung cell phones. On April 2016, the company re-entered the most important index of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the MERVAL. It had previously been part of it during 2011.

It is an all composite design. Development and design The TST-14J is a Desert Aerospace, LLC modification of the TST-14 motorglider with the addition of a retractable jet engine used for self launching. It has a high T-tail. It is a mid wing design with straight tapered wings. The wing tips carry winglets and there are outboard ailerons, two position flaps and upper surface spoilers. The fuselage of the TST-14J is built from two half shells which incorporate the straight tapered fin. The fuselage tapers rearwards, producing an arched shape below. The tailplane carries a single piece elevator. The cockpit has a forward hinged, single piece canopy, and a side hinged passenger canopy. The TST-14J has a tailwheel undercarriage, with spatted mainwheels on fuselage- mounted, sprung, cantilever legs. The 45 lb PBS TJ-100 turbine engine requires a two-minute cooldown before retracting into the fuselage.

They are also known as les enfants nantais. Their feast day is 24 May.  Life  Cath√©drale de Nantes. The story of St. Donatian and his brother St. Rogatian is known from a 5th century document, \\"the Passion of Children of Nantes\\". This is the basis for all later works, which also added some extra information to the legend,Rodolphe Delaroque, ¬´ Sur les pas des enfants nantais ¬ª, Nantes au quotidien, no 136, juin 2003, p. 31. for example the tradition that they were related to a \\"illustrious\\" Armorican family.Cath√©drales et basiliques de Bretagne, EREME, 2009, p. 75. St. Donatian and St. Rogatian were, it seems, the sons of the first magistrate of the city. Donatian, the youngest, was baptized (probably by St. Similien, third bishop of Nantes, who outlived them). Donatian then evangelized his older brother, Rogatian. The family property, a Gallo-Roman villa, also home to the first Christian church built in Nantes, stood on the site of the current Basilica of St. Donatien-et-Saint-Rogatien. According to tradition, the church was built at the location of their graves, which was in their home, as was customary.Rodolphe Delaroque, ¬´ Sur les pas des enfants nantais ¬ª, Nantes au quotidien, no 136, juin 2003, p. 29. According to the story, after being denounced as Christians, they were arrested and appeared before the imperial prefect, the provincial governor, who asked them to sacrifice to idols. When they refused, they were tortured and spent their last night praying together. That night, Rogatian regretted that he was going to die without being baptized, but his brother reassured him, telling him that the blood of his martyrdom would take the place of baptism. They were pierced by the spear of a lictor and then beheaded on the morning of 24 May 304. According to tradition,Henri de Berranger, √âvocation du vieux Nantes, √âd. de Minuit, 1966, 300 p.

Early ceramics in the area were rough and utilitarian, for such purposes as cooking, carrying water or storing seeds. Some of these were multicolored, but the decorated faded because the pieces were not fired after painting. The Spanish introduced European techniques to the area, especially the potter's wheel to make more symmetrical containers and glazing to keep color and give a bright finish. Spanish introduced ceramics were slowly adopted by the indigenous population in most of New Spain but in Jalisco, their adoption was relatively quick. Demand was high, spurring a developed ceramics industry in the Guadalajara area. The ceramics industry was established by monks who not only evangelized the indigenous, they also taught them trades, such as European style pottery. The training allowed for indigenous traditions, such as burnishing to be combined with the use of high quality clay slips. It also allowed for a decorating styles influenced by European, indigenous and Oriental motifs. The Tonal√° tradition became known as \\"Tonal√° ware\\" \\"Polished ornamental ware\\" or \\"Guadalajara polychrome.\\" A number of these pieces were exported Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, mostly to Spain but examples reached Italy and other areas. However, in the later colonial period ceramics waned in Tlaquepaque, coming back in the 19th century with jars and Nativity scenes. One item which seems luxurious today, but was probably relatively ordinary in colonial period was large ceramic bathtubs, which were richly decorated inside and out with images such as Saint James on horseback, the patron saint of the locality, double headed eagles and other motif surrounded by vegetative images, flowers, thick and thin lines and more. In the 1950s and 1960s, Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards introduced more modern high-fire ceramics to the Guadalajara area, starting in Tonal√°. These are wares fired at over 1000C which vitrifies the clay and eliminates the need for lead-based glazes. Wilmot mostly kept local traditional designs although some Oriental influence is mixed in as well, along with Asian glazing processes. Edwards introduced new designs with the techniques. Today, Jalisco's ceramics stand out for their variety, unique decoration and various style noted for their quality, well known nationally and internationally. Jalisco has a particularly strong ceramics tradition in Mexico, not only for its variety but as part of the culture. Barro bru√±ido is recognized as part of the state and international as distinctively Mexican. Starting in the 1990s, the wholesale market for ceramics waned because of the overvalued peso and markets opening to cheaper Asian ceramics, especially from China. The economic changes of the past decades have put pressure on Jalisco's ceramic industry as it competes with Asian imports. To help Jalisco potters stay competitive, the Museo Regional de la Cer√°mica has added a design center to help train local artisans in new designs and techniques. Most workshops and other producers in the state are still small, with only a few formal enough to undertake export. Most artisans in the state are part of the \\"informal economy\\" without formal government registration, making census of the industry difficult. However, it is estimated that handcrafts in general, which ceramics is the most important, generates about 80,000 jobs in the state. Some artisans have moved into specialty markets such as Artesanias Erandi, selling lead-free, hand painted glazed ceramics, popular with US buyers for its rustic and ethnic look. It is high fire but maintains traditional designs. Traditional ceramic styles Jars and tiles on display at the Museo Regional de la Cer√°mica A wide variety of traditional low-fire and some high fire ceramics are made in Jalisco, ranging from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are Tonal√° and Tlaquepaque.Hopkins and Muller 99 Traditional ceramics styles include \\"bru√±ido\\", \\"bandera\\", \\"canelo\\", \\"petate\\" and \\"betus\\". The best known of these styles is bru√±ido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name comes from the fact that these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for bathing. Water stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the clay, which is actually desired by many people. Another exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones or carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonal√°.Hopkins and Muller 100‚Äì102 One variant of bru√±ido is black, which is often made into jars, flower vases, platters and skulls for Day of the Dead . Canelo is a type of bru√±ido is named for the color the fired clay turns out, which is various shades of cinnamon (canela in Spanish). It is burnished with lard and painted with ochre and brown tones. The decorative lines are generally horizontal with different thicknesses and tone with other stylized objects such as leaves, waves and more added. It is popular and used mainly for water jugs because it is good for keeping liquid cool. It is also used to make cooking pots and dry storage containers. Bandera, which means \\"flag\\" in Spanish, is so named because it has the green-red-and-white colors of the Mexican flag. Like, bru√±ido, it is also an unglazed burnished ware. For unknown reasons, this style of pottery is very rare.Hopkins and Muller 101 The base of this pottery is a red burnished slip which serves as a background for floral decorated painted on. The designs are outlined by a green derived from copper and then filled in with a kaolin white. These three colors are also on the Mexican flag, giving the ceramic style its name. It is not a common type of pottery but most of what is produced is of high quality, often in Roman style storage jars and water storage containers with a long neck. Petate or petalillo pottery is distinguished by having a light yellow background filled with crosshatching, which looks like a woven palm mat, called a petate. According to Jos√© Bernab√©, barro petate began when two potters by the name of Magdaleno Gold√≠var and Jos√© Cervantes began to fill the background with a fine crosshatching. The Bernab√© family started experimenting with this decorative style around 1840. The decorative style require very fine white clay in order to create a very smooth painting surface. The main design over the crosshatching is usually painted in black and occasionally in green. These include images of plants and animals, especially deer, rabbits, eagles, roosters and swans.Hopkins and Muller 98‚Äì99 The tighter the crosshatching is, the finer the piece. This type of pottery is used to make mugs for hot chocolate, platters, large bowls and some animal and human figures. This ware is painted before firing at 900C for five or six hours, glazed, and then fired again. The resulting ceramic resists temperatures of up to 3000C. The work involved in the decoration makes this one of the more expensive types of Mexican ceramic, and for this reason, it is most commonly seen on large, relatively flat platters. A giant urn in this style can take up to three years to complete.Hopkins and Muller 98‚Äì99 The two most famous masters of this type of pottery were Pedro Ch√°vez and Jos√© Bernab√©, but their families continue to make it. Betus pottery is characterized by vibrant colors that give the ceramics a whimsical look. This style derives its name from the betus oil the clayware is immersed in before it is fired. The oil, which is made of a resin extracted from pine trees, gives the painted pottery a brilliant sheen. One uncommon ware is called engregado. These objects have a special varnish that make them useful for cooking, the varnish acting like a coating of Teflon that prevents food from slicking when heated. High fire Stoneware plates on display at the Jorge Wilmot exhibition at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City. Jalisco's high- fire ware is of the best produced in the country. High fire ceramics, including stoneware, were introduced to Jalisco by Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards in 1950s and 1960s, making Tonal√° the first and primary production of this type of ceramic in Mexico. This production is considered between industrial and traditional handcrafted ceramic. These are fired at over 1,100 ¬∞C, causing the clay to vitrify and form a nonporous surface. The main difference between the Wilmot and Edwards styles is that Wilmot maintained the area's traditional decorative styles, focusing on images of suns, birds, eagles, lions and flowers. He also founded a new school of ceramic production which remains to this day, using a traditional green-gray background with images made of small dots, often of double headed eagles, lions and multicolored suns. Edwards' ceramics have a blue-gray backgrounda and delicate decorations with Oriental influence. Workshops from both traditions create elaborate bowls, jars, flower vases, and decorative pieces such as fish figures from miniatures to those measuring fifty centimeters. Wilmot created the Premio Nacional de la Cer√°mica in 1977 with two categories, traditional and contemporary ceramics. In the last twenty years, new categories have been added. In 1997, a museum dedicated to prize winners was inaugurated as the Museo del Premio Nacional de la Cer√°mica Pantale√≥n Panduro, named after a famous artisan. The museum not only displays winning pieces, it also shows the success that Jalisco potters have had in Europe and other places in the world. Major high fire ceramics workshops today include Netzi, whose bowls has a gray enamel in the inside, with the exteriors finished with a textured yellow, similar to cork, earning it the name of \\"corcho.\\" The workshop of No√© Suro makes decorative spheres in cobalt blue in a modern style. Stoneware is produced by El Palomar and some other factories in Tlaquepaque. Another high- fire ware is of the white kaolin type by factories such as Loza Fina and Cer√°mica Contempor√°nea Suro. The last is a family run operation that caters to chefs, designers, architects, and artists. The workshop primarily make dishes in all shapes and sizes, but items such as lamps and decorative pieces as well. The pieces are generally made to order based on designs preapproved by the client. Orders range in size for a setting for four to the entire dish set for restaurants. Many of their clients buy wares in bulk although there is no minimum. Tonal√° Ceramic animal figures from Tonal√° Tlaquepaque and Tonal√° are Jalisco's major ceramics centers with international recognition for their techniques and decorative styles, with high fire ceramics their most important production. The best clay in Jalisco is found in the Tonal√° and Tlaquepaque areas, especially that in the El Rosario community. This clay is so fine, that the resulting works are similar to porcelain. Tonal√° has long been recognized as a center for ceramics in Mexico. The streets are filled with artisan workshops and sidewalks stalls selling pottery and stoneware pieces. One thing that distinguishes Tonal√° made ware is the decorative details. Two elements, the nahual and the \\"flor de Tonal√°\\" are common. A nahual is a pre-Hispanic shape shifter or shaman, often drawn as a smiling cat. The flor de Tonal√° (Tonal√° flower) first appeared in pottery design in the early 20th century. Its distinctive shape is an oval center with rounded petals that form a scalloped design. These elements can appear in all of the types of pottery that is produced here. Market days, Thursday and Sunday, are a good chance to see a wide variety of ceramics of the region, all spread out on the streets of the downtown. While there are a wide variety of figures, utensils and decorative items, it is not all that is produced. Many manufacturers sell their wares through other channels. To find the best pieces, one needs to visit the workshops and factories. Tonal√° is known for its \\"barro de olor\\" (lit. aromatic clay) because the pieces made from it transmit its smell and flavor to water containers, especially the bru√±ido pieces, which is also an important ceramics for the town. One common type of bru√±ido or canelo item is animal figures, especially cats in Oriental poses, made by a molding process. Other common animals include ducks, fish, toucans, owls, chickens and doves. Another common ceramic is a kind of piggy bank, along with platters and plates, often decorated with vegetative motifs. One noted family from Tonal√° in burnished pottery is the Jim√≥n family. Another popular item are piggy banks which are painted in bright colors and glazed. High fire ceramics produced in Tonal√° include a series of cooking pots which nestled one inside the other. The town hosts an annual ceramics competition called the Concurso Nacional de la Cer√°mica Tonallan. In 2011, the total purse was 585,000 pesos, which was awarded to thirty two winners from fourteen different states in Mexico. The municipality is home to the Museo Nacional de la Cer√°mica (National Ceramic Museum), which director Prudencio Guzman Rodriguez considers to be a \\"link between Tonal√°'s tradition and people interested in researching our tradition\\". Established in 1986, the museum has a collection of 1000 pieces that range from pre-Hispanic artifacts to contemporary prizewinners. The institution was begun when a board of local artisans and businessmen with sculptors Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards to find a way to promote the ceramic tradition here. Many of the artifacts are on loan from the Instituto Nacional Indigenista (National Indigenous Institute), and a number were donated by Wilmot. The rest of the pieces are prizewinners from the Certamen Estatal de la Cer√°mica (State Ceramic Contest). Unfortunately by the mid-1990s, the museum has to close due to lack of funds and maintenance. The municipality stepped in and the museum was reopened in 1996. The collection contains pieces created by some of the most renowned artisans of the area and are of the styles most typical to Tonal√° such as bru√±ido, bandera, petatillo and canelo. Artists and artisans represented include Salvador V√°squez, Juan Antonio Mateo, Ger√≥nimo Ramos, Nicasio Pajarito, Candelario Medrano, Jorge Wilmot and Ken Edwards. Near Tonal√° are the small communities of Salatitl√°n, El Rosario and Tateposco which are also ceramics centers. Salatitl√°n is known for clay whistles formed by molds into shapes such as human and animal figures. El Rosario produces barro canelo but mostly as miniatures and toys such as miniature cookware. Another popular liquid container in the Tonala area is the tinaja, a squat jug with a handle at the top and a small spout.Hopkins and Muller 102 In Santa Cruz de la Huerta, near Tonala, specializes in clay drainpipes, some crudely fashioned toys and whistles in the shape of animals. Most of these products are sold in public markets. One exception to this is the work of Candelario Medrano, who makes curious, sometimes grotesque sculptures. In his workshop can be found double decked boats, church buildings with miniature people, and animals such as lions, roosters and owls with savage human faces. They tend to be large pieces, made partly by mold and partly by hand, then painted in bright, clashing acrylics. Tlaquepaque Stoneware vase with nahuals from Jalisco Tlaquepaque is from the name Tlacapan, which roughly translates to \\"men who make clay utensils with their hands\\". The ceramics industry is based on seven different types of clay that are in the area. Much of the best ceramic of Tlaquepaque is sold in the various galleries that are in the town center along with other area crafts. One specialty is the making of human figures, called \\"tipos populares\\" (\\"common guys\\") that measure between ten and twenty five centimeters in height. These figures include farmers, horsemen, fruit sellers, milkmen, fishermen, drunks and children playing. Other figures include creatures called \\"duendes\\" and sets for Nativity scenes. The heads, feet and hands are created through the use of molds but the bodies are handcrafted, often with elaborate detail, and painted in various colors. The main significance of many of these pieces is that they represent Mexico of the 19th century. Another series of figures includes all of the presidents of Mexico, complete or in bust form. Most of these measure about twelve centimeters. The most famous workshop here is that of the Panduro family, which maintain a set of molds from the 19th century. The Carranza family also makes figures, but uses wire frames as the basis for the figures, which are then covered in small balls of clay. These figures usually related to popular festivals such as bullfights, jaripeos and charreadas as well as Nativity scenes. About 2,000 artisans such as Jose Garcia Quinones in Tlaquepaque preserve the tradition of making nativity scenes and other figures from clay. These nativity scenes can be whimsical with non-tradition animals such as lions and giraffe and even the Devil can appear. Garcia Quinones has won prizes for his work since he was a boy and each year for thirty years has sold his wares in Mexico City. Like other potters, the pieces are made at a home workshop with all members of the family contributing to the creation. Another potter, Justino Estuvier, over 70 years old, exports his wares to Spain. However, this aspect of the ceramics industry is fading in the municipality with far fewer potters than there used to be. Common artisans there battle to survive against the proliferation of plastic and cheaper ceramics from Asia. The average handcrafted nativity scene sells in Mexico for 350 pesos, when cheaper mass-produced ones sell for 160. There are potters in Tlaquepaque that specialized in doing portraits of famous people in clay, including 19th-century presidents Porfiro D√≠az and Benito Ju√°rez. Pantale√≥n Panduro's portrait of D√≠az was so good that the president himself offered to send the artisan to Italy to study, but Panduro declined. The Museo del Premio Nacional de la Ceramica Pantaleon Panduro is named after him, dedicated to exhibiting pieces from the Concurso Nacional de la Cer√°mica Tonallan and other competitions. It is the only one of its kind in Mexico dedicated to all of the various types of ceramics produced in the country. The works are organized by technique, origin and type of prize won. The Museo Regional de la Ceramica is run by the Instituto de la Artesan√≠a Jalisciense and the state government of Jalisco. It was founded in 1954 by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista and INAH. In 2011, the museum received on permanent loan two thousand pieces from the collection of the Comisi√≥n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas for exhibition. This agreement is part of the museum's mission to emphasise the handcrafts and art of indigenous peoples. Other ceramic centers Another area noted for its ceramics is Sayula since the 19th century. One distinguishing characteristic is a blue tone which has not been duplicated anywhere else in the state. Sayula work reached its peak in the 19th century. Since then, however, the ceramics tradition here has been almost completely lost. Sayula pottery of the majolica type which uses a fine white clay. At its height, the work was sought by hacienda owners and the clergy. Background colors are applied as a slip and traditionally are of three colors, white, blue and pink, the last two being uncommon in majolica pottery. Decorative elements are almost always floral and/or vegetative and simple geometric patterns. Occasionally, figures such as humans and animals appear. Much of this ceramic is found as containers and as tiles, with tiles found on the houses and churches of the Sayula area. They can also be seen at the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Gracia in Guadalajara and the tiles on the city cathedral is also thought to come from here. Most of the production of this area is anonymous but some artisans do stand out such as Epigmenio Vargas and Isidro Real. It is thought that the major production of the area ended with the building of the railroads, which subjected the ceramic to competition. Santa Cruz de las Huertas is near Guadalajara and known for its toys. Traditional piggy banks from here are black as well as a number of figures such as circus performers. Other items include multicolored whistles made of barro betus which are usually sold by the dozen. The most noted artisan from here is Candelario Medrano, who founded a style of ceramics followed by the area's artisans. Many of the toy figures produced here are large, multicolored and often of fantastic creatures such as lions with sun faces. Other toy sets include churches, kiosks and representations of Noah's Ark. This community also produces ceramic masks used to for the community's \\"Tastoanes\\" traditional dance.

Radio. Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow. Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of dramatic monologue, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in poetry and drama, but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary. It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a tragedy.\\"Razen: The Science of Sleep\\". , USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.

Combat Theater Base Ready Reaction Force The Ready Reaction Force, RRF, is the first response to the military's quick reaction force, generally platoon-sized unit in the United States Army, designed and capable of rapid response to situations that develop in a very short time frame. The time frame for a ready reaction force is minutes, typically within ten minutes or less, working from a base in a forward combat zone that is generally performed by infantry, military police or cavalry units based on said unit's standard operating procedures (SOPs). These such RRFs are designed to intervene quickly as a spearhead to gain and hold ground in quickly unfolding combat or low- intensity conflicts, such as civil unrest that necessitate the defense of strategic and tactical locations of interest, an attack on a military outpost or operating base or two insurgent activity within their area of operation (AO). The RRF is a modern military reserve, and belongs directly to the commander of the unit it is created from. Depending on the unit size and protocols, the commander may be the only person authorized to control the RRF force, or he may delegate this responsibility to one or more additional people. RRF forces are commonly found in maneuver battalion-level task forces and above, in addition to many operating bases having their own dedicated RRF to react to threats on or immediately around the base. The readiness level of the RRF is based on unit SOPs. Since maintaining a split-second level of readiness is draining on equipment, fuel and personnel, the RRF is postured based on the likelihood of being called up. During high-intensity conflict, the RRF may be forced to maintain that split-second level of readiness, and have all members in their vehicles with the motors running. However, during low-intensity conflict, where deployment is less likely and may be more readily predicted, the command establishes how fast the RRF must be able to react, which can range from trucks and personnel in a central location with the troops rotating out of the trucks to the vehicles simply staged close to a unit area, with all personnel staying close enough for rapid recall. The speed at which a RRF is expected to react is defined by its Readiness Condition, or REDCON, level. The mission of a RRF can vary widely, as they are used to respond to any threat the commander chooses to employ them for. A US Army RRF consists of a variable number of trucks, generally a mix of M1151 Up-Armored HMMWVs and, since their introduction, MRAPs. Depending on the mission requirement, additional units can be attached to an organic platoon to expand their capabilities. Examples include attaching Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), teams to a RRF responding to bombs or similar threats and vehicle recovery assets to a RRF expected to recover damaged trucks. Large Scale Ready Reaction Force Large scale Ready Reaction Force used in peacetime such as with the use of US Army's Paratroopers (82nd Airborne Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team), US Army's Airborne Rangers of the 75th Ranger Regiment, United States Marine Corps/USMC's Force Reconnaissance units, US Navy SEALs and United States Army Special Forces and US Air Force's Special Tactics Squadrons, the time frame is sometimes hours to days depending on the geographical location and scale of operation. Because they are usually transported by air, such military units are usually lightly armed, but extremely well trained to compensate for their lower caliber, small arms weaponry and lack of heavy equipment like tanks and other armored vehicles that will soon follow by the larger \\"heavy\\" units that are to sustain and hold the ground that the RRF has captured and/or controlled from the spearheaded efforts.

Allen received police protection due to her relationship with Sergeant Elmer V. Jackson of the L.A.P.D.'s administrative vice squad, who reportedly was her lover. Early career Allen began as a sex worker in Los Angeles in the 1930s, though she already had several prior morals charges in other US cities. She rose to prominence around 1940 as the successor to Ann Forrester (aka \\"Black Widow\\"), who had previously run a $5,000-a-week prostitution syndicate but was convicted and handed a prison sentence.Los Angeles Times Rasmussen, Cecilia; History of Hollywood Madams Is Long, Lurid; November 30, 1997, Web August 30, 2011 Scandal After an attempted robbery of Brenda Allen and Sergeant Jackson in which Jackson shot and killed the perpetrator, the press and other members of the police became aware of their relationship. Wiretaps led to the arrest of Allen and the resulting publicity to the convening of a grand jury. The publicity from the grand jury revelations of police corruption led to the resignation of L.A.P.D. Chief Clemence B. Horrall and his replacement by retired Marine Major General William A. Worton, who had served with the Marine Corps' III Amphibious Corps at the Battle of Okinawa. Reform Worton was appointed by L.A. mayor Fletcher Bowron on a temporary basis. He served from July 1949 to August 1950, when he was replaced as chief by William H. Parker, who had served the general as a special aide and then as head of Internal Affairs (Horrall's deputy chief, Joe Reed, also resigned after being shamed by grand jury testimony.) It was Parker, in his 16-year reign as police chief, who is credited with cleaning up the L.A.P.D. Cultural impact The relationship between Allen and Jackson was depicted in author John Gregory Dunne's 1977 novel True Confessions, which was later turned into a movie starring Robert de Niro and Robert Duvall (as Jackson). Brenda Allen was played by Joan Van Ark in the CBS made-for-television film Shakedown on the Sunset Strip (1988). The story of Brenda Allen also plays a role in the 2011 video game L.A. Noire. The scandal appears in the James Ellroy novels The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, Perfidia and This Storm, and is mentioned extensively in the book LAPD '53 for which Ellroy provided text to photographs provided by the Los Angeles Police Museum.

Like other artworks by Klee, it blends biology and machinery, depicting a loosely sketched group of birds on a wire or branch connected to a hand-crank. Interpretations of the work vary widely: it has been perceived as a nightmarish lure for the viewer or a depiction of the helplessness of the artist, but also as a triumph of nature over mechanical pursuits. It has been seen as a visual representation of the mechanics of sound. Originally displayed in Germany, the image was declared \\"degenerate art\\" by Adolf Hitler in 1933 and sold by the Nazi Party to an art dealer in 1939, whence it made its way to New York. One of the better known of more than 9,000 works produced by Klee, it is among the more famous images of the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It has inspired several musical compositions and, according to a 1987 magazine profile in New York Magazine, has been a popular piece to hang in children's bedrooms. Description The picture depicts a group of birds, largely line drawings; all save the first are shackled on a wire or, according to The Washington Post, a \\"sine-wave branch\\" over a blue and purple background which the MoMA equates with the \\"misty cool blue of night giving way to the pink flow of dawn\\". Each of the birds is open-beaked, with a jagged or rounded shape emerging from its mouth, widely interpreted as its protruding tongue. The end of the perch dips into a crank. Critical analysis Twittering Machine has invited very different opinions on its meaning, which Gardner's Art Through the Ages (2009) suggests is characteristic of Klee's work: \\"Perhaps no other artist of the 20th century matched Klee's subtlety as he deftly created a world of ambiguity and understatement that draws each viewer into finding a unique interpretation of the work.\\"Kleiner (2009), p. 724. The image has frequently been perceived as whimsical, with a 1941 article in the Hartford Courant describing it as \\"characterized by the exquisite absurdity of Lewis Carroll's \\"Twas brillig and the slithy toves\\" and The Riverside Dictionary of Biography placing it in \\"a very personal world of free fancy\\".Michael (1941). Sometimes, the image is perceived as quite dark. MoMA suggests that, while evocative of an \\"abbreviated pastoral\\", the painting inspires \\"an uneasy sensation of looming menace\\" as the birds themselves \\"appear closer to deformations of nature\\". They speculate that the \\"twittering machine\\" may in fact be a music box that produces a \\"fiendish cacophony\\" as it \\"lure[s] victims to the pit over which the machine hovers\\". Kay Larson of New York magazine (1987), too, found menace in the image, which she describes as \\"a fierce parable of the artist's life among the philistines\\": \\"Like Charles Chaplin caught in the gears of Modern Times, they [the birds] whir helplessly, their heads flopping in exhaustion and pathos. One bird's tongue flies up out of its beak, an exclamation point punctuating its grim fate‚Äîto chirp under compulsion.\\"Larson (1987), p. 96. Without drawing conclusions on emotional impact, Werckmeister, in 1989's The Making of Paul Klee's Career, sees a deliberate blending of birds and machine, suggesting the piece is part of Klee's general interest in \\"the formal equation between animal and machine, between organism and mechanism\\" (similar to the ambiguity between bird and airplane in a number of works).Werckmeister (1989), p. 240‚Äì241. According to Wheye and Kennedy (2008), the painting is often interpreted as \\"a contemptuous satire of laboratory science\\". Arthur Danto, who does not see the birds as deformed mechanical creatures but instead as separate living elements, speculates in Encounters & Reflections (1997) that \\"Klee is making some kind of point about the futility of machines, almost humanizing machines into things from which nothing great is to be hoped or feared, and the futility in this case is underscored by the silly project of bringing forth by mechanical means what nature in any case provides in abundance.\\" Danto believes that perhaps this machine has been abandoned, the birds opportunistically using it as a perch from which they issue the sounds the inert machine is failing to produce. Danto also suggests, conversely, that the painting may mean simply that \\"it might not be a bad thing if we bent our gifts to the artificial generation of bird songs.\\" Wheye and Kennedy suggest that the picture may represent a sound spectrograph, with the heads of the birds perhaps representing musical notes and the size, shape and direction of their tongues suggesting the \\"volume, intensity, degree of trilling, and degree of shrillness of their voices\\". This reflects the earlier view of Soby's Contemporary Painters (1948) that: > The bird with an exclamation point in its mouth represents the twitter's > full volume; the one with an arrow in its beak symbolizes an accompanying > shrillness ‚Äì a horizontal thrust of piercing song. Since a characteristic of > chirping birds is that their racket resumes as soon as it seems to be > ending, the bird in the center droops with lolling tongue, while another > begins to falter in song; both birds will come up again full blast as soon > as the machine's crank is turned.Soby (1948), p. 99. History The Swiss-born Klee had been teaching at the Bauhaus school in Germany for a year when he completed this ink drawing on watercolor in 1922.Kreinik and Zucker The work was displayed for several years in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin until Adolf Hitler declared it and many other works by the Swiss-born Klee \\"degenerate art\\" in 1933.Wheye and Kennedy (2008), p. 79. The Nazis seized the painting and sold it in 1939 for $120 to an art dealer in Berlin.Shottenkirk (2006). The New York MoMA purchased the painting that same year.Perl (2007), p. 91. Although Klee produced more than 9,000 works in his lifetime, Twittering Machine has become one of his better known images.American Heritage Dictionary (2004), 453. According to Danto, the painting is \\"one of the best-known treasures at the Museum of Modern Art\\".Danto (1997), p. 84. Legacy The son of a musicologist, Klee himself drew parallels between sound and art, and Twittering Machine has been influential on several composers.Time (1960) In fact, as of 2018, Klee's painting has inspired more musical compositions than any other single piece of art, with more than 100 examples, from full symphony orchestra to solo piano. The first such work is the 1951 orchestral work Die Zwitschermaschine by German composer Giselher Klebe; probably its two most famous appearances are as movement four in David Diamond's 1957 four-movement \\"The World of Paul Klee\\" and as the fourth movement of Gunther Schuller's \\"Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee\\", composed in 1959.Milwaukee Sentinel (1991). According to Time magazine, the two composers drew very different interpretations from the piece, with Schuller's work consisting of a \\"snatch of serial music in which the orchestra beeped, squeaked and rasped like a rusty hinge while the muted brasses burped out shreds of sound\\" while Diamond drew on \\"more somber tones: muted, dark-hued movements of the strings, with the picture's more jagged lines delineated by scampering woodwinds and brasses.\\" Larson wrote in New York Magazine (1987) that the image was then \\"embedded in childhood prehistory\\", commenting that it \\"always seemed to be taped to kids' bedroom walls, next to Rousseau's The Sleeping Gypsy\\".

Plot Dinah Hunter (Yvette Mimieux) is an advertising executive living in Los Angeles who quits her job after arguing with a client and comes home to find her boyfriend in the swimming pool with another woman. Sick of his constant philandering, she calls a friend and gets her old job back in New York City. Driving cross-country from Los Angeles, Dinah picks up a young man, named Bobby Ray (Robert Carradine), and his pregnant girlfriend Lola (Nancy Lee Noble). That night, Bobby Ray and Lola rob Dinah and steal her car and purse. Dinah walks into an empty bar and asks Dan Oldum, the bartender, to use his phone to call the police to report the robbery, but the barman attempts to rape her, and after she defends herself, a policeman, named Deputy Burt, arrives and Oldum lies by telling him that Dinah attacked him. With no money or identification on her, the policeman believes Oldum and arrests Dinah and takes her to the Jackson County jail. The next day, Dinah is in a jail cell next to Blake (Tommy Lee Jones), a drifter whom she witnessed getting arrested earlier after a car accident. Sheriff Dempsey explains to Dinah that until he can get through to Los Angeles or New York to verify her identity, she has to stay in jail. He then tells Blake that he is to be extradited to Texas for a murder charge. That evening, the night jailer, Deputy Hobie, assaults Dinah in her cell and rapes her. After he finishes, she grabs a wooden stool and beats him to death. Blake reaches through the bars and takes his keys, opens both cells, and drags Dinah outside to steal Hobie's pickup truck. Sheriff Dempsey witnesses them escaping and gives chase only to run head-on into another car driven by a drunk driver resulting in the deaths of both the sheriff and the other driver. Blake takes Dinah to a run-down barn out in the hills to hide out where he meets up with some friends who let Dinah clean up and give her a change of clothes. As Blake and Dinah are leaving, two officers from the Bakersfield police show up and tell everybody to surrender. Blake's friends pull out machine guns and hold off the police while Blake and Dinah escape in the pickup truck. After driving through pastures and dirt roads, they find an empty ranch house to hide in for the night. Listening to the news, they discover that they are both wanted for Hobie's death. Dinah wants to turn herself in, but Blake explains that it does not matter that she was raped; she killed a cop and that with both her rapist and Sheriff Dempsey dead and unable to collaborate her self-defense story, she will be arrested and not receive a fair trial for Blake claims that all small town police are corrupt and will see her put away for life or given the death penalty. He says that, since she doesn't have a criminal record, she could just live the rest of her life as a fugitive, pointing out that her life as she knows it is already over and that no policeman will ever believe her side of the story due to the circumstances. The next morning, they are awakened by the shotgun- carrying owner of the ranch. Blake knocks the shotgun out of man's hand and the two crash through a window. During the fight, the rancher wounds Blake with a scythe and is about to kill him when Dinah puts a gun to the man's head and knocks him out. Blake and Dinah jump into the pickup with Dinah driving. A police helicopter spots them and radios the Fallsburg police who are all at a Bicentennial parade. The Fallsburg police chief orders his men to make a roadblock using a tractor-trailer. Dinah drives right into the trap and the police open fire, hitting Dinah in the shoulder. Blake tries to help Dinah to escape on foot, but she is too badly wounded. Blake leaves Dinah behind while he and the police exchange gunfire as he runs through the town and into the parade. The police fatally gun him down as he knocks over a standard bearer and Blake dies lying on the American flag. The police chief drives up with the wounded Dinah in the back seat and she stares at Blake's dead body before he drives away to take her to the town's jail. The film suddenly ends on this bleak and downbeat note.

Response The film has become a cult film. In 1996, it was selected by film director Quentin Tarantino for the first Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas. Based on CBS' positive response to airing Jackson County Jail in prime time, Miller pitched the network on an alternate storyline for Mimieux's character, envisioning a potential series for her in the vein of The Fugitive. The network greenlit this new pilot film, Outside Chance, which contained 30 minutes of footage from the original, blended with newly shot material with Mimieux and some other actors from the previous film; Tommy Lee Jones' scenes were removed, though his character was still referenced. The film premiered on the network on Saturday, December 2, 1978. The pilot did not go to series.Audio commentary with Michael Miller from Shout Factory DVD and BluRay of Jackson County Jail Film critic Danny Peary lists the film as one of his \\"Must See\\" Films in his Guide for the Film Fanatic (1986).

He played college football as an offensive lineman for the South Carolina Gamecocks. As a senior, the former walk-on was selected as a second-team All-SEC player, was a semi-finalist for the William V. Campbell Trophy, won 2011 Gamecock Inspiration Award, was named to the 2010 SEC Football Community Service Team, and was nominated by Steve Spurrier for the Rudy Awards. Chisolm tore his Anterior cruciate ligament after the 2010 SEC Championship Game against the Auburn Tigers. Chisolm play for many teams which include the Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens and the Carolina Panthers. Early years Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Chisolm attended West Ashley High School in Charleston, South Carolina. He played football his junior year for West Ashley and also threw the shot put and discus for the track team. After graduating from high school in 2006, Chisolm was not recruited by the major college football powers. He attended Pikeville College in Kentucky and later enrolled Trident Technical College in Charleston. University of South Carolina =2009 season= In 2008, Chisolm enrolled at the University of South Carolina. After spending one year at South Carolina, Chisolm tried out for the South Carolina Gamecocks football team as an unrecruited walk-on football player. He started practicing with the scout team in August 2009 and quickly drew the attention of the coaching staff. Head coach Steve Spurrier recalled, \\"I remember one day coach Lorenzo Ward said, 'That new kid over there has knocked our guys on their butts.'\\" Spurrier was also impressed by Chisolm's work ethic: \\"He's got a wonderful attitude that hopefully will rub off on all these other players. As a coach, you love those kind of guys. You love those guys that really act like this is important to them.\\" Chisolm made the team as an offensive lineman and earned his first start in early November 2009. After earning his third consecutive start against Clemson, Chisolm's quick rise to the starting lineup for an SEC squad was described as \\"one of the best stories in the league.\\" Reminding the press that Chisolm had not even joined the team until two weeks before the season started, offensive line coach Eric Wolford said, \\"I wouldn't think that's ever happened in the history of the SEC. It may have, but it was probably a long time ago.\\" Strength and conditioning coach Craig Fitzgerald also noted the remarkable nature of Chisolm's accomplishments: > \\"You can go an entire career and you'll never see another story like this, > never. ... If you're a walk-on in the [Southeastern Conference], you're > lucky if you finish out your eligibility by being a part-timer on special > teams. You might start a few games along the way as a part-time fullback. > You don't become a starter in a couple of months, especially on the > offensive line.\\" During the 2009 season, Chisolm established himself as one of the best players on the squad. Chris Low, SEC specialist for ESPN.com, said of Chisolm: \\"He really is one of the best success stories in this league, starting his career as a walk-on, working his way up to where he's not only a part of that offensive line but he's an integral part of that offensive line and now starting.\\" =2010 season= In the months before his senior year, Chisolm's parents, who ran a janitorial service in Charleston, both died of cancer. His mother, Purcella, died of ovarian cancer on January 8, 2010, and Chisolm considered leaving school to help his father run the family's janitorial business. He stayed in school, but spent hours driving 115 miles between Columbia and Charleston, \\"often taking off just after practice to help his father, Garrett Sr., after the death of his mother.\\" In the spring, his father developed a cough which was eventually diagnosed as lung cancer. Chisolm stayed in school, but continued to make the 115-mile drive from Columbia to Charleston to see his father. His father died on September 15, 2010. Despite the loss of both parents, Chisolm continued to compete for the 2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team and helped lead the team to its first SEC East football title. Adding to the obstacles facing Chisolm in his senior year, Chisolm suffered an ACL injury that ultimately required surgery in January 2011 to surgically repair his right leg. Having joined the team as an unrecruited walk-on, Chisolm became a second-team All-SEC player and also won several academic awards, including the Harold White GPA Award. In September 2010, Chisolm was selected as a semifinalist for the William V. Campbell Trophy, awarded annually to the top scholar-athlete in college football. He was also named to the 2010 SEC Football Community Service Team for his volunteer work reading at elementary schools, feeding the homeless, and preparing food for the needy at the Harvest of Hope food bank. He also won the Gamecock Inspiration Award in April 2011 as South Carolina's most inspirational athlete during the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year. South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier also nominated Chisolm for the Rudy Awards. In April 2011, Chisolm was the subject of an in-depth feature story by Yahoo Sports. In the story, Jason Cole described Chisolm's story as follows: \\"To find a man out of tryout who is big enough, athletic enough and smart enough to play major college football is as likely as finding a wild iguana in the far reaches of Canada, even if you give that guy two years to get ready. Chisolm did it in the space of three months and then came back as a full-time starter the following season.\\" =2014 season= November 2014, Chisolm decided to retire from football due to health reason. Professional career In July 2011, Chisolm signed a contract with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League. He spent most of the pre-season on the injured list while recovering from ACL surgery. He was cut on September 4, 2011, in the Dolphins' final round of cuts, but he was then signed as a practice squad member of the 2011 Miami Dolphins. He was released from the practice squad on September 12. Chisolm was signed by the San Francisco 49ers on February 1, 2012. He was waived/injured on August 13, 2012, and subsequently reverted to injured reserve on August 15. He was given an injury settlement and released from injured reserve on August 20.

Location The site is on the north bank of the Thames immediately to the south of the Samuda Estate in Cubitt Town on the Isle of Dogs, and lies between the river and Manchester Road. It occupies around , with around of river frontage. History Derelict London Yard (foreground) in 1974. The site, immediately upstream of the yard of Samuda Brothers, was acquired in 1856 by Robert Baillie and Joseph Westwood. Westwood and Baillie built a number of ships at the yard including HMS Resistance, but subsequently concentrated mainly on the manufacture of iron and steel bridges. Westwood and Ballie went out of business in 1893. The yard was taken over in 1898 by Yarrows, who had outgrown their original yard to the north at Folly Wall. Yarrows built many torpedo boat destroyers at the yard. As shipbuilding in London declined, Yarrows subsequently transferred to Scotstoun, Glasgow between 1906 and 1908. In 1917 the freehold was purchased by C. & E. Morton, a local manufacturer of soups, pickles and jams. The site was used for the manufacture of packing cases and for storage. Mortons employed around 600 people here. Mortons sold the site in 1936. It is said to have been used during World War II for the construction of units for the Mulberry harbours used in the invasion of Normandy. After the war it was acquired by Badcocks of Greenwich, which had previously occupied part of the site as a tenant. By the early 1960s Badcocks had been joined by a variety of other firms, all of which made use of existing buildings. By 1972 the wharf was unoccupied. In 1977 it was acquired by the GLC. A plan to build housing, a water-sports centre and a boat-building yard stalled when heavy pollution was discovered. It passed to the London Docklands Development Corporation, and was sold to a private developer, becoming one of the first sites on the Isle of Dogs to be redeveloped. It is now occupied by 312 residential units, completed in 1988. Development included opening up a stretch of the foreshore as a beach (owned by the Port of London Authority), and the opening of a section of riverside walkway (owned by the local authority).

He served as apprentice to Joseph Collyer the younger, and subsequently became assistant to James Heath. His first published engravings were some plates after the designs of Thomas Stothard, R.A., and he also engraved a large portion of The Canterbury Pilgrims, which was completed and published by Heath. He became better known to the public by his engravings from the pictures and drawings of Richard Cook, R.A., and some of these were considered among the finest specimens of book illustrations then produced in England. He subsequently engraved the portraits in a collection of the works of the English poets, and was engaged by Cadell & Davies to engrave the designs of Robert Smirke R.A., for works published by them. Engleheart engraved nearly thirty of Smirke's designs for their edition of Don Quixote. His services were enlisted by Sir David Wilkie, R.A., to engrave his Duncan Gray and The only Daughter, which are the works by which Engleheart is chiefly known. His last important work was an engraving from the picture by William Hilton, R.A., of Serena rescued by Sir Calepine, the Red Cross Knight. Among other engravings by him were Cupid and the Nymphs, after Hilton, The Holy Family, after Fra Bartolommeo, some plates for The British Museum Marbles, and numerous portraits and plates for the annuals then in vogue.

","title":"Francis Forcer"},{"id":"32746180","text":"Francis Forcer the elder (c.1650‚Äìc.1705) was an English composer. Life Forcer is mentioned by Hawkins as the writer of many songs, five of which may be found in Playford's Choyce Ayres and Dialogues, (bk. ii. 1679, one in the edition of 1681, and two in that of 1683). Some of his music is in the Fitzwilliam Collection, Cambridge, an overture and eight tunes are in the Christ Church Library, Oxford, and a set of instrumental trios, with a jig and gavotte for organ, among the British Museum manuscripts. He was one of four stewards for the celebration of St. Cecilia's day of 1684. Towards the end of the seventeenth century Forcer became the lessee of Sadler's Wells music house, garden, and water at Clerkenwell, with one James Miles (about 1697) as his partner. To Miles was assigned the control of the good cheer, the building or \\"boarded house\\" becoming known as \\"Miles's Music House\\", while the waters were advertised as \\"Sadler's Wells\\". The musical entertainment at such places of resort at that period was said by Hawkins to be hardly deserving the name of concert, i.e., concerted music, for the instruments were limited to violins, hautboys, and trumpets playing in unison, and when a bass was introduced it was merely to support a simple ballad or dance-tune. \\"The musick plays, and 'tis such music as quickly will make me or you sick\\", comments an old writer upon the efforts of a rival establishment; and Ned Ward describes the combination of attractions at Sadler's Wells in the lines: :The organs and fiddles were scraping and humming, :The guests for more ale on the table were drumming. Lady Squalb rose to sing, and \\"silenced the noise with her musical note\\", and a fierce fiddler in scarlet ran \\"up in alt with a hey diddle diddle, to show what a fool he could make of the fiddle\\". It appears that these primitive entertainments were announced \\"to begin at eleven, to hold until one\\". Forcer obtained a license to marry Jane Taylor of Worplesdon, Surrey, on 30 July 1673. He was then described as \\"of St. Bartholomew, Exchange, London, gent., bachelor, about twenty-three\\". He died in 1704 or 1705, leaving (by a will dated 1704) to his son, Francis Forcer, various properties in Durham and in Fetter Lane. There is no mention of Sadler's Wells, and nor was Sadler's Wells among the property left by James Miles upon his death in 1724. By the latter's will his daughter Frances, wife of Francis Forcer the younger, became entitled to an annuity, and lands in Berkshire, Essex, &c.; are settled upon Henry and John Miles Tompkins, the children of the said Mrs. Francis Forcer (d. 1726) by her first husband.

He had been sent to Oxford, entered Gray's Inn on 8 July 1696, and was called to the bar in 1703. Notwithstanding his culture, Forcer's reign at Sadler's Wells was marked by the introduction of nothing more intellectual than rope-dancing and tumbling. In 1735 a license for singing, dancing, pantomime, &c.;, and the sale of liquors was refused him by the authorities, who, however, promised at the same time not to interfere. It was not until after Forcer's death, when John Warren was occupier in 1744, that the grand jury of Middlesex thought it necessary to protest against the demoralizing influence of this and similar places of amusement. Forcer the younger was tall, athletic, and handsome. Garbott relates that he improved the place, and adds: : Miles in his way obliging was, we know, : Yet F . . . . r's language doth the softer flow ; : Behaviour far genteeler of the two. : By birth a gentleman and breeding too, : Oxford, for liberal arts that is so fam*d, : (Inferior all, none equal can be nam'd) : His Alma Mater was, it is well known. : And Gray's Inn learned gave to him the gown. : Call'd was he from thence imto the bar, &c.; ‚Äî a profession soon abandoned for the lucrative position 'behind the barr' at Sadler's Wells, where Stephen Monteage, Woollaston, and other habitu√©s were wont to 'tarry.'

He studied under Battista di Rapallo, surgeon to the Marquis of Saluzzo. He spent his early years of practice in Genoa and a statue of him can be found in front of the old Civic hospital in Rapallo. In 1495 Vigo moved to Savona and became acquainted with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere. When the Cardinal was made Pope Julius II in 1503, he took Vigo with him to Rome, appointing him as his official surgeon. He was with the Pope in the attack on Bologna and cured the Pope of a nodule on his hand. In 1514 Vigo published Practica in arte chirurgica copiosa a comprehensive work on surgery composed of nine books and written in Latin. He dedicated it to his son, Luigi. In it Vigo wrote about anatomy, medications and the treatment of apostome, ulcers, wounds, diseases and fractures and dislocations. The book on wounds included one of the earliest discussions of the treatment of wounds caused by firearms. He assumed that the victims of such wounds were poisoned by gunpowder and recommended treatment with boiling oil in order to counteract the poison. Ambroise Par√© in 1536, as surgeon to colonel-general Mareschal de Montjean discovered that such treatment was counter-productive and recommends different treatments. The book on diseases discussed the French Disease (which is generally equated with modern-day Syphilis). In 1517, Vigo published Practica compendiosa which covered most of the same material as his Practica in a much more condensed form. Vigo's two books were commonly printed together after that and often along with another compendium of surgery by Mariano Santo who said he had been a student of Vigo's and who would later become famous for his work on the treatment of bladder stones. Although he is generally known today only for his mistaken treatment of gunshot wounds, Vigo's first book on surgery was enormously successful. It was translated into English, Latin, Italian and French and reprinted dozens of times in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries making him one of the best known surgeons of his day.

It witnessed Egypt launch three Scud missiles against Israeli targets. One of the missiles was fired at Arish and the others at the Israeli bridgehead on the western bank of the Suez Canal, near Deversoir. Background One of the lessons learned by Egypt following the Six-Day War was the need of a weapon able to hit deep inside Israel. The weapon would have to interrupt any Israeli attack manoeuvres and would serve as a deterrent. As a result of the need, Egypt armed itself with three types of weapons: * Heavy bombers that could strike deep inside Israel. * Cruise missiles that would be able to overcome the Israeli missile defence systems. * Long range surface-to-surface missiles that would be able to strike deep inside Israel and that would be launched from deep inside Egypt, defended by Egypt's air defence networks. The Soviets feared equipping Egypt with deep-strike abilities, which caused tensions between Egypt and the Soviet Union. Eventually, the Soviets agreed to supply Egypt with KSR-2 Surface-to-surface missiles, Tupolev Tu-16s (instead of the newer Tupolev Tu-22 Egypt requested) and a division of Scud surface-to-surface missiles. The Mossad was aware of the Scud delivery since June 1973, before the missiles had arrived in EgyptRonen Bergman and Gil Meltzer, Yom Kippur War - in real time, 2004, p. 182 on August 24. The Soviets also trained Egyptian soldiers to operate the systems. The Scud division included 10 launchers, and Israel Military Intelligence (Aman) estimated that the manpower training would take at least 11‚Äì12 months, meaning that Egypt would only be able to use the missiles in the first quarter of 1974 at the earliest. However, it is possible that the Egyptians were operating Scud missiles on their own by October 1973. In addition, Aman learned that the Scud division would be on active duty from the beginning of October 1973. The Agranat Commission later referred to the Scud missiles and saw them as a factor that could have changed the balance of power on the battlefield.Agranat Commission Report: Commission Inquiry of the Yom Kippur War, the third and last part, p. 8‚Äì9. Aman estimated that Egypt would not dare to go to war against Israel without first equipping itself with Scud missiles, which could act as an opposing threat to the IAF's abilities (Aman was still convinced Egypt would not be able to operate the Scud missiles before the beginning of 1974). The attack Israeli intelligence received information which stated that between October 12 and October 13 Soviet teams conducted reconnaissance in the area of Port Said, Ismailia and Damietta, searching for launching sites for the Scud missiles. The intelligence estimate was that the Scud missiles could hit deep inside Israel, as far as Netanya, and from some launching areas, the Scuds might even be able to hit Haifa. As a response to the intelligence estimates, Israel launched aircraft sorties in the region and asked the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Simcha Dinitz, to inform the U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, about the Soviet missions, so he would discuss the subject with his Soviet counterpart.Noam Ophir, the long shadow of the Scud, the Israeli Air Force site, October 2006 On the night between October 14 and October 15, the IDF crossed to the western side of the Suez Canal and started forming a bridgehead as preparation to a deep assault inside Egypt. The following day, Egyptian president Anwar Sadat threatened that he would retaliate with surface-to- surface missiles as a response to attacks deep inside Egypt. As a result, the Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan decided not to attack economical targets in Egypt the following day, in a direct contradiction to his opinion on the subject in the previous days. On October 20, Moshe Dayan and the Israeli Chief of Staff David Elazar considered conquering Port Said and Port Fuad. During the discussion, the question of Scud launches as an Egyptian response was taken into account. In addition, Israel also bombed the Egyptian missile batteries at Port Said several times. The Egyptians claim that Israel attacked there because of its fear of Scud missiles being positioned there, due to the fact that Scud missiles positioned at Port Said could threaten all of Israel's big cities.ol-EJ I ol-Gamasy, Mosich, Mozcrat to - Gamasy, herev October, 1973, Paris, 1990, p. 215-216; Interview with Ali Fahmi, commander of air defense forces: Suheir Alhosini, co - operation is amazing ', in Arabic sources on the Yom Kippur War, Abraham Robinson (Translator), systems 332, (1993), p. 75. On October 21, out of desperation, the Egyptians moved a battery of Scud missiles that was previously deployed in the eastern area of the Nile's delta (from where Tel Aviv was in the battery's range), to an eastern position in a minimum distance from the canal.Yuval Ne'eman, \\"operational link between Israel and the United States in the Yom Kippur War\\", path 3, (June 2005). On October 22, the UN Security Council accepted resolution 338. The resolution demanded that a ceasefire be in effect at 19:00. According to Victor Aisralian, a high-ranking officer in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, the Scud division was under Soviet control, and fully staffed by Soviet personnel. The Egyptian leadership and the Soviet advisers were disappointed that the war was about to end without them having used the most sophisticated weapon the Soviets had supplied Egypt. As a result, in the hours before the ceasefire took into effect, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt called the Soviet foreign minister and asked for his permission to launch missile strikes against Israel. Unable to reach him, he turned to the Soviet minister of defence, who approved the attack. In the last few minutes before the ceasefire took into effect, the Soviet teams managed to fire three missiles, without Egyptian knowledge or approval.Victor Israelyan, Inside the Kremlin During the Yom Kippur War, Pennsylvania State Press, University park Pennsylvania, 1995, pp. 111 Each of the three Scud missiles carried 2 tons of explosives. One of the missiles exploded near Arish, from which Israel received its aid from the United States, and the other two were fired at the Israeli bridgehead at Deversoir, on the western side of the canal. One of them hit a concentration of supply trucks and killed seven soldiers from the 401st Brigade of the 600th Division. The explosion left a crater of 15 meter in diameter and a depth of four meters.Avraham Adan, On Both Banks of the Suez, Jerusalem, 1979, p. 284 Later on, Sadat claimed in his book that he commanded the forces to fire the Scuds at the Israeli bridgehead: \\"I wanted Israel to know that we have such weapons and that we would be able to use them later on in the war\\".Anwar Sadat, the story of my life, Idanim, 1978, p. 199.

This fear was raised by military intelligence chief Eli Zeira at a situation assessment with the Chief of Staff on October 9. This avoidance is more noticeable when compared to the significant Israeli strikes which were conducted during the 1967-70 War of Attrition. These strikes caused significant damage to the Egyptian military and forced it to defend the Egyptian front, therefore weakening its offensive capabilities. On the Syrian front, however, Israel struck deep inside Syria, damaging the Syrian war effort and even disrupting normal life in the country, attacking important power plants, petrol supplies, bridges and main roads.

It was in business from 1910 to 1971. Originally independent, it was a subsidiary of King Features Syndicate from 1930 onwards. At its peak, the Central Press supplied features, columns, comic strips, and photographs to more than 400 newspapers and 12 million daily readers. Notable comic strips that originated with Central Press include Brick Bradford, Etta Kett, and Muggs McGinnis (later titled Muggs and Skeeter). History Virgil Venice McNitt (1881‚Äì1964), the managing editor of the Cleveland Press, founded the Central Press Association in Cleveland in 1910. In 1912, McNitt acquired the Chicago-based North American Press Syndicate and merged it into the Central Press. That same year, McNitt entered into arrangements to publish works authored by William Jennings Bryan and Jane Addams. Other early features were Bob Satterfield's cartoons, Edna K. Wooley's column, and a sports column by Ed Bang.\\"Central Press Has 50th Birthday Party,\\" Editor & Publisher (October 15 1960). Archived at Stripper's Guide. Accessed Dec. 2, 2018. He hired Bryan to cover the 1912 Republican and Democratic National Conventions for the Central Press. He also made a deal with Addams to circulate her Progressive Party Platforms to newspaper across the country. In 1920, McNitt founded a separate, New York City-based Central Press Association, which was soon absorbed by his new McNaught Syndicate (founded in 1922).Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"CHAPTER VIII: Recent Developments in Syndicate History 1921-1935,\\" A History Of Newspaper Syndicates In The United States, 1865-1935 (Western Newspaper Union, 1936).

In 1927, the Central Press also took over the Editors Feature Service and in August 1929 it acquired control of Johnson Features. Also in 1929, the company constructed a mechanical production plant in New York, again forming a Central Press Association of New York, Inc. to operate the new plant. Virgil McNitt remained the president and general manager of the Central Press from its founding in 1910 until 1930, when he sold the service to King Features Syndicate, part of the Hearst newspaper syndicate, which retained the Central Press as a separate division.\\"Central Press Purchased by King; To Be Operated as Separate Unit: Staff and Features of Cleveland Organization to be Continued Intact ‚Äî New York Plant Not Included In Purchase ‚Äî Eichel Shifted to West as Editor,\\" Editor & Publisher (Feb. 15, 1930).

Robert Forby (1759-1825), was an English philologist. Career Forby, born in 1759 of poor parents at Stoke Ferry, Norfolk, was educated at the free school of Lynn Regis, and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship (B.A. 1781, M.A. 1784). Sir John Berney, bart., induced him to leave the university, and to become tutor of his sons, presenting him in 1787 to the small living of Horningtoft, Norfolk. Afterwards he fixed his residence at Barton Bendish, where he took pupils; and on their number increasing, he removed to Wereham. Two years subsequently, in 1789, by the death of his uncle, the Rev. Joseph Forby, he came into possession of the valuable rectory of Fincham, Norfolk. He removed thither in 1801, and continued to reside in his parish till his death, which occurred suddenly while he was taking a warm bath, on 20 Sept. 1825, aged 66. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1798, and was a distinguished scholar. At one time, though at what period is uncertain, he was resident at Aspall, Suffolk, as tutor to the children of Mr. Chevallier. Works He published some small pieces of ephemeral interest, and an important philological work entitled The Vocabulary of East Anglia ; an attempt to record the Vulgar Tongue of the twin sister counties, Norfolk and Suffolk, as it existed in the last twenty years of the Eighteenth Century, and still exists: with Proof of its Antiquity from Etymology and Authority, 2 vols.

Harris uses his works to comment on societal constructs of sexuality and race, while exploring his own identity as a queer, black man.  Early life  Born in the Bronx, Harris was mostly raised by his chemistry professor mother Rudean after she divorced Harris's father, between New York City and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Harris has expressed the impact of the absence of his father as a large impact on his personal and emotional development, which would later be shown through some of his pieces, including his collaborations with his brother, Thomas Allen Harris. While in Dar Es Salaam, Harris and his brother were sent to an English-speaking Swahili school. Harris believed it was important to his development as both an artist and a black man to live in a country in which black people were in positions of power. He valued his time spent in Tanzania, as it was a sharp contrast to the school he attended in New York City. Harris spent a lot of his childhood with his grandparents, including his maternal grandmother Joella, who he has featured in his art, was a missionary and his grandfather was a treasurer for Greater Bethel AME Church (Harlem, New York), which influenced many of Harris' pieces. Additionally, his grandfather had an extensive photograph archive, which can be connected to Harris' later experimentation with photography in his art. During their youth in the early 1970s, Harris and his brother began to do drag on the weekends, in which they would perform in the hallway of their mother's home. This provided a safe space for the brothers to experiment with gender and their own personal sexual identity, something they feel is crucial to their artistic development. In addition to playing with gender and performance, Harris toyed with color and different functions of color. Growing up in the 1970s, there was a resurgence within the African American community in which exploration of African culture began to influence style and domestic culture. Harris used color to connect himself and his art back to these roots, as many in his community did at the time of his childhood.  Academia and early works  = Education = Harris originally decided to attend Wesleyan University with the intended major of Economics. During his second year there, he took a trip to Amsterdam to visit his brother that was living there at the time. In Amsterdam, Harris discovered a book by Allan Sekula, ‚ÄúPhotography Against the Grain: Essays and Photo Works‚Äù that he believes drastically altered his ideas of self-development, changing the course of his life. Harris returned to the US and spent the following semester exploring NYC through the black clubbing scene of the 1980s. He took courses in the arts, returned to Wesleyan, came out as queer, and switched his major to art. In 1988, Harris graduated from Wesleyan University with a BFA.Harris received his MFA from the California Institute of the Arts and attended the National Graduate Photography Seminar at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1990. Following this time, Harris also participated in the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in 1992. = Americas = According to art critic Maximil√≠ano Duron, an emergence of self-realization within Harris sparked his first work titled ‚ÄúAmericas‚Äù between 1987 and 1988. ‚ÄúAmericas‚Äù is a black and white photography series in which Harris dresses in wigs and wears whiteface. Scholars, Kwame Appiah and Cassandra Coblentz, view ‚ÄúAmericas‚Äù as Harris‚Äô discovery of both his voice as an artist, and as a man, while toying with blackface in reverse. Harris went on to attend the California Institute for the Arts and describes facing challenges there as one of the only students of color. After receiving feedback from a professor that his work was misunderstood by a white audience, he created a piece intended to command attention. This piece was Harris standing in a leopard bodysuit with a derogatory word referring to homosexuals painted in red lipstick at the bottom. Harris expresses that he used this piece to claim his identity, and reassume power over it, in a way that everyone could understand. = Constructs = Harris‚Äô struggle at CalArts inspired his work titled ‚ÄúConstructs‚Äù. Constructs furthered the ideas of his previous work ‚ÄúAmericas‚Äù, as he aimed to showcase what it means to be a queer black man and accentuated the connection between sexuality and race. He dressed mainly in minstrel attire and used whiteface to critique the static aspects of culture in the US led by a white majority.  Exhibitions  = Whitney Museum Independent Study Program = Harris‚Äô first exhibition-style work was curated in 1992, in a series he created through the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program.The collection was a color-based series, in which he used the colors of the Pan- African flag and members of his family to display and create a narrative of black life that was proud and exuberant. = Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary Art = In 1994, Harris was offered a solo exhibition in New York City by Jack Tilton featuring his earlier work, ‚ÄúConstructs‚Äù, as part of the larger exhibition titled ‚ÄúBlack Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art.‚Äù Educator, Senam Okudzeto, considered Harris‚Äô work a marriage of the autobiographical and the historiographical, beautifully illustrating ‚Äúidentity politics‚Äù. For Okudzeto, ‚ÄúBlack Male‚Äù did not attempt to project inclusivity or disillusion viewers; ‚ÄúBlack Male‚Äù encouraged viewers to think about blackness and masculinity as political powers in the culture of the United States. = The Good Life = In the fall of 1994, Harris exhibited The Good Life in New York where Barkley L. Hendricks also appeared, where Elizabeth Hess of The Village Voice said \\"the most brilliant pairing in the installation is achieved when Lyle Ashton Harris' seductive self-portraits meet Barkley L. Hendricks' tight paintings of black men. Harris dresses up in feminine costumes, challenging every construct of black macho, while Hendricks' dated, once fashionable portraits - a sports figure, a man in a fancy, full-length coat - support the pillars of masculinity...\\". The show was composed of large format Polaroids depicting staged and impromptu photographs of friends and family members. One of the most notable works from the show is a triptych series in collaboration with his brother, Thomas Allen Harris, entitled \\"Brotherhood, Crossroads, Etcetera\\". The work weaves a complex visual allegory that invokes ancient African cosmologies, Judeo-Christian myths, and taboo public and private desires. Harris remained consistent in his ability to play with gender, sexuality and race in his art when he worked with Ren√©e Cox in 1994. The two posed for Harris's polaroid piece, The Child. Cox poses as a father figure, embracing Harris as the mother figure, who holds a child as they both look into the camera. Harris maintains his color scheme of black, green, red, and yellow, which emphasize his connection to his African roots and culture. Green, he establishes as a symbol of the African race, and red as a symbol of blood. This color scheme was used for The Child, as well as his project Brotherhood, done with Thomas Allen Harris. = The Watering Hole = In 1996, \\"The Watering Hole\\", a photomontage series, reveals Harris' performative use of photography and its mechanisms, putting image into a field of representation where they reveal hidden or repressed occurrences. ‚ÄúThe Watering Hole‚Äù was inspired by the criminal case involving Jeffrey Dahmer, a cannibalistic killer who had victims that were majority black and Latino boys. At this time, Harris was interested in black masculinity as it relates to vulnerability. He used newspaper clippings relevant to the case and incorporated his own photographs to create a collage that showed the transparency between men and their masculine identities. Harris found the idea of cannibalism in the case especially interesting as it described the process of one's ‚Äúdesire to consume the other‚Äù. = Bille, Boxers, and Better Days = In 2002 Harris came out with his photo series called ‚ÄúBillie, Boxers, and Better Days.‚Äù With this series, made up of polaroid prints of performative self-portraits, Harris aimed to depict the commodity of black bodies and the idea of gender as a result of repeated acts that create an identity that can be categorized. Throughout these works, Harris intends to reveal he has infinite relationships with his being and definitions of selfhood, even aligning himself with black femininity through Billie Holiday. In her essay on this, Amber Musser says, ‚ÄúHarris's citation of Holiday is not just about his relationship to her; it is also about black femininity and understanding the way it functions as a space of otherness within Harris's formulation of selfhood‚Äù. = Blow Up = In 2004, \\"Blow Up\\", Harris's first public wall collage was shown at the Rhona Hoffman gallery in Chicago. Harris‚Äô work, ‚ÄúBlow Up‚Äù is a collage series centered around a piece Harris found in 2001 while he was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome. At the time, Harris was interested in racism and power dynamic in European Soccer. He was particularly focused on an image of a black man massaging an Italian soccer player's leg. This image became the focal point of the entire exhibition. Blow Up contains imagery depicting interpretations of race and sex across cultures and history, while illustrating their connectivity. This led to a series of three other wall collages composed of materials, photographs and ephemera Harris collected including, Blow UP IV (Sevilla) which was made for the Bienal de Arte Contemporeano de Sevilla in Seville, Spain in 2006. = Memoirs of Hadrian = In 2002, \\"Memoirs of Hadrian\\", a photomontage series pictures a young boxer in a non-traditional manner as he is slouched and bloodied rather than triumphant as many images of boxers were shown around that time. According to a Holland Cotter, a Pulitzer prize winning art critic, the title refers to \\"both to the city and to Marguerite Yourcenar's book of the same name, a fictional autobiography of the aging Roman emperor.\\". = Other exhibitions = In 2010 Gregory R. Miller & Co. published Excessive Exposure. The publication is the most definitive documentation of Harris' \\"Chocolate-Colored\\" portraits made with a large-format Polaroid camera over the past ten years. In 2011, The Studio Museum in Harlem exhibited some of these portraits, highlighting specific individual subjects. In 2014, he was also featured on the Independent Lens documentary Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People produced by his brother Thomas Allen Harris. In 2000 and 2001, he was a Fellow at American Academy in Rome. In February 2015, he received the David C. Driskell Prize from the High Museum of Art and, later in May, he also spoke at the Contemporary African Art Fair at Pioneer Works Center For Art and Innovation. He has also been exhibited in places such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Venice Biennale, Adamson Gallery, the Bruce High Quality Foundation University Gallery Cornell University, Neil L. and Angelica Rudenstine Gallery, W. E. B. Du Bois Institute, Harvard University, University of California at Santa Barbara, Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and Center for the Arts, University at Buffalo, Andy Warhol Museum and Howard University Department of Art. and magazines such as New York, Vibe and The New York Times (the latter at which he was a photojournalist). Mickalene Thomas cited Harris as an influence of hers while Harris himself cited influences such as Caravaggio, Francis Bacon, Robert Mapplethorpe, Cindy Sherman and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Ashton Harris is represented by the Salon 94 in New York City. He currently lives in New York where is the assistant professor of art at New York University and formerly split his time between the New York and Accra, Ghana campuses.  Recent works and critical reception  = Teaching in Accra, Ghana = Through New York University's Global Program,between the years of 2005 and 2012, Harris taught in Accra, Ghana, and created work inspired by the political unrest surrounding visibility for the homosexual community. His works ‚ÄúDeceivers and Money Boys,‚Äù 2013 and ‚ÄúUntitled (Colonial Law),‚Äù 2014, were influenced by the oppression of the homosexual community provoked by the media after British Prime Minister, David Cameron, revoked aid to African Countries with ‚Äúanti-gay laws‚Äù. Philosopher, Kwame Anthony Appiah, investigates the effects Harris‚Äô work in Ghana. Appiah believes Harris discovered a different relationship with gender roles there, for example white is more disconnected with race; Ghanaians apply white powder to their faces in ritualistic practice not for the purposes of whiteface. This interconnectivity of culture is exemplified by Harris‚Äô interpretation of a photo taken of Italian politician, Silvio Berlusconi, that was featured in the New York Times in the early 2000s. Harris layered the photo with motifs of from Ghanaian funerary clothe and Java prints to represent the history of trade between Dutch and West Africa. = Collage methodology = Collage has remained an integral part of Harris's studio practice since the mid-1990s. Harris‚Äô series in Ghana, as well as his early work ‚ÄúThe Watering Hole‚Äù, are examples of his thoughtful collaging. Throughout his works ‚ÄúJamestown Prison Erasure,‚Äù 2010, and ‚ÄúUntitled,‚Äù he uses translucent fabrics and shadowy figures to represent the invisibility of the LGBTQ community in Accra, and the ongoing presence of racist structures passed down from the transatlantic slave trade. According to Cassandra Coblentz, collaging helps display the strong connection between photograph and identity that exists in Harris‚Äô work. She believes he uses collage to make straightforward imagery layered, creating movement within still photography. = Self-portraiture and masquerading = Harris commonly uses self-portraiture in many of his works and exhibitions, particularly his earlier works. James Smalls refers to Harris‚Äô self-portraits as photography that engages in investigations of social issues with a focus on disguise and masquerade on the surface. One of Harris‚Äô most recent works, ‚ÄúFlash of the Spirit‚Äù is a mask-based series inspired by Robert Farris Thompson's book titled, Flash of the Spirit.For this series, Harris uses masks collected by his uncle who traveled through West Africa in the 1960s that he felt represented a connection to his childhood. ‚ÄúFlash of the Spirit‚Äù was shot in Provincetown, Fire Island, a typically white occupied vacation spot. Jeff Elstone of Vulture magazine reports that Harris did so to ignite the African diaspora in those environments through photographs that connect with the inherent queerness Harris sees in Africanism.

His clan held the plain of Magh Feimhin, near Clonmel. Forannan was chosen bishop by popular election, and consecrated, according to his 'Life,' in 'the city called in the barbarous dialect of the Irish Domhnach mor,' i.e. Donoughmore, which, it is added, is the metropolis of Ireland. From this Lanigan erroneously inferred it to have been in Armagh. But the 'Book of Leinster,' the 'Lebar Brecc,' and the 'Martyrology of Donegal' all term him of 'Donoughmore in Magh Feimhin,' the territory of his family. Departure from Ireland In obedience to a vision directing him to go to the Meuse, Forannan, with twelve companions, left Ireland about 969, and, as usual with Irish saints, was miraculously conveyed across the sea. While in search of the appointed place they met, who had built many churches, and among them one dedicated to St. Patrick. He then led them to Rome, that they might obtain the instruction in monastic learning which they sought for. There Forannan received the episcopal dignity and the title of abbot ; he was ordered to turn aside for further instruction in the Benedictine rule to a monastery named Gorzia. Thence he went to Walciodorus, now Wassor, between Dinant and Givet. The pious emperor Otto heard of his fame, and, after some hesitation in acknowledging Forannan's rank, took the abbey under his protection. Walciodorus had been founded in 945 by Eilbert, and Macallen, an Irishman, was the first abbot. Macallen, on leaving Ireland, had first gone to Peronne, the Irish monastery founded by St. Fursa, and there won the patronage of Hersendis, the wife of Count Eilbert. Walciodorus was one of a group of such monasteries supplied with inmates from Ireland. By Forannan's influence a place called Hasteria (now Hasti√®re) was added to his monastery. He also obtained a village called Gruthen, which he made over to the monastery, in order that its vineyards might supply the monks with wine. Several interpretations of the name Walciodorus have been proposed; some taking it to be from 'vallis decora,' the beautiful valley, others from 'waltz-dor,' the torrent of the wood. Seven years after his arrival Count Eilbert died. He was attended during his illness by Forannan, and was buried in the Basilica of Walciodorus. Forannan died in 982. His day is 30 April.

(died 1699), was an English nonjuring divine. Life Fitzwilliam was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he entered as a servitor in 1651, and was elected to a demyship in the same year. At the Restoration, according to Anthony √† Wood, ‚Äòhe turned about and became a great complier to the restored liturgy.‚Äô But Fitzwilliam himself appeals to ‚Äòthe zeal I had for the present government even while it was merely to be enjoyed in hopes, and we could only wish it might be restored‚Äô (sermon preached in 1683). In 1661 he was elected fellow of Magdalen, and held his fellowship until 1670. He was made librarian of the college in 1662, being at the same time university lecturer on music. His first patron was Dr. George Morley, afterwards bishop of Winchester, who recommended him to the lord treasurer, Thomas Wriothesley, the virtuous earl of Southampton, in 1664, in whose family he resided as chaplain, and instructed Lady Rachel Wriothesley and her sisters. On the death of the Earl of Southampton Bishop Morley ‚Äòtook him into his own household,‚Äô and on ‚Äòhis dismission from his service with a fair reward‚Äô recommended him in 1666 as chaplain to the Duke of York, afterwards James II, to whose daughter, the Princess Anne, he became tutor. In 1669 he was appointed by Bishop Morley to the living of Brightstone in the Isle of Wight, on the resignation of Dr. Thomas Ken, who was collated to the living of Woodhay. He was afterwards presented by his friend, Bishop Turner of Ely, to the living of Cottenham, near Cambridge, and promoted by the crown to a canonry at Windsor in 1688. He was a friend both of Thomas Ken and of his brother-in-law, Izaak Walton, who sent him presentation copies of all his works. He was also on terms of intimacy with John Kettlewell. He attended, with Ken, Bishop Morley's deathbed in 1684. At the Revolution he resigned his preferments, because his conscience forbad him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new dynasty. In January 1690/1691 he appeared as a witness at the trial of John Ashton, executed for a Jacobite conspiracy. It was reported that Ashton was a Roman Catholic, and Fitzwilliam testified that ‚Äòhe had received the sacrament of the Lord's supper only six months before in Ely Chapel‚Äô‚Äîthat is, in the chapel at Ely House, Hatton Garden, the Bishop of Ely's London residence, which was a great resort of the nonjurors until Bishop Turner was deprived. Fitzwilliam appears to have been a regular attendant at these services, for he admits that ‚Äòhe had been a hundred times at prayers in their altered state,‚Äô that is, when the names of King William and Queen Mary were omitted. He professed his willingness to submit peaceably, though he would not take the oaths. His correspondence with Lady Russell consists of fifty-seven letters which she wrote to him, and four or five which he wrote to her. Thomas Selwood, who edited the first edition of Lady Russell's letters in 1773, says: ‚ÄòAll the letters to Dr. Fitzwilliam were by him returned in one packet to her ladyship, with his desire they might be printed for the benefit of the public.‚Äô The correspondence indicates the greatest veneration on the part of Lady Russell for her old instructor, and a pastoral, almost a parental, solicitude on his part for his old pupil. Lady Russell consults him on the appointment of a chaplain, the education of her children, the marriage of her daughter, and, above all, her own griefs upon the execution of Lord William Russell, whom Fitzwilliam had attended before his execution, and at whose trial he was one of the witnesses for the defence. She expresses the deepest reverence for his character, and the utmost value for his counsel. After the Revolution she strove in vain to convince him that he 'might honestly submit to the present government.' Fitzwilliam's replies to her arguments show the conscientious and unselfish character of the man, and also give some insight into his life. He begs her to use her influence, not for himself, but for his parishioners, 'to get some person presented to my living, upon my resignation, in whom I may confide without any, the least capitulation, direct or indirect, beforehand. He whom I design is one Mr. Jekyl, minister of the new chapel, Westminster, and a favourite of the present government.' Anticipating that he would not be able to comply, he adds: 'I beg of your honour three things: first, that you would have the same good opinion of my integrity, and of my zealous addiction to your service, as ever you had; secondly, that you would permit me, in entire trust and confidence, to make over all my worldly goods to you; for I fear some men's hearts may drive affairs so far as to bring all remnants of it into a premunire; thirdly, that I may have some room in your house, if any can be spared, to set up my books in, and have recourse to them if, on refusal, we may be permitted to stay in town.' If Lady Russell cannot grant these last requests, he intimates that he will apply to one of her sisters, Lady Gainsborough or Lady Alington. He died in 1699, having appointed 'my ever dear friend, and now my truly honoured father,' Dr. Ken, his sole executor under his will, with a life interest in 500 pounds, which he bequeathed to the library of Magdalen College. He also left books and manuscripts to the Bodleian Library. Works The only publication of Fitzwilliam extant is A Sermon preached at Cotenham, near Cambridge, on 9 Sept. 1683, being the day set apart for Public Thanksgiving for deliverance of His Sacred Majesty and Government from the late Treasonable Conspiracy, that is, the Rye House plot, for his supposed complicity in which Lord William Russell lost his life. Fitzwilliam, however, thoroughly believed in his innocence, and testified to that effect at the trial. On the anniversaries of the arrest, the trial, and the execution of her husband, Fitzwilliam always sent letters of comfort and advice to Lady Russell. Fitzwilliam was one of the few nonjurors who are mentioned with unqualified praise by Lord Macaulay. He groups him with the saintly John Kettlewell, and thinks they are deserving of 'special mention, less on account of their abilities and learning than on account of their rare integrity, and of their not less rare candour.'

He gave sustained military service and leadership through the Scottish and Welsh campaigns of Edward I and was summoned to parliament from 1295 to 1315. His marriage in c. 1282 brought him other manors including Morpeth in Northumberland and its appurtenances. In 1297 he was enfeoffed as tenant-in-chief (feudal lord) of the entire barony of Greystoke, seated at Greystoke in Cumberland but with Yorkshire estates, through his matrilineal Greystok descent. He entered upon these in his own right in 1306. Having served in the retinue of Aymer de Valence, during the first decade of Edward II's reign he remained dependable as a military leader and royal lieutenant in the defence administration of the northern counties and Scottish marches.

Reign of Edward II  = Northern Justice = In the reign of Edward II Ralph attached himself to the baronial opposition. In 1309 he was appointed a justice to receive in Northumberland complaints of prises taken contrary to the statute of Stamford. On his own behalf he became involved in a suit in 1305 concerning the manor of Brierton, County Durham: from this he had purchased a rent worth ¬£30 and more, but the feoffee, Geoffrey de Hartlepool, refused to pay him.'Parishes: Stranton', in W.

It appears from a letter of c. 1312, when Fitzwilliam's men were preventing Geoffrey from harvesting at Brierton, that, by appealing to the legal authority of the liberty rather than to the feudal authority of Robert Clifford (who was killed in 1314), Geoffrey was seeking to enlist Bishop Kellaw's influence towards Fitzwilliam, though the bishop was reluctant or unable to exercise it to a sufficient extent.Holford and Stringer, Border Liberties and Loyalties, p. 126 (Google). Kellaw could remember that, when subprior in 1301, his plea (in a matter of ¬£200 damages) for observance of royal protection (or any such writ not the bishop's) had been refused by Ralph Fitzwilliam, William de Crompton and John de Crepping, Justices of the franchise.Durham Cathedral Archive: Locelli, (Durham Cathedral Muniments GB-0033-DCD-Loc), Loc.VII.45, article 27.
