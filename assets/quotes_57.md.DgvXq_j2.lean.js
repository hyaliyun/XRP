Format Held inside Saddleback's Worship Center, the event was the first joint appearance of the two presidential candidates during the campaign. It was broadcast live on national news networks, as well as several evangelical Christian networks such as Trinity Broadcasting Network and Daystar Television Network. Tickets for the sold-out event were distributed to church members by raffle for prices as high as $1,000. Both campaigns agreed to the format of the debate--two consecutive interviews--and Senator Obama went first, as determined by a coin toss. The coin toss was conducted by Rick Warren's staff on behalf of McCain and Obama, who were not present. Some groups opposed the forum, including the Americans United for Separation of Church and State.Voters Have Heard Enough About The Presidential Candidates And Religion, Says Americans United. Issues The candidates each exposed their positions on a number of issues, including faith, abortion, evil, wealth, same-sex marriage, and stem-cell research. The two struck common themes, but differed on their views of abortion; Obama said the answer was \\"above his pay grade\\" a comment he later regrettedNBC News and also told Warren the issue \\"scientifically\\" and \\"theologically\\" is not a black and white one in defining the precise moment when a baby gets human rights. McCain answered, \\"At the moment of conception.\\" Asked about their greatest moral failures, Obama cited his adolescent drug use while McCain said his was failing his first marriage. Obama and McCain gave different answers on which justices they would have refused to nominate to the United States Supreme Court, McCain saying Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, Stephen Breyer and David Souter, and Obama saying Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. The presumptive nominees presented contrasting views on the definition of rich; Warren asked, \\"At what point...do you move from middle class to rich?\\" Obama answered that rich Americans make more than $250,000, while McCain answered, \\"How about $5 million?\\" When asked an issue on which they had changed their view in the last ten years, Obama said welfare reform and McCain said energy. Both candidates were alleged to have made misleading claims and exaggerations during the forum. Alleged cheating Because the questions posed to the two candidates in their separate appearances would be the same or similar, it was agreed in advance that whichever candidate went second would be sequestered so as not to hear anything asked of his rival. At the beginning of the forum, Warren stated, \\"Now, Senator Obama is going to go first. We flipped a coin, and we have safely placed Senator McCain in a cone of silence.\\" In fact, however, McCain did not even arrive at the church until nearly half an hour later. Andrea Mitchell, on Meet the Press, alluded to the possibility that McCain may have been able to hear the questions put to Obama, partly because his answers were immediate and, according to Mitchell, he sounded well prepared. Another act that aroused suspicion was when McCain was asked to define marriage-- he gave a straightforward answer, and then asked when he would be asked the importance of Supreme Court Justices, even though the question was not to be asked until later. The McCain campaign stated that McCain did not hear or see any of the broadcast. A spokeswoman for McCain said, \\"The insinuation from the Obama campaign that John McCain, a former prisoner of war, cheated is outrageous.\\" ABC News has reported that, in subsequent inquiries about the incident, the McCain campaign, while continuing to insist that McCain did not hear or see the broadcast himself, \\"has so far refused to say no one told the senator about the questions Obama was asked.\\" References External links *Official website *Saddleback forum (CNN broadcast): Part 1 ¬∑ Part 2 ¬∑ Part 3 ¬∑ Part 4 *Saddleback forum (CNN Transcript) *\\"Who Won the Showdown at Saddleback?\\" New York Magazine August 18, 2008 (A sampling of commentary) 2008 United States presidential debates Lake Forest, California ","title":"Civil Forum on the Presidency"},{"id":"18891399","text":"Clash of Eagles is a 1990 alternate history novel by Leo Rutman.

Life and career Born in Rome, Manni debuted as an actor in 1952, when in spite of his acting inexperience he was chosen by Luigi Comencini for the main role in La tratta delle bianche. Following the success of the film Manni interrupted his university studies and started appearing in a significant number of films of any genre, becoming in a short time one of the most popular actors in the Italian cinema. Declined the fame, in the sixties Manni appeared mainly in spaghetti western and peplum films, but he also took part to several international productions, including films by Delmer Daves and Tony Richardson. His last role was Katzone in Federico Fellini's City of Women. He died in Rome, aged 52, after accidentally shooting himself.

After attending high school, first in his hometown and then in Berlin, Schwarz attended the University of Grenoble, University of Bonn and Berlin, graduating with a doctorate. During the First World War, he briefly served as a soldier. He became involved with the labour movement in Chemnitz, following the November Revolution. He joined the SPD and was there during the suppression of the Kapp Putsch in 1920. Radicalised by the experience he moved to the USPD, accepting the post of district secretary in Kiel. By the end of the year he was with the KPD. In early 1921, he was District Secretary for Hesse-Cassel, but went underground following the March Action. He was arrested in Berlin at the end of 1921 and was held prisoner in Kassel for several months. By October 1922, Schwarz was employed as a teacher in Berlin and served as a left-wing member of the party leadership for the district of Berlin-Brandenburg. When Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow formed a left-wing party leadership, he became a full-time party functionary running the party organisation in Thuringia. In May, and again in December 1924, Schwarz was elected Reichstag deputy for the KPD. In 1925, as the internal struggles of the KPD evolved, Schwarz belonged to the ultraleft wing. He started to criticise the Soviet Union as a counter- revolutionary state. While the party was still under Maslow and Fischer he gave up his party duties and, by May 1926, with the rise of Ernst Th√§lmann to party leadership, he left the KPD completely. Together with Karl Korsch he formed the Entschiedene Linke group. He remained a member of the Reichstag, despite joining the anti-parliamentarian KAPD. After the loss of the Reichstag seat in 1928, Schwarz returned to teaching. Rather than having any party position, he concentrated on the promotion of German-French understanding. After the Nazi takeover, Schwarz initially fled to France and then to Cuba, Mexico and the U.S.. In 1944, he took U.S. citizenship. Two years before his death he moved back to Germany, where he lived in Bad Godesberg.

The approximately 95 kilometre-long line with a top speed of up to 300 km/h, would connect the existing Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt and Mannheim‚ÄìStuttgart high-speed lines, carrying long-distance passenger traffic and freight that now passes over the Mannheim‚ÄìFrankfurt railway. It is also part of Axis No. 24 (Lyon/Genoa‚ÄìBasel‚ÄìDuisburg‚ÄìRotterdam/Antwerp) of the Trans-European Networks. The line is listed as an \\"urgent need\\" in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2030). The options to be implemented should be selected in 2019. The commissioning of the new line is planned for 2030, while the northern section (Zeppelinheim‚ÄìDarmstadt) should go into operation in 2028 (as of 2018).  History  The Rhine-Main and the Rhine-Neckar regions are two of the eleven metropolitan areas in Germany. They are connected by three railway lines, the Main-Neckar Railway, the Mainz‚ÄìLudwigshafen railway and the Mannheim‚ÄìFrankfurt railway (Riedbahn). The Riedbahn, which has been heavily used for years, has been considered overloaded since the commissioning of the Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt high-speed railway at the latest. Around 650 trains (as of 2007) run daily in the corridor between Mannheim and Frankfurt/Mainz; a further increase to about 900 train journeys per day was expected by 2015. Alt URL In the late 1980s, the capacity of the old line was increased from 240 to 280 train movements per day. The long-distance, local and freight traffic causes regular delays on the double- track mixed traffic line. The line is in particular restrictive for long- distance traffic, as it includes the Biblis curve, which is limited to 90 km/h. In addition, there is an urgent need for additional local transport capacity to connect the densely populated area to the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. The traffic forecast drawn up as part of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2003 predicted 32.8 million passenger journeys per year on the Frankfurt- Mannheim section and 17.0 million on the Mannheim‚ÄìStuttgart section in 2015. Freight traffic between Frankfurt and Mannheim would have then been 56.16 million tonnes per year, distributed over both lines.

In the spring of 1998, Deutsche Bahn carried out an internal examination of the option of building a new line, instead of a then planned upgrade of the Riedbahn. An early draft in 1998 proposed a line from Frankfurt Airport, going along the motorway as far as Weiterstadt. From there, the line would run to Hauptbahnhof Darmstadt and then rejoin the motorway in the south of the Darmstadt urban area. As part of the South Hesse Integrated Planning (Integrierten Planung S√ºdhessen), operational investigations were carried out to increase capacity between Frankfurt and Mannheim from 1997 to 1999. The trigger for this was the new Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt high-speed railway opened in 2002, which was expected to result in additional traffic as well as the expected expansion of regional services. It showed that a four-track upgrade of the existing lines would not be possible. As a result, further investigations assumed the construction of a new line. The preliminary planning for the new line started at the end of 1998 or the beginning of 1999. In May 1999, DB commissioned an accounting firm to reassess the project. In addition, the Mottgers link, Frankfurt 21 and Stuttgart 21 were part of the package analysed. It was one of two new construction projects listed in DB‚Äôs Network 21 (Netz 21) strategy adopted in 1999. At the beginning of 2000, Deutsche Bahn announced plans for the new line to bypass Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. The line would therefore pass about five kilometres east of the city and would connect at Schwetzingen with the high- speed line to Stuttgart. Mannheim would be connected via a junction in the area of the Viernheim triangle autobahn interchange. The original approval documents, which provided for a connection to Mannheim, were withdrawn, and the regional planning procedure was stopped at the end of February 2000. The DB justified this step with problems with the connection with Mannheim and at first took no further position. In March 2000, Deutsche Bahn CEO Hartmut Mehdorn, announced that after the completion of the new line, no fewer trains than at present would stop at Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. The CEO described the ensuing dispute over the connection to Mannheim as bordering on \\"hysteria\\" in May 2000. Deutsche Bahn presented two possible routes, including one running through Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, to the Karlsruhe regional administration as part of a first scoping stage on 30 October 2000. After this first discussion, the regional planning procedure could be initiated. As part of the preliminary design, numerous options were examined. In early 2002, the board of Deutsche Bahn decided to initiate the regional planning procedure for the new line with an option following autobahns 5, 67 and 6. This option has proved to be the cheapest; it would enable the highest traffic growth and would be the most environmentally and economically viable option. The 75 kilometre route would allow the journey time between Frankfurt and Stuttgart to be reduced from 79 to 60 minutes. At the same time, improvements would be made to regional transport operations on the existing route. For the Mannheim area, alternatives with a bypass of Mannheim (option A) and with an additional bypass (option B) were introduced. DB did not include a station on the bypass. On 18 April 2002, representatives of Deutsche Bahn confirmed that the company was continuing with its application for the implementation of the regional planning procedure (Raumordnungsverfahren). In 2002 it was still expected that planning approval would be given in 2004 and it would be opened at the end of 2008. Due to a lack of funding, a pause in the development of the ‚Ç¨1.9 billion project was planned after the completion of the regional planning procedure at the end of 2004. According to a media report, the estimated expenditure of ‚Ç¨16.5 million, which would have been necessary for a continuation of the plans, could not be funded. By then, about ‚Ç¨30 million had been invested in the project. The regional planning procedure was carried out from 1999 to 2004 and the planning approval procedures were to run from 2007 to 2011. The Regierungsbezirks (district governments) of Darmstadt and Karlsruhe are in charge of the consultation process. The regional planning procedure for the southern section ended on 18 May 2004 with the handover of the spatial planning assessment for the Baden-W√ºrttemberg section of the route. In particular, it was unclear whether the bypass of Hauptbahnhof Mannheim (bypass solution) could be achieved; in this solution, some freight and long-distance trains would bypass Mannheim without stopping. The massive protests from the region as well as the states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland resulted in the project development lasting for years. = 2004‚Äì2016: continuing unresolved planning and political conflict = An agreement was reached on the route for the connection to Darmstadt at the end of January 2007 and the planned route in Hesse was presented at the beginning of May of the same year. Deutsche Bahn called Europe-wide tenders for the carrying out of environmental planning support planning at the end of April 2007. This was required to last at least one growing season and was a prerequisite for the initiation of the zoning procedure. It was planned to record the occurrence of more than 500 animal and plant species on an area of 20,000 hectares in a corridor up to 1000 metre-wide along the planned route. Further investigation was required on sections of the route that passed through Natura 2000 areas. The data was to be used to draw up a landscape management plan, which would define ecological compensatory measures for land consumed. The detailed technical planning was to be awarded in August. This would include the detailed routing. A working group on the Baden-W√ºrttemberg section of new line, initiated by minister president G√ºnther Oettinger, was due to commence operations at the beginning of September 2007. The minister president and the cabinet spoke in favour of a connection to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof and against a bypass. At a hearing with the Federal Railway Authority to prepare the environmental impact assessment of the southern sector, representatives from the region around Mannheim also reaffirmed their rejection of a bypass of Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. In mid-September 2007, Deutsche Bahn AG awarded a contract for the technical planning. The contract, which would also determine the exact route, had a value of ‚Ç¨7.5 million. Among other things, noise protection and train control and safety systems would be planned in detail within this framework. As late as 2007, large-scale construction was planned to begin in 2011 with the project to become operational in 2017. The section of new line between Neu-Isenburg-Zeppelinheim and Mannheim-Waldhof and Mannheim-Pfingstberg would be 77 kilometres-long. The existing, double-track railway between Frankfurt-Stadion and Neu-Isenburg- Zeppelinheim (five km) would be increased to four tracks. About eight km of the high-speed line would run through twelve tunnels. The project would involve a total of about 100 road and 30 railway bridges. Over a length of about 19 km the line was to run in \\"trough structures\\" (that is with support walls and a solid base), with a length of about seven km in tunnels (all data: as of June 2007). In 2009, it was planned to start the first preparatory measures for the new line as of 2011 and a financing agreement was concluded to that effect. Construction would take six years according to plans from 2007. The railway was expected to have a construction cost of about ‚Ç¨2 billion in 2007. In February 2008, DB AG called Europe-wide tenders for the preliminary design and approval planning. In December 2008, Deutsche Bahn AG initiated the planning approval for a 13 km-long section between Frankfurt Stadion station and the municipal limits of M√∂rfelden and Erzhausen. This section included an upgrade of the existing Riedbahn to four tracks and the construction of an island platform in Zeppelinheim station. The section was discussed at a public hearing and published in 2009. Deutsche Bahn expected in July 2010 that the planning approval decision would be made at the beginning of 2011. After some changes to the plan, the planning documents for the section were rewritten in September 2010. At the end of July 2017, this planning approval procedure was terminated at the request of DB Netz AG. As of mid-2010, the planning approval procedure for the eleven-kilometre section between Gernsheim and Einhausen was due to begin in late 2010/early 2011. The planning approval procedure for the 22 km-long section between Darmstadt and Mannheim was to commence in the first half of 2011. In the course of the review of the federal railway needs plan, which was presented in 2010, the federal government indicated that it considered that there was still room for improvement with regard to the project layout. The cost-benefit ratio was estimated in the report at 1.2 (benefits of ‚Ç¨2.212 billion compared to costs of ‚Ç¨1.683 billion) and was thus just above the minimum for an economically worthwhile project. Furthermore, the report notes that not all capacity constraints in the Rhine-Main/Rhine-Neckar area would be eliminated by the new line. Above all, the section between Darmstadt Hbf and Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld was expected to remain a bottleneck with a capacity utilisation of more than 110%. In January 2011, Deutsche Bahn, according to its own information, was still in the process of testing the developed route on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport. The examination process would be completed in autumn 2011. On 15 March 2012, the Ministry of Transport presented the 2011‚Äì2015 investment framework for federal transport infrastructure (Investitionsrahmenplan 2011‚Äì2015 f√ºr die Verkehrsinfrastruktur des Bundes). The new line was listed in it under \\"other important projects that generally start after 2015\\". In early 2012, the Federal Ministry of Transport commissioned a study to develop an overall transport concept for the railway corridor and to submit proposals for development measures. The first results showed that a new line between Frankfurt and Mannheim was still indispensable. The planning of the new line should therefore be further developed with a view to increasing capacity and additional freight traffic. The final results of the study were expected in mid-2013. Deutsche Bahn then wanted to initiate the optimisation of the planning at short notice. The submission of the full report was expected in mid-2014 to occur in autumn 2014. The reviewers recommended in March 2015 that the best solution would be a new line parallel to the A 5 and A 67 motorways. The revision of the planning was also foreseen in consultation processes. On 21 July 2014, the commissioned company, Intraplan, presented the first results of the Korridorstudie Mittelrhein (Middle Rhine corridor study). The study recommended a mixed traffic route along the A 5 and A 67 motorways. The line would be used by faster passenger traffic during the day and by freight traffic at night. There would be different options for the integration of the line into Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. The full opinion was originally expected to be presented in autumn 2014, followed by a public consultation phase before a decision was taken on the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 (Bundesverkehrswegeplan 2030) by mid-2015. It was then planned that the results would be available by the end of 2014 (as of November 2014). The initiation of the first planning approval procedure was planned for 2017 (as of January 2016). The line was due to be opened in 2015. = From 2016: Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 and resumption of planning = Event marking the resumption of the planning of the Rhine/Main‚ÄìRhine/Neckar high-speed line in the large auditorium of the Technical University of Darmstadt. A public consultation phase took place during 2015 in preparation for the determination of the 2030 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. The state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg listed the project, with full integration of Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2015 (later renamed the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030). The investment of ‚Ç¨220 million was planned in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The \\"NBS Rhein/Main ‚Äì Rhein/Neckar‚Äú project was listed in the \\"draft proposals\\" in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2015 of 5 May 2014 on the \\"(Frankfurt am Main Stadion ‚Äì) Zeppelinheim ‚Äì Mannheim-Waldhof\\" route with a top speed of 300 km/h. The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 was adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 3 August 2016. Deutsche Bahn and the ministries of transport of Hesse and Baden-W√ºrttemberg presented a roadmap for future planning at the Technical University of Darmstadt on 30 September 2016. According to the Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, the interest in this event was \\"enormous\\". Representatives of more than 20 citizens' initiative movements fighting against noise between Hockenheim and the Hessian mountain road were present. In particular, the route in the Lorsch‚ÄìViernheim‚ÄìMannheim triangle was still very controversial. Mannheim mayor Peter Kurz had decided to oppose an above-ground route in the Mannheim urban area. Five new working groups of the planning process (inter alia \\"Traffic concept\\" and \\"Darmstadt and surroundings route\\") began their work in the first quarter of 2017. Working Group 2 on \\"Transport concept\\" met in Lampertheim on 26 February 2018. In addition to the concept favoured by Deutsche Bahn of a double-track new line used during the day by long-distance passenger trains and at night by freight trains, three other concepts were discussed: # a new line as a pure freight line, # a new line for mixed traffic during the day including an overtaking loop, # a four-track new line. In May 2018, Deutsche Bahn continued to favour a new double-track line that would be used during the day for long-distance traffic and at night for freight traffic. The citizens' initiative BI NOBL strongly supported a new line with four tracks. In the middle of 2018, the planning approval procedure for the Zeppelinheim‚ÄìDarmstadt section was planned to be completed in the same year, with the commissioning to take place in 2028. At the end of 2018, the route option was scheduled to be selected in 2019 and the planning approval process would then be initiated for the Zeppelinheim‚ÄìDarmstadt section. In the middle of 2018, it was planned to complete the preliminary planning for the Darmstadt area (planning approval section 2) in mid-2019 and to initiate the planning approval procedure in 2022. For the Pfungstadt‚ÄìLorsch section (PFA 3 and 4), the technical planning of the new line (together with an upgrade of the A 67 motorway to 6 lanes) was to be updated by the end of 2018 and the planning approval procedure was to be initiated in 2019. For the Lorsch‚ÄìMannheim section (PFA 5 and 6), the alignment was still pending with the selection of the route expected to take place at the beginning of 2019 and the planning approval documents to be submitted in 2022.  Impact  After the commissioning of the new line, the capacity of the existing line would be sufficient to allow the increase of services on the S-Bahn line 7 to Gro√ü-Gerau from every half-hour to every quarter of an hour and to connect with the planned Terminal 3 of Frankfurt Airport. Operations of the first stage of the new terminal is scheduled to commence in 2021. A regional service designated as the Hessenexpress would connect Wiesbaden (via the Wallau link) with Frankfurt airport. A extension via Darmstadt to Mannheim is under consideration. The line is to pass under or over the A3. This could be done as part of a planned upgrade of the Wiesbaden motorway junction. The planning approval procedure is to be initiated in 2020. The Hessenexpress is to operate from 2025. After the scheduled start of operations on the northern section (Zeppelinheim‚ÄìDarmstadt) of the new line in 2028, the service would be extended to Darmstadt. The first German clock-face timetable concept presented in October 2018 envisages two and a half trains per hour and direction on the line between the two main stations, a travel time of 29 minutes with 300 km/h high-speed trains and a travel time of 31 minutes with 250 km/h high-speed trains. Between Frankfurt Airport and Mannheim there would be a half-hourly service with 250 or 300 km/h fast trains with a travel time of 26 and 27 minutes, respectively. The second draft report submitted in May 2019 provides for three train pairs per hour.  Planned route  Two options were investigated in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and five in Hesse during the regional planning procedure. The route is considered highly controversial. While a consensus was found for the northern section of the line in Hesse (56 km) at the beginning of 2007, negotiations on the southern section in Baden-W√ºrttemberg (29 km) continue.  Hesse  mountain road makes mobile\\") in Lorsch supporting a proposal for the new line in that area to go through a 11.9 kilometre-long tunnel. The route would run between Frankfurt Stadion station and Neu-Isenburg-Zeppelinheim parallel to the old line. The project includes the construction of a third stage of Frankfurt Stadion station. The five routes investigated in the northern section (Hesse) were: * Option I: a direct route between Mannheim and Frankfurt without intermediate stops. Deutsche Bahn emphasised that even if this option was implemented, Darmstadt would remain connected to the long-distance network via the Main-Neckar Railway. The cost of this option, including the quadruplication between Frankfurt-Stadion and Zeppelinheim, was estimated at ‚Ç¨1.2 billion in 2004 values. * Option II: a similar route to option I, but with a newly built long-distance station called Darmstadt West in the Siedlung Tann area. The estimated additional costs compared to option I in 2009 was ‚Ç¨100 million (in 2009 values). * Options III/IV: a route through the city of Darmstadt and the Hauptbahnhof. The estimated additional cost of option III compared to option I in 2001 was ‚Ç¨135 million (as of the regional planning procedure in 2001). In this option, noise protection measures were recommended over a length of about 8.2 km. The number of people affected by new construction noise was specified in the regional planning procedure to be 79,740. The estimated additional costs of option IV compared to option I in 2004 amounted to ‚Ç¨300 million. Noise protection measures with a length of 9.9 km were recommended for this option; the number of people affected by new construction noise was stated as 120,300 in the regional planning procedure. * Option V: the connection of Darmst√§dt Hauptbahnhof by means of a double track connection to the new line. In the context of the preparation of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2003, this option was assigned the greatest economic benefits. Another advantage is that the nighttime freight traffic in this solution would bypass Darmstadt. The number of long-distance trains corresponds to those of options III/IV. Due to the greater length of the track, the land consumption of options III and IV is greater than that of options I and II. For options I and II, soundproofing measures of just 6.3 km in length were recommended as part of a noise analysis; the number of citizens affected was stated in the regional planning procedure at 65,940. Furthermore, option II with a long-distance Darmstadt West station would have greater economic returns than options III and IV, which would entail high expenditures for engineering structures and soundproofing measures. Deutsche Bahn originally favoured option I, while the Hessian state government and the affected districts favoured options III/IV. In all options, the rest of the route runs next to motorways for its whole length. At a press conference on 2 February 2007 in Darmstadt, the DB CEO Hartmut Mehdorn, the Hessian Minister of Economics Alois Rhiel, Darmstadt Lord Mayor Walter Hoffmann and district council leaders Alfred Jakoubek (Darmstadt-Dieburg) and Matthias Wilkes (Bergstra√üe) for the Hessian part of the route called for the so-called consensus or bundled route. This starts after the existing underground connection with the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway south of the Frankfurter Kreuz and runs on the eastern side parallel to the A5. After Darmst√§dter Kreuz (Darmstadt motorway interchange), the line follows the A 67 and crosses the motorway at Lorsch to continue on the western side of the motorway. According to Deutsche Bahn information, the city of Darmstadt would be relieved of over 210 daily trains, including up to 40 freight trains at night. Deutsche Bahn tested a route along the A 5 and analysed it for environmental noise. Since the option favoured by Deutsche Bahn along the A 67 was also compatible with land use planning, the route was considered to commit \\"no breach of law‚Äú. The Bund f√ºr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland criticised the route for touching several flora and fauna habitats and bird reserves. In an interview on 15 September 2006, Oliver Kraft, DB Netz's board member responsible for investments, threatened to suspend planning at the end of 2006 if Darmstadt and Mannheim continued to insist on all trains stopping in these cities. At the same time, he offered to support a connection to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof. In April 2008, district administrator Matthias Wilkes of Bergstra√üe presented a feasibility study, according to which a tunnel through the Hessian Ried was cheaper than the ground-level route favoured by DB. The study also emphasised the fact that such a tunnel would reduce noise pollution and would not disrupt the Natura 2000 site. The Bergstra√üe district supported a route for the new line to the west of the A 67 from 2008. In March 2019, around 2,000 people demonstrated against a route in the southern Hessian town of Lampertheim that would turn off directly south of Lorsch towards Mannheim and run firstly through the Lampertheim forest. The protesters feared that high-quality arable land would be destroyed and that it would cut through a game-rich forest. This route option was added to Deutsche Bahn planning as option \\"Mannheim Direct\\" or \\"option E\\" in November 2019. = Darmstadt Bypass = The bypass of Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof was also controversial. This option was originally rejected in the regional planning procedure. Both a bypass of Darmstadt and a direct connection to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof without a bypass had been discussed. However, a direct connection would not only have been the most expensive option, it would also have caused the greatest environmental impact. According to DB information, however, the land used would be comparatively low for the planned option. Introduced in February 2007, the consensus route (Konsenstrasse) was intended to run from the high-speed line into Darmstadt and connect Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof via a single-track loop to the new line. This line would branch off between Weiterstadt-Riedbahn and the T√§ubchesh√∂hle nature reserve towards the Hauptbahnhof and reconnect in the area of Kelley Barracks (near Pfungstadt) south of the Darmstadt interchange. The southern entry and exit is to be operated at up to 200 km/h and the northern at up to 160 km/h. In this option, the majority of the long-distance trains that currently run over the Riedbahn would bypass Darmstadt. In addition, Deutsche Bahn has contractually agreed that at least one ICE service per hour and direction would stop in Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof. The 13 km-long connection from Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof was considered structurally complicated, as several major roads and land formerly used by the US Army and areas protected under Natura 2000 have to be crossed. Compared to option V, the number of tracks has been reduced from two to one. Residents of areas next to the link feared additional noise and called for the construction of a station on the new line outside the centre of Darmstadt. At the end of March 2009, the mayor of Darmstadt surprisingly announced that he could no longer pursue the bypass option, which would cost up to ‚Ç¨112 million, and instead opted for a long-distance station on the new line. Such a station would probably have had to be underground. According to DB information such a station would have been served by more ICE services than the Hauptbahnhof if served by a connection. This option would also have the lowest impact on the environment. According to DB information, such an external station was investigated at the request of the city of Darmstadt. Since only the connection to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof is part of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, such a long-distance station would have to be financed from Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs own funds. According to recent calculations, the solution favoured by the city of Darmstadt along Eschollbr√ºcker Stra√üe would have cost ‚Ç¨103 million built in a trough structure or ‚Ç¨112 million in a tunnel. A ground-level option was calculated to cost ‚Ç¨67.6 million. In mid-January 2010, Deutsche Bahn submitted a report in which a Darmstadt West long-distance station (Fernbahnhof) was considered feasible and useful. Accordingly, the travel time between the proposed long-distance station and the Hauptbahnhof by tram would have been 20 minutes under ideal conditions. At the end of August 2010, the city's Transport and Environment Committees drew up a proposal to connect Darmstadt with the new line only to the north, which would support a shuttle service to Frankfurt Airport. Darmstadt City Council finally also called for a full connection to the Hauptbahnhof at the direction of the new Darmstadt Mayor J√ºrgen Partsch. A \\"North connection of Darmstadt Hbf to the new line\\" was included in the \\"draft of project proposals\\" for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2015 of 5 May 2014. According to this draft, a \\"rail connection from Terminal 3 of Frankfurt Airport\\" is also planned. The Middle Rhine Corridor Study (Korridorstudie Mittelrhein), which was submitted in March 2015, proposed various options for connecting Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof. Such connections were not economically justifiable just to enable ICE stops, since the advantages for passengers entering and exiting at Darmstadt would be outweighed by disadvantages for passengers passing through Darmstadt. A northern connection to the Hauptbahnhof could be justified with fast regional trains to Frankfurt Airport, which could cover the route in 13 minutes. A southern connection would be economical if it were used by freight trains and avoided a planned connecting curve for freight trains at Weiterstadt. At the beginning of January 2016, talks about the Darmstadt connection were well advanced according to the Hessian Minister of Transport Tarek Al-Wazir, although the exact routing had not been determined. The German clock-face timetable concept presented in October 2018 assumes a southern connection between Darmstadt and the new line.  Baden-W√ºrttemberg  Three options are being discussed for the route in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and nearby Hesse‚Äîthe route between Lorsch and Mannheim runs largely through Hessian territory: * Under Option A, the line would take a 90-degree curve to the west at the end of the A 67 before running along the A 6\\\\. The route then makes another 90-degree curve to the south and connects to the Mannheim‚ÄìFrankfurt railway at a junction in Sandhofen. * Under Option B (bypass of Mannheim), the line would run south from the Viernheim triangle interchange along the A 6 and change to the east side of the motorway north of Wallstadt. The line would then cross the Neckar, the A 656 and the Mannheim marshalling yard. The line would connect with the Mannheim‚ÄìStuttgart high-speed railway in the Pfingstberg tunnel. * Lothar Mark, a federal member of parliament, put forward Option C (also called the Mark Option and called the Mannheim direct option by DB) which would involve a route running from Lorsch diagonally through the forest. This option was favoured by Deutsche Bahn in March 2009. In the regional planning decision of May 2004, the regional council of Karlsruhe rejected option B, which was preferred by DB. Deutsche Bahn objected that only the concerns of the region had been taken into account, while the transport policy goals of the new project went far beyond the region. As recently as September 2007, it was planned to initiate the planning approval procedures for the southern section of the Hessian line by the end of 2008. At the end of November 2009, the ICE corridor through the Bergstr√§√üe district (ICE- Trassenf√ºhrung auf Bergstr√§√üer Gemarkungen) working group (which included the affected Bergstra√üe district, community groups and conservation organisations) stated that a majority wanted the new line to run west of the A 67 motorway. This decision was supported by a new legal opinion, according to which Option C required a completely new regional planning procedure. The nature conservation associations BUND and NABU represented in the working group did not support either options A or C. They preferred the longest possible underground route and opposed the removal of EU protected status from areas that would obstruct a desired route. In November 2010, environmental associations from Hesse and Baden-W√ºrttemberg for the first time jointly advocated route option C as the more environmentally friendly option. In contrast to option A, it would be possible to avoid forest fragmentation with a cut-and-cover tunnel. The Hessian Minister of Transport Dieter Posch, however, declined, to support the \\"Mannheim direct\\" option in March 2011. In May 2012, DB director Grube called for the line to be bundled with motorways A 67 and A 6 so that no forest areas would be cut. = Mannheim Bypass = As part of the regional planning procedure in the southern section a connection to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof (so-called Option A) was examined as well as a bypass of the Hauptbahnhof, including a link to it (called the \\"bypass option\\" or Option B). Deutsche Bahn favours the bypass of Mannheim Hauptbahnhof (with double track connections to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof at Mannheim-Waldhof and Hockenheim), but many interest groups in the Rhine/Neckar region reject it. The region is the seventh largest German conurbation with about 2.3 million inhabitants. Deutsche Bahn sees an advantage of the bypass in that it would largely avoid noise pollution caused by freight traffic in the urban area. Both the Main-Neckar Railway and the old east branch of the Riedbahn, if it was reactivated by DB, would be available for goods traffic. Deutsche Bahn began rebuilding the east branch of the Riedbahn in November 2007. With additional costs of ‚Ç¨435 million, the bypass option would have greater traffic utilisation and greater economic benefits than option A. Deutsche Bahn also emphasised its intention to have the same number of long-distance trains stopping in Mannheim for both options (as of 2003). The invitation to tender for the design and approval planning of February 2008 specified a bypass of Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. The Landtag of Baden-W√ºrttemberg unanimously rejected the bypass of Mannheim on 19 June 2002. In the framework of the regional planning procedure, the Karlsruhe Regional Council classified option A (no bypass) as compatible with spatial planning, while the bypass solution (option B) was classified as non-compatible with spatial planning. The bypass solution would allow a journey time of 53 minutes between Frankfurt and Stuttgart (compared to 70 minutes previously). This would allow a system time of one hour, which would be favourable for a clock-face timetable. In conjunction with the planned Stuttgart‚ÄìAugsburg new and upgraded railway the travel time for long-distance traffic between Frankfurt am Main and Munich would be reduced from today's minimum of 3¬Ω to as little as 2¬Ω hours in the future. The main disadvantage of this option lies in the bypass of Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, a long-distance traffic node, by some of the trains running between Stuttgart and Frankfurt. A possible compromise provides for the construction of the bypass option, with an hourly ICE service between Frankfurt and Stuttgart that would pass Mannheim, but with other long-distance trains running via Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. In addition, a stop at a new ICE station to be constructed on the bypass route between Mannheim and Heidelberg (near Seckenheim) is being considered. The federal government saw (as of 2007) no need for a bypass option and therefore excluded its financing from federal funds. According to the Regionalforums ICE-Knoten Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar ICE node regional forum) the region and Deutsche Bahn agreed that Mannheim Hauptbahnhof would be able to handle the additional traffic that would use the new line. At the beginning of October 2007, Deutsche Bahn announced a competition to design three bridges near Mannheim worth ‚Ç¨228,000. Accordingly, the construction of a 100 m-long bridge over the Mannheim motorway interchange, a 300 m-long bridge over the Mannheim marshalling yard and a 400 m long bridge over the Neckar were planned. In November 2007, Deutsche Bahn cancelled the tender for bridge construction due to the sensitive political situation in the Mannheim area.  Technology  For train protection the track should be equipped with ETCS Level 2 (Baseline 3) without conventional colour light signals.  Cost The Investment framework plan for Federal Transport Infrastructure by 2010 provided for investments of ‚Ç¨1,316.3 million for the project (2006 prices). By 2005, a total of ‚Ç¨20.7 million had been spent. Federal funds amounting to ‚Ç¨17.0 million were to be invested between 2006 and 2010. In addition to this period, there was a financing requirement of ‚Ç¨1,278.6 million (federal funds from 2011, DB AG‚Äôs own funds and third-party contributions from 2006). The project is listed in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2003 as \\"new project\\" no. 13; the planned investment costs, including the connection to the Mannheim-Stuttgart line and a reserve for planning, amounted to ‚Ç¨1,771.4 million. Due to the delay in construction, the European Commission reduced the funding for the project by ‚Ç¨12 million at the end of 2010.

It has a brown cap, and is usually found with oak trees. It differs from the true boletes in that the spores are a pale straw colour.  Taxonomy  The species was described initially by the French mycologist Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pierre Bulliard (1742‚Äì1792). Formerly a member of the family Paxillaceae, research now places this mushroom in Gyroporaceae. Gyroporus means 'having round pores', and castaneus is a reference to the chestnut colouration.  Description  The cap is from 3 to 10 cm in diameter, and pale to rusty brown in colour, which becomes darker with age. The stem is a similar colour, although it may be lighter at the apex. If the stem is cut vertically, it is usual to find several cavities of differing sizes inside. Both the cap and the stem have a tendency to crack or split in dry periods, or with age. The pores are small and white; they become dirtier with age, and are not attached to the stem. They darken slightly when pressed. The tubes are also whitish, and the spore print is pale yellow to straw. The flesh is firm, and does not change colour on cutting. The photograph on the right shows the chunkier form; a slender form also occurs. Illustration of typical stem cavities in G. castaneus  Distribution and habitat  The mushroom is found occasionally in Britain and throughout continental Europe, as well as eastern North America, but it is rare in western North America. It grows in small groups, or singly, in an ectomycorrhizal relationship with oaks (Quercus). It prefers acid and sandy soils, and fruits from summer to autumn. In New Zealand, it is found in association with Leptospermum. In Asia, it has been recorded from Taiwan. Gyroporus castaneus has been included in the Moscow Oblast's and the Russian Federation's Red Book and several other countries' Red Lists, including those of Norway and Montenegro.  Edibility  Gyroporus castaneus is edible, and highly regarded by most authors; it is said to taste pleasantly nutty when young. However, Marcel Bon, in his 1987 book The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe, records it as suspect, so it may be worth applying caution, by eating a very small amount initially. There is also reportedly a poisonous strain of this mushroom in coastal Portugal.

Last accessed May 22, 2007. Funkhouser won the mayoral election on March 27, 2007. Funkhouser's campaign motto was \\"A city that works for regular folks.\\" He had campaigned on a promise to pay more attention to neighborhoods and to end corrupt TIF deals with special-interest developers. During his mayoral campaign in 2007, he became known by the citizens of Kansas City by his nickname, \\"The Funk\\". Funkhouser's wife, Gloria Squitiro, ran his campaign. Funkhouser wore an orange tie in reference to the Ukrainian Orange Revolution and as a symbol of his desire for change.Kansas City heads to polls Tuesday to pick next mayor, KCTV. Last accessed May 22, 2007. From his campaign website: \\"I've chosen orange as my official campaign color because it is fast becoming a symbol for change in politics - a shift away from back-room deal making and toward an open style of governance that respects and listens to citizens.\\" Funkhouser was also critical of project spending during the Kay Barnes administration. In a KCTV interview he said, \\"We've been buying stuff,\\" he said. \\"What we don't know is whether what we bought is what is worth what we paid for it.\\" Controversies Free automobile Implementation of Funkhouser's campaign pledges of fiscal conservatism while cleaning up local government received national headlines early in his administration when Funkhouser announced his intention to accept a new leased Honda Civic Hybrid from a Northland auto dealer. The city's law department approved the offer, which would have been reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission. Funkhouser believed that by being transparent about the transaction, he could avoid any appearance of impropriety and save the city $160,000 a year by rejecting the city-owned car, with its attendant driver and police security detail. However, critics questioned the \\"gift.\\" City Councilman John Sharp said \\"It sure doesn't pass the smell test...It's nice that the mayor is providing so much free publicity to a foreign auto company.\\"Kansas City Mayor Has No Problem Accepting Free Car - Fox News - June 13, 2007 Funkhouser eventually rejected the hybrid, choosing instead to drive his privately owned vehicle himself.Mayor changes mind: no free car - Kansas City Star 19 June, 2007 Minutemen controversy Funkhouser became embroiled in another controversy when it was discovered his appointed co- commissioner for the Parks and Recreation Board Frances Semler was a member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. Critics insisted that Semler resign the board or the Minutemen. This controversy attracted national attention, prompting two national civil rights organizations (La Raza and the NAACP) to withdraw their conventions from Kansas City in protest of Funkhouser's refusal to ask for Semler's resignation from an organization they call a \\"hate group.\\" Funkhouser's supporters say Funkhouser believes that \\"diversity\\" encompasses not only skin color but also opinion, and they point to another commissioner, Ajamu Webster, who founded the local National Black United Front (NBUF), an organization advocating reparations and separatist education for blacks. They note that the Southern Rights Coalition doesn't consider the Minutemen a \\"hate group.\\" They also claim Semler's personal views on immigration are not germane to her professional service as a parks commissioner.Funkhouser's Frances Semler under pressure to resign for being Minutemen member - The Audacious Epigone - June 14, 2007 Gloria Squitiro An ongoing controversy during Funkhouser's term as mayor involved his wife's carrying out the normal duties of First Lady, a strictly volunteer position. Revered during the campaign for her honest newsletters, \\"Notes From the DoubleWide,\\" upon his election, Funkhouser's wife, a small business owner and doula, took a desk near his office within City Hall, and brought that personal glimpse into his office. Funkhouser had stated that he and his wife were a \\"political team.\\" He asserts that it was squarely within his authority to have anyone on a volunteer basis, further citing that Squitiro was his advisor during the election. Critics said her participation in her husband's administration is a clear violation of the Missouri Constitution's \\"Nepotism Clause\\" . The City Council passed an ordinance (the only nay vote being Funkhouser's) on the pretense of banning certain types of volunteers from serving at City Hall, but the only one it effectively barred was Squitiro from the premises. In response, Funkhouser began holding meetings in which she was needed in public libraries. Funkhouser filed suit against the city, claiming the \\"volunteer ordinance\\" unconstitutional. The court ruled in Funkhouser's favor and the ordinance was repealed Personal life An avid chess player, Funkhouser celebrated his election night party at the Westport Flea Market, a neighborhood tavern where he regularly met with the Westport Chess Club to play.

She ran a brothel at 1725 6th Avenue in the heart of the red-light district, which was known as The Line, from approximately 1906 to 1941. Her clients included politicians, factory workers and military men. Mame Faye is currently honoured by a New York tugboat bearing her name. Personal life Mame Faye was born Mary Alice Fahey, the daughter of Irish immigrants Thomas Fahey and Margaret McNamara Fahey. She had two siblings: Thomas, who was killed when struck by a train in 1896, and Martha, who later married Michael Myers. Faye married a man named Bonter in 1897 (presumed to be saloon owner G. A. Bonter), but Mrs. Mary Bonter reported herself \\"single\\" or \\"widowed\\" on censuses from 1910 on. In the 1905 City Directory she was recorded as living with her brother-in-law (assumed to be Michael Myers) at 330 First Street. Little is known about Mary Fahey's life before 1904, when a prostitute named \\"Mame Fay\\" was arrested in a sweep of Troy's houses of ill repute. After retiring she lived with her nephew Thomas Myers. Mrs. Mary Bonter died two years later at the age of 77, leaving an estate valued at $282,690.76 (about $3.5 million today) to her nephew Thomas. She was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery in the Fahey family plot. Although she set aside $2,500 to pay for a monument, none was erected until 2006. Bordello Faye purchased a row house in 1906 and opened her own bordello on 1725 Sixth Avenue, three buildings north of the police station and opposite the Union Station. Sixth Avenue led up the hill to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and a set of steps led from the back of Faye's house to the Institute. A policeman was often stationed outside the brothel at busy times to keep the patrons in order. In return, Faye would keep the police station supplied with fresh coffee. City censuses from 1910 to 1930 list up to six female boarders between the ages of 19 and 36 living in Mary's house, whose occupations were listed variously as \\"domestic\\" or \\"unemployed.\\" The census also lists a \\"radio set\\" on the premises. As a city, Troy developed a reputation for this kind of work, largely built on serving the New England market, where houses could not operate as freely. (Another well-known house was the Old Daley Inn, now the \\"Olde 499 House\\" restaurant.) Access to Canadian liquor also supported the business, especially through Prohibition. Faye would recruit prostitutes from local lunch shops, telling them they were \\"sitting on a million\\" and offer them $100 a week wages, at time when a female factory worker would earn $15-$18 a week. Faye was reported to be good to the women who worked for her and made sure they were in good health and received medical care when needed. In 1927 she gave the doctor who attended the brothel two tickets for a holiday in Havana. In the 1930s, a local newspaper included a flyer for 5 of the bordellos of The Line, including Mame Faye's Notchery. Mame's nearly 40-year career as madam coincided with a major shift in American attitudes toward prostitution. What earlier Victorian mores had deemed a necessary evil became known as \\"the social evil.\\" An effective public campaign was waged to prove that prostitution was the cause of all other social ills, particularly venereal disease epidemics among soldiers. Wildly overblown reports of \\"white slavery,\\" in which young (mostly white) women were kidnapped by (mostly Asian) men and forced into prostitution, swept the nation. This was one of the major American culture wars of the 20th century. \\" The passage of the Mann Act forced the hand of local governments who had allowed this illegal practice to flourish for decades. Mame had a lot of money and a good lawyer. Still, after decades of legal skirmishes, her house was closed for good in 1941. District Attorney Earl Wiley made a name for himself by clearing the social evil from the notoriously corrupt Troy. The 6th Avenue row house was torn down in 1952 are part of an improvement to the city. Film In 2008, directors Penny Lane and Anne Marie Lanesey made a documentary film was made about Mame Faye entitled \\"Sittin' on a Million\\", the title being a phrase Faye reportedly used when recruiting prostitutes. Lane and Lanesey are both graduates of the RPI.

Family and childhood Public references to Drexel's nation of origin and pedigree were contrary to privately recorded facts. As early as 1915 (in American press reports) and as late as the 1940s (in Nazi broadcasts), she was described as a member of the \\"famous Drexel family\\" of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an apparent reference to the descendants of Francis Martin Drexel (who founded the Drexel & Company banking empire), including his son Anthony Joseph Drexel (who founded Drexel University in Philadelphia) and his granddaughter Saint Katharine Drexel. By all accounts, including the one provided by Constance Drexel to the Bureau of Investigation in 1918,Interview reports of Agent J.F. McDevitt regarding ‚ÄúConstance Drexel, application for passport‚Äù June 21, 1918, available at footnote.com; accessed August 5, 2008. she was born in Germany, apparently in the 1880s, many decades after Francis Drexel emigrated from Europe to Philadelphia in 1817. After she began broadcasting from Nazi Germany during wartime, at least one American syndicated columnist speculated that ‚ÄúDrexel‚Äù was a pseudonym.Baukhage, \\"Washington Digest: Imperial Hopes may Linger but Where will Nazis Flee?\\", Rock Valley (IA) Bee, September 19, 1944; page 3. Published information regarding her age and date of birth is also wildly inconsistent. Historian John Carver Edwards has concluded Drexel was born in Darmstadt, Germany on November 28, 1894, to Theodore Drexel, scion of a wealthy family in Frankfurt, Germany, and Zelda Audemar Drexel, daughter of a prominent Swiss watch manufacturer, and was brought to the United States by her father the following year. However, all five ship manifests in Ellis Island records documenting her re-entry into the Port of New York between 1905 and 1923 give an age commensurate with birth in the 1880s.Ellis Island Passenger Ship Database, search results for Constance Drexel; accessed March 7, 2009. A U.S. Department of Justice internal memorandum prepared in 1946 described her birth date as November 24, 1884.Office Memorandum from Nathan T. Elliff to Assistant Attorney General Theron L. Caudle re: Treason Cases, June 14, 1946; accessed October 10, 2010. Drexel became a United States citizen upon her father‚Äôs naturalization in 1899. She reported to the FBI in 1918 that she had a sister named Norma Georgia Drexel, then living in Switzerland. Constance grew up not in Philadelphia, but in Roslindale, Massachusetts, where she attended public schools. \\"As an adolescent she divided her time between the United States and Europe, attending school in four different countries and honing her skills as a writer\\", completing her education at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. World War I Miss Drexel first received national publicity in early 1915, when American newspapers began to report that ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Heiress‚Äù Constance Drexel had volunteered briefly as a Red Cross nurse near the front lines in France in the early months of World War I, and reported on her experiences.\\"Heiress Helps Cause\\", The Washington Post, January 30, 1915, at page 4Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger, February 8, 1915, at page 16.Portrait of Constance Drexel, chroniclingamerica.loc.gov, Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger, February 8, 1915; accessed January 29, 2018. She became active nationally and internationally in the International Woman's Congress, which met at The Hague in the neutral Netherlands, in April 1915. When she agreed to write dispatches regarding the Congress for American newspapers to publish, her career as a professional journalist began. She soon joined the staff of the Philadelphia Public Ledger. When her stories expanded to include not just her experiences but also her opinions, reactions were mixed. In one such article, she wrote \\"[one] must realize that an increase in horrors hastens the end of the war; so in the long run it's the most humane thing to have no relief funds or nurses. That's why I left the Red Cross\\".\\"Red Cross Nurses Prolong the War: So Declares a Girl who is Tired of Her Job\\", The Fort Wayne News, September 14, 1915; page 9. A Chicago Herald editorial entitled ‚ÄúHorrible Logic‚Äù observed that her statement went far to confirm ‚Äúthat, when once moved to cruelty, women are infinitely more cruel than men.‚ÄùEditorial in the Chicago Herald entitled ‚ÄúHorrible Logic‚Äù, reprinted in the Newark Advocate, September 18, 1915, at page 4. In another column, she opined that \\"perhaps the greatest curse of war\\" was \\"the effect of the loss of men on women and on the race\\". She explained that the most \\"harrowing sight in all of war-ridden Europe today\\" was \\"the spectacle of the young girls who must always live unmated, robbed of their birthright\\". \\"Her writings suggested an enthusiasm for Germany's preparedness campaign, and especially women's role in that effort\\", according to Edwards. She became involved in the women's suffrage movement, and, in 1916, as a campaigner for the re-election of Woodrow Wilson. After the United States declared war on the German Empire, she attempted to return to Europe with the announced purpose of visiting her ailing sister in Switzerland, but a complaint from a colleague at the Public Ledger who alleged she had made pro-German comments led to a federal investigation. Her editors attested to her loyalty, but in part because of her German birth and her pacifism, the investigating agent concluded that she should not be permitted to use her passport. Covering the Paris Conference, Congress and the League of Nations She returned to Europe soon after the end of the war, first to cover the Paris Peace Conference and then to cover and participate in the Inter-Allied Women's Conference of the International Conference of Women and International Woman Suffrage Alliance (which succeeded in obtaining a woman‚Äôs equality clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations). Returning to the United States, she covered the suffrage campaign, and when women won the right to vote, she became one of Capitol Hill's few women political correspondents. Her readership peaked in the 1920s, when her columns on the status of women around the world, and interviews with world leaders, were published in many newspapers, including not only the Public Ledger but also the Chicago Tribune, The New York Times,Constance Drexel, \\"Women to be a Force at Party Conventions\\", The New York Times, June 1, 1924.\\"Parliament Gives Heed Now to its Women Members\\", The New York Times, July 27, 1924.Woman's Status Highest in America\\", The New York Times, January 4, 1925. and members of the McClure Syndicate. Interest in Nazi Germany By the early 1930s she achieved a ‚Äúgrowing stature among the press corps and certain political circles,‚Äù on issues such as international arms control and world peace. Her interest in those issues did not prevent her from becoming enamored with the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement in Germany. Edwards concluded that she liked Hitler because she was impressed by his support for other aspects of her ‚Äúreform agenda,‚Ä≥ including a greater role for women, the eradication of a parasitic social elite, welfare legislation for minors, and social hygiene regulatory laws. \\"Drexel eagerly anticipated visits to the new Reich, and on several of these working holidays the Propaganda Ministry awarded her writing assignments.\\" In 1938, she became employed in Philadelphia in the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Writers' Project and, later, as an instructor of French on the WPA Education Project, when her writing made at least one journalist question whether she had already become a Nazi propagandist. Berlin-based correspondent Drexel returned to Germany in 1939, officially to care for her ailing mother in Wiesbaden, Germany, but travelling at the expense of the German government. In the months leading to Hitler‚Äôs invasion of Poland in September 1939, Drexel wrote feature stories for American newspapers that were ostensibly about the home life of ordinary Germans, but that consistently reflected positively on the Nazi regime and negatively on its future adversaries.Constance Drexel, \\"German Government Diverts Onions to Munitions Channels\\", Oakland Tribune, July 30, 1939, at page 9-B. For example, six weeks before the outbreak of war, she wrote in the Oakland Tribune that the annexation of Austria had prevented the Viennese population from starving; even though this was \\"[r]endered more difficult by the United States sudden boycott of manufactured goods from the annexed territories ... now that the peculiar genius of the North Germans for organization and efficient administration is in full play under the new regime, this and other problems with which they are harassed are being overcome.\\" For a few months after World War II began, she wrote more feature articles about life in Germany that appeared in The New York Times.Constance Drexel, \\"Women in Three Lands at War: the Home Fronts in Britain, France, and Germany\\", The New York Times, October 8, 1939.\\"Many Changes Made by War in German Schools\\", The New York Times, December 24, 1939. But by that stage of her career, her colleagues in the American press corps had little respect for the quality or integrity of her work. One American network hired her at the beginning of the war, but dropped her almost at once.William L. Shirer, Berlin Diary (1941), Johns Hopkins University Press (pg 529); She had constantly pestered Berlin-based CBS radio correspondent William L. Shirer for a job, but as he later explained, he had considered her \\"the worst broadcaster I ever heard\\".William L. Shirer, \\"William L. Shirer Reviews ‚Äì Parade of American Turncoats\\", Nebraska State Journal, February 14, 1943, at page D5. In 1940, she began broadcasting on Nazi-controlled shortwave radio channels. She was introduced to listeners as a ‚Äúworld-renowned journalist and a member of the famous Drexel family of Philadelphia.‚ÄùWilliam Wilson, \\"Six Americans Broadcasting for Axis to be Indicted for Treason\\", Lowell Sun, January 13, 1943, at page 1. According to M. Williams Fuller, \\"[s]ounding like a grand dame with a stuffy nose, she described Germany as a cornucopia ‚Äì a land of plenty destined for a glorious future. Her broadcasts concluded with titillating accounts of Germany's art exhibits, concerts, food surplus, haute couture and world-class entertainment.\\" Shirer's September 26, 1940 entry in his \\"Berlin Diary\\" notes that \\"the Nazis hire her, as far as I can find out, principally because she's the only woman in town who will sell her American accent to them.\\" When applying (through Swiss authorities) for an extension of her U.S. passport in November 1942, she stated that \\"[i]n speaking for the German radio, I am following my own ideas; I am not [a] speaker about political or military matters but reporting cultural activities such as activities in the theatre, music and the film.\\" Drexel soon fell from grace among her new colleagues, and top Nazis began avoiding her.William B. Breuer, 'The Air Raid Warden was a Spy and other tales from Home-Front America in World War II pg. 133, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (2003); Long after the war, it was reported that she had committed a faux pas while attending a reception for Nazi Party leaders. \\"On being introduced to a beautiful young German woman, Drexel blurted: 'oh, you are the girlfriend of Adolf Hitler!'\\" As Propaganda Ministry official Inge Doman later testified in the treason trial of Mildred Gillars, known as \\"Axis Sally\\", Doman warned Gillars \\"to keep your distance from that Drexel woman. She's a pest and a crackpot.\\" Indictment, arrest, and release On October 1, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a memo to U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle that stated in part, \\"There are a number of Americans in Europe who are aiding Hitler et al on the radio. Why should we not proceed to indict them for treason even though we might not be able to try them until after the war?\\"October 1, 1942, Memo from the White House (signed F.D.R.) to the Office of the Attorney General; accessed October 10, 2010. A Federal Bureau of Investigation review of excerpts of such broadcasts stated that Drexel was attempting to show that the war had not lowered the morale of the German people in an effort to discourage the American people from continuing with the war effort. In July 1943, the United States Department of Justice filed treason charges against Drexel and seven other United States citizens who had been broadcasting from Axis-controlled radio stations. On August 17, 1945, over three months after the war in Europe had ended, she was arrested in Vienna by American forces after she revealed her identity to a Stars and Stripes reporter on a walk behind the Vienna City Hall.\\"Capt. Downey of Pittsfield Arrests Two Americans Indicted for Treason\\", Berkshire Evening Eagle, August 21, 1945, at page 1. Wearing an American flag lapel pin, she claimed she had always been a loyal citizen, and had only broadcast on cultural questions. At the time of her arrest, her age was listed as 60 (in one newspaper) and almost 70 (in another). Drexel was detained for over a year before she was transferred to Ellis Island in New York Harbor, pending an October 1946 hearing by a board of inquiry of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, on her eligibility to re-enter the United States.\\"Miss Drexel Held at Ellis As Treasonist\\", Berkshire Evening Eagle, October 1, 1946, at page 14. On October 3, 1946, the board decided that she had not forfeited her citizenship, and allowed her to re-enter the country. At the time of her release and re-entry, the United States Department of Justice said that her prosecution on the treason charges was no longer contemplated because lawyers who went to Germany to seek further evidence against her failed to uncover any. An internal Department of Justice memorandum dated June 14, 1946, repeats information from the Office of Strategic Services that she \\"was stranded in Germany and since she needed money she found a job with the American Propaganda Section of the Reichrundfunk\\" but that her twice-weekly broadcasts dealt \\"mainly with women, children, and the beauties of the German landscape.\\" The memo recommended taking no further action against her. Walter Winchell and others were still urging prosecution and stiff sentences for the Berlin broadcasters.Walter Winchell, \\"Case Histories of Nazi Stooges Who Played Judas to Uncle Sam\\", Syracuse Herald Journal, November 12, 1947, at page 39. When the charges were formally dropped on April 14, 1948, the investigators explained that none of Drexel's broadcasts was \\"political in nature\\".\\"Constance Drexel Freed of Charges\\", The New York Times, April 14, 1948.

Mass production was planned to begin late in 1940 but the Fall of France prevented this. Design and development The origins of the SE.100 predate the creation of the SNCASE (Sud-Est) company in the nationalisations of 1937. It was designed by Pierre Mercier and Jacques Lecarme at Lior√© et Olivier, initially designed the LeO 50. Underpowered by two Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M engines, the design was recast to use the more powerful Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-20 and -21 engines, the same used in the Lior√© et Olivier LeO 451 bomber, and renamed the SE.100. The aircraft was of conventional all-metal construction, having a mid-wing layout. As with most French twin-engined aircraft of the era, the engines were handed, one airscrew rotating clockwise and the other anti-clockwise, to minimise torque. The aircraft had a twin tail. In production models it was planned to redesign the wing to use components from the LeO 451 wing to ease production. The fuselage was short in appearance, with a long nose and a very short tail, the cockpit being connected to the gunner's position aft by a windowed corridor. The undercarriage was of the nosewheel type, rarely used in French aircraft of the 1930s, with the main wheels fitted right aft, retracting into the tail rather than the wings or engine nacelles as was conventional. The aircraft was fitted with four Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20 mm cannon in the nose and one in the gunner's post. The first prototype of the SE.100 flew on 29 March 1939 at Argenteuil and a number of necessary changes were identified during the tests. It was destroyed in a crash on 5 April 1940. The aircraft proved to be around 100 km/h faster than the Potez 631, the French Air Force's current twin- engined fighter, and production was authorised. While the tests were proceeding, a second prototype, incorporating the changes, the most obvious of which was the removal of the windowed corridor in the fuselage and its replacement by additional fuel tanks, was being built. The armament was increased to six cannon in the nose, two in the gunner's post and one additional cannon in the floor of the gunner's post. As the second prototype was being built, the Citro√´n company was preparing to mass-produce the aircraft at their Paris works, deliveries planned to begin late in 1940. At least two paper variants were studied, the SE.101 powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines, and the SE.102 powered by a different version of the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N. The SE.500 and SE.800 were to have been a 12-passenger transport and a four-engined transport, respectively, derived from the SE.100.

Playing code golf is known as \\"golf scripting\\". Code golf challenges and tournaments may also be named with the programming language used (for example, Perl golf).  History  The length of the shortest possible program that produces a given output (in any fixed programming language) is known as the Kolmogorov complexity of the output, and its mathematical study dates to the work of Andrey Kolmogorov in 1963. Code golf, however, can be more general than this, as it often specifies a general input-output transformation that must be performed rather than asking for a single output with no input. Whilst the term \\"code golf\\" was apparently first used in 1999 with Perl, and later popularised through the use of Perl to write a program that performed RSA encryption, a similar informal competition is known to have been popular with earlier APL hackers. The challenging nature of aggressively optimizing for program size has itself long been recognized, for example a 1962 coding manual for Regnecentralen's GIER computer notes that \\"it is a time-consuming sport to code with the least possible number of instructions\\" and recommends against it for practical programming. Today the term has grown to cover a wide variety of languages, which has even triggered the creation of dedicated golfing languages.  Etymology  The term \\"code golf\\" is derived from the similarity of its goal with that of conventional golf, where participants seek to achieve the lowest possible score, rather than the highest, as is the standard in most sports and game scoring systems. While conventional golf players are trying to minimize the number of club strokes needed to complete the course, code golfers are striving to reduce the number of key strokes necessary to write the program.  Dedicated golfing languages  Several new languages have been created specifically with code golfing in mind. Examples include GolfScript and Flogscript, which are Turing- complete languages which provide constructs for concisely expressing ideas in code. Because golfing languages compete for extreme brevity, their design sacrifices readability which is important for practical production environments, and therefore they are often esoteric. Sometimes, however, a language is designed for a practical purpose, but turns out to be suitable for code golf. An example of GolfScript code to print 1000 digits of pi: ;'' 6666,-2%{2+.2/@*\\\\/10.3??2*+}* \`1000<~\\\\; This prints a string starting with \\"3141592653\\" followed by 990 more digits of pi. Code golf websites have users constantly creating new and unique golfing languages to win code golf challenges. Other popular languages include 05AB1E and Jelly.  Types of code golf  Some code golf questions, such as those posed on general programming sites, may not require implementation in a specific programming language. However, this limits the style of problems that it is possible for the problem designers to pose (for example, by limiting the use of certain language features). In addition, the creation of such \\"open\\" questions has resulted in the design of code golf specific programming language dialects such as REBMU (a dialect of REBOL). Both online and live competitions may also include time limits.

According to HealthInvestor, it is one of England's largest private hospitals. History The London Clinic was established by a group of Harley Street doctors; the building was designed by Charles Henry Biddulph-Pinchard and officially opened by the Duchess of York in 1932. In 2005, The London Clinic became the first hospital in the UK to trial and offer robotic surgery with the da Vinci Surgical System, allowing specialist consultants to perform complex procedures. The Queen opened a new cancer centre, built at a cost of ¬£80 million, at the London Clinic in April 2010. After an inspection in December 2014 by the Food Standards Agency the organisation was given only two stars - the only hospital in London to perform so poorly  but the poor standard of hygiene was addressed and, after a further inspection in June 2015, the Clinic was awarded five stars. In November 2015 it secured a ¬£65 million revolving credit facility from HSBC which was used to increase theatre capacity, boost technology investment and renovate the radiology and intensive care facilities. The Duchess of Cornwall visited the Clinic in February 2017. In November 2017 the Care Quality Commission described the design of the new intensive care unit and the annual multi-faith memorial service, which contributes to end of life services, as areas of \\"outstanding practice\\". The clinic opened a specialist centre for robotic surgery in 2019.

The 56 units of this class were specifically intended for the Halle (Saale) - Leipzig line and for routes in southern Germany.  Pre-war period  The E 77 had been designated a light multi-purpose locomotive within DRG's first classification programme. Later it was mainly used on freight trains. The engines were delivered by BMAG, Krauss and LHW and had originally still held the State Railways' Class EG 3 title with numbers 22 001 through 031 (Bavarian) or EG 701 to 725 (Prussian). BMS delivered the electrical parts. In service, the E 77 distinguished itself with a rather limited result. One was never really satisfied with its running abilities. Moreover, there were often problems due to the many flexible electric cables. During World War II all engines ended at the Reichsbahndirektionen Halle und Hanover in exchange for Class E 75.  Post-war period  At the end of the war, 53 locomotives were left. 42 thereof, as well as parts of engines E 77 02, 09, 19, 28, 56, 67, 71 and 73, which had been taken out of service due to damages, were ceded to the Soviet Union as reparations. E 77 06 and 51 were so heavily damaged that their scrapping in Leipzig was authorized in 1947/48. Nothing is known of E 77 64's post-war fate. In 1952/53, 38 of the reparations locomotives (not E 77 05, 58 and 75) were returned into DR's stock. Of them, only 10 units with numbers E 77 03, 10, 14, 15, 18, 24, 25, 30, 52 and 53 were repaired past 1955. The others were scrapped only in the 1960s. When sufficient numbers of new electric locomotives were available, Class E 77 was retired and save for E 77 10, all units were scrapped as well until late in 1966. For a few years, E 77 10 still served as a switch heating engine at Halle central station and was then converted to a heritage locomotive at the Dresden railway works, whereby it was almost restored to its prior state.  Technical data  Save for the first series of Prussian locomotives (EG 701 - 713, later E 77 51 to 77 63), all engines had originally had cowl doors. At the reinstatement by DR though, those were dropped. The trailer axles of the threepartite linked locomotives were at first embedded steeply and later flexibly, so that the wheel arrangement was changed from (1B)(B1) to (1'B)(B1'). But even after this conversion they were not yet satisfied with the engines' smoothness. The work schedule featured the following transportation services: * Freight trains with 1,800 tonnes at a 3 permille slope with 30 km/h * Passenger trains with 500 t at 3 permille with 60 km/h * Passenger trains with 500 t at 10 permille with 50 km/h and * Freight trains with 850 t at 10 permille with 25 km/h. The locomotives had 15 permanent running steps.  Preserved locomotives  Of the 56 exemplaries built in total, one unit has been preserved. E 77 10 is nowadays based at the Dresden Transport Museum.

The film stars Constance Bennett and Gracie Fields as an American and an Englishwoman trapped in Paris when Nazi Germany invades in 1940, who rescue British airmen shot down in France and help them escape across the English Channel. This was also Bennett's only producing credit. The film's sets were designed by the art director Nicolai Remisoff. Alexandre Tansman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score (one of 21 nominations that year). Plot American Kitty de Mornay quarrels with her French husband Andre over her lack of concern over the imminent fall of Paris to the Germans. She is so ignorant of the danger she is in, she flees with her English friend Emmeline \\"Emmy\\" Quayle too late. They end up at the country inn of Pappa Renard. After serving them a meal, he reveals that a shot-down English flyer, Flight Lieutenant William Gray, is hiding out there. Since Renard is unwilling to continue sheltering Gray, the women decide to take him back to Paris with them. When their car has a flat, German Captain Kurt von Weber happens by and has one of his men change the tire. Since he is going to Paris too, von Weber personally drives them back, past all the German patrols and checkpoints. When he leaves, he gives Kitty his card, revealing that he is assigned to the military department of the Gestapo. They sneak Gray past Madame Martin, Emmy's concierge, and into her apartment. A week later, Gray decides he has to leave, as anyone caught sheltering an enemy soldier will be executed. Before he can, the Germans surround and search the building. The timely arrival of von Weber, with a bouquet of flowers, ensures that the search is cut short. Kitty suggests going out to a nightclub to get the German out of the apartment. At the club, they encounter Andre. While dancing, Kitty apprises Andre of her situation and asks for his help in getting Gray out. Following Andre's instructions, they contact Tissier, a baker. By bad luck, a German patrol happens by, and Emmy is taken in for questioning. After seeing Gray off, Kitty goes back to see what she can do for her friend. To her surprise, she find Emmy at Tessier's place. Kitty is persuaded to help others escape with them. Emmy reluctantly decides to get involved too, just to keep Kitty out of trouble. They contact Father Dominique. Expecting to sneak one man into unoccupied France, they are surprised to find the priest hiding about a dozen in his crypt. The women take two with them, but when they reach Tissier's bakery, they learn that he has been shot. When they discover that the local cemetery is across the border, Kitty decides to use a funeral to get the men. The undertaker, however, informs them that the Germans are on guard against such attempts. However, he expects the aged Marquise de Montigny to pass away soon; when she does, the undertaker is glad to be able to give the worthy, yet poverty-stricken woman a lavish funeral procession, with the soldiers disguised as mourners. At the last moment, Kitty and Emmy decide to go back to continue smuggling. By 1942, the occupying Germans are frustrated that so many Allied soldiers are eluding them. Von Weber comes up with a plan to destroy the smuggling network. He arranges for a fake Allied pilot to be \\"shot down\\". The man is brought to Emmy's antique shop hidden inside a chest. She is warned, but he becomes suspicious and pulls a gun and calls the Gestapo. She is able to strike him on the head (fatally) with a candlestick when he is distracted. However, too much is overheard over the phone, and the Germans, led by von Weber, come for them; Andre is there as well, back from England on a mission for the Free French. Emmy is captured, but the others evade the first sweep, hiding in the basement. When they overhear that von Weber will not stop searching, utterly convinced Kitty is still in the building, she knocks Andre out and gives herself up to save him. They survive to be liberated by the Allies, though Emmy is so unhinged by her ordeal that she at first does not even recognize her friend.  Reception  Glenn Erickson gave the movie an unfavorable review, calling it a \\"rather undistinguished spy thriller. It has reasonable production values but lacks a strong script and is shaky in the credibility department.\\"  Cast   References   External links  1945 films American films American war films Films about the French Resistance Films directed by Gregory Ratoff Films set in France Films set in Paris United Artists films War films based on actual events World War II films made in wartime Films set in 1940 American black-and-white films ","title":"Paris Underground (film)"},{"id":"18891814","text":"Rebecca Soumeru (born December 22, 1981 in Steinheim, Germany) is a Dutch softball player, who represents the Dutch national team in international competitions.Athlete biography: Rebecca Soumeru, beijing2008.cn, ret: Aug 16, 2008 Soumeru played for Run '71 Oldenzaal, Macerata and since 2007 for Sparks Haarlem.

Gregg, 113 U.S. 550 (1885), was an appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio regarding a bill in equity filed November 20, 1879, to establish the title of the plaintiff to, and recover the possession of, a certain tract of land in the County of Logan, in the State of Ohio, and for an account of rents and profits.. The dispute was one of many issues with land titles in the former Virginia Military District section of Ohio. Decision The court syllabus states: *A court in equity has no jurisdiction over a suit based upon an equitable title to real estate unless the nature of the relief asked for is also equitable. *A court of the United States sitting in equity cannot control the principal surveyor of the Virginia Military District in the discharge of his official duties or take charge of the records of his office or declare their effect to be other than what appears on their face. *The plain meaning of the Act of March 23, 1804, 2 Stat. 274, to ascertain the boundaries of the Virginia Military District in Ohio is that a failure within five years to make return to the Secretary of War of the survey of any tract located within the territory, made previous to the expiration of the five years, should discharge the land from any claim founded on such location and survey and extinguish all rights acquired thereby. *The series of acts relating to this district, beginning with the Act of March 23, 1804, and ending with the Act of July 7, 1838, 5 Stat. 282, as revived and continued in force by later acts, are to be construed together, and as if the third section of the Act of March 23, 1804, had been repeated in every act of the series. *The Act of March 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 701, allowing persons who had made entries before January 1, 1852, two years time to return their surveys did not apply to those who had made both entries and surveys before the latter date. *The land office referred to in ¬ß 2 of the Act of May 27, 1880, 21 Stat. 142, relating to the Virginia Military District in Ohio is the General Land Office. *On the pleas and issues in this cause, the complainant has failed to make good the case stated in the bill. The plaintiff insisted that the first and second sections of the Act of May 27, 1880, repeal by implication the third section of the Act of March 23, 1804. There is no ground for such a contention. It is most unreasonable to suppose that Congress intended, by doubtful inference, to repeal the salutary provision of ¬ß 4 of the act of 1804, which, in numerous enactments, it had cautiously preserved for a period of seventy-six years, and on which the titles to a vast domain rested. The object of the first and second sections of the Act of May 27, 1880, was not to confer new rights, but to preserve rights already vested from impairment by any construction which might be placed on the Act of February 18, 1871, by which the unsurveyed and unsold lands in the Virginia Military District were ceded to the State of Ohio. But it is enough to say that there is no inconsistency between the two enactments, one of which is said to repeal the other. There can therefore be no repeal by implication. It followed that the plaintiff could derive no aid from any act of Congress passed since the first day of January 1852. On that day, all interest and estate of the heirs of Archibald Gordon in the lands covered by his entry recorded on January 1, 1823, and his survey recorded on November 6, 1824, ceased and determined. The plaintiff therefore has failed to make good her averment that she has an equitable estate in fee simple to the premises in controversy. She has therefore shown no right to the relief prayed by her bill. The court found that it was immaterial whether the patent of Gregg under which the defendants claim was valid or void. The plaintiff, having no title, can have no relief against them. The defendants, being in possession, are entitled to retain possession until ousted by one who has the title. The decree of the circuit court, by which the bill was dismissed, was therefore right, and was affirmed.

Early life, education and family Morris-Jones was born in the Caernarfonshire village of Waenfawr, the son of Captain Morris Jones and his wife Ann. He was educated at Menai Bridge Grammar School, Anglesey and St. Mungo's College of Medicine in Glasgow. In 1931 he married Leila Paget- Marsland, a widow. They never had children.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Medical career Morris-Jones qualified as a doctor (LRFPS) in 1906 from Glasgow, gaining a further licence for surgery (LRCP&S;) from Edinburgh, and was for twenty years a general practitioner in Colwyn Bay in North Wales. During the First World War, Morris-Jones served in the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment as a medical officer in France, during which time he was awarded the Military Cross. He was later granted the rank of honorary captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In 1915 he co-authored an article in the British Medical Journal with Hugh Lett, Surgical Experiences at Wimereux, France about his work at the Number 5, British Red Cross Hospital, also known as Lady Hadfield's Hospital. He later served as Chairman of his division of the British Medical Association and of the Colwyn Bay Medical Society.The Times, (Obituary) 11.7.72 Politics Morris-Jones took an active part in the public life of the town of Colwyn Bay and the County of Denbigh. He was elected a member of Colwyn Bay Urban District Council, later becoming its Chairman. He was High Sheriff Designate of the County, 1929‚Äì30, and also served as a member of the County Council. In 1956 he received the honorary freedom of Colwyn Bay. He was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Denbighshire and was a Justice of the Peace. At the 1929 general election, Morris-Jones was nominated by the Llangollen Liberal Association to be the candidate for DenbighThe Times, 1.4.29 and on 4 April he was selected by the local party to stand in succession to the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) Ellis William Davies who was resigning on grounds of ill-health.The Times, 5.4.29 Morris-Jones had a straight fight against the 32-year-old Conservative, Captain Alan Crosland Graham of Clwyd Hall, Ruthin, the political private secretary to Lord Balfour.The Times, 9.4.29 The Liberal party improved its position nationally in 1929, going up from 40 to 59 seats and increasing its share of the vote by nearly 6%. However it did not make the breakthrough it had hoped for against the background of its ambitious and innovative policy programme of social, industrial and economic reform under the leadership of a reinvigorated Lloyd George. In this climate, and without a Labour opponent in Denbigh, Morris-Jones was able to increase the Liberal majority from 1,421 to 8,189.The Times, 17.10.31 Parliamentary interests While in Parliament, Morris-Jones took a particular interest in public health and agriculture both nationally and as they affected Denbighshire. He was an honorary Treasurer of the Parliamentary Medical Group from time of election in 1929 and was later appointed as a member of the Committee of Trustees set up under the MPs Pensions Act.The Times, 11.7.72 In 1938 he was a member of a Parliamentary delegation participating in events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Australia. While there he took part in discussions about the development of the Empire, measures to stimulate immigration to Australia and the promoting of Australian trade with the USA.The Times, 3.2.38 More grimly, he was a member of a Parliamentary Delegation to Buchenwald concentration camp soon after its liberation in April 1945. National Liberal In 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the issue OF Free Trade. The official party led by Sir Herbert Samuel although agreeing to go into the 1931 general election supporting the government became more and more worried about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald's administration. Morris-Jones, who had been appalled at the economic record of the second Labour Government, joined this groupDavid Dutton, Liberal Civil War: Denbigh, Oldham and the 1935 General Election; Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, Autumn 2006, pp 8-16 and thereafter sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal National. At the 1931 general election, Morris-Jones was not opposed in Denbigh either by a Free Trade Liberal or Conservative candidate. Although bitterly opposed to MacDonald's government, Labour did not stand a candidate either, presumably for tactical reasons. So on Friday 16 October Morris-Jones retained his Parliamentary seat as one of 65 MPs returned unopposed. Liberal schism After the 1931 general election there was a period of uncertainty in Liberal Associations about the development of separate parties in local areas and Liberals of the official and National persuasion were often regarded by local members as legitimate representatives of Liberalism, despite their formal designations. There was a belief in both camps that the split was nominal and temporary. As late as 1934 the Liberal Magazine was asserting that ‚Äòthe Liberal Nationals are bound in the course of time to reunite with the normal Liberal Party‚Äô.Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56 p.8 This was not the case everywhere however and in Denbigh Morris-Jones faced criticism and some hostility from Liberals not willing to accept his defection to the Liberal Nationals. This became more pressing after the withdrawal of the official party under Samuel from the government when Liberals argued that it had become increasingly clear that the coalition was a National Government in name only and really a Conservative administration, dominated by the massive Conservative strength in Parliament. Government office In 1932, Morris-Jones was appointed an Assistant Government Whip and he held that post until 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury. He was knighted in the prime minister's list of the New Year's Honours in January 1937. In May 1937 when Neville Chamberlain succeeded Stanley Baldwin as prime minister, Morris-Jones was offered the position of Chief Whip to the Liberal National group after the formation of the new government but preferred ‚Äòfor personal reasons‚Äô to return to the backbenches.The Times, 29.5.37 1935 General Election As the prospect of another general election approached the Liberal Party policy of not opposing sitting Liberal National MPs came increasingly under threat, although many local parties did not have the resources to put up independent Liberal candidates against incumbent Liberal Nationals. However, in Denbighshire there was a willingness to challenge Morris-Jones, who was seen more and more as a surrogate Tory. At a meeting of the Liberal Association there on 24 October 1935, as the prospect of a general election loomed, it was agreed to adopt John Cledwyn Davies, the Director of Education for Denbighshire and the Lloyd George coalition Liberal MP for Denbigh from 1922‚Äì23. Morris-Jones refused to stand down and the two members of the liberal family fought each other in the general election in November. The Conservatives supported Morris-Jones and the intervention of a Labour candidate helped take votes away from Davies. Across the country the Liberal National vote remained steady and Morris-Jones held the seat with a majority of over 5,000.Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, p12 Independent MP For brief period during the Second World War, commencing in February 1942, Morris-Jones decided to leave the Liberal Nationals. One of his reasons for resigning from the Liberal Nationals may have been a desire to have the freedom to criticise the government over its prosecution of the war, including the need to place war production under the direction of a single minister which Morris-Jones had urged in 1941.The Times, 26.7.41 In July 1942 he was signatory to a motion which while praising the armed forces indicated a lack of confidence in the government's conduct of the war.The Times, 1.7.42 It was later recorded that he had rejoined the official Liberals along with two other MPs, Leslie Hore-Belisha and Edgar Granville.Roy Douglas, The History of the Liberal Party: 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p244 However at the time Morris-Jones described himself as having become an IndependentThe Times, 12.8.42 although his closeness to the official party was evident in his voting record and associations.The Times, 20.2.43 Perhaps he was already thinking about post-war political alignments and wished to keep his options open. He must have been aware of the feeling that, as in the earlier split in the party between 1916 and 1923, Liberals of whatever stripe had a common Liberalism to bind them. In the end the political and electoral realities overcame the sense of Liberal family and Morris-Jones rejoined the Liberal Nationals in March 1943, presumably sensing or calculating it would be the safest way to enable him to continue as an MP.The Times, 23.11.43 Welsh political and public life In 1937 Morris-Jones was Honorary Treasurer and Honorary Secretary of the Reception Committee co-ordinating the Royal Visit to North Wales. As part of the coronation celebrations the King and Queen were to visit North Wales in July 1937. They were to open an extension to the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth and make a ceremonial visit to Caernarfon Castle. At this time Lloyd George was Constable of the Caernarfon Castle and Morris-Jones was involved in discussion and debate with him and others about the arrangements for the visit and some bad-tempered exchanges took place over the choice of music for the royal programme which Lloyd George felt was not up to the dignity of the occasion.Colin Cross (ed.) Life with Lloyd George: The Diary of A J Sylvester, 1931-45; MacMillan, 1975 pp179-181 In 1941‚Äì2, Morris-Jones served as Chairman of the Welsh Parliamentary Party. Liberal MPs from Wales had always regarded themselves as separate Parliamentary entity, certainly from as early as 1886. They saw their role as promoting distinctly Welsh causes and being the party of Welsh nationalism.Alan Butt Philip, The Welsh Question: Nationalism in Welsh Politics, 1945-1970; University of Wales Press, 1975 and K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics 1868-1922, University of Wales Press, 1963 This role diminished with the decline of Liberalism in Wales during the 20th century and establishment of Plaid Cymru in 1925 but there remained a sentiment at Westminster that Welsh parliamentarians should meet together in the interests of their country and the Welsh Parliamentary Party which Morris-Jones chaired was therefore an informal group of Welsh MPs from all parties which met occasionally from the mid-1930s to discuss issues affecting Wales and its relationship with Whitehall and Westminster.(https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960311/debtext/60311-16.htm In 1949 Morris-Jones put forward a Private Member's Bill to create the post of Secretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshire supported by a Parliamentary Under Secretary and a Department of State to be known as the Welsh Office for which he got a measure of cross-party support although it did not pass into law.The Times, 19.2.49 Wales had to wait until 1951 for a dedicated minister, 1964 for its own Secretary of State and 1965 before the establishment of the Welsh Office. The National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Assembly Government followed in 1999. Morris-Jones was also a member of the Gorsedd, an association of poets, writers, musicians, artists and individuals who have made a significant and distinguished contribution to Welsh language, literature, and culture, under the Bardic title of Rhoslanydd. He also served as a member of the Governing Body of Representative Body of the Church in Wales between 1950 and 1962. Liberal National after 1945 At the 1945 general election Morris-Jones faced official Liberal and Labour opposition in Denbigh but was supported as the government candidate by the Conservatives. In a straight fight against either Liberal or Labour he might well have lost, given the huge anti-government swings recorded at that election. However, with the opposition split, he held on with a majority of 4,922.(http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i06.htm) Although he stood down as an MP at the 1950 general election, Morris-Jones thereafter remained loyal to the Liberal Nationals, or National Liberal Party as it became known after 1948. He served as Vice Chairman of the Executive of the National Liberal Party in 1952 and the following year (1953‚Äì54) he went on to be Chairman. The National Liberals again held Denbigh against split opposition in 1950, albeit with a reduced majority.http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge50/i06.htm) It remained a National Liberal seat until 1959 when a Conservative candidate was put up, successfully retaining it. It then stayed Conservative until the constituency was abolished in 1983. Standing down from Parliament Although he was 66 years old as the election approached, Morris-Jones‚Äô decision to step down from Parliament at the 1950 general election may have been influenced by more than just advancing years. He was genuinely pessimistic about the future of the Liberal Party in Wales and the country at large. In a speech in Denbigh he said he doubted there would be more than 20 Independent Liberals in the next House of Commons.The Times, 20 February 1950 This is a slightly surprising number given that only 12 Liberal MPs had been elected in 1945, a drop of nine on the previous election and since then the party had been experiencing defections ‚Äì Gwilym Lloyd-George was almost completely associated with the Conservatives by 1950 and Tom Horabin had taken the Labour whip. In fact the party continued to decline at the 1950 general election, making a net loss of three seats leaving then with only nine. Perhaps Morris-Jones also foresaw the final absorption of the National Liberals into the Conservative Party. The formal merger of the two parties had already taken place in 1948 and from then on, it was only a matter of time before any remaining genuinely Liberal element was subsumed by the overwhelming numbers and philosophy of the Conservatives, something which given his Liberal past and strong convictions, Morris-Jones may well have regretted. Although, as noted above, once outside Parliament he stuck with the National Liberals, perhaps in the hope of a peerage. Morris-Jones and the National Health Service As a doctor, Morris- Jones took a keen interest in the legislation to set up the National Health Service (NHS). By and large he was not in favour, usually taking the side of the professional organisations in opposing measures to force doctors into the NHS. By 1948 he was much more closely aligned with the Conservatives and their thinking. That Morris-Jones was a man of traditional views in relation to medical matters can be deduced from his association with the campaign to prevent the sale of contraceptives from slot machines, as a ‚Äòtemptation to youth‚Äô.The Times, 15.9.49 An early indication of Morris-Jones's misgivings over a national health scheme came in 1942 in the debate over the Beveridge Report. In a letter to The Times newspaper he predicted that the setting up of a full-time National Medical Service for the whole population would cut across the traditional relationship between the doctor and patient and would need a great popular mandate. The tone of Morris-Jones's letter made it clear he did not approve of such a scheme and doubted whether it would ever work.The Times, 4.12.42 Writing again to the Times on 15 March 1948, Morris-Jones identified with the concerns of many doctors about the powers to be conferred on the Minister of Health and with the doctors‚Äô strong desire to retain their professional freedoms and their livelihoods as well as their fears that the new arrangements would bring about a deterioration in standards of medical and clinical service and professionalism. He ended by writing, ‚ÄúThe mines can be nationalised; the art and science of medicine cannot be‚Äù.The Times, 17.3.48 However, like the doctors, Morris-Jones eventually bowed to the inevitable. Even though there were many doctors who disliked the Act, Morris-Jones felt they had achieved a significant amount though negotiation and should therefore accept the government's offer to join the NHS in July 1948. A further justification he made was that this should be done on behalf of patients who would otherwise suffer from a continuing fight between government and medical professionals.The Times, 23.4.48 A year after the introduction of the NHS, Morris-Jones was again writing to the Times to highlight what he saw as the decline in status of the General Practitioner, which he described as‚Äô the first line of defence of our health service‚Äô. He believed that there was evidence to show that after a year of the NHS there had been a deterioration in the art of medicine as practiced by GPs, an expansion of their workload, an increase in bureaucracy, difficulties in seeing cases through and getting patients into hospitals.The Times, 31.8.49 Publications *Surgical Experiences at Wimereux, France (jointly with Hugh Lett): British Medical Journal, 1915 *Doctor in the Whip‚Äôs Room: published by Robert Hale, London, 1955 Papers Morris-Jones‚Äô papers are deposited in the Flintshire Record Office, which is located at The Old Rectory, Hawarden.

The instruments would have detected any nuclear explosions and indicated the estimated size in megatons. With the display unit mounted in a steel cabinet, the system used two sets of five photo-sensitive cells within the detection head to record the intense flash of light produced by the detonation of the weapon followed, within a second, by a second intense flash. This double flash is characteristic of a nuclear explosion and measurement of the short gap between the two flashes enabled the weapon's power to be estimated, and the bearing to be indicated. It had a range of 150 miles (240 km) in good visibility.COCROFT, Wayne D and THOMAS, Roger J C Cold War: Building for Nuclear Confrontation 1946-1989 English Heritage, Swindon, 2003 revised 2004 (p.191 & 193) From 1974 AWDREY units were used together with a device known as DIADEM (Direction Indicator of Atomic Detonation by Electronic Means) which measured the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by an explosion.COCROFT, Wayne D and THOMAS, Roger J C Cold War: Building for Nuclear Confrontation 1946-1989 English Heritage, Swindon, 2003 revised 2004 (p.191-2) The instruments were in constant operation (state of readiness) between 1968 and 1992 and tested daily by full-time ROC officers. Operations AWDREY was designed, built and maintained by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. The design was tested for performance and accuracy using real nuclear explosions at the 1957 Kiritimati (or Christmas Island) nuclear weapon trials, after being mounted on board a ship. Although a single AWDREY unit could not differentiate between a nuclear explosion and a lightning strike, the units were installed sufficiently far apart that a lightning strike would not simultaneously register on two adjacent AWDREYs. The first two primary responsibilities of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO), for whom the ROC provided the field force were: * Warning the public of any air attack (see four-minute warning) * Providing confirmation of nuclear strike on the UK AWDREY was the principal method by which the UKWMO would achieve its second responsibility. Simultaneous responses on two or more AWDREY units would identify the explosion as a nuclear strike. ROC post bomb detection instruments (see Bomb Power Indicator) operated by recording the peak overpressure of the blast wave from any nearby nuclear explosion. Any ultra-high-altitude nuclear explosion, designed to knock out the UK's communications and electronic equipment would not produce a detectable blast wave, and the AWDREY system was therefore the only method of identifying these bursts. Installation The AWDREY installation consisted of three separate elements: the sensor, the detection unit and the display cabinet (timer). The sensor was mounted on the roof of the building. The detection unit was installed in a special room that was enclosed inside a Faraday cage; in the case of the Royal Observer Corps controls, this was the \\"Radio Room\\" that already protected the sensitive radio equipment from the effects of EMP. Awdrey Timing and Logic on display in York The display unit (timer) (shown in the photograph above) could be mounted anywhere in the building ‚Äì at ROC controls this was usually on the balcony adjacent to the Triangulation Team. The three elements of the installation were connected by EMP-shielded and heavy duty cabling. During the early phase of operations, a spare observer was required to stand next to the display unit and monitor it constantly to identify initial responses. Once a nuclear strike on the UK had been confirmed by the Director UKWMO (or his deputy), readings from AWDREY were ignored during subsequent nuclear bursts within the attack, and the readings from ROC posts became the main method of detecting and identifying any subsequent near ground bursts. The 12 ROC AWDREY units were located at the group controls in Exeter, Oxford, Horsham, Bristol, Colchester, Carmarthen, Coventry, Carlisle, York, Dundee, Inverness and Belfast.COCROFT, Wayne D and THOMAS, Roger J C Cold War: Building for Nuclear Confrontation 1946-1989 English Heritage, Swindon, 2003 revised 2004 (p.187) This siting pattern provided sufficient detectors that the entire UK was covered, but the units were far enough apart that a lightning storm would be unlikely to trigger simultaneous AWDREY responses at two sites. Codeword Royal Observer Corps reports following a reading on AWDREY were prefixed with the codeword \\"TOCSIN BANG\\". The message would also include the three-letter group identifier, followed by the time and yield reading from the AWDREY printout. E.g. \\"TOCSIN BANG ‚Äì CAR ‚Äì 11.06 (hours) ‚Äì 3 megatons\\" (with CAR relating to Carlisle control).

He was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, but later moved with his family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Initially wanting to become a policeman, he changed his mind upon graduating from the I.S.T. Academy (Institute of Security and Technology) to become a boxer instead. Moore then worked as a security officer at Pennsylvania Community College and a disc jockey in various Philadelphia clubs while undergoing training as a boxer in his spare time. While he was gradually becoming a boxer he committed himself to charity and the community for which he already received several certificates and awards.

It opened its line from a junction near Longniddry as far as Gullane in 1898, but never succeeded in financial terms, and it never completed its line to North Berwick, which already had a branch railway. It closed to passengers in 1932 and continued, partly due to sugar beet traffic, until closing completely in 1964. Formation In 1850 the North British Railway opened a branch line from Drem station, on its main line to Berwick, to North Berwick. The North British hoped that it would develop the town as a superior residential area, for people with daily business in Edinburgh. That trade was slower to build up than the NBR intended, but the focus on golf as a pastime, and on the increase of visits to resort locations, led to the eventual establishment of the branch as a useful asset to the company. Settlements to the west relied on road connection to the main line for travel to Edinburgh for many years, but in 1892 a scheme was promoted for a new railway branch from Longniddry, on the main line railway, to North Berwick, running through Aberlady, Luffness and Gullane. The proposed line was independently supported, although the North British Railway were favourably disposed in the background. However, when the Bill for the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway was presented, the North British Railway objected, as did a local landowner, Walter Hope, who saw that his farm and house would be prejudicially affected by the proximity of the course of the line. The NBR now saw that the line running through to North Berwick would abstract business from their own line. Negotiations followed and the proposed route of the line was modified to satisfy Hope, and discussion with the North British Railway resulted in their agreeing to work the line for 50% of receipts, guaranteeing a 4.5% dividend on the Company's capital of ¬£66,000. The Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway received the Royal Assent on 24 August 1893;Hajducki and Smith & Anderson; Carter says 28 August. the Act specified that the line could not be extended through from Gullane to North Berwick without the consent of the NBR. The practical benefit of the line was simply to connect some minor villages to the railway, and when subscriptions for shares were sought, it proved very difficult to generate financial commitment. Indeed, four years after the passage of the Act, the Company was still unable to pay the expenses to witnesses at the Parliamentary hearings. Preference shares were issued and finally by September 1898 sufficient capital had been acquired to finish the line. A contract for construction had been let in 1896. Opening The construction was completed, between Spittal (where the junction was named Aberlady Junction, a mile and a half east of Longniddry) and Gullane, and the line opened on 1 April 1898. The signalling on the single line branch was by the Tyers electric tablet system.From Hajducki, page 158; but he implies one train only working from Aberlady; he refers to \\"the Aberlady and Gullane no. 0 staff\\"; but this may simply be a matter of phraseology. The train service was lavish, at nine passenger trains each way daily, with additional trains on summer Saturdays. Absorption The North British Railway were paying 4.5% to the shareholders of the little line, and operating it too; on 14 October 1899 they wrote to the Aberlady company offering to purchase it by exchange of shares in the NBR. This was agreed and on 6 August 1900 an Act was passed which authorised the transfer.Paterson gives 1 August 1890, but this is a mistake. The terms were controversial: a shareholder named James Calder pointed out that the market value of the North British Railway shares given in exchange for the Aberlady shares was ¬£123,885 for shares that had cost ¬£88,000, giving a considerable profit to Aberlady shareholders, the largest of whom were North British Railway directors. The Edwardian era brought a considerable increase in leisure travel to the area; this included the popular practice of taking a house for rent in the summer months and travelling daily to Edinburgh or Glasgow, while the family remained in the resort; and also the increased popularity of golf, and of travelling considerable distances to a resort location to play it. A small station was opened at Luffness to serve an adjacent course on 1 September 1903; use of the station was restricted to players at the golf course. The Lothian Coast Express Responding to these developments the North British Railway put on a train service named The Lothian Coast Express. This started running on 3 or 12 June 1912; in the down direction it ran from Dunbar, taking a North Berwick portion at Drem and attaching a Gullane portion at Longniddry. The train ran through to Glasgow, stopping at Edinburgh Waverley,Ross states on page 214 that it ran through Waverley without stopping, the only scheduled train to do so; but Paterson gives Edinburgh calling times in both directions, on page 94. Ross and Paterson may be referring to different eras, before and after the War. and conveyed a breakfast car. The up direction train in the afternoon conveyed a tea car. The train was said to have been the first British named train to carry a headboard with the train name. Proposals to extend to North Berwick In 1915 there was a remarkable development, in which residents of Aberlady and Gullane presented a petition to the North British Railway urging the construction of the line between Gullane and North Berwick. This had been authorised in the original Act for the line, although the powers had long since lapsed. The arguments they pressed emphasised the development of a backward district, and the unification of branch connections at Longniddry, although they did not say whether they proposed that the Drem to North Berwick line should be closed. The North British Directors carefully considered the idea, but the fact of World War I being in progress, and the obvious rise of road motor vehicles in serving sparsely populated rural areas, and the undeveloped nature of the intervening terrain, meant that the proposal was politely put in abeyance. From 1923 In 1923 the North British Railway was made a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) under the \\"grouping\\" of the main line railways of Great Britain, following the Railways Act 1921. From 1923 road scheduled public passenger transport started operation in the area, and in later years it became a powerful competitor, having many advantages over the branch railway service. Aberlady and Gullane were never commercially buoyant locations: in 1932 Aberlady station was handling ten passengers a week. The Golf Platform at Luffness had lost its custom too, as the well-heeled golfers used their own motor cars, and it closed on 1 June 1931. From 7 May 1929 the branch was reduced to the one train only system of operation, with the signal boxes at Aberlady and Gullane closed. These economies were insignificant in comparison with the loss which the line was making, and the LNER announced that the passenger service would be discontinued from 12 September 1932. Goods traffic continued, but it too declined substantially in volume as road alternatives became increasingly practicable. In fact only the continuation of sugar beet traffic sustained the branch. During World War II it had been impossible to import cane sugar, and many farmers turned to sugar beet. The product was conveyed by rail to a processing plant in Cupar, Fife. In the 1960s the competitive advantage of sugar beet declined, and on 15 June 1964 the last goods train trip operated.

The Garden is a companion release to Nesmith's 1974 album/book, The Prison. Both The Garden and The Prison are written to have the music complement a novel included in the release (also written by Nesmith). The Prison and The Garden were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch. The idea is for listeners to read the novel while simultaneously listening to the recording. Even though The Garden was released on Nesmith's record company, Rio Records, the novella/album concept was the driving force behind Nesmith's multimedia company Pacific Arts. In the liner notes, Nesmith states The Garden is not a sequel in the strictest sense of the term ‚Äî meaning that there isn't a true continuation of the narrative which began in The Prison. Instead, they are correlated thematically and stylistically as both are presented in a linear and consecutive approach. Each of The Garden's seven chapters are also visually enhanced, if not somewhat inspired by a series of Claude Monet paintings. There is a much more subtle connection between the prose and these unqualified masterworks, yet he is able to relate them in a contextual sense. Reviews Allmusic writes \\"the music retains Nesmith's inimitable and signature sound, yet compared to his most concurrent effort, Tropical Campfires (1992), The Garden is exceedingly ethereal and more often than not instrumental. There are vocals that feature not only the artist, but also his children Jason ‚Äî who is likewise the central character in the short story ‚Äî Christian, and Jessica. The backing band also includes Christian Nesmith as well as most of the musicians the senior Nez had collaborated with on the aforementioned Tropical Campfires, most notably Desert Rose Band string man John Jorgenson (guitar/sax/bassoon/mandolin/oboe/bandurila/mandocello), Joe Chemay (bass), and John Hobbs (keyboards), as well as studio maven Sid Page (violin)\\".Lindsay Planer, Allmusic, 2007 Production According to the liner notes, the album was recorded at various times between October 1991 and September 1993 at Footprint Studios and Trax in Los Angeles.

The badge was first established by order of Hermann G√∂ring on 5 November 1936. It was originally awarded to Luftwaffe personnel after completion of the required number of six jumps. The badge depicted a diving eagle with a swastika in its claws surrounded by a silver wreath. The original construction was made of \\"gold-finished bronze\\" for the eagle and \\"oxidized silver plate\\" for the laurel leaves. In 1937, the construction of the badge changed to aluminium. In late 1942, the construction was changed again to a metal alloy. A cloth version of the badge was also authorized in 1937, to be worn on a flight jacket. A recipient had to re- qualify for the badge each year. An army version (Fallschirmsch√ºtzen-Abzeichen des Heeres) was later introduced (1 September 1937), with the swastika relocated to the top of the wreath and surmounted by a smaller upright eagle. As with the Luftwaffe, a recipient had to re-qualify for the badge each year. In 1936, the army ordered the institution of its own parachute company, which was expanded to a battalion in 1938. When the army parachute units were transferred over to the Luftwaffe in 1939, the former army soldiers continued to wear the army version of the Parachutist badge. The Waffen-SS personnel of the 500, 501 or 502 SS-Parachute Battalions were awarded the Luftwaffe badge after they passed the jump and other test requirements.

He was a state and national representative player of the 1940s, and was heavily involved in coaching development in the 1960s and 1970s. Playing career Johnson began his senior career as a sixteen-year-old playing for Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast, He primarily played at and was first selected to represent for NSW Country in 1940. During World War II, Johnson played two excellent seasons with St. George in 1944-1945\\\\. In 1946 he returned to the south-coast and captain-coached Wollongong that year. That year he was selected in a Southern Districts representative side who were victorious over the visiting Great Britain tourists In 1947, Johnson was back in Sydney, this time with the Newtown Bluebags. He was selected for the New South Wales team and at the end of the 1948 season he toured with the Kangaroos. Johnson injured his leg early in the tour in England and he participated in only seven tour matches. Johnson was captain-coach of the Bluebags in 1952 and in 1953 was a non-playing coach. His attempt to retire from playing was not entirely successful as he was required to fill in on-field occasionally and in 1954 he was persuaded to return as hooker for the season by his coaching successor, Col Geelan. The team made it to the Grand Final but were beaten by Souths and Johnson finally retired from playing. Post-playing career Johnson maintained his connection with the game, firstly as a coach with Wollongong Wests in 1957. He coached them to their first premiership win. In 1962, Johnson was a founding member of the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) Coaching Panel and replaced Keith Gittoes as director of coaching in 1974. Johnson was responsible for developing coaching and playing skills in Darwin, Northern Territory, and in Papua New Guinea. From 1970 to 1975 he coached the Darwin and Northern Territory teams. It was in his honour that the Frank Johnson Medal, Darwin Rugby League's equivalent of the Rothman's Medal was named. The medal was first awarded in 1973. Johnson was honoured with life membership of the NSWRL in 1982 and received the Order of Australia Medal for services to the sport of Rugby League Football. His nephew John Johnson was for a number of years the A Grade coach for the Palmerston Raiders club in Darwin. Frank's great-nephew Matthew Johnson played for the club and made junior Northern Territory representative appearances.

From a philosophical viewpoint, nominal value represents an accepted condition, which is a goal or an approximation, as opposed to the real value, which is always present. Measurement In manufacturing, a nominal size or trade size is a size \\"in name only\\" used for identification.R. K. Rajputpage A textbook of manufacturing technology: (manufacturing processes), Firewall Media, 2008 page 705 The nominal size may not match any dimension of the product, but within the domain of that product the nominal size may correspond to a large number of highly standardized dimensions and tolerances. Nominal sizes may be well-standardized across an industry, or may be proprietary to one manufacturer. Applying the nominal size across domains requires understanding of the size systems in both areas; for example, someone wishing to select a drill bit to clear a \\"-inch screw\\" may consult tables to show the proper drill bit size. Someone wishing to calculate the load capacity of a steel beam would have to consult tables to translate the nominal size of the beam into usable dimensions. When considering the engineering tolerance between a shaft (or bolt) going through a hole in some other part (such as a nut), both the shaft (or bolt) have the same nominal size (also called the basic size), Coban Engineering. \\"Tolerancing Definitions\\". Bryan R. Fischer. \\"Mechanical Tolerance Stackup and Analysis, Second Edition\\". 2011 p. 410. Bruce J. Black, \\"Workshop Processes, Practices and Materials\\". 2015. p. 70. but all the holes are physically larger and all the shafts are physically smaller in order that any shaft (or bolt) of a given nominal size can fit into any hole of the same nominal size. In measurement, a nominal value is often a value existing in name only;ASTM D3039, D4139, and others it is assigned as a convenient designation rather than calculated by data analysis or following usual rounding methods. The use of nominal values can be based on de facto standards or some technical standards. All real measurements have some variation depending on the accuracy and precision of the test method and the measurement uncertainty. The use of reported values often involves engineering tolerances. One way to consider this is that the real value often has the characteristics of an irrational number. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long gauge block will measure to be exactly 1 inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1 inch is not the real value of the gauge block length, but some other number approximates it. Examples In various subfields of engineering, a nominal value is one for which the \\"name\\" for the value is close to, but not the same as, the actual value. Some examples: For example, dimensional lumber sizes such as \\"2 by 4\\" refers to a board whose finished dimensions are closer to inches by inches ( inches by inches is typical in the United Kingdom). A \\"-inch\\" floppy disk's standard dimension is 90 mm, or 3.54 inches, and is advertised to hold \\"1.44 megabytes\\" although its capacity is 1,474,560 bytes (1.40625 MB). A \\"-inch pipe\\" in the Nominal Pipe Size system has no dimensions that are exactly 0.75 inches. A screw thread has a number of dimensions required to assure proper function but is referred to by a nominal size and a thread design family, for example \\" inch, 20 threads per inch, Unified National Coarse.\\" In the United Kingdom, pipe is available that is quoted in both metric size and imperial size. The metric size is larger than the imperial size. For example, both inch and copper pipe is actually the same pipe which has a nominal internal diameter of an inch and a nominal external diameter of 15 millimetreshttp://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nps- nominal-pipe-sizes-d_45.html Nominal pipe sizes (diameter is always internal in the imperial measurement system and always external in metric). A machine is designed to operate at some particular condition, often stated on the device's nameplate. For example, a pump is designed to deliver its nominal pressure and flow while operating at its nominal speed and power. Actual operating conditions may vary. * Electricity: **Mains electricity is nominally 230 V in the European Union, but is allowed to vary ¬±10%. In North America, the nominal voltage is 120 V, with variance allowed from 114 V to 126 V (¬±5%). Voltage is also supplied at 208 V, 240 V and 480 V with similar tolerances. In general, electrical devices are designed to work with one nominal voltage, which represents a band of possible actual voltages, power factor and AC waveform shapes. ** Traction power networks routinely operate well above the nominal voltage, but still within the tolerance. For example, a streetcar traction power could be rated 600 ¬±10% volts nominal, but the actual overhead line voltage would normally be close to 660 volts, only dropping near the nominal value in exceptional conditions. ** NiMH and NiCd rechargeable batteries have a nominal voltage of 1.2 V, but will actually supply real voltages ranging from about 1.45 V to 1.0 V during discharge. ** A solar panel designed to charge a \\"12 V lead‚Äìacid battery\\" will often be called a \\"12-volt panel\\", even though the actual voltage while charging (of both the panel and the battery) is around 14 V, and the open-circuit voltage of the solar panel is around 17 V. \\"Basic Tutorials: Solar Panels\\". Retrieved 2014-06-25. Other cases involve diameter, speed, and volume.

Overview The instruments, operated by volunteers, measured the level of peak-overpressure at the instrument's location. Once readings had been combined with information provided by the Ground Zero Indicators it would be possible to estimate the size of the nuclear explosion in megatons. Detailed BPI information was backed up by the automatic AWDREY readings. The BPI was designed and built by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. The design was tested for performance and accuracy using real nuclear explosions at the 1957 Kiritimati (or Christmas Island) nuclear weapons tests, after being mounted on board a ship. A number of BPIs were also tested in Australia during the Operation Buffalo series of nuclear tests, with units located at various distances from ground zero. Operations Above ground a pair of circular plated baffles would be affected by the passing of the blast wave. The detector was connected by a steel pipe to the indicator dial below ground in the protected monitoring post. The dial was wall mounted and measured readings from 0.1 to 5 pounds per square inch peak overpressure. Readings below 0.3 pounds per square inch were noted but not reported. The baffles were normally stored below ground and only screwed onto the top of the pipe at the start of exercises or at Transition To War. Outside of operations the BPI pipe was protected by a screw on cap and there was a drain valve at the base of the instrument to remove any excess rainwater. If the BPI registered a reading of 0.3 or higher the operator would wait ten seconds before pressing the reset button and making a report to the group control. One minute after a BPI reading an observer is sent above ground to change the photographic papers in the Ground Zero Indicator. Codeword Royal Observer Corps reports following a reading on any BPI were prefixed with the codeword \\"Tocsin\\" e.g. \\"Tocsin Shrewsbury 56 post - (time) oh five fifty five - pressure two point six\\".

The films centre on the character of Joe Huggett, played by Jack Warner, the head of a working class London family. Along with the Gainsborough melodramas, the Huggett films proved popular and lucrative for the studio. All three films were directed by Ken Annakin and produced by Betty E. Box. Overview of films and characters The family first appear in the film Holiday Camp (1947), in which the family consists of Joe, his wife Ethel (Kathleen Harrison), their daughter Joan (Hazel Court) and her baby, and their son Harry (Peter Hammond). Jimmy Hanley played Jimmy Gardner, who becomes romantically involved with Joan. Actors Susan Shaw and John Blythe also appear, and would return (playing different characters) in the three Huggetts films that followed. Holiday Camp proved popular enough with post-war British audiences for the family to be spun off for a series of films of their own. In the first, Here Come the Huggetts (1948), characters Joan and Harry were replaced by three daughters: Jane (Jane Hylton), Susan (Susan Shaw) and Pet (Petula Clark). Peter Hammond was recast as Susan's on-off boyfriend Peter Hawtrey, while Jimmy Hanley returned as Jimmy Gardner who is now engaged to Jane. Other regular characters in the series include Ethel's niece, Diana (Diana Dors), Harold Hinchley (David Tomlinson), garage owner Gowan (John Blythe) and Grandma Huggett (Amy Veness). Blythe and Veness were the only actors, besides the main cast, to repeat their roles in all three films. The characters of Jane and Jimmy are missing from the second film but return for the final film, in which Jane is played by Dinah Sheridan. The first film revolves around the upheaval Diana's arrival at the Huggett home causes, as well as the impending wedding of Jane and Jimmy. The follow-up films were Vote for Huggett (1949), in which Joe stands for election, and The Huggetts Abroad (1949), in which the family emigrate to South Africa and get involved in smuggled diamonds. Creative personnel All four films in which the Huggetts appear are directed by Ken Annakin (making his feature film debut with Holiday Camp) and produced by Betty E. Box, while Mabel Constanduros and her nephew Denis Constanduros contributed to all four scripts. Muriel Box, Sydney Box and Peter Rogers were writers on Holiday Camp and Here Come the Huggetts, and Ted Willis worked on the script for Holiday Camp and co-wrote The Huggetts Abroad with Gerard Bryant. Allan MacKinnon co-wrote Vote for Huggett with the Constanduroses. The Huggett's theme which appears in all three films was composed by Antony Hopkins. List of Huggett film appearances * Holiday Camp (1947) * Here Come the Huggetts (1948) * Vote for Huggett (1949) * The Huggetts Abroad (1949) Other appearances Another film, Christmas with the Huggetts, was planned but never made. A BBC radio series, Meet the Huggetts, ran from 1953 to 1962. Both Warner and Harrison reprised the roles of Joe and Ethel, but here their family consists of daughter Jane (Marion Collins) and son Bobby (George Howell), rather than the three sisters of the film series. Legacy and influences Warner and Harrison were later reunited in the film Home and Away, about a family in similar circumstances to the Huggetts who win the football pools. The 1952 film The Happy Family, starring Harrison, was also influenced by the Huggetts. In the fourth wall breaking pre-credits sequence of the 1949 film It's Not Cricket, stars Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne mention the Huggett films in a contemptuous manner. This film was also produced by Betty E. Box. Media releases The Huggetts boxset, including all three films and Holiday Camp, was released on Region Two DVD in May 2007 by ITV Studios Home Entertainment.

Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy- white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland. Systematics and taxonomy The species was one of the many species named by Linnaeus who officially described it in Volume Two of his Species Plantarum in 1753 as Agaricus piperatus, the specific epithet deriving from the Latin adjective piperatus meaning \\"peppery\\". For many years, Tyrolian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli had been considered the author of the first description; however, a recent revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature in 1987 changed the rules regarding the starting date and primary work for names of fungi. Previously, the starting date had been set as January 1, 1821, the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, but now names can be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work. Lactifluus piperatus was the original type species of the genus Lactarius. However, after the finding that Lactarius actually represented more than one genus, the species Lactarius torminosus was conserved as type for that genus. Thus, L. piperatus is now the type species of Lactifluus, which was split from Lactarius and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone. Phylogenetic research showed that L. glaucescens, sometimes considered only a variety of L. piperatus, is a distinct species in Europe. Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around L. piperatus, suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species. It is commonly known as the peppery milk cap, pepper milkcap, peppery Lactarius, peppery milk mushroom, white peppery milk-cap, or other similar names. Similarly, in German it is known as the Pfeffermilchling (\\"pepper milk cap\\"). Description L. vellereus is differentiated by its shorter, thicker stipe and its large, woolly cap. Lactifluus piperatus has a cap that varies from across and is convex with a widely funnel-shaped center. The cap is creamy-white in colour, glabrous and not glossy; its surface may become cracked in dry locales. The stipe is white in colour, smooth, long by thick and is cylindrical, sometimes tapering towards the base. There is a thick layer of firm white flesh, and the decurrent gills are particularly crowded and narrow, sharing the white colouration of the stem but becoming creamy with age. As with other species of Lactarius, there is abundant milk (latex), which is white, and dries olive-green. It has a white spore print with elongate, elliptic or amyloid spores which are ornamented, as with L. vellereus. The spores measure from 6.5-9.5 by 5-8 Œºm, and have tiny warts. L. vellereus is larger with a thick stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills, but is not as tall. Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue- green tinged gills and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is differentiated by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour. Distribution and habitat Lactifluus piperatus in the wide sense, i.e. including probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and eastern and central North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found on the floor in deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into early winter. It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha. Edibility Despite being described by some mycologists as inedible or even poisonous, Lactifluus piperatus is generally considered edible. However, it is not recommended by some, because of its unpleasant taste. It is difficult to digest when eaten raw, but is used as a seasoning when dried, or sometimes is eaten fresh after parboiling, though its taste is still unappetising. Some recommend frying in butter with bacon and onion or pickling, or baking in a pie or pastry as other ways to prepare it. The milk has a very hot and acrid taste, which is removed if boiled. The mushroom used to be highly regarded in Russia, where it would be picked in dry seasons when other edible species were less available. The mushroom is also popular in Finland, where cooks boil it repeatedly, disposing of the water each time, and then store it in salt water and keep it refrigerated, after which it is pickled or served in salads. When eaten fresh and raw, the mushroom has been known to cause an irritant reaction on the lips and tongue, which subsides after an hour. The close L. glaucescens has been reported to be poisonous, but it has been speculated that the \\"poisonings\\" were caused by the extremely strong, peppery taste, rather than by the presence of actual poisons. Lactifluus piperatus forms part of an unusual and highly regarded dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms over the surface of the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels. Other uses Because of the presence of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.

Bent in 1970.Condon, Christopher. \\"Reserve‚Äôs Bent May Be Charged by SEC Over Money Fund‚Äôs Collapse \\"Reserve‚Äôs Bent May Be Charged by SEC Over Money Fund‚Äôs Collapse\\", Bloomberg News, December 24, 2008. Accessed June 28, 2010. \\"Bent is credited with having invented the money-market mutual fund in 1970, creating a safe and liquid place for retail investors to park cash. That year he opened Reserve Primary and his company with partner Henry B. R. Brown, who died in August.\\" Early career Brown was born on February 13, 1926 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father worked for a company that manufactured blast furnaces. He attended Harvard University, where he was a cartoonist for the Harvard Lampoon. After graduating from college he worked for Chemical Bank in the early 1950s and later worked for a company that would later become part of Citibank. In 1963 he joined Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association in a position where he managed the firm's securities investments. Inventing the money market fund Until it was overturned by the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in 1980, a United States banking law known as Regulation Q, which was enacted by Congress during the Great depression as part of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposit checking accounts. While well-heeled investors could earn high yields by purchasing certificates of deposit or commercial paper, investments that required investments that could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, typical consumers were effectively frozen out of this market. Banks in the United States were able to gather substantial funds that they were able to lend out with interest without paying any returns on the funds they had received from depositors. Sitting around their office in August 1969 and brainstorming, Bent suggested that a mutual fund could be created that would allow small investors to combine their resources and gain access to the higher yields available from purchasing a pool of CDs and commercial paper. Neither of them knew anything about the intricacies and legalities of opening a mutual fund, but research by Brown confirmed that the type of money market mutual fund that they had conceived of would be legal in all 50 states. They established the Reserve Fund to implement their idea, which languished in its first several years, building up $250,000 in debts. Early on, individuals and corporations could invest in the fund by putting in as little as $1,000. Shares in the fund were $100 each, with \\"dividends\\" paid as additional fractional shares in the account, keeping the value of each fund share at a constant price. The fund charged a management fee of 50 basis points. Though other banks and investment firms were looking at creating money market funds of their own, Bent and Brown were confident that the enormous size of the potential market and their ability to keep costs low would allow them to compete with their larger competitors. They turned the corner after an article in the January 7, 1973 issue of The New York Times brought much-needed attention to their innovation.Hershey, Robert D., Jr. \\"Overnight Mutual Funds for Surplus Assets\\", The New York Times, January 7, 1973. Accessed June 22, 2010. By the end of that year they had garnered investments of $100 million. The money market fund industry grew by leaps and bounds, becoming an industry that had amassed $3.5 trillion in assets by the time of Brown's death in 2008, with the Reserve Fund alone accounting for $62 billion in assets. The invention of the money market fund by Bent and Brown was credited by the American Museum of Financial History, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, as a major innovation in the financial history of the United States. Paul Samuelson, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1970, said in a speech in 2001 that Bent and Brown deserved to win a Nobel prize themselves. Upon hearing of Samuelson's statement, Brown remarked that he couldn't \\"say that our 'invention' resulted from any brilliance on our part\\", continuing that \\"it was actually a combination of the threat of starvation and pure greed that drove us to it\\".Markham, Jerry W. \\"A financial history of the United States: From the age of derivatives into the new millennium : (1970 - 2001), Volume III\\", p. 6. M. E. Sharpe, 2002. Accessed June 28, 2010. Money market funds seek to maintain a stable $1.00 net asset value, never losing money. In the financial turmoil following the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, just one month after Brown's death, the Reserve Fund saw a run on its investments after it marked down to zero the value of assets it had invested in Lehman's securities, forcing it to \\"break the buck\\", leaving investors who had held onto their investments in the fund to lose as much as three to five percent of their investment.Henriques, Diana B. \\"Money Market Fund Says Customers Could Lose Money\\", The New York Times, September 16, 2008. Accessed June 22, 2010. Personal life After his retirement from the financial industry, he joined with partner Chris Gerow in competing in the annual Punkin Chunkin event held in Delaware. Brown died at age 82 of an abdominal aneurysm on August 11, 2008, at his home in Leesburg, Virginia. His residence had been owned by members of his family for more than 200 years. Brown's grandfather was United States federal judge Addison Brown, who was also a botanist and one of the founders of the New York Botanical Garden. An earlier ancestor was Virginia statesman Richard Henry Lee, whose June 1776 resolution led to the United States Declaration of Independence.

Overview The GZI consisted of four horizontally mounted cardinal compass point pinhole cameras within a white enamelled metal drum, each 'camera' contained a sheet of photosensitive paper mounted within a clear plastic cassette on which were printed horizontal and vertical calibration lines delineating compass bearing and elevation above the horizon. The bright flash from a nuclear explosion would burn a mark on one or two of the papers within the drum. The position of the burn spot enabled the bearing and height of the burst to be estimated. With triangulation between neighbouring posts these readings would give an accurate height and position. The altitude of the explosion was important because a ground or near ground burst would produce radioactive fallout, whereas an air burst would produce only short distance and short lived initial radiations (but no fallout). Once combined with the peak-overpressure readings from post Bomb Power Indicator readings the power of the burst in megatons could also be calculated by the Triangulation Team in the group control building, using a hand held plastic calculator device. Operations Normally stored below ground the drum was mounted at the start of exercises or at Transition To War on a special above ground mount set in the concrete of the entrance hatch. Concentric lugs on the mount ensured that the drum was mounted correctly even in the dark. The light sensitive photographic paper was unfixed chemically and had to be protected from daylight by being carried in a protective pouch strapped to the observer's chest. The cassettes were always lodged in a specific order so they could be changed in the pitch black with practice. Differing notched cutouts at the bottom of the cassettes ensured they could not be mounted at the incorrect cardinal point. Daylight inevitably darkened the unfixed papers so routine changes were made at mid day during winter operations and twice daily, at mid day and sunset, during summer months. The sun burned a distinctive suntrail across the papers when there was no cloud cover. Sixty seconds after any reading on the Bomb Power Indicator an observer exited the post and changed the GZI cassettes. The exposed papers were returned underground for assessment. The pre-exposed papers had a graticule grid exposed on the papers that showed degrees of bearing. The fireball from any nuclear burst within range would have burned a mark on the paper. The spot size and bearing would be reported to the group control together with an indication that the spot is touching or clear of the horizon, essential for indicating an air or ground burst. Codeword Reports following readings on the GZI were prefixed with the words \\"Nuclear Burst\\" and the monitoring post's operational identifier e.g. \\"Nuclear Burst Shrewsbury 56 post - (time) oh six hundred - Bearing zero seven zero - spotsize zero six - touching\\". Training For realistic exercise training photographic papers with simulated burst spots were prepared by the Exercise Division of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation at Cowley. Delivered sealed, the time of opening was written on the outside of the sealed envelope. Observers trained blindfolded so that they could exit the post up the vertical steel ladder and complete a GZI cassette change quickly and even in the pitch dark of a winter's night.

The suit provides whoever wears it superhuman strength, as well as leaving the wearer open to having their body controlled by someone else via wireless computer signals. After learning that Drew's father, who has a serious heart condition, is required to present the prototype to investors, and after soon discovering that the suit would cause Drew's father to die of massive heart failure, the group goes on a mission to save his father and shut down the company responsible for building the incomplete and dangerous device. Plot A research and production company is performing a live human trial for a machine called the \\"Augmentor 1000\\". The device is designed for medical use, with an ancillary benefit of enhanced strength. The machine's creator, workaholic Pat Utley, objects due to potentially lethal side effects. Edward Crow, the company owner, overrules him. The Augmentor is successfully activated but the subject suddenly goes berserk until Pat literally pulls the plug on the device. Drew, Pat's teenage son, meets up with friends Miles and Lanny after school. All three are bullied by jocks; they later commiserate at Drew's house and decide to form a club to defend themselves. The next day, Drew and Miles hang out at Pat's work, and hack into the computer systems for fun. While Miles browses classified files, Drew overhears Crow demanding that Pat prepare for a motion control Augmentor demonstration. To ensure his compliance, Pat is ordered to wear the machine for the test or be taken off the project. Pat reluctantly agrees, despite a problematic heart condition. Drew concludes they're trying to get rid of his dad, so Miles tries to find out more about the machine, but they need Crow's superuser password. To get it, the three of them recruit Jonny, the school hustler, for their club. Together, they trick a system supervisor out of the superuser password and download the Augmentor schematics. Miles determines that an Augmentor user will fry their nervous system in 20 minutes, but Drew's dad would be dead in only five. They determine the best way to save Pat is to steal the machine. To help break into the building, Jonny's cousin Samantha, a skilled car thief and lockpick, is enlisted. The team calls themselves the \\"P.U.N.K.S.\\" - an acronym formed by the first letters of their surnames, and also stands for their mantra (\\"to Protect the Underdog with Nerve, Knowledge, and Strength\\"). During a night raid, they successfully infiltrate the building. Miles copies and deletes the Augmentor files while Drew and Sam plant an audio bug and tap into a camera feed for surveillance from their \\"master control\\". A silent alarm attracts guards, and Miles crashes the system with a virus before the teens narrowly escape with the Augmentor. The day after, they learn from their audio/video feed that Crow has file backups and an Augmentor prototype. They attempt two public meets to obtain the prototype, but both fail. Crow organizes an impromptu demonstration for an important investor with Middle Eastern buyer connections which Crow needs, as he has secretly put all of his company's financial hopes on black market trade. Frustrated with Pat, Crow decides to test out the prototype Augmentor with the remote control unit personally. Jonny uses a second motion control suit to embarrass Crow by making him do ridiculous antics. Furious, Crow threatens to fire Pat unless the real demo goes perfectly. The victory celebration is cut short when Crow is overheard talking about eliminating the P.U.N.K.S., and mentioning a troublesome FBI agent named Houlihan. Everyone panics and bails except Drew. He meets Houlihan, falling into a trap set by Crow. The other P.U.N.K.S. save him at the last minute by radio, and he escapes. Pat tries to resign, but is drugged and forcibly suited up for the buyer presentation. Drew returns to \\"master control\\", only to find Crow kidnapped his friends. He rides in during the demo and rescues his friends and saves his dad. Crow puts on the Augmentor and fights Drew. The boy has the upper hand, but runs past his twenty-minute limit and starts losing consciousness. As Crow prepares to pummel him, Sam intervenes in the motion control suit and has Crow beat himself up. The police arrive and arrest the criminals. Back at school, the jocks pick on Miles, but the P.U.N.K.S. unite, and Lanny literally tosses them across the courtyard by using the Augmentor. On their way home together, Miles reads an article detailing the exposure of Crow's operation, the arrests, and crediting the P.U.N.K.S. as a \\"covert team of operatives\\", for bringing them to justice.

The band was formed in 1989 and released two albums and three EPs. The band split in 2001. Biography Witness was created in 1989 and was composed of former members of Blue Bird. Their music is mainly based on 1970s blues rock and hard rock. The original line-up was: Cyril as vocalist, Bob as drummer, and Paco and Manu shared guitar and bass guitar. At the time, the band played some gigs on small stages. Eventually, Paco moved definitely to guitar, while Manu officially became the band's bass guitar player. The band enlarged its playlist and performed more and more often in its home region, the Sarthe, but also in Brittany. Witness took part in various festivals and opened for Calvin Russel. Around 1992, many important events occurred: the band played a lot of concerts (72 in just one year), recorded an entirely DIY demo cassette (First Shoot), and turned more toward hard rock. The following year, Witness hit the road and opens for alternative rock bands throughout France, playing in several festivals. In 1994, the band recorded a darker five-track disk named after the band, played for 15,000 people at Le Mans 24h motorbike race and added many festival concerts to their list. The band's style then became more grunge-like and they recorded another DIY cassette: the eight-song Smooth. This work was followed by a 15-track album having the same name in 1996, released by Move On Prod. Gilles, who had already played guitar on some recordings, became a full-time member of the band soon after. This five-member line-up appeared on stage during Rennes' Transmusicales that same year, as well as in other occasions. In 1997, the members of the band shared an unplugged experience in bars and show-cases that can be heard on Elec-oustic. Witness went back in the studio during January 1998 to record Grimace, many guests contributing to this definitely electric album. Unfortunately, Bob was severely injured in May. Dennis became the drummer for a while before leaving the job to Yann, who had already helped out with percussions on Grimace. Bruno, who played the keyboards parts on the album, shared a few stages with them before taking part in some further recordings. Bob returned as a drummer in 1999, even though he was still suffering from the effects of his accident. The band then recorded a few demos in its home-studio, in order to prepare the Avatar album. The band performed on stage for a while, but Bob was forced to leave his drumming to Yann once again during spring 2000, his handicap making it difficult for him to endure the band's long sets and unleashed live energy. Soon after, the band published a four-track demo. The recording sessions for Avatar took place from summer 2000 on until 2001 at the Master Studio with Thierry Chassang, who had already worked on Grimace. The band released a three-tracks demo the same year. Witness opened for Popa Chubby at Le Mans' 24h and gave its last concert in September, before dissolving two months later.

There are entrances to the reserve located on Allison Road, Canadian Bay Road, Two Bays Road and Station Street near the Moorooduc Railway Station. History Rock was quarried using explosives, loaded into dobbin carts and taken to a steam powered crusher. The resulting crushed stone was loaded into larger carts and transported to the Mornington railway line via a spur-line. *1887 - The Moorooduc quarry was established by David Munro. *1888 - A spur-line was built from the quarry to the site which is now Moorooduc station to transport stone and ballast for the construction of a branch line between Baxter and Mornington. *1923 - The Frankston - Hastings Shire Council purchased the site. Stone from the quarry continued to be used for ballasting railway lines and other uses including building, road construction and repairs to the Mornington Reservoir. *1927 - Electricity was introduced and the steam powered crusher which used local timber for fuel was superseded by an electrical crusher. *1932 - Stone from the quarry was used in the construction of stables and garden walls at Cruden Farm owned by Keith Murdoch, father of Rupert Murdoch. *1935 - The cartage of stone by rail was replaced with trucks. *1950s - Stone from Moorooduc quarry featured in houses built in Gulls Way, designed by David Chancellor and W. Rex Patrick. *1961 - The quarry was closed due to flooding. Continuing to fill with water the quarry became a popular swimming spot. *1973 - Frankston Council designated the area a flora and fauna reserve. *1981 - Some scenes for the television mini-series I Can Jump Puddles were filmed at the site of the quarry. *1986 - The movie Frog Dreaming was filmed at the site of the quarry. After a period of neglect community interest transformed the site into a beautiful nature reserve, one of the best on the Mornington Peninsula. Current status The Moorooduc Quarry Flora and Fauna Reserve is located within the boundaries of the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port Biosphere Reserve. There are several walking tracks throughout the reserve. One track encircles the high cliffs of the quarry and another the lake at the base of the cliffs. Following the path from Station Street will take you past ruins of an explosives store. Rock climbing and abseiling were quite popular in the reserve but is now strictly prohibited. The Moorooduc Quarry Flora and Fauna Reserve was submitted for listing on the Register of the National Estate prior to the closure of the register in 2007 but was rejected because it was \\"not of sufficient significance to warrant entry in the Register.\\" Flora Four species of eucalyptus and four species of acacia dominate the reserve. Most botanically significant is the diversity and abundance of indigenous native grasses and wildflowers. More than thirty species of orchids have been documented in the reserve. Several of these are classified as of state or regional significance. Flora found in the reserve: * Acacia * Australian indigo (Indigofera australis) * Bracken * Eucalyptus * Maidenhair fern * Orchids * Manna gum * Cherry ballart * She-oak Fauna At least 45 native species of birds have been recorded as breeding in the reserve and many other species visit to feed or rest. Waterbirds are often seen on the quarry lake. Several bat species have been recorded and infrequent sightings of koalas. The quarry lake and surrounding ponds and dams are home to small to microscopic aquatic creatures and various frogs.

This is a list of people executed in the Papal States under the government of the Popes or during the 1810‚Äì1819 decade of French rule. Although capital punishment in Vatican City was legal from 1929 to 1969, no executions took place in that time. This list does not include people executed by other authorities of the Roman Catholic Church or those executed by Inquisitions other than the Roman Inquisition, or those killed in wars involving the Papal States, or those killed extrajudicially. Most executions were related to the punishment of civil crimes committed within the Papal States, with the condemned convicted within the civil courts of the Papal States; for example, in 1585, Pope Sixtus V initiated a \\"zero tolerance\\" crackdown on crime, which according to legend resulted in more severed heads collected on the Castel Sant'Angelo bridge than melons in the Roman markets. The best records are from the tenure of Giovanni Battista Bugatti, the executioner of the Papal States between March 22, 1796 and August 17, 1861, who recorded the name of the condemned, the crime, and the location of the execution for each of the 516 \\"justices\\" he performed for the governments, papal or French. Bugatti's list ends: \\"So ends the long list of Bugatti. May that of his successor be shorter\\". Before 1816, the most common methods of execution were the axe and noose (with burning at the stake used in high profile instances); after 1816, the guillotine (installed by the French during their control of Rome) became the norm. However, after 1816, two other methods‚Äîthe mazzatello (crushing of the head with a large mallet, followed by a cutting of the throat) and drawing and quartering (sometimes, but not always, after a hanging)‚Äîcontinued to be used for crimes that were considered \\"especially loathsome\\". The execution sites of choice were the Ponte Sant'Angelo, the bridge in front of the Castel Sant'Angelo, the Piazza del Popolo, and Via dei Cerchi near the Piazza della Bocca della Verita. Papal law prescribed a payment of only three cents of the Roman lira per execution for the executioner to \\"mark the vileness of his work\\" but did not prohibit the free lodging, tax concessions, and large pension awarded to Bugatti. :The date in parentheses is the date of the execution.

Its story takes place in 1930 during Prohibition in the United States. The film is notable for serving as a storefront for George Lucas and Gary Kurtz who were looking for crew to assist with the look of Star Wars. Both visited the set during production and were impressed with what they saw. Several of the predominantly British crew were effectively recruited during this visit. Plot During the Prohibition era, a young widow, Claire, gets involved in liquor smuggling and romance with two men, Walker and Kibby, off the San Diego coast. Organized crime controls bootlegging back east and wants to do the same here, so a hit man named McTeague is sent to deal with these amateur crooks, as is the Coast Guard, leading to various battles at sea.

Before that film came out they were struggling writers, looking for an original project. While Huyck was in the Army reserves, Katz was in the UCLA library \\"looking for anything for an idea.\\" She came across an article in American Mercury magazine about rumrunners operating off Ensenada during prohibition and, feeling that it had never been used for a film before, started researching the period. When Huyck got out of the army they brought the idea to Mike Gruskoff, a producer, who liked the similarities to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and agreed to finance them writing it for $75,000 They worked on the script for six months. \\"It took us a long time to get our characters down,\\" said Katz. \\"We tried it a lot of different ways. And we did a lot of research into the period and the language.\\" When they handed the script in, Groskoff sold the film within eighteen hours to 20th Century Fox for $450,000, which was then a record amount for an original screenplay. They were helped by the fact that American Graffiti had since come out and been a huge success.Gloria Katz- Willard Huyck Interview Warren, Madeline; Levine, Robert A.

Katz said, \\"our reaction was, Stanley Donen seems so bizarre for this kind of film! Then we realized he's the ideal director because he is really a romantic director, and he can do this kind of character stuff and the kind of humor that the film has.\\" Some changes to the script were made. \\"Stanley wanted very much to play up the relationships, the menage-√†-trois,\\" said Huyck. \\"Which was fine with us. The script was probably overloaded with action since we wanted to sell it. Actually, action is boring to write. We have much more fun with dialogue.\\" \\"Stanley's big emphasis to us is that you must love the characters,\\" said Katz. \\"And any place he feels the characters are being lost, he wants us to put in something to develop the characters further. \\" Casting The writers said their inspiration for the lead characters were Jean Harlow, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. It took 18 months for Donen to cast the film. Donen says this was due to problems with billing, pay and the fact the woman's role was central made it difficult to find male stars to play opposite her. \\"We thought the idea of three stars was a terrific notion because it would make Lucky Lady very salable and very castable,\\" said Katz. \\"Ironically, it made it salable, but casting turned out to be a very big problem because one of the three stars was a woman. A lot of male actors didn't want to be in an ensemble piece or a piece with a woman as a strong character.\\" The only two female stars considered \\"bankable\\" at the time were Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli. Minnelli was the first star cast, for a minimum of $350,000. Donen originally wanted Paul Newman, who also wanted Spielberg to direct, and Warren Beatty for the lead male roles with production scheduled to begin in October 1974. However the stars could not be locked down. Later, in November 1974, Burt Reynolds was signed along with George Segal.That's Liza With an 'L' for Lucky Los Angeles Times 19 Nov 1974: f9. Huyck said Reynolds \\"didn't really like doing macho roles, he didn't want to play the tough guy role, he wanted the silly part.\\" Reynolds' fee was reportedly $500,000, Segal's $750,000. Reynolds said it was \\"very important\\" the film was a success \\"since my last three films went down the tubes.\\" Segal later dropped out of the project and was quickly replaced with Hackman. Gene Hackman initially did not want to do the film, but 20th Century Fox kept offering him more and more money. Finally, Fox offered him $1.25 million, and according to talent agent Sue Mengers, \\"it was almost obscene for him not to do the film.\\" \\"I was seduced,\\" said Hackman. Shooting Filming began in Guaymas, Mexico in February 1975 and finished in July of that year. It was an exceedingly difficult shoot, compounded by the isolation of the location, poor weather, and the fact so much of it was shot on water.'Lucky Lady' Filming Just Plain Unlucky: 'Lucky' Filming Plain Unlucky 'Lucky' Filming Plain Unlucky 'Lucky' Filming Plain Unlucky Murphy, Mary.

New ending In the original script, the two male leads were killed by government agents and the final scene happened ten years later with Liza Minnelli's character married to a boring businessman remembering the men she once loved. The writers said when they sold it, \\"The studio loved the script, and at that point no one objected to the ending.\\"Why Couldn't This 'Lady' Have an Unhappy Ending?: Why No Unhappy Ending for 'Lady'? By STEPHEN FARBER. New York Times 14 Dec 1975: D1. \\"One of the first images in our minds when we began to work on the script was the ending,\\" said Katz. \\"The idea of this woman remembering the two men she loved. We worked backwards from that. To us, the romance of the piece was in the idea of separation and loss. Because the film was booked in for a Christmas release, Donen only had three months to edit the film. During this time Donen became concerned about the ending, feeling that the film had become much lighter than originally intended, and tried several different ones, including simply cutting off the final ten minutes. He eventually decided the film needed a happy ending and Fox agreed to finance a reshot scene. Because Minnelli was filming A Matter of Time in Rome, Donen, Hackman and Reynolds flew to Rome in November and shot a new ending. The ending consisted of the three characters in bed together ten years later. Huyck and Katz wrote the new ending, albeit reluctantly. \\"To us the original ending made a comment about the choices a woman has to make. But instead of making it the story of this woman, Stanley has made it a story of three people. That's valid. It's just different from what we originally intended.\\" Garth Wigan, a Fox executive at the time, later recalled, \\"We previewed the movie nine times. The 2-hour, 30-minute version was wonderful. Burt Reynolds and Liza Minelli died at the end and everything was set up for them to die. But market research told us they shouldn't die, so we started chopping a bit here, a bit there. We took the seriousness out. The only good preview we had was when the film broke, and Stanley Donen, the director, did a dance for the audience while it was being spliced.\\"HOLLYWOOD'S SNEAKY WAY OF TESTING FILMS New York Times 17 May 1981: A.1. It was decided that the new ending was not suitable, in part due to poor make up. So a third ending was used, which cut off the last ten minutes of the film. Minnelli later criticized Donen for taking \\"out the part that made you feel like the three of us are in peril. I saw the finished picture and I never once was afraid for us. Most of the serious moments were removed too.\\" Reynolds and Minnelli both criticized the new ending, requesting that the studio show the three different endings to the press. Donen refused and since he had final cut the studio backed him. Donen called Minnelli an \\"emotional child\\" for this criticism.Murphy, Mary (December 17, 1975). \\"Fox's 'Lucky Lady' at Loose Ends\\".: Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 19-20.

The project is intended to reduce tow and barge delays by replacing the existing older, and frequently congested, locks and dams Number 52 and Number 53. The locks are located about 17 miles upstream from the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers at Olmsted, Illinois. The project is operational while the removal of Locks and Dams 52 and 53 should be completed around 2020. The project is both the largest and the most expensive inland waterway project ever undertaken in the United States. History The US Congress, through the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 first approved a $775 million budget for the project in 1988 (October 1987 Price Levels). The lock chambers, completed in 2002, are wide and long. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, the new dam and locks will reduce passage time to under one hour with the new system. Due to queuing at Lock and Dam Number 52 and Lock and Dam Number 53, it can take cargo traffic 15 to 20 hours each to transit the locks the Olmsted complex is intended to replace. When initiated the complex was projected to cost $775 million. As of February 2018, the estimated cost of the project is over $3 billion. While the project was initially scheduled for completion in 1998, by 2016 it was projected to become operational between 2018 and by 2020, Locks and Dams 52 and 53 would be decommissioned. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal agency responsible for maintaining navigation on the USA's rivers, estimates the delay in completing the project results in a yearly loss of about $640 million to $800 million in lost benefits to the nation. While calculating these benefits is complex because of the amount of variables considered, it essentially takes into account the reduced costs industry (or businesses using the river for commerce) would experience if the Olmsted Project was operational versus the current means of transit through the aging and often unreliable Locks and Dams 52 and 53. These benefits further calculate the reduced costs in moving cargo through the river versus the next available cheapest alternative, usually by rail or by truck.  In-the-wet construction  The Locks and Dams 52 and 53 Replacement Project, better known as the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project makes use of the innovative in-the-wet construction. When a dam is constructed on a small river, engineers usually create a cofferdam (or a enclosure) within a river and drain the water out of it to facilitate construction. However, building this entire project through the use of cofferdams would have been incredibly impeding to river traffic. As the hub of the Inland waterways, the largest transit point in the nation's river system where approximately 90 million tons of goods pass through each year, blocking large parts of the river would have caused major delays to river traffic even more so than evidenced at Locks and Dams 52 and 53. Site of the Olmsted Project. Notice the on-land casting yard where concrete elements of the dam are built and then transported into the river for placement. Engineers instead chose to construct the dam portion of the project using the in-the-wet technique, where concrete portions of the dam itself were built offsite at a concrete casting yard, transported into the river for placement, and placed on the bottom of the river, all with minimal disruption to the river. 414x414px  Problems with the project - cost increases  This has been perhaps the longest and largest civil works project in the history of the Corps of Engineers. Multiple delays, especially in funding have created a 30 year endeavor that has been inflated from a $700+ million price tag to over $3 billion in early 2018. The biggest contributors to these increases have been: * Delays in funding and lack of availability of appropriations * Costs increases of materials over time * Low initial budget proposal for the project (engineers underestimated the initial costs of the project) * In-the-wet construction * Cost-reimbursable contracts (where the Government carries the majority of the risk of development) * Unforeseen engineering problems * Stretching of the budget (the USACE had and has other projects that require funds which were in turn taken away from Olmsted) * Inflation * Changes in design to the project * Unpredictable river conditions See also * List of locks and dams of the Ohio River References External links * Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the USACE website * Olmsted Locks and Dam locality map * Olmsted Dam Construction on Flickr Buildings and structures in Ballard County, Kentucky Buildings and structures in Pulaski County, Illinois Ohio River Dams in Illinois Dams in Kentucky United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Locks of Illinois Locks of Kentucky ","title":"Olmsted Locks and Dam"},{"id":"18892897","text":"Lucie Idlout (born Tatanniq Lucie d'Argencourt) is a Canadian singer/songwriter from Iqaluit, Nunavut.

Colla, and stars Burt Reynolds, Yul Brynner, Raquel Welch, Tom Skerritt and Jack Weston. The screenplay was written by Evan Hunter, based on the 1968 novel of the same name that was part of the \\"87th Precinct\\" series he wrote under the name Ed McBain. Dave Grusin composed the film's soundtrack score. While the 87th Precinct novels are set in a fictional metropolis based on New York City, Fuzz is set and was shot on location in Boston, Massachusetts. Plot Detectives Steve Carella (Reynolds), Meyer Meyer (Weston), Eileen McHenry (Welch) and Bert Kling (Skerritt) are part of the 87th Precinct's team, investigating a murder-extortion racket run by a mysterious deaf man (Brynner). While attempting to investigate and prevent the murders of several high-ranking city officials, they also must keep track of the perpetrators of a string of robberies. Further complicating matters is a rash of arson attacks on homeless men. Cast * Burt Reynolds as Det. Carella * Raquel Welch as Det. McHenry * Yul Brynner as The Deaf Man * Tom Skerritt as Det. Kling * Jack Weston as Det. Meyer * James McEachin as Det. Brown * Bert Remsen as Sgt. Murchison * Steve Ihnat as Det. Parker * Peter Bonerz as Buck * Don Gordon as La Bresca * Dan Frazer as Lt. Amos Byrnes * Norman Burton as Police Commissioner Nelson * Charles Tyner as Pete * Neile Adams as Teddy * Tamara Dobson as Rochelle * Charles Martin Smith as Baby Production The film's opening-credits sequence was filmed in and around Charlestown's City Square station on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's elevated Orange Line (demolished in 1975), as well as the MBTA's Red Line as it emerged from its Cambridge, Massachusetts tunnel to cross the Longfellow Bridge en route into Boston. Other Boston filming locations included the North End, the Boston Common, and the Public Garden, where Burt Reynolds runs around disguised as a nun. \\"It was kind of fuzzy\\", said Reynolds of the film. \\"It was made by one of those hot shot TV directors. I liked working with Jack Weston; it began our relationship. I did like working again with Raquel. And I liked the writer whose book the film was based on, Ed McBain, The 87th Precinct. I'd like to direct one of his books.\\" Welch was paid $100,000 for nine days work. There was meant to be a scene where Welch's character appears in her bra and panties in the men's room. Welch refused to film it. They shot it a number of other ways \\"but it just didn't work\\" said producer Ed Feldman. \\"We promised United Artists we'd deliver a certain picture and we haven't got it.\\" However Welch still refused. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"an offbeat, funny, quietly cheerful movie in which Ed McBain's 87th Precinct is finally brought to life. Several movies have been based on McBain's 87th Precinct novels, but never one in which the squad room was explored so lovingly by the camera, and the detectives were made so human.\\" In a negative review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby remarked that the film \\"looks more like a dress rehearsal than a finished film, a very dry run for something that is apparently meant to be a comedy-melodrama about ineptitude, especially the day-to-day ineptitude of a group of detectives attached to a Boston police station.\\"Canby, Vincent (July 15, 1972). \\"The Screen: Cops Take Rap in 'Fuzz'\\". The New York Times. 29. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety praised the screenplay as \\"excellent\\" and \\"a rare combination of effective interlocking vignettes which logically and literately evolve towards a climax.\\" Of the performances Murphy wrote, \\"Reynolds is very good, Weston and James McEachin are excellent, and Skerritt is outstanding as the principal quartet of detectives spotlighted in the hunt for Brynner. Miss Welch's developed cameo as a sexy policewoman is a decided plus.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (May 24, 1972). \\"Film Reviews: Fuzz\\". Variety. 19. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that it has \\"something for everyone: Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds. Only a solve-three-plots-at-once ending spoils the entertainment.\\"Siskel, Gene (June 11, 1972). \\"Fuzz\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared the film \\"a solid piece of craftsmanship, well-paced and skilfully assembled\\", though he felt that it \\"could have been just as diverting had it been played less broadly and for more in-depth characterization. As it is, 'Fuzz' succeeds as a mindless entertainment.\\"Thomas, Kevin (May 23, 1972). \\"'Fuzz' Film Features Raquel, Burt---Clothed\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 14. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \\"a sprightly, genial take-off on the cops-and-robbers formula\\" as well as \\"the most amusing and attractive commercial vehicle I've seen since 'Play It Again, Sam,' and it recommends itself in a similar way ‚Äî as an agreeable throwaway entertainment, ideally suited for summertime moviegoing.\\"Arnold, Gary (July 25, 1972). \\"Fuzz, MASHed\\". The Washington Post. B1. Tony Collier of The Monthly Film Bulletin thought that \\"the comedy here, ladled on with a satirical fervour that invites overstatement, works in isolation, with no real interplay between it and the violence, so that the two elements coexist without ever quite managing to coalesce. Fuzz is nevertheless an intelligent and enjoyable film, and often very funny.\\" Controversy In Boston, on October 2, 1973, 24-year-old Evelyn Wagler, after running out of fuel, was walking back to her car with a two- gallon can of gasoline. Six teenagers dragged her into an alley and forced her to pour gasoline on herself. She complied, and was then set on fire by the teenagers. The teenagers walked away laughing. Wagler was white, and the youths were black, and this murder occurred during a racially tense period in Boston history. After the incident, the press reported that Fuzz had aired on nationwide TV the previous weekend, and the perpetrators may have re-enacted the fictional arson attack portrayed in the movie. The case was never solved.Evelyn Wagler Murder at CelebrateBoston.com In Miami, on October 20, 1973, 38-year-old Charles Scales, a homeless person sleeping outdoors behind an abandoned building, was approached by a group of teenagers, doused with gasoline, and set on fire. Two other homeless people were also attacked in the same incident, but escaped. A homeless person that survived stated the teenagers \\"Were laughing and throwing gas and striking matches\\" at them.\\"Torch Victim Tells Killer's Name, Dies\\", Modesto Bee, October 22, 1973, page b-2, AP Story The film Fuzz was mentioned in the news reports about the killing, as the attack completely mimicked the movie's plot. Both the perpetrators and victims were black, ruling out the motivation for the murder may have been racial in nature. The incidents led to a careful review by network Standards and Practices and a general public feeling that violence on television was inspiring violence in real life. Networks had to curb their violence throughout the decade as a result, and Fuzz got pulled temporarily from TV movie blocks until it returned in its uncut version to cable years later.

In addition to the standard locomotives (Einheitslokomotive) described below there was also a Prussian class that was given the designation E 913 in 1927. E 91.0 and E 91.8 History As early as 1922 the first order was placed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn for 30 heavy goods train electric locomotives with a C+C wheel arrangement for mountain railway services, as part of their procurement plan for electric locomotives. They were delivered by Krauss (mechanical elements) and WASSEG (electrical equipment) in 1925 and 1926. Sixteen units were allocated to the Bavarian railway network. They were given the designation EG 5 22 501 ‚Äì 516 by the Bavarian Group Administration. The other 14 machines were deployed to the Silesian network as EG 581 Breslau to EG 594 Breslau. From 1927 they were given operating numbers E 91 01 ‚Äì 16 and E 91 81 ‚Äì 94. In 1927 a further four locomotives were delivered that had been ordered with Bavarian operating numbers, but were delivered with the new numbers E 91 17 ‚Äì 20. Classes E 91 and E 77 were very similar. The three-axle driven bogies had an inside frame. Each had a double motor driving its axles via a jackshaft and Winterthur diagonal side-rod drive (Schr√§gstangenantrieb). The superstructure was in three sections. The front and rear sections each had a driver's cab and an engine room and were fixed to the bogies. The centre section was suspended between the front and rear sections and was articulated. The gangways between the individual sections of the engine room were protected by bellows; there were no dividing walls. The Bavarian locomotives could be easily told from their Silesian counterparts by the additional front door between the two cab windows (see photograph, right, of the Bavarian E 91 11, parked up in AW Frankfurt as a stationary transformer for the test shop. Unlike the E 91.9, it had air vents that can be clearly seen along the lower half of the sides). The machines were to be able to haul goods trains of 1,200 tonnes at 35 km/h on a 10 ‚Ä∞ incline and passenger trains of 500 tonnes at 45 km/h. Because the engines were intended for goods and passenger services, which did not require high top speeds, these locomotives fully met their intended expectations. In the DRG, the south German engines remained permanently in Bavaria at Munich main station, Regensburg, Rosenheim and Freilassing locomotive depots. The Silesian machines, whose delivery had begun in 1925, were homed in Hirschberg/Jelenia G√≥ra depot. Of those, numbers E 91 89 to E 91 91 were transferred to Ulm shed in the Stuttgart Reichsbahn railway division in 1933. In 1943, E 91 88 and E 91 94 were moved to Bavaria, and E 91 82, 92 and 93 followed in 1944. The remaining engines, E 91 83 to E 91 87, were transferred to the Soviet Zone in autumn 1945. They were given to the USSR in 1946 as war reparations. After their return in 1952/53 they remained mothballed. A new lease of life on the R√ºbeland Railway did not come to fruition, because it soon became apparent that this line would be electrified for 25 kV, 50 Hz. The engines were retired in 1962 and scrapped in 1965. Of the south German engines, E 91 05 had been retired in 1934 and E 91 17 in 1944. After further retirements, 17 locomotives remained in the DB fleet in 1950 (numbers E 91 01 - 03, 07 - 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 81, 88, 89 and 94) and they were modernised between 1958 and 1960, all the electrical equipment being renewed. The driver's cabs were changed (gangways and window shields removed and the third window at front and rear replaced with a larger one). On the introduction of computerised operating numbers, the locomotives were reclassified in 1969 to 191s and given three-digit running numbers. In their final years the engines were not only deployed in south German locomotive depots, but also at Oberhausen in the Ruhrgebiet. Due to their low top speed, they were mainly used on shunting duties. They were retired between 1969 and 1975. E 91.9 History Locomotive 191 100 retired at M√ºnchen-Freimann shop in 1983 and used for spare parts E 91 99 (14.09.1985) Because more electric locomotives were required as a result of the expansion of the network and the increase in traffic, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft issued a follow-on order for twelve E 91s in 1927 to cover the most pressing requirements. The locomotives were to be equipped with an electric brake for hauling heavy trains on long inclines. In addition the original design had to be changed in order to save weight. As a platform for testing the electric brake, locomotive E 95 02 was equipped with it on delivery. The engines were supplied in 1929 by AEG and WASSEG (a joint venture between AEG and SSW) with numbers E 91 95 - 106 and stationed at Waldenburg-Dittersbach / Wa≈Çbrzych-Podg√≥rze locomotive depot for duties on the Silesian network. Compared with the original version of the Class E 91, they differed not only technically in terms of their lower weight (a weight saving achieved above all by the traction motors) and electric brakes, but the locomotives were also longer. There was no difference in power between the two types. Externally the newer machines could easily be spotted from their three large cab windows and the air vents along the side, that were all level with the engine room window. In order to distinguish them from the older model, they were grouped into the new class E 919. Locomotive E 91 96 was retired as early as 1943 after an accident, but not dismantled in southern Germany until after the war. Even before the end of the war, numbers E 91 95 to E 91 102 were moved to south Germany. Number E 91 104 found itself in the Dessau repair shop (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk or RAW) with bomb damage. Locomotives E 91 103, 105 and 106 also sent there in October 1945. These three engines and spare parts from the dismantled E 91 104 were sent to the Soviet Union in 1946 as part of the war reparations. After their return in 1952/53 they remained sidelined, were retired in 1962 and scrapped the following year. The war damage on E 91 95 was not repaired and it was retired in 1949. The remaining locomotives (E 91 97 - 102) remained in service with the Deutsche Bundesbahn and, like the E 91.0 engines, were modernised between 1957 and 1960. On the introduction of the DB classification scheme on 1 January 1968 they were reclassified as 191 097 - 102. Their retirement followed in 1974 (191 097, 098, 102) and 1975 (191 099 - 101). On 27 November 1975 the last locomotive of Class 191, number 191 099, was retired, but was retained as a museum locomotive. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the railway in Germany in (1985) the engine was made operational with parts from 191 100 and was able to take part in the parade of locomotives during the anniversary celebrations. But as a result of damage she had to be sidelined again. She is at present in the Augsburg Railway Park.

While useful as a broad concept or definition, it is not easy to make the category of emergency fighter clear cut, as many aircraft designs are produced under pressure in wartime, and aircraft which were hastily adapted for use as fighters may then go on to have a mainstream career. Context The crisis which gives rise to an emergency fighter may have been the sudden outbreak of war, which resulted in a country lacking sufficient fighter aircraft. This was the case for Australia at the beginning of the Pacific War in World War II; with both the UK and the USA committing its production capacity to supplying their own needs, they had to create their own indigenous design resulting in the Commonwealth Boomerang.Gunston 2001, p. 152. An emergency fighter may also have been produced to meet a need for a particular sort of fighter aircraft. For instance, Britain‚Äôs Royal Air Force used hastily converted Bristol Blenheim light bombers as twin engined heavy fighters.Lake 1998, p. 61ff. A materials shortage arising in the course of conflict may have led to experiments with new kinds of fighters, like the Finnish VL Humu, which was based on the American Brewster F2A Buffalo, but with a higher proportion of wood in its construction. Emergency fighters were also designed to a tight time scale in a crisis situation, in the hope that a new aircraft might be able to change a nation‚Äôs fortunes. Most famous of these was undoubtedly the Heinkel He 162 jet aircraft of Germany. Many examples of the emergency fighter concept date from the Second World War. In that global conflict, situations of strategic national emergency arose in several nations due to total war. At the same time, fighter design was still sufficiently simple that an aircraft designed and produced in a matter of months had some chance of being effective. Types of solution Some emergency fighters were aircraft designed for other purposes but pressed into service to meet an immediate need. In early 1942 eight Australian CAC Wirraway trainer and general purpose military aircraft were used to intercept a Japanese raid on Rabaul, with disastrous effects when all the defenders were shot down. Some Russian Sukhoi Su-2 light bombers were used as fighters during the opening days of Operation Barbarossa when nothing else was available. To meet the challenge posed by a shortage of strategic materials like the light alloys used in aircraft construction, several prototype emergency fighters were designed to use more readily available materials. For example, the British Martin-Baker MB 2 used a simple design made from steel tubes, while the VL Myrsky used much plywood. However, less strategically important materials like steel or wood tended to affect the performance of the aircraft adversely. Adaptation of existing aircraft The advantage of adapting existing aircraft was that the emergency fighter could be produced quickly. A variety of aircraft types were used: the Bristol Blenheim light bomber lacked performance in its intended role as a heavy day fighter, but found a useful niche as a strike fighter in Coastal CommandLake 1998, p. 69-75. and as a night fighter, pioneering the use of airborne intercept radar;Lake 1998, p. 63-68. the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 was occasionally used to escort other Sturmoviks on ground attack missions; and 26 British Miles Masters were produced, but never used, as the M.24 Master fighter with a single seat and six wing guns.Mondey 1982, p. 176-7. Modern attack aircraft are usually equipped to carry short-range air-to-air missiles for self- defense; some airforces because of inventory shortages will task their attack aircraft with a secondary air-to-air role, for example as with the Portuguese A-7 Corsair II squadrons. During the late 1980s and early 1990s the United Kingdom planned to use their BAe Hawk trainer aircraft as point-defence fighters. New designs Very few new emergency fighter designs progressed beyond the prototype stage. Of those that did, the Commonwealth Boomerang was probably the most successful, but even then it was most effectively used in the ground support role. The Heinkel He 162 entered mass production and even squadron service, shooting down some opponents, but its effectiveness was limited by a dire shortage of fuel in the collapsing Reich.Gunston 2001, p. 196. Other designs which did not enter service included the British Miles M.20,Mondey 1982, p. 170. which had a similar performance to the contemporary Hawker Hurricane; and the American Bell XP-77.

An emergency fighter competition was also launched to develop jet aircraft with great performance advantages over Allied aircraft. *Bachem Ba 349Gunston 2001, p. 174. *Blohm & Voss BV 40 gliderGunston 2001, p. 176. *Heinkel He 162 *Focke-Wulf Volksj√§ger Italy *Ambrosini SAI.207 *Ambrosini SAI.403 Japan *Kawasaki Ki-100 Produced as an emergency measure by adapting a Ki-61-II-KAI to carry a radial engine, the Ki-100 emerged as an outstanding fighter. *Mizuno Shinryu Soviet Union *Ilyushin Il-2 was used as an attack bomber and transport aircraft, with fighter escort.

It was difficult to obtain foreign built aircraft, so new designs were built locally. *FFVS 22 United Kingdom The crisis point for the British RAF came at the Battle of Britain, and British use of emergency fighters centres on this time. *Boulton Paul P.94 ‚Äì experimenting with a turretless Boulton Paul Defiant *Bristol Blenheim Mk IF and Mk IVF *Martin-Baker MB 2 *Miles M.20 - designed, built, and flown in 9 weeks. *Miles M.24 version of Miles Master *Percival Mew Gull racing aircraft, plans to fit pair of machine guns did not proceed *Douglas Boston bombers converted into interim night fighters United States The vast manufacturing resources of the USA, and its lack of vulnerability to invasion, meant that emergency fighters were not extensively developed. Only the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter using non-strategic materials could be considered akin to an emergency fighter.Dorr 1990, p. 126. However, the United States Navy did use the SBD Dauntless dive-bomber as combat air patrol aircraft in emergencies, including during the Battle of Coral Sea. On 8 May 1942, Pilot Stanley \\"Swede\\" Vejtasa claimed three A6M Zeroes shot down when his scouting squadron was pressed into service to defend the USS Yorktown. Assessment Very few emergency fighters entered service, and of those that did, even fewer types achieved effectiveness in operations. Two main factors can be identified for this failure: *Time Scale: Even though emergency fighters were produced to a tight time scale (the He 162 flew within 5 months of design work beginning), by the time they were ready for combat, events had usually moved on. Either the crisis had passed (as with the Miles M.20 which first flew as the Battle of Britain was being won), or it had deepened so far that rescue was impossible (as occurred with the Bachem Ba 349).Gunston 2001, p. 174. *Performance: Conversions from existing aircraft were usually inadequate as frontline fighters, although some like the Bristol Blenheim IF found useful employment elsewhere. Likewise emergency fighters which used non-strategic materials usually suffered in performance, although they could be used for other roles, like the VL Myrsky which was used for reconnaissance Sometimes the rush into production meant that the emergency fighter was positively dangerous to all but the best pilots, like the He 162.Gunston 2001, p. 196. Overall therefore it can be seen that the lack of operational effectiveness of emergency fighters stemmed from the inherent limitations of the concept.

It stars Burt Reynolds, Anne Francis, Vic Diaz, Lyle Bettger and Rodolfo Acosta.IMPASSE Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 39, Iss. 456, (Jan 1, 1972): 52.  Plot  Pat Morrison (Reynolds) runs a shady salvage operation in Manila. His latest scheme involves finding $3 million worth of gold bars hidden by the military during World War II. To this end, he needs the help of several former soldiers who were present when the gold was hidden. The first is Jesus (Vic Diaz), a Filipino muslim and Morrison's business associate. The second is Draco (Rodolfo Acosta), a hard-drinking, hot-tempered Apache living on an Indian reservation who answers Morrison's telegram with the promise of finding a wartime lover named Maria Bonita. The trio then breaks the third man, the bigoted Hansen (Lyle Bettger), out of a Filipino jail. Draco eventually manages to find Maria in a local bar, but discovers that she has grown older and gained weight. Meanwhile, Morrison rescues the captured Trev Jones (Clarke Gordon), a veteran with a heart condition who has been abducted by Wombat (Jeff Corey). With Trev's help, Morrison and company are able to figure out the gold's exact location in the Malinta Tunnel on the island of Corregidor. Along the way, Morrison falls in love with Jones's daughter Bobby (Anne Francis), a tennis champion. This complicates matters as Morrison is sleeping with Jesus's Japanese wife Mariko (Miko Mayama), a fact that Jesus discovers and confronts Morrison with. Despite their differences, the four men are able to successfully locate and retrieve the gold. However, they meet resistance in the Philippine military. A gunfight ensues that leaves Hansen dead, Draco wounded and Jesus captured. After a brief chase, Morrison finds his escape route blocked and it is revealed that a jealous Mariko had tipped authorities off to their plan. The film ends at the airport with Bobby returning to the United States and a smiling Morrison being led away in handcuffs.

He did not race for another six months as a result of arthroscopic surgery for an ankle chip. On his return to competition, Behrens won again then in July at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, won the Dwyer Stakes. In the August Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course, Behrens finished second by a nose to Deputy Commander, then in September scored a 5¬æ length win in the Pegasus Handicap at the Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey in which he beat a field that included the heavily favored Touch Gold. In that year's Breeders' Cup Classic, Behrens disappointed his backers with a seventh- place finish. At age five Behrens had his best season in racing. His wins in 1999 included the Grade I's Gulfstream Park Handicap and Oaklawn Handicap, the Grade II Suburban Handicap, plus the Massachusetts Handicap in which he defeated Real Quiet. In addition, Behrens earned second-place in the Donn Handicap, Whitney Handicap and the Jockey Club Gold Cup Stakes. However, with a chance at Horse of the Year honors he finished a dull 7th in the Breeders Cup Classic behind Cat Thief. As a six-year-old, Behrens won his second straight Grade I Gulfstream Park Handicap, was second to Dubai Millennium in the Dubai World Cup, and had seconds in the Woodward Stakes and Suburban Handicap. Behrens stood stud at Victory Rose Thoroughbreds in Vacaville, California.

The company was established in 1874 and started with horsecar operations on the Ullev√•l Hageby Line, Gamlebyen Line and the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. The network was electrified with in 1899 and 1900, whereby the company was bought by Union- Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft. It delivered new Class U trams. Within a few years the company had also opened the V√•lerenga Line and Kampen Line. It took over Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie in 1905, taking over its fleet of Class S trams and the Sagene Ring, the Vippetangen Line and the Rodel√∏kka Line. The company was based at Homansbyen Depot. From 1912 it started an extensive cooperation with its main competitor, Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES). KSS also took delivery of the Class SS trams and from 1921 the Class H trams. The company build part of the Sinsen Line in 1923. Both companies were municipalized in 1924 to become Oslo Sporveier. History Establishment Horsecars in Karl Johans gate in 1898 The first plans for horsecar operations in Oslo‚Äîthen known as Christiania‚Äîtook place in 1868, when Engineer Jens Theodor Pauldan Vogt and Architect Paul Due applied for a concession. They proposed a line from Homansbyen to Gamlebyen (then known as Oslo) with branches to Pipervika and Palaisbryggen. The municipal authorities rejected the application‚Äîciting concerns of the street being too narrow. A new application was issued in 1873 with a common section with four branches, along Drammensveien, Gamlebyen, Oslo West Station (Vestbanen) and Gr√ºnerl√∏kka. This time the municipality granted the necessary permissions. Vogt and Due's concession was transferred to a company, A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab, which was incorporated on 26 August 1874. The share capital was set to 200,000 speciedaler.Fasting: 9 The company bought a lot on Pilestredet 10,000 speciedaler, which became the site of Homansbyen Depot, including the company's administration. In its original design it had places for 44 vehicles and 116 horses, as well as a smithy, offices, apartments, a laboratory for the veterinary and a sick bay for twelve horses.Fristad: 19 The company was permitted to use tracks on top of the roads, although the municipality retained the right at any time to require them to be dug down. The company opted for standard gauge, presumably because this was most common amongst horsecars and eased procurement. Track-laying started in May 1875. Because of the location of the depot and the low traffic estimates along Drammensveien, KSS opted to instead build a branch to Homansbyen.Fasting: 12 Horsecars outside Oslo Cathedral in 1876 The first twenty-two trams arrived from John Stephenson Company on 2 September 1875. The first horses arrived nine days later. Trial runs started on 21 September and operating permit was granted on 4 October. The official opening took place the following day. Regular traffic started on 6 October, as the second horsecar system in the Nordic Countries, after Copenhagen. The original network consisted of three services: from Homansbyen to Stortorvet, from Vestbanen to Stortorvet and from Stortorvet to Oslo. The services to Vestbanen corresponded with trains, while the other two operated every ten minutes. The fares were set to 10 √∏re. Shortly after a direct service was set up from Homansbyen to Vestbanen. Horsecar operations Oslo was at the time a highly segregated community with little interaction between the higher and lower classes. Amongst the concerns of the upper classes was that the trams would become popular with the lower classes and that there would be more interaction between classes.Fristad: 12 At first there were no regular stops, the horsecar would simply lower its speed and allow people to jump on and off where they wished. This was especially important on hills to keep the momentum and not wear out the horses. The horsecar would stop for elderly passengers and those of sufficient prominence. The company took delivery of seventeen sleds for use during winter. These proved much less suitable for operations, as the horses could not pull the same load on snow as on rails. The turnover time for horses was reduced, resulting in increased headway. The company therefore decided to salt and plow the tracks and instead use the horsecars during winter.Fristad: 21 Horsecar in 1880 Profits were made immediately, and in 1877 an additional seven cars were delivered,Aspenberg: 6 allowing the headway to drop to five minutes. The company became a major retailer of used horses. These were sought after due to the good treatment they received at the company. However, if they ever walked down a street with tracks they would follow these blindly and it was difficult to get them to diverge off the route.Fristad: 20 From 1878, the fare increased to 15 √∏re for all routes.Fristad: 15 KSS opened its first extension on 18 March 1878, when the first part of the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line opened from Storgata to Thorvald Meyers gate. It was further extended to Beyer Bridge on 12 April 1879. In conjunction with this a new depot was built at Olaf Ryes plass with place for fifty horses and a number of horsecars. The Vestbanen Line was extended to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879. Once these expansions were made the company fell more into a state of operation. From 9 July 1880 all routes terminating at Stortorvet were merged, resulting in direct services from Homansbyen to Oslo and from Gr√ºnerl√∏kka to Vestbanen. This also meant that passengers no longer had to buy a new ticket for a transfer. Between 1887 and 1892 the company took delivery of seventeen new vehicles from Skabo. During the 1890s the company carried out some double tracking. The final batch of fifteen horsecars, built by Falkenried, were delivered in 1897. They were so heavy they needed to be hauled by two horses and were designed with the intension of being used as trailers for the electric trams.Fristad: 33 Opening of the electrification of the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line on 29 September 1899. Electrification Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES) became the second tramway operator in Oslo when it opened its first two electric tramway lines on 2 March 1893.Aspenberg: 7 Although the new company received a permit for two new lines, KSS retained a preferential treatment allowing priority in building later new lines.Fasting: 42 KES had significantly lower operating costs and only charged 10 √∏re for its tickets. Although only very few locations had a choice between the two companies, KSS was soon viewed as outdated and expensive.Fristad: 62 They chose to cut their ticket prices to 10 √∏re in 1896.Fristad: 27 To alleviate the situation, KSS's board approved plans in December 1897 for electrify their network. Meanwhile, the board decided to convert its entire network to double track. As tracks for an electric tramway had to be designed to allow for return current, an all-new trackage would have to be laid. These plans were approved by the annual meeting on 17 January 1898. The company both needed a supplier and capital, and struck a deal with Union-Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft, who would deliver the new infrastructures and trams, and also provided capital through purchasing a majority stake in the company. There was a general understanding for the conversion in the public, although there were many protests against installing overhead lines in Karl Johans gate. Class U tram hauling a converted horsecar trailer at Homansbyen Depot in 1905 The first section which was electrified was from Munkedamsveien to Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, on 29 September 1899.Aspenberg: 10 The same day the line was extended to Torshov.Fristad: 34 The Homansbyen and Oslo Lines were electrified on 17 November,Fristad: 137 except for the section from Oslo Hospital to St Halvards plass, which had to be hauled by horses until 15 January 1900.Fristad: 35 This work required the delivery of new electrical trams. Forty-seven Class U units were delivered in 1899, with electrical equipment from Union and bodies built by Falkenried and Linke-Hofmann-Busch. Thirty-eight horsecars were converted to trailers.Aspenberg: 45 The company continued the work by opening the V√•lerenga Line on 3 May. The Kampen Line opened on 6 June. Both of these were branches of the Gamlebyen Line.Fristad: 138 This resulted in a major restructuring of the routes, with five lines each running on a ten-minute headway. The Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line was the next to be expanded. Unlike the rest, it was financed by the municipalities of Kristiania and Aker, and was the first of KSS's lines to run outside the Kristiania's municipal borders.Fristad: 37 It opened in two stages, to Sandaker on 2 October 1901 to Grefsen Station on 28 November 1902. A converted Class S tram in 1915, inherited from KKS Consolidation By 1897 the Liberal Party had received a majority in the municipal council. The party had as part of its program stated that it wanted to municipalize the tramway operations. That year there was a political debate regarding an expansion of the KSS' tramway towards St. Hanshaugen and Sagene, two areas which were being developed. KSS applied to build a tramway there, but on 23 September 1897 the municipal council voted to establish its own tram company, Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie (KKS), and build a line to St. Hanshaugen Sagene itself.Fasting: 52 This resulted in three new lines. Sagene Ring opened in November 1899.Faster: 56Fristad: 45 The Rodel√∏kka Line, which opened in January 1900, used the lower section of the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka Line to reach the city center. The Vippetangen Line was completed in August. However, none of the three lines connected with each other and KKS had to lease track from KSS.Fasting: 58 KSS had a concession which expired in 1905, at which time the municipality could purchase the company at par value. This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS.Fasting: 64 In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK 2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK 1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, it was estimated that the municipality would make more money by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK 3 million for the period in question. The decisive municipal council meeting was held on 14 April 1905, although the actual vote did not occur until 02:00 hours the following day, after a nine-hour debate.Fasting: 65 The Conservative majority voted in favor of selling KKS to KSS and extending the latter's concession to 1924.Fasting: 66 Tram hauling open Skabo trailer outside Sagene Church on Sagene Ring With the takeover KSS required not only three lines, but also a fleet of twenty Class S motorized trams and twelve trailers. It also took over two depots. Sagene Depot was kept, while Rodel√∏kka Depot was closed.Aspenberg: 38 This resulted in new, mixed services: Homansbyen‚ÄìOslo, Homansbyen‚ÄìSannergata, Munkedamsveien‚ÄìSannergata‚ÄìGrefsen, Munkedamsveien‚ÄìV√•lerenga, Sagene‚ÄìSt. Hanshaugen‚ÄìKampen, St. Hanshaugen‚ÄìRodel√∏kka and Stortorvet‚ÄìVippetangen.Aspenberg: 11 The Vippetangen Line was completed to Vippetangen on 8 November 1905. Coordinated operations The next extension took place on 24 September 1909, when the Homansbyen Line was extended to Adamstuen.Fristad: 140 In January 1910 the company introduced line numbers of its services. KES had done this a few months earlier and taken the first three digits, so KSS numbered their lines 4 through 10.Fristad: 51 From 1912 the two companies started to cooperate closely with their routes. This first materialized in a connecting line in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Homansbyen Line to reach the Briskeby Line and Majorstuen. At Skillebekk a connection was built through Munkedamsveien, allowing the Vestbanen Line access to the Sk√∏yen Line. The third connection opened in 1915, linking Jernbanetorget to the Kampen Line and the V√•lerenga Line through a connection along Vognmannsgata, Brugata and Vaterland Bridge, allowing trams from there to serve Oslo East Station.Fristad: 52 The one tram built by J. G. Brill Company, depicted in 1922 The second generation of electric trams, Class SS, were delivered in 1913 and 1914. The thirty-seven trams were significantly larger due innovations allowing longer wheelbases. By 1915 the street tram network consisted of thirteen services, of which two were operated by KES and six were joint operations. The joint services were operated the relative number of trams in proportion of the ownership of trackage along the line and where each company simply kept the revenue it created on their services.Fristad: 54 The first women conductors were hired in 1916.Fasting: 83 The Stephenson and Skabo horsecar trailers were taken out of service in 1917 and 1918. Sixteen were sold to the Bergen Tramway and the Trondheim Tramway.Aspenberg: 39 Homansbyen Depot in 1922 From the company's opening it had charged 10 √∏re for a ride, but this was raised to 15 √∏re in 1918, a price which would remain unaltered for the rest of its history.Fristad: 64 To ease management of such an odd amount, token coins were popular. They were sold with a quantity discount and were commonly used in Oslo as a conventional coin worth 15 √∏re.Fristad: 65 During this period the country was experiencing inflation. KES and the labor union could not reach an agreement for wage increases and the company was hit by a strike from 11 January to 22 March 1920. It was resolved through the municipality offering to reduce its charges.Fasting: 89 As part of the agreement, the 5 √∏re commuter prices in the morning and afternoon were abolished. The last batch of trams were delivered from 1921 and 1923. On 1 February 1923 a branch the Rodel√∏kka Line, the Sinsen Line, was built to Carl Berners plass.Fristad: 139 The company's last extension took place on 18 December 1923, when the V√•lerenga Line was extended to Bryn. Ekebergbanen trams at Stortorvet in 1923 Municipalization KES and KSS both had concessions which expired on the same date, in March 1924. At this point the municipality was free to purchase the companies at par value. A municipal committee was appointed in 1922 to look into the matter. KES was valuated at NOK 9 million, while KSS was worth NOK 12.5 million. The committees majority proposed a merger and that KSS received a prolonged concession, while the minority recommended that the tramways be bought by the city. A third option, a jointly public and privately owned company, was also proposed, where the municipality would own fifty-one percent.Fasting: 91 The issue was considered by the council's executive board, which supported the joint public‚Äìprivate proposal with eleven against nine votes. The argumentation was largely ideological: the left side accused the right for bringing economic advantages for private investors, while the right accused the left of insufficient financial investigations of municipal operations. The issue was voted on in the municipal council in December, with 43 against 41 councillors supporting the joint model. The latter were members of the Communist Party and the Labor Party, who both were in favor of a municipal take-over. The new company, Kristiania Sporveier, was incorporated in May 1924 and took over all street tram operations. The city changed its name to Oslo on 1 January 1925, as did the tram company.Fasting: 92 Network A map of the tram network in 1939. Green lines denote KSS lines as of 1924, yellow lines those which were built by KES KSS operated a network of tramway throughout most of eastern and northern Oslo. Through the city center it followed Karl Johans gate to Stortorvet, its hub. To the east the lines ran concurrently to Kirkeristen, where the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line split from the Oslo Line (later name the Gamlebyen Line). The latter ran through Gr√∏nland along Vognmannsgata and Schweigaards gate. The Oslo Line proper ran through Oslogate to St. Halvards plass and onwards to Oslo Hospital in Gamlebyen (at the time known as Oslo). From here the suburban Ekeberg Line, operated by Ekebergbanen continued southwards. Two lines branched off from the Oslo Line. The Kampen Line ran along Motzfeldts gate, Jens Bjelsens gate, T√∏yengata, Hagagata and Brinkens gate to Kampen, Norway. Further down the V√•lerenga Line branched off at Schweigaards gate and continued along it, St. Halvards gate, V√•lerengagata and Etterstadgata. The Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line branches off from the Oslo Line at Brugata and ran further north along Storgata and then Thorvald Mayersgata through Gr√ºnerl√∏kka. It then continues along Vogs gate and Sandakerveien through Torshov. At Storo it turns off onto Storoveien to Grefsen Station, a mainline railway station on the Gj√∏vik Line. From Nybrua the Rodel√∏kka Line branched off along Trondheimsveien and then followed Helgesens gate, Rathkes gate, Verksgata, K√∏benhavngata to the intersection at D√¶lenenggata. It served the neighborhoods of Rodel√∏kka and D√¶lenenga. The Sinsen Line continued along Trondheimsveien until Carl Berners plass. Class U tram after it crashed through the wall at Torshov Depot To the west the line split northwards and southwards after running west along Karl Johans gate. The southern route, the Vestbanen Line, followed Rosenkrantz' gate to Oslo West Station, through Engens gate to Munkedamsveien. It ran along it to Cort Adlers gate, Huitfeldts gate and Larssons gate to Parkveien. From there it followed Munkedamsveien to Skillebekk, where it connected to KES's Sk√∏yen Line. North from Karl Johans gate the Homansbyen Line (today the Ullev√•l Line) ran along Hedgehaugsveien, Pilestredet and Thereses gate to Adamstuen. Sagene Ring took off from Athen√¶um in Akersgata and ran northwards along Colletts gate, Geitemyrsveien and Kierschouws gate through the neighborhoods of St. Hanshaugen and Sagene. From there it ran across Bentse Bridge to connect with the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line at Torshov. Homansbyen Depot was constructed with a building housing the company's administrative office, horse stables, a wagon depot, a forge, and a weighing shed. These installations were designed by the Norwegian architect Henrik Thrap-Meyer.Fasting: 19 It was expanded in conjunction with the electrification.Hartmann & Mangset: 52 KSS had a depot at Gr√ºnerl√∏kka from 1880 to 1899. When it then extended the line to Torshov, it built a new depot there and closed the one at Gr√ºnerl√∏kka.Aspenberg: 36 KSS took over Sagene Depot and Rodel√∏kka Depot with the KKS takeover, but the latter was immediately closed.Aspenberg: 37 The company's final depot opening took place in 1922, when it opened V√•lerenga Depot. Rolling stock Heritage KSS horsecar in 1975 During its period of horsecar operations, KSS took delivery of 57 units. These are subdivided into three classes, each manufactured by a different company and with distinct specifications. After the closing of the horsecar network, thirty-eight units were converted to trailers for electric trams. The first class was built by John Stephenson Company and consisted of twenty-nine units delivered in 1875 and 1877. They were long and wide. They weighed and were bidirectional, allowing seating for fourteen seated passengers. The second class consisted of fourteen units delivered by Skabo between 1887 and 1892. These were delivered in various configurations of open and closed seating and were normally only operated during winter. They had the same dimensions as the Stephenson cars. The final class, built by Falkenried, consisted of fifteen units delivered in 1897. Measuring in length, they were sufficiently heavy they needed to be hauled by two horses. This was a calculated choice, as they were primarily intended to be used as trailers for the electric trams. Heritage Class SS tram in KSS's green livery The first electric trams were forty-seven Class U trams delivered in 1899. The electrical components were built by Union-Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft and the bodies by Falkenried and Skabo. The trams had two GE52 motors with a combined power output of and had a total weight of . They were long and were built with open platform bays. Each unit had capacity for twenty seated and fourteen standing passengers. The company inherited twenty trams and twelve trailers in the KKS takeover. These had an identical long and body with wooden exterior paneling. KKS ordered the trams from Schukert & Co., who built the electrical and technical equipment, while the bodies were built by Busch. They features outdoor bays for the motorman and a cabin with wooden benches in the longitudinal direction. All units had seating for twenty passengers. The motorized vehicles had seating for fourteen, while the trailer had seating for twenty. Class H tram, rebuilt from an old Class S, during trial runs in 1923 KSS took delivery of thirty-seven Class SS motorized trams and twenty-two trailers between 1912 and 1914. They had electrical components from Siemens- Schukertwerke and were variously built by Falkenried and Skabo. Their main innovation was that the wheelbase was increased from , allowing for a lengthening of the body. They were long and had a power output of . Class H was the final series delivered to KSS. Due to inflation in Germany they were cheap and were mostly bought to allow smaller units to retire. KSS bought seventeen new trams, electrical equipment for seventeen and thirty-four new trailers. The electrical equipment was used to rebuild and expand existing trams, particularly Class S units. One unit was bought from J. G. Brill Company with General Electric motors. The rest were bought from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik with electrical equipment from Siemens-Schukertwerke. The trams were long and weight between . They sat twenty-four passengers. Four horsecars, ten motorized trams and four trailers have been preserved by Oslo Tramway Museum.

Mani Ram Bagri (1 January 1920 ‚Äì 31 January 2012) was an Indian parliamentarian and political activist. He served three terms in the Indian Parliament, first from 1962 to 1967, and then again from 1977 to 1984. He belonged to the league of parliamentary opposition socialists like Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Known widely throughout North India during his tenure as the \\"de facto\\" Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Bagri was widely considered to be one of the most prolific Socialist leaders of his time. He was party to the nation's international visits to the USSR, including the summit that led to the Tashkent Declaration, as well as the Warsaw Pact socialist republics in the 1960s. He is also notable for being the first speaker to address the International Parliamentary Conference in Hindi, his mother tongue. Early life and education, 1920-1947 Mani Ram Bagri was born in the village of Ban Mandori, Hissar District, Haryana (erstwhile Panjab) on 1 January 1920. He participated in various national movements at a very young age and joined the Socialist movement led by Acharya Narendra Deva, Jayaprakash Narayan and Dr Rammanohar Lohia. Little is documented about his formative years, as he did not graduate from higher-level institutions. During his 20s, he developed a close friendship with Lohia, and the two remained allies both politically and personally, for the rest of their lives. Political career Bagri was the undisputed leader of the Socialist parliamentary party during 1962‚Äì67, when Rammanohar Lohia entered the Lok Sabha through a by-election from Farukhabad. Mani Ram Bagri participated in and led various socialist movements. A close associate of late Dr Lohia and Raj Narain, he was also detained during Emergency under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, and allegedly subject to sleep deprivation, mental harassment and a poor diet while imprisoned with other prominent Socialist leaders. Mani Ram Bagri was General Secretary of the All India Samyukta Socialist Party (Lohiavadi) during 1972‚Äì74, and alter of Janata Party (S). He represented Hisar and Mathura constituencies in the Indian Parliament. A three time Parliamentarian, he was a member of the 3rd Lok Sabha (2 April 1962 ‚Äì 3 March 1967) as a Socialist member from Hisar (then part of Punjab state), the 6th Lok Sabha (23 March 1977 ‚Äì 22 August 1979) as a Janata party member from Mathura (Uttar Pradesh) and the 7th Lok Sabha (10 January 1980 ‚Äì 31 December 1984) as a Janata (S) member again from Hissar (Haryana). Ch. Bagri at his home, early 1970s In the 1960s. he and his team of socialists were invited to the Socialist Republic of Romania and to observe the proceedings of the Politburo. He remained close allies with Moscow, however, he disapproved of the indiscriminate Communist authoritarian state established there. He also represented India at the Tashkent Agreement following the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, one of the few Opposition leaders present. Bagri officially retired from politics in the late 1980s, following the demise of Indira Gandhi and the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, in which he played an active part in preventing harm from coming to innocent Sikh civilians in Delhi and Hisar. Ideology and methods Having risen from a very poor family, Bagri spent most of his life fighting for the underprivileged sections of the Indian society. His methods of doing so are generally described as Gandhian. He had joined politics at a young age and devoted his entire life to the poor's rights. He was a hardcore socialist and demanded the word of other Non-Congress parties in the government and this attitude earned him the honour of being the first Leader Of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Bagri is widely regarded across party lines as having been a politician with impeccable integrity and ethics. He was renowned for living a frugal lifestyle and used to donate a large amount of his salary to the poor around Hissar, Delhi, amongst other such towns. Bagri was held in utmost esteem by successive Prime Ministers of India including Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. Despite representing a brand of socialist ideology often opposed to Congress' policies, Bagri shared a deep personal bond with Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. Bagri played a pivotal role in shaping the nascent democracy in India, and gave a voice to millions of villagers, the poor and the downtrodden and represented their aspirations. He led many movements in North India championing the cause of the poor and the oppressed and is considered a major force in giving these weaker sections of society self-belief. Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, Mani Ram Bagri, Madhu Limay, S M Joshi Mr Bagri was an excellent communicatorFrom Jawaharlal Nehru to Mani Ram Bagri, India has never lacked for great communicators in its politics. http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edit/one-nation-under-the-same- satellite-feed.html and a brilliant orator. One of Mr. Bagri's famous speeches in Parliament related to nationalization of Birla House which was owned by the Birla family. As the government was not very keen on this, Mr. Bagri being his usual fiery self thundered: Despite his rivalry between the Congress Leaders, he maintained a cordial relationship with prominent leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. He officially retired from politics in the late 1980s as the Indira Gandhi government slowly dissolved. He outlived most of his league-in-arms and spent the rest of his life at his residence in Hissar, and the chowk in which it is located is, till date, known in his honour as Bagri Chowk. Bagri, ailing for the past few years, died in Hissar on 31 January 2012 at the age of 92 years. Ramdhari Singh, Madhu Limay, Mani Ram Bagri, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, B P Maurya,S M Joshi Sh.

A multinational military force, representing the Eight-Nation Alliance, rescued a besieged population of foreign nationals in the city of Tientsin (Pinyin: Tianjin) by defeating the Chinese Imperial army and Boxers. The capture of Tientsin gave the Eight- Nation Alliance a base to launch a rescue mission for the foreign nationals besieged in the Legation Quarter of Peking (Pinyin: Beijing) and to capture Beijing in the Battle of Peking (1900). The region of Tientsin (now called Tianjin) and Peking (now Beijing).  Background  Tientsin, in 1900, consisted of two adjacent, but very different sub-divisions. To the northwest was the ancient high-walled Chinese city, on each side. To the southeast, one to two miles away (3 km), along the Hai River, was the treaty port and foreign settlements, a half-mile wide . About one million Chinese lived within the walled city or in satellite communities outside the wall. In the foreign settlements resided 700 foreign civilians, mostly European merchants and missionaries, along with tens of thousands of Chinese servants, employees, and businessmen. Among the civilians living in the foreign settlement were Herbert Hoover, a future president of the United States, and his wife Lou Henry Hoover. A low mud wall, less than , surrounded at a distance of several hundred yards (half km) both the higher walls of the old city and the foreign settlements.Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1909, p. 98 books.google.com In early June 1900, in response to the growing threat of the Boxers (Militia United in Righteousness, Yihetuan), which was a militant, anti-foreign and anti-Christian peasant movement, six countries with interests in China sent 2,400 troops to Tientsin to guard the foreign settlements. Another 2,000 were with Admiral Seymour along the railway line between Tientsin and Peking, attempting to march to Peking to protect the foreign community there. The allied military force was composed of soldiers, sailors, and marines from Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. With so many nationalities among the Allied force, no overall commander was appointed. Leadership was collective.  Siege  The walled (Chinese) city of Tientsin, at the center of this map, was one mile (half km) square. The foreign concessions are shown on the far right, just inside the low mud wall that surrounds Tientsin and environs. The Americans, British, and Japanese attacked the walled city from the south; the Russians from the east. Thousands of Boxers from the countryside converged upon Tientsin, and on June 15, 1900, they rampaged through the walled city destroying Christian churches and killing Chinese Christians. On June 16, a mob of partially armed Boxers advanced on the foreign settlement. They were driven off by volleys of fire from the defenders.Preston, Diana. The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners that Shook the World in the Summer of 1900. New York: Berkley Books, January 2001, p. 107. The Chinese army near Tientsin stood by and awaited orders from Peking to either support the Boxers or protect the foreigners. As a result of the June 17 attack by the foreign armies on the Dagu Forts, the Qing government of China took the side of the Boxers and ordered the army to attack the foreign settlements. The Chinese began bombarding the foreign settlement with artillery on June 17. The Western and Japanese soldiers defending the foreign settlements were initially stretched thin, and all communication with the coast and the allied fleet was cut off for several days.Thompson, pp. 98‚Äì100 The Chinese army numbered an estimated 15,000 in Tientsin plus Boxers armed with swords, spears, and antique guns, although the number of Boxer combatants was diminishing rapidly as the movement was fading back into the countryside from where it came. The army were led by general Nieh Shih-ch'eng, who was considered one of the ablest Chinese officers. Most of the Chinese army action against the foreign settlements consisted of a daily artillery barrage. The army fired an estimated 60,000 artillery shells at the foreign settlements. However, most of the shells failed to explode on impact due to inefficiency and corruption in the Chinese ammunition factories and did less damage than might otherwise have been expected. On June 21, 1900, some 131 US Marines and 400 Russians made a desperate attempt to reinforce Tientsin by following the railway from the coast to the city. Only two miles from the city they were ambushed by the Chinese and forced to retire, the Americans losing 3 killed and 13 wounded. Additional Western soldiers were unloaded from ships offshore and rushed up the railroad to Tientsin. Five thousand reinforcements reached Tientsin on June 23 to augment the hard-pressed soldiers and civilians defending the foreign settlements. Their arrival caused the Chinese to withdraw from their position on the east which enabled the besieged to establish a tenuous line of communication and supply along the railroad to the coast, away. The Chinese army continued to besiege three sides of the Tientsin foreign settlements.See the report by U. S. Consul Ragsdale on the \\"Siege of Tientsin\\" in U. S. For. Rel, 1900, pp. 268‚Äì273. On June 26, a force of 2,000 sallied from the settlements and rescued Admiral Seymour and his 2,000 men who were surrounded six miles (10 km) out of the city. With Seymour's men they returned to the settlements without opposition. Most of Seymour's force of sailors returned to their ships. Reinforced, and with their supply line to the coast secured, the coalition of allied soldiers in the foreign settlement began planning an assault on the walled city of Tientsin to defeat the Chinese army and open the road to Peking and the relief of the Siege of the International Legations.Bodin, Lynn The Boxer Rebellion. London: Osprey Publishing, 1979, p. 15 Nie Shicheng and Ma Yukun commanded the forces against the Alliance, raining precise and intense ordnance against the Tientsin concessions. The losses suffered by the Alliance in battle was mainly due to artillery bombardment since the Chinese army carried it out with extreme precision and in a superb manner. They hid well, employed good bulwarks of defense by utilizing the landscape and went on the offensive in a dauntless manner and would continue battling until the end.  Battle  Chinese woodblock. Bodies thrown into the sky as Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops attack Western forces at Tianjin. The allies had underestimated the capability of the Chinese forces at the beginning of the siege, thinking that foreign troops could easily brush aside Chinese forces. They turned out to be wrong, in the face of fierce Chinese resistance. On July 13, 1900, the allied force to assault the walled city of Tientsin consisted of about 6,900 soldiers: 2,500 Russians, 2,000 Japanese, 900 Americans, 800 British, 600 French, and 100 Germans and Austrians.Landor, A. Henry Savage. China and the Allies. New York: Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1901, pp. 181‚Äì182. The challenge was substantial. The walls of Tientsin were high and thick. The Chinese had about 12,000 soldiers within the city or in nearby forts. They were well-armed with artillery, machine guns, and modern rifles. To reach the city wall, the allied troops would have to cross more than a mile (2 km) of flat, unwooded terrain, dotted with farmhouses and swamps and crossed by canals and causeways.Thompson, pp. 130-131; Fleming p. 163. An American soldier surveying the scene said that \\"had a formidable enemy defended the Chinese position the attacking column would have been annihilated.\\"Daggett, A. S. America in the China Relief Expedition. Kansas City, MO: Hudson-Kimberly, 1903, p. 28 The plan of the allies was to storm the city on two sides: British, American, Japanese and French troops would attack the South Gate; Russian and German troops would attack the East Gate. Herbert Hoover, who was based in the city as a mining engineer, agreed to guide the Allied forces through the local terrain. Early in the morning of 13 June 13, 1900, Hoover with the US Marines guided the three columns of British, American, Japanese and French troops to the approaches to the South Gate. When the lead troops came under fire, Hoover was permitted to withdraw from the action and return to Tientsin where the civilian population was waiting to be evacuated to the Taku (Dagu) Forts. However, Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, remained in Tientsin to care for the wounded.Hoover, Herbert. The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover, Years of Adventure, 1874‚Äì1920. New York and London: Hollis and Carter, 1952, p. 53; Max Boot (2003). The savage wars of peace: small wars and the rise of American power. Da Capo. p. 86-88. . () The attack went poorly for the Allies in large part due to the lack of overall command. Miscommunication and uncoordinated movements plagued the attackers. The main effort against the South Gate became pinned down in an exposed position under Chinese fire from within the city. The Chinese again unleashed a torrent of fire upon the Allies. The allied troops were forced to lie face down in mud. The uniform of the American troops, dark blue, provided a virtual bulls eye to the Chinese troops, equipped with western firearms, such as Winchesters, Mausers, Mannlichers. Severe losses were inflicted on the Allies. Captain David Beatty noted the British forces took cover in an entirely exposed location. Similarly, the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment was exposed to fire from Chinese sharpshooters as it attacked from the left, right across open ground. The regiment's commander, Colonel Emerson H. Liscum was fatally shot as he rushed to take the flags after the regiment's standard-bearer fell. His dying words were, \\"Keep up the fire, men!\\" The allied troops were held down in the mud by the constant Chinese fire. Herbert Hoover led American Marines to assist the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and they hit a swamp where Chinese guns murderously targeted them. The Chinese kept the guns firing for over five hours, until nightfall. Bullets were described as \\"hail\\", and guns provided a \\"death tattoo\\". In this nianhua, created by an anonymous artist who did not view the event, there is a depiction of the Boxers bombarding Tianjin in June 1900, and Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops attacking the British Admiral Seymour and his expeditionary force. The Japanese General Fukushima Yasumasa, who had fought against the Chinese previously, warned Allied commander Dorwood that Chinese forces would fight to the death if trapped, but if they left an escape route of two gates open, the Chinese would retreat. Eventually the attacks were called off. The Japanese soldiers attempted to blast away the South Gate but the defenders continued to simply cut or extinguish the fuses. At 3:00am the following morning the Japanese finally succeeded. A soldier volunteered to brave the enemy fire and light a short fuse. The soldier was killed in the explosion but succeeded in breaching the gate. Japanese soldiers charged through the open gate and entered the city, followed by the British and American soldiers. The Russians renewed their attack on the East Gate and broke through, causing the remaining Imperial Chinese soldiers to withdraw from the city. Once inside the city the Allied soldiers became disorganized and some engaged in looting. The Japanese executed suspected Boxers by beheading them. After General Nie was killed and Generals Ma and Song retreated, only Dong Fuxiang remained with his Muslim troops to combat the advancing forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance from Tientsin to Peking.  Casualties  For the Eight-Nation Alliance, Tientsin was the bloodiest battle of the Boxer Rebellion. Two hundred and fifty soldiers of the allied armies were killed and about 500 wounded. The Japanese lost 320 killed and wounded; the Russians and Germans 140 killed and wounded; the Americans 25 killed, and 98 wounded; the British, 17 killed and 87 wounded; and the French 13 killed and 50 wounded. Casualties for the Chinese Army and the Boxers are unknown.Thompson, pp 130, 138 Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops fighting Allied forces at Beicang outside of Tianjin  Aftermath  After the victory at Tientsin, the foreign soldiers decided that the advance on Peking should be delayed until sufficient forces were collected. This was largely on account of the changed opinions regarding Chinese valor and the effectiveness of their resistance to the Seymour expedition. As it was, the Allies would have tarried at Tientsin for additional reinforcements some weeks longer had not the British and American commanders threatened to proceed alone with their contingents and risk the consequences. Although it was felt, so had the estimation of Chinese prowess been increased, that at least 50,000 troops were necessary, some thought 70,000, successfully to invade the interior, the second relief expedition to Peking finally got under way, August 4, with an impressive total of 18,800 men. This number included 8,000 Japanese, 3,000 British, 4,500 Russians, 2,500 Americans, and 800 French. The Germans were unrepresented, as it was judged best to reserve some strength for Kiaochau and the coast, in case of trouble there.

Born Antonio Jacques de Almeida Santos in Neuilly-sur-Seine near Paris, his father was the financier Baron de Almeida Santos of Lisbon, his mother was the former Barbara Tapper of Highland Park near Chicago. His godfather was pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Early years De Almeida was born in Neully-sur-Seine. As a child he studied piano, showing great musical talent (although he admitted he was not an exceptional pianist). In the early 1940s, he taught himself to play the clarinet by listening to recordings of Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw. When his family moved to Buenos Aires he studied with Alberto Ginastera, and he had the opportunity to hear performances conducted by notable European refugees at the Teatro Col√≥n.Wimbush, R. Here and There ‚Äì Antonio de Almeida. Gramophone, September 1969, p376. He studied nuclear chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Leading a student orchestra there, he realized he was more interested in music than in science. His godfather, pianist Artur Rubinstein, convinced him to give up his full scholarship at M.I.T. He attended Yale University, where he studied musical theory with Paul Hindemith. He received his Bachelor of Music degree at Yale in 1949. He took conducting courses with Sergei Koussevitzky and Leonard Bernstein at the Tanglewood Music Center, and also studied conducting with George Szell. During his student days, he played first horn at Tufts College, first bassoon at Harvard, oboe with the Wellesley Orchestra, clarinet at MIT and the cello at Yale. Conducting He began conducting for Portuguese Radio in Lisbon in 1949, and soon after was appointed to his first conducting post at the Oporto Symphony Orchestra. While there, he invited Thomas Beecham to guest conduct the orchestra. He was the conductor of the Portuguese Radio in Lisbon (1957‚Äì1960) and Stuttgart Philharmonic (1962‚Äì1964). He gave the Paris premiere of Il Trittico at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1964, and worked at the Op√©ra National de Paris from 1965 to 1967. He was principal guest conductor of the Houston Symphony (1969‚Äì1971) and then music director of the Orchestre philharmonique de Nice (1971‚Äì1978). He gave the Argentinian premiere of Mahler's 7th Symphony in Buenos Aires. He became the music director of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra in 1993, a position he held at his death. His American debut came in November 1960 with the opening of the eighth subscription season of New York's American Opera Society at The Town Hall. He led the Symphony of the Air in a concert version of Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. New York Times reviewer Harold C. Schonberg wrote of the conductor \\"He knows his business. Cool, not flamboyant of gesture, capable, he held the performance together as nicely as one would desire\\". He also wrote that \\"Mr. de Almeida is a conductor to watch\\". Recording He made numerous recordings, specializing in French operas such as Ambroise Thomas' Mignon and Hamlet, and Fromental Hal√©vy's La Juive. His recordings were instrumental in restoring compositions of Ernest Chausson, Henri Duparc, Florent Schmitt and Jules Massenet to the active repertory. He recorded ballet music from the operas of Gaetano Donizetti, Gioachino Rossini, and Giuseppe Verdi. With the Moscow Symphony he recorded orchestral works of, among others, Charles Tournemire, Henri Sauguet, and Gian Francesco Malipiero. He recorded for many labels, including Columbia, EMI, Erato, Naxos, Philips, RCA and Supraphon. Musicology An interest in the works of Jacques Offenbach began in the 1950s, and by the 1970s Almeida was known as an authority. He made numerous discoveries including previously unknown arias and a second-act finale for La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein. He prepared editions of Offenbach's operas, and compiled a Thematic Catalogue of the Works of Jacques Offenbach. He became co-artistic director (with H.C. Robbins Landon) of the Haydn Foundation in 1968. Under the Foundation's auspices, he recorded a set of Joseph Haydn's symphonies. He also edited a complete set of Luigi Boccherini's symphonies for Doblinger in Vienna. Personal life He was married to Lynn Erdman in 1953, their marriage ending in divorce in 1988. The couple had two sons (Antonio de Almeida Santos and Lawrence d'Almeida) and a daughter (Cecilia de Almeida Frachesen). His son Antonio, a Juilliard and Academy of Vocal Arts trained opera singer, worked as classical record producer and served as a producer and engineer for some of the conductor's Moscow Symphony recordings. Despite his Portuguese/American parentage, he declared his nationality to be French, and he remained a citizen of France throughout his life. He spoke six languages fluently, and was well versed in Greek and Latin. He died of liver and lung cancer on 18 February 1997, age 69, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Produced by Westward Television to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the event, it nevertheless focuses on the voyage's most controversial aspect, the execution of the gentleman Thomas Doughty for mutiny. The film has only been aired twice: once in the UK on 28 December 1980, and once in the US, on Masterpiece Theatre, 27 March 1983.  Plot  The film opens with Drake's return from his voyage of circumnavigation. He is nervous about how he will be received at home, and rightly so, for he has executed Thomas Doughty, an influential courtier, investor in the voyage, and formerly, his closest friend. The story is mostly told in flashback as Drake recounts the circumstances of the voyage to Queen Elizabeth I. Although it is clear how Drake interprets the events that led to Doughty's execution, the depicted scenes paint a more ambiguous tale. Conflict between Drake and Doughty grows due to an escalating pattern of Drake's increasing autocracy and paranoia, and Doughty's underhanded means to regain the authority he sees as rightly his due. John Thaw as Francis Drake Before the fleet leaves Plymouth, Drake learns that someone has betrayed the news of the voyage to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Drake is upset as the destination of the venture - to raid Spanish ships in Peru and return home via a route theorized by John Dee called \\"the Straits of Anian\\" - is top secret, known only to Drake, Doughty, the Queen and a few select insiders. Drake has told the crew they will be voyaging to Alexandria on a trade mission. Tension is high when the truth is revealed. A few of Drake's crewmen are discontent at being tricked into a long, dangerous voyage; Doughty has second thoughts and tries to convince Drake to redirect the fleet to less uncertain plunder on the Spanish Main. Drake is resolute, but alienates his former friend through his high- handedness. Doughty believes that his investment, his advocacy of the venture at court, and his command of the soldiers accompanying the fleet, entitle him to equal command. The fleet encounters the Santa Maria, a Portuguese vessel. Upon its capture, Drake induces the cooperation of its captain and navigator, Nuno da Silva, who has an extensive knowledge of the coastline of Brazil. Hostilities escalate when Drake reprimands one of Doughty's officers for stealing from a Portuguese prisoner. Doughty is given command of the prize ship. Drake's ship, the Pelican, immediately falls victim to a number of misfortunes including a lack of wind and an outbreak of scurvy. Doughty's ship is nowhere to be found. Drake becomes increasingly paranoid, attributing the misfortunes to Doughty's betrayal and his interest in the occult. Upon the reunion of the ships, Doughty continues to agitate for what he perceives is his due: co-equal status in directing the fleet. He has a final confrontation with Drake, who strikes him and has him bound to the mast of the Pelican. The film climaxes at the scene of Doughty's execution at San Juli√°n. Drake brings Doughty to trial, accusing him of mutiny and witchcraft. Encouraged by his nephew, Drake induces the ship's carpenter, Ned Bright, to perjure himself in order to assure the conviction. Drake manipulates the men into sentencing Doughty to death. The chaplain, Francis Fletcher, tries to persuade Doughty to confess his sins, but the gentleman protests his innocence until the end. He takes communion with Drake and goes resolutely to his death. Drake then makes a speech promising the men wealth beyond their wildest dreams, but the gentlemen adventurers and the mariners must settle their differences. He changes the name of the Pelican to the Golden Hind, in hopes of placating Sir Christopher Hatton, Doughty's former employer. Thomas Doughty's Last Confession Drake's successful exploits of plunder and subsequent return to England are covered almost incidentally. One disturbing scene involves the abandonment of the navigator Nuno da Silva on the shores of Mexico. Drake knows that da Silva will certainly fall into the hands of the Spanish Inquisition, yet is unwilling for a Portuguese national to see the Straits of Anian. The treatment of da Silva is extremely upsetting to the crew, including Drake's nephew, who formerly idolized his uncle. Drake cannot find Anian, and so returns home the long way, by going completely around the globe. After hearing Drake's story, Elizabeth, clearly interested in the riches which Drake has won, grants him her full protection from Doughty's friends and from the Spanish king, who has demanded his execution. She cynically informs him that if he had not succeeded, he would be as good as dead for the execution of Doughty. The film ends with Drake's knighthood, a triumph that seems oddly hollow due to the strained reaction shots of some of the surviving characters including Drake's nephew and the preacher, Francis Fletcher.  Production  According to actor Paul Darrow, Drake's Venture was Westward Television's attempt to justify its franchise renewal. The subject matter was especially appropriate since Westward's logo was the Golden Hind. The attempt failed; ironically, the news that the south-west franchise was given to TSW (Television South West) was made during a commercial break during the lone showing of Drake's Venture in Britain. What little we know of the production is from Darrow's autobiography, You're Him, Aren't You?. In it, he remarks that the filming took three months, using a full-scale authentic replica of the Golden Hind. The ocean scenes were filmed on the English Channel; the location shooting for San Julian was at Slapton Sands in Devon. According to Darrow, the sea was rough and Michael Irving, the actor who played Leonard Vicary, became so ill he had to be hospitalized, of necessity reducing his role in the film.

According to steaming method, sirutteok is subdivided into two groups: seolgitteok (ÏÑ§Í∏∞Îñ°) and kyeotteok (ÏºúÎñ°). Seolgitteok---also called muritteok (Î¨¥Î¶¨Îñ°)---is regarded as the most basic form of sirutteok and is made only with rice. \\"Kyeotteok\\" consists of multiple layers of azuki bean or other bean powder and a rice- glutinous rice mixture. Ingredients The main ingredients for \\"sirutteok\\" are rice (Î©•ÏåÄ mepssal in Korean) or glutinous rice (Ï∞πÏåÄ chapssal), which sometimes are mixed. Other grains and beans (such as azuki bean, mung bean and sesame, wheat flour or starch) can also be mixed with the rice. Various fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients, such as persimmon, peach or apricot, chestnut, walnut, and pine nut. In addition, vegetables or herbs can be used to flavor the tteok. Danggwi leaves (ÎãπÍ∑ÄÏûé; Ostericum grosseserratum), seogi mushroom (manna lichen), radish, artemisia, pepper, and Korean wine for example, whereas honey and sugar are used as sweeteners. Varieties *Baekseolgi (Î∞±ÏÑ§Í∏∞) - a variety of siru tteok. It literally means white snow tteok which is made of white rice. *Kongtteok (ÏΩ©Îñ°) - tteok made with various kinds of beans *Jeungpyeon (Ï¶ùÌé∏) - tteok made with makgeolli (unfiltered rice wine) *Mujigae tteok (Î¨¥ÏßÄÍ∞úÎñ°) - literally \\"rainbow tteok\\"; this variety of tteok has colorful stripes. The tteok is used especially for janchi (ÏûîÏπò), Korean banquet, party, or feast like dol (celebrating a baby's first birthday), Hwangap (celebrating 60 years old people's birthday), or gyeonhon janchi (wedding party) *Hobak-tteok See also *Songpyeon *Korean cuisine * List of steamed foods References Tteok Steamed foods ","title":"Siru-tteok"},{"id":"18893307","text":"Leipzig (official name: Landkreis Leipzig) is a district (Kreis) in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

Development and design After World War I there were many surplus Airco DH.9 light bombers, designed by Geoffrey de Havilland, available for the emerging air transport business. At first stripped DH.9s were used to carry one passenger behind the pilot in the gunner's position, but later versions, designated DH.9B, added a second passenger seat ahead of the pilot. A second seat behind the pilot was added by extending the rear cockpit in the early DH.9C. Later DH.9Cs had this rear position converted to hold two passengers face to face, protected by a faired dorsal canopy or cabin. Most of these later four-seat aircraft had slight sweepback to counter the rearward shift in the centre of gravity.Jackson pp. 121‚Äì35 The DH.9, DH.9B, and DH.9C were dimensionally similar, with the same wingspan and height and only small variations in length depending on the powerplant.

Ottoman Greeks (Greek: Œ°œâŒºŒπŒøŒØ, ) were ethnic Greeks who lived in the Ottoman Empire (1299‚Äì1922), the Republic of Turkey's predecessor. Ottoman Greeks, who were Greek Orthodox Christians, belonged to the Rum Millet (Millet-i Rum). They were concentrated in what is today modern Greece, eastern Thrace (especially in and around Constantinople), western Asia Minor (especially in and around Smyrna), central Anatolia (especially Cappadocia), and northeastern Anatolia (especially in Erzurum vilayet, in and around Trebizond and in the Pontic Mountains, roughly corresponding to the medieval Greek Empire of Trebizond). There were also sizeable Greek communities elsewhere in the Ottoman Balkans, Ottoman Armenia, and the Ottoman Caucasus, including in what, between 1878 and 1917, made up the Russian Caucasus province of Kars Oblast, in which Pontic Greeks, northeastern Anatolian Greeks, and Caucasus Greeks who had collaborated with the Russian Imperial Army in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829 were settled in over 70 villages, as part of official Russian policy to re-populate with Orthodox Christians an area that was traditionally made up of Ottoman Muslims and Armenians. History Introduction Demotic Greek speakers in yellow, Pontic Greek in orange and Cappadocian Greek in green with individual villages indicated.. In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim dhimmi system, Greek Christians were guaranteed limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were treated as second-class citizens. Christians and Jews were not considered equals to Muslims: testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses, their houses could not overlook those of Muslims, and their religious practices would have to defer to those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations.. Violation of these statutes could result in punishments ranging from the levying of fines to execution. The Ecumenical Patriarch was recognized as the highest religious and political leader (millet-bashi, or ethnarch) of all Orthodox Christian subjects of the Sultan, though in certain periods some major powers, such as Russia (under the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca of 1774), or Great Britain claimed the rights of protection over the Ottoman Empire's Orthodox subjects. 19th century The three major European powers, Great Britain, France and Russia (known as the Great Powers), took issue with the Ottoman Empire's treatment of its Christian population and increasingly pressured the Ottoman government (also known as the Sublime Porte) to extend equal rights to all its citizens. Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government implemented the Tanzimat reforms to improve the situation of non-muslims, although these would prove largely ineffective. In 1856, the Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayun promised equality for all Ottoman citizens irrespective of their ethnicity and confession, widening the scope of the 1839 Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane. The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, (or Kan√ªn-ƒ± Es√¢s√Æ in Ottoman Turkish), which was promulgated on November 23, 1876. It established freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. 20th century A 1914 document showing the official figures from the 1914 population census of the Ottoman Empire. The total population (sum of all the millets) was given at 20,975,345, and the Greek population was given at 1,792,206. On July 24, 1908, Greeks' hopes for equality in the Ottoman Empire brightened with the removal of Sultan Abd-ul- Hamid II (r. 1876‚Äì1909) from power and restored the country back to a constitutional monarchy. The Committee of Union and Progress (more commonly called the Young Turks), a political party opposed to the absolute rule of Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid II, had led a rebellion against their ruler. The pro- reform Young Turks deposed the Sultan and replaced him with the ineffective Sultan Mehmed V (r. 1908‚Äì1918). Before World War I, there were an estimated 1.8 million Greeks living in the Ottoman Empire.. Some prominent Ottoman Greeks served as Ottoman Parliamentary Deputies. In the 1908 Parliament, there were twenty-six (26) Ottoman Greek deputies but their number dropped to eighteen (18) by 1914.. It is estimated that the Greek population of the Ottoman Empire in Asia Minor had 2,300 community schools, 200,000 students, 5,000 teachers, 2,000 Greek Orthodox churches, and 3,000 Greek Orthodox priests. From 1914 until 1923, Greeks in Thrace and Asia Minor were subject to a campaign including massacres and internal deportations involving death marches. The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) recognizes it as genocide and refers to the campaign as the Greek Genocide. Patriarchate of Constantinople After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when the Sultan virtually replaced the Byzantine emperor among subjugated Christians, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized by the Sultan as the religious and national leader (ethnarch) of Greeks and the other ethnicities that were included in the Greek Orthodox Millet. The Patriarchate earned a primary importance and occupied this key role among the Christians of the Ottoman Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion, and thus regarded all the Orthodox Christians of the Empire as a single entity. The position of the Patriarchate in the Ottoman state encouraged projects of Greek renaissance, centered on the resurrection and revitalization of the Byzantine Empire. The Patriarch and those church dignitaries around him constituted the first centre of power for the Greeks inside the Ottoman state, one which succeeded in infiltrating the structures of the Ottoman Empire, while attracting the former Byzantine nobility. Identity Ottoman Greeks in Constantinople, painted by Luigi Mayer The Greeks were a self-conscious group within the larger Christian Orthodox religious community established by the Ottoman Empire.: \\"The Greeks belonged to the community of the Orthodox subjects of the Sultan. But within that larger unity they formed a self-conscious group marked off from their fellow Orthodox by language and culture and by a tradition of education never entirely interrupted, which maintained their Greek identity.\\" They distinguished themselves from their Orthodox co-religionists by retaining their Greek culture, customs, language, and tradition of education.: \\"While living as a millet under the Ottoman Empire they retained their own religion, customs, and language, and the 'Greeks became the most important non-Turkish element in the Ottoman Empire'.\\" Throughout the post-Byzantine and Ottoman periods, Greeks, as members of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, declared themselves as Graikoi (Greek: ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ, \\"Greeks\\") and Romaioi or Romioi (Greek: Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ/Œ°œâŒºŒ∑ŒπŒøŒØ, \\"Romans\\").: \\"All the peoples belonging to the flock of the Ecumenical Patriarchate declared themselves Graikoi (Greeks) or Romaioi (Romans - Rums).\\": \\"The people we have named as Greeks (Hellenes in the Greek language) would not describe themselves as such ‚Äì they are generally known as Romioi and Graikoi ‚Äì but according to their context the meaning of these words broadens to include or exclude population groups of another language and, at the same time, ethnicity.\\": \\"...Œ∑œÉŒ¨ŒΩ œÄŒøœÑŒµ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøŒπ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒΩœâœÑŒØŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒø, œåœÑŒπ Œ∑ ŒΩŒ≠œâŒΩ Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ ŒµŒØœÑŒµ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒ± Œ±œÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩŒµŒØŒΩ Œ¨œÅœáŒµœÑŒ±Œπ...\\" Notable Ottoman Greeks *Aleksandro Karatodori (1833‚Äì1906). *Basil Zaharoff (1850‚Äì1936), arms dealer and financier. *Christakis Zografos (1820‚Äì1896), banker and benefactor. *Elia Kazan (1909‚Äì2003), director, producer, writer and actor. *Elias Venezis (1904‚Äì1973), writer from Ayvalƒ±k. *Evangelinos Misailides (1820‚Äì1890). *H√ºseyin Hilmi Pasha (1855‚Äì1922), Grand Vizier. *Pargali Ibrahim Pasha (1494‚Äì1536), Grand Vizier to Suleyman the Magnificent. *K√∂sem Sultan (1589‚Äì1651), wife of Ottoman sultan Ahmed I. *Michael Vasileiou, 19th century merchant and benefactor. *Nicholas Mavrocordatos (1670‚Äì1730). *Prince Alexander Mavrocordatos (1791‚Äì1865), Greek statesman. *Yorgo Zarifi (1810‚Äì1884), banker and financier. *Aristotle Onassis (1906‚Äì1975), shipping magnate. *Anton Christoforidis (1918‚Äì1985), Greek light heavyweight boxer. *Sir Alec Issigonis (1906‚Äì1988), Greek-British car designer whose most famous work is the Mini. *Adamantios Korais (1748‚Äì1833), Greek humanist scholar *Roza Eskenazi (1890‚Äì1980), famous singer. *Rita Abatzi (1914‚Äì1969), famous singer. *Giorgos Seferis (1900‚Äì1971), Greek poet who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. *Marika Ninou (1918‚Äì1957), famous singer. *Giannis Papaioannou (1913‚Äì1972), famous singer. *Leonidas Paraskevopoulos (1860‚Äì1936) ‚Äì Greek military man and politician. *Kostas Skarvelis (1880‚Äì1942), famous singer. *Matthaios Kofidis (1855-1921), businessman and politician.

It is 11 km from Gadag city, 24 km from Dambal and about 50 km from Kuknur. The centre of cultural and temple-building activity of the Western Chalukya Empire lay in the Tungabhadra river region, where large medieval workshops built numerous monuments.Hardy (1995), p 156 These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida (South Indian) temples, defined the Karnata dravida tradition.Hardy (1995), pp 6-7 Lakkundi in particular was the location of the mature phase of the Western Chalukya architecture,Hardy (1995), p 158 and the Kasivisvesvara temple marks a high point of these achievements. According to Henry Cousens, it is one of the most ornate temples in the Kannada spoken region of India.Cousens (1926), p. 79 The existence of a 1087 CE inscription on a beam in the temple mantapa (hall) and the plainness of that part of the temple suggests that the original construction may have been simpler and that the profusion of decoration may have been added to the other parts of the temple at a later period, with the end of Chola invasions of Chalukyan territory. Most of the inscriptions in Lakkundi date from 1170 CE onwards. It is known that Hoysala king Veera Ballala II annexed Lakkundi (also known as Lokkigundi) from the Seunas of Devagiri and made it his capital around 1193 CE. It is possible that the temple may have received embellishment during his rule.Cousens (1926), p. 80 Temple plan Doorjamb and lintel mouldings on southern door of Kasivisvesvara temple This is a double shrined temple (dvikuta). The shrine facing east is dedicated to Kasivisvesvara (Hindu god Shiva) whose universal symbol, a linga, stands three feet tall in the sanctum. The other shrine, which faces the main shrine is dedicated to the sun god Surya and is called Suryanarayana. The Surya shrine faces west, an unusual occurrence among Surya temples, which normally face east.Cousens (1926), p. 81-82 The Kasivisvesvara temple epitomises the shift in Chalukyan artistic achievements, towards sharper and crisper stone work not seen in earlier constructions, taking full advantage of the effect of light and shade. Special attention was paid to mouldings, arches and other details on the tower, and decorations on doorjambs and lintels.Cousens (1926), p. 80 Doorjamb and lintel mouldings on shrine door of Kasivisvesvara temple The architects in the Karnataka region seem to have been inspired by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced by the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections.Foekema (2003), pp. 51-52 Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the nearby Nannesvara Temple.Foekema (2003), p51, p53 Decorative features Lathe-turned polished pillars in inner mantapa Old Kannada inscription of Vikramaditya VI dated 1087 A.D on temple beam According to Cousens, the doorpost mouldings on the southern and eastern doorway are worthy of mention. On both sides of the southern doorway are four inner bands of scrolls which run up the sides and around the lower part of the entablature above. Next to these bands, on either side, in the centre, are tall columns or pilasters supporting the lower cornice above. Beyond these columns, on either side, are four more bands of decorative mouldings.Cousens (1926), p. 80 On the lintel of the doorway is a dedicatory block containing an image of Gaja-Lakshmi with an elephant on either side. In fact, in the Kannada spoken regions, it is common to find the image of Lakshmi in the dedicatory block on the lintel irrespective of the temple's original dedication; whether the principal deity was Shiva, Vishnu or Jaina.Cousens (1926), p. 22 Above the lower cornice, the entablature consists of small figures, now numbering only three (must have been eleven originally) standing under cusped arches. Above these figures is a valance of beads hanging in festoons. According to art historian Cousens, the decoration on the eastern doorway, though not a fine as on the southern doorway, is worthy of praise for its filigree work. The doorway to the shrine (sanctum) rivals the exterior ones in finish. The dedicatory block on the lintel has an image of Gaja- Lakshmi and her elephants. Above the cornice is a procession of men and animals. These images, which are barely six inches tall, include horsemen and musicians. Above these images are the trinity of Hindu gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.Cousens (1926), p. 81 Kirtimukha (demon face) with miniature tower- decorative arch combination going up the shrine superstructure The ornamentation on the outer wall of the shrine consists of prominent central niches above which is a miniature tower (shikhara or aedicule) which is purely nagara (north Indian) in style and cuts through the principal cornice. The decorative arch above the miniature tower is a conspicuous ornamental feature of the superstructure. The miniature tower-arch combination is repeated up the superstructure of the shrine. The finial (kalasha) and the capping structure of the tower is missing. In the temple hall, the pillars, their capital, and brackets figures above the capital (which include little lions, kirtimukhas and scrolls) are evidence of expert workmanship, the kind found on ivory or silver. The artisans fully availed the workable properties of finely grained stone (soapstone) to produce polished pillars whose shafts have a rounded appearance obtained by using a lathe.Cousens (1926), p. 81 Notes References  11th-century Hindu temples Hindu temples in Gadag district Chalukya dynasty Shiva temples in Karnataka ","title":"Kasivisvesvara Temple, Lakkundi"},{"id":"18893388","text":"Barangay Apo is the fourteenth studio album of the Filipino trio Apo Hiking Society.

Its purpose was to establish a meteorological-observation station as part of the First International Polar Year, and to collect astronomical and magnetic data. During the expedition, two members of the crew reached a new Farthest North record, but of the original 25 men, only seven survived to return. The expedition was under the auspices of the Signal Corps at a time when the Corps' Chief Disbursements officer, Henry W. Howgate, was arrested for embezzlement. However, that did not deter the planning and execution of the voyage.  Expedition   First year, 1881  Proteus at Qeqertarsuaq harbor The expedition was led by Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greely of the Fifth United States Cavalry, with astronomer Edward Israel and photographer George W. Rice among the crew of 21 officers and men. They sailed on the ship Proteus and reached St. John's, Newfoundland, in early July 1881. At Godhavn, Greenland, they picked up two Inuit dogsled drivers, as well as physician Octave Pierre Pavy and Mr. Clay who had continued scientific studies instead of returning on Florence with the remainder of the 1880 Howgate Expedition. Proteus arrived without problems at Lady Franklin Bay by August 11, dropped off men and provisions, and left. In the following months, Lieutenant James Booth Lockwood and Sergeant David Legge Brainard achieved a new Farthest North record at , off the north coast of Greenland. Unbeknownst to Greely, the summer had been extraordinarily warm, which led to an underestimation of the difficulties which their relief expeditions would face in reaching Lady Franklin Bay in subsequent years.  Second year, 1882  By summer of 1882, the men were expecting a supply ship from the south. Neptune, laden with relief supplies, set out in July 1882 but, cut off by ice and weather, Captain Beebe was forced to turn around prematurely. All he could do was leave some supplies at Smith Sound in August, and the remaining provisions in Newfoundland, with plans for their delivery the following year. On July 20, Pavy's contract ended, and Pavy announced that he would not renew it, but would continue to attend to the expedition's medical needs. Greely was incensed, and ordered the doctor to turn over all his records and journals. Pavy refused, and Greely placed him under arrest. Pavy was not confined, however Greely claimed he intended to court-martial him when they returned to the United States.  Third year, 1883  In 1883, new rescue attempts by Proteus, commanded by Lieutenant Ernest Albert Garlington, and Yantic, commanded by Commander Frank Wildes, failed, with Proteus being crushed by pack ice. The six survivors: Private Francis Long, Sergeant Julius R. Frederick, Private Maurice Connell, Steward Henry Bierderbick, Sergeant David L. Brainard, Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greely In the summer of 1883, in accordance with his instructions for the case of two consecutive relief expeditions not reaching Fort Conger, Greely decided to head South with his crew. It had been planned that the relief ships should depot supplies along the Nares Strait, around Cape Sabine and at Littleton Island, if they were unable to reach Fort Conger, which should have made for a comfortable wintering of Greely's men. But with Neptune not even getting that far and Proteus sunk, in reality only a small emergency cache with 40 days worth of supplies had been laid at Cape Sabine by Proteus. When arriving there in October 1883, the season was too advanced for Greely to either try to brave the Baffin Bay to reach Greenland with his small boats, or to retire to Fort Conger, so he had to winter on the spot.  Fourth year, 1884  In 1884, Secretary of the Navy, William E. Chandler, was credited with planning the ensuing rescue effort, commanded by Cdr. Winfield Scott Schley. While four vessels‚Äî, , , and Loch Garry‚Äîmade it to Greely's camp on June 22, only seven men had survived the winter.Stein, Stephen K (December 2006). \\"The Greely Relief Expedition and the New Navy\\", International Journal of Naval History The rest had succumbed to starvation, hypothermia, and drowning, and one man, Private Henry, had been shot on Greely's order for repeated theft of food rations. The relief party arrived at St. John's, Newfoundland on July 17, 1884 from which the news was telegraphed throughout the States, and a sketched portrait of the members of the Greely Expedition, both living and dead, was published. After a stay of ten days the ships left for New York. The surviving members of the expedition were received as heroes. A parade attended by thousands was held in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was decided that each of the survivors was to be awarded a promotion in rank by the Army, although Greely reportedly refused.  Controversy  Rumors of cannibalism arose following the return of the corpses. On August 14, 1884, a few days after his funeral, the body of Lieutenant Frederick Kislingbury, second in command of the expedition, was exhumed and an autopsy was performed. The finding that flesh had been cut from the bones appeared to confirm the accusation. However, Greely and the surviving crew denied knowledge of cannibalism, and it was surmised some members were trapping sea-lice for food and needed meat for bait.

The \\"Astro\\" in the title is actually an acronym abbreviating \\"Asahio Sogo Teacher's ROom\\", alluding to the school's name Asahio Sogo. The original title, Ky≈çkan Astro, plays on the fact that is 'instructor' in Japanese, but the title uses the kanji meaning 'warship' in place of meaning 'government service'. The manga started serialization in Houbunsha's seinen manga magazine Manga Time Kirara Carat on February 24, 2005, and the first bound volume was released on February 27, 2007. However, the manga has not appeared in the magazine since November 28, 2007. Yen Press licensed the series for release in English, and released the first volume on August 12, 2008. Plot Set in the present, the story focuses on the exploits of first time teachers Izumi Maki and Yuko Nagumo as they begin their teaching jobs at the school they used to attend (Asahio Shogo). Other faculty members include Setsuna Arai, the school's nurse, and Kaname Karasuma, a veteran teacher. Characters ; :Maki is a physical education teacher who is very relaxed and does not take her job very seriously, much to the irritation of some of the faculty. She is prone to taking naps even during school hours and enjoys playing video games and drinking to excess. ; :Nagumo is the Japanese teacher at her school, and dresses in a kimono for the class. She takes her duties far more seriously than Maki, and takes pride in tripping up and fooling her students (as she explains, if they fall for trick questions, they are not reading well enough). However, she is possibly more well known for being a glutton, bringing several bento to school, which she eats between every period, and is something of a fujoshi though she tries to hide it. ; :Arai is the nurse of the school. She is very no-nonsense when it comes to her work, violently ejecting any students (or teachers) who are not actually ill. She frequently plays hand held video games in her office when patients are far and few between. She is somewhat infamous for being something of a sadist, grinning happily at the sight of blood, and speaks almost gleefully at the prospect of injuries at a sports event. Arai has a love‚Äìhate relationship with Maki's brother, Itsuki, giving her characteristics of a tsundere. ; :Karasuma teaches English and French and is the back-up homeroom teacher to Maki, whom she is in love with. She carries a camera specifically for taking photos of her whenever the chance arises, and frequently attempts to get closer to her, but is almost inevitably shot down. Maki appears oblivious to Karasuma's feelings. External links *S.S.

The property is owned by the city of Medford, and managed by a trust established to preserve the property. Its principal feature is the manor house constructed in 1880 by Shepherd Brooks, a member of a prominent Medford family, and is the only major 19th-century estate to survive relatively undeveloped in the city. The grounds are open to the public daily from dawn to dusk, and tours of the house are available during the summer. The estate was developed by Brooks, a member of the locally prominent Brooks family that dominated West Medford for many years, as a summer estate and gentleman's farm. The manor house was designed by Peabody & Stearns, and is a large red brick house, with Queen Anne styling. It has a complex roofline with many gables, and there is a port cochere. A carriage barn stands near the main house. The estate originally included a second summer house called Point of Rocks, which had been built by Peter Chardon Brooks III in 1859, but this was demolished by the city in the 20th century. The city acquired the 82-acre remnant of the Brooks estate after the death of Shepherd Brooks' wife Clara in 1939. After the Second World War the city used the estate to provide housing for veterans, and in the 1960s and 70s it was used as a nursing home. From the 1970s through the late 1980s the Manor building was used as a group home for mentally-challenged adults. The proposal in 1992 to erect a cellphone tower near the Shepherd Brooks Manor created a firestorm from local residents. The Brooks Estate Preservation Association, a citizen-led group, was formed to change the City of Medford's lack of leadership. A four-year effort to preserve the Brooks Estate in perpetuity was successfully completed with the passage of the Conservation and Preservation Restriction in 1998, which permanently protected the Manor, Carriage house and 50-acres of land from development and cemetery expansion. Local conservationists then worked to permanently protect the property. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

SANDDE is an acronym for \\"Stereoscopic ANimation Drawing DEvice\\" and is a play on the Japanese term for \\"3D\\", which is pronounced \\"San-D\\". The concept of SANDDE was to enable artists to draw and animate in three-dimensional space. It was intended to be intuitively usable, like a pencil: as an art creation tool, SANDDE incorporated aspects of drawing, painting, sculpture and puppetry. Unlike most other contemporary 3D computer graphic animation software, SANDDE did not require the construction of models from primitives. The main input device was a \\"wand\\" which allows the user to create drawings in the air. Animators sat in virtual stereoscopic theaters and, using the wand, drew in space to create individual frames and then animated their creations using the interactive capabilities of the wand to create shots, sequences, and complete movies. SANDDE was originally developed by IMAX in the mid-1990s, and was used to create one IMAX short (Paint Misbehavin [1997]) and portions of two other IMAX feature films: Mark Twain 3D (1999) and Cyberworld (2000). Thereafter, IMAX stopped active development of the system but provided licenses to the National Film Board of Canada for artistic experimentation. The NFB has used SANDDE in numerous stereoscopic productions including Falling in Love Again\\", Moonman, June, The Wobble Incident, Subconscious Password, and Minotaur. In 2007, IMAX spun off the Janro Imaging Laboratory to explore future development and commercial use of the application, including in Ultimate Wave 3D and Legends of Flight, both produced by the Stephen Low Company.

So, General Juin, the then chief of staff, ordered the Direction Technique Industrielle to evaluate interest for this project. SNCAC and Breguet Aviation answered positively and the SNCAC NC.210 was selected in December 1945 when a contract for 105 aircraft was awarded to SNCAC. The NC.211 originated as the NC.210 powered by four Gnome- Rh√¥ne 18R 18-cylinder radial engines. With a change of engine type to the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14R the designation changed to NC.211. Intended to provide the French Air Force, (French: Arm√©e de l'Air (ALA), literally Army of the Air), with strategic transport and paratrooping capability the Cormoran was a large four-engined aircraft with a double-deck fuselage, high-set wing and tricycle undercarriage. Constructed largely of light-alloys with stressed skins and steel high stress components the Cormoran had a conventional tail unit with tailplane attached to the extreme rear of the fuselage and fin also. The cockpit was situated forward of the wing leading edge above the forward fuselage which also had large clamshell doors to the lower deck cargo compartment. Passengers, paratroops and stretchers were to have been carried in both the lower cabin and the upper cabin, which was on the same level as the cockpit aft of the wing. The retractable twin-wheeled undercarriage legs retracted into the rear of the inboard engine nacelles and the underside of the forward fuselage. History After the fuselage of the first prototype was displayed at the 1946 Salon d'√Å√©ronautique in Paris on November 15, 1946 the first flight was delayed due to hydraulic problems on the landing gear. The first prototype Nc.211-01 was ready to fly in July 1948, making its first and only flight on 20 July 1948 at Toussus-le-Noble. During the flight a mismatch between flaps and tailplane/elevators caused the crash of the aircraft with the loss of all five on board. Flight testing of the first production aircraft, from 9 April 1949, quickly revealed less than sparkling performance, leading to loss of confidence in the aircraft's ability to meet the requirement, (and possibly the safety of the design), resulting in cuts to the contract to ten production airframes. Flying with this aircraft ceased on 7 July 1949 with approximately 30 hours total flying time, after which the aircraft was used to house radio transmitters on the airfield at Villacoublay until it was scrapped circa 1972/3. All remaining aircraft and components were scrapped at the A√©rocentre factory at Bourges or at Billancourt airfield.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Jonathan Fletcher House is located roughly midway between the village centers of Medford and West Medford, on the north side of High Street at its junction with Hastings Lane. The setting includes a period granite retaining wall, with steps and a hitching post. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front gable roof and shingled exterior. The front facade is three bays wide, its first floor left bays sheltered by a deep porch supported by six Tuscan columns. The main entrance is in the right bay, sheltered by a glassed vestibule. A two-story ell extends to the right, its gable roof perpendicular to and lower than the main roof. The interior retains a number of original features and finishes, some of them closely copied from pattern books published by Asher Benjamin. The house was built about 1835 by Jonathan Fletcher, on land that had previously seen industrial use as a tannery by the locally prominent Brooks family. There is some evidence suggesting the ell is older than the main block: documentation indicates a house was standing here in 1795, and the paneling and hearth locations of the ell are suggestive that there was once a central chimney in the structure.

Antigua had served as a privateer before the Royal Navy purchased her on 4 June 1757. She was sold in the West Indies on 13 August 1763.Colledge, p. 34 The sloop brought the French privateer Marie- Catherine into St. John's, Antigua, on March 24, 1758. The Antigua had captured the Marie-Catherine with the aid of privateers. The French crew threw its 8 carriage guns and 8 swivel guns overboard during the pursuit. The Antigua recaptured a British schooner that was departing Dutch Suriname days later. The schooner, loaded with sugar and molasses, was sent into English Harbor. Months later, the Antigua captured a 10-gun French privateer on May 1 after a \\"smart engagement\\" in which the French suffered several casualties. The prize was brought into St. John's. The Antigua captured a 10-gun French privateer in the Atlantic in June 1758 after a battle that lasted for several hours. The prize was brought into Philadelphia harbor. In July, the Antigua was attacked while sailing from Barbados on the windward side of Martinique by a 16-gun French privateer. The two ships exchanged fire until two more French privateers arrived and the Antigua broke off the engagement and safely reached English Harbor. On November 6, the Antigua brought a 5-gun French Privateer and its 24-man crew into St. John's. The Antigua, under commander Weston Varlo, engaged a 12-gun French privateer off the windward coast of its namesake island on December 11. The battle lasted for a half hour and resulted in the capture of the French ship, with 5 privateers killed and 9 wounded. The Antigua started 1759 with much activity. On January 7, the ship spotted the merchant Nancy from Bristol being captured by two privateers off of Wiloughby Bay. Varlo signaled HMS Spy in English Harbour and the two Royal Navy ships sailed after the French ships and their prize. The two privateers left their prize to be recaptured by the Antigua and Spy, abandoning a prize crew that had taken control of the Nancy. Six days later, the Antigua brought in a 6-gun French privateer. Another privateer, a sloop loaded with beef and wine, was captured on January 23 while it was en route from Sint Eustatius to Martinique. In October 1759, the Antigua recaptured the sloop George, a New London-based vessel that had been taken by a French privateer. The sloop captured an additional 4 ships in November, bringing 3 ships engaged in the Dutch-French Caribbean trade and a 6-gun French privateer sloop into St. John's, Antigua.

Kumaran Nair was one of the very few Kathakali artists to have had directly interacted with allied art forms like Bharatanatyam from south India and Kathak from the north of his country besides also Odissi from the eastern belt. This was besides a brush he had with Tamil cinema in his youthful days in Madras (Chennai). All these never conspired to shed the element of classicism in Kumaran Nair's Kathakali performances, instead helped his acting-dancing techniques acquire a certain grand eclecticism that won him fans across Kerala and elsewhere. In short, Kumaran Nair's style was a mix of intellect, imagination and signature body language that took care not to breach or dilute the pure grammar of Kathakali all the same.http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/08/03/stories/2007080350090200.htm A native of Vellinezhi, one of Kathakali's nerve-centres in Palakkad district, Kumaran Nair was primarily groomed‚Äîfrom as early as the age of five‚Äîin the highly evolved Kalluvazhi style by none other than its grand master, Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon. His classmates at Kerala Kalamandalam included the legendary Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair (1914‚Äì1990), but on completion of his studies found the conditions in Kerala not exactly promising a bright future for him as a Kathakali artiste. Much to the sorrow of his guru Pattikkamthodi, Kumaran Nair shifted base to Madras, where he gained name a master of choreography by teaching dance (for songs) to Tamil cine star Ranjan. During this span, Kumaran Nair also worked closely with the film icon M.G. Ramachandran, who later switched over to politics and became the state's chief minister. He soon returned to Kalamandalam as a tutor, where circumstances subsequently forced him to work with the dance section. An unhappy Kumaran Nair quit his alma- mater. He later worked with several Kathakali schools like PSV Natyasangham, Kottakkal; Kalasadanam, Chunangad and Varanakkottu Kaliyogam, Payyannur; but his longest stints were in Gandhi Seva Sadan (Sadanam Kathakali and Classical Arts Academy) at Peroor in Palakkad district and the International Centre for Kathakali in New Delhi. Kumaran Nair is a recipient of the Padma Shri award (2004), the Central Sangeet Natak Akademi award, the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi Fellowship and the Kalamandalam award, among others.

It encompasses a portion of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, a state park managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The principal features of the district are three reservoirs and their associated gate houses and pumping stations, which were developed by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC, predecessor organization to the DCR) starting in the late 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. The most prominent and visible feature of the district is Spot Pond, a large body of water on the east side of Interstate 93 in Stoneham. The pond was used as a passive reservoir by surrounding towns prior to its acquisition by the MDC. The MDC replaced several town pumping stations with a single station (separately listed on the National Register in 1984), and constructed a gate house adjacent. Also found in the same area on the eastern shore of the pond is the John Bottume House, a 19th-century stone house that now serves as the reservation's visitors center. The MDC also enlarged the pond's capacity, and converted it for use as a storage reservoir providing water to the communities north of Boston. There is a second gatehouse on Spot Pond, at the southern end (straddling the Stoneham-Medford line). The MDC also constructed two smaller reservoirs within the Fells. The Bear Hill Reservoir, located just west of I-93 near the summit of Bear Hill, has a capacity of 2 million gallons, and was created in 1902-3 with the construction of two concrete dams and a gatehouse. The Fells Reservoir is located in the southeastern part of the reservation. Because it was sited in existing parkland, it was given a deliberately naturalistic appearance. It was designed by the noted Olmsted Brothers firm, and its gatehouse was built to a design by Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge.

Only 30% of the 1,487 objects damaged were destroyed. Over 1,000 cultural monuments were suffered, as well as thousands of works of art and valuable collections. By the end of the catastrophe, 101 people had died in Montenegro and 35 in Albania and over 100,000 people were left homeless.  Aid and relief  Damage done to Hotel Slavija in Budva Days after the earthquake, $30,000 was made available immediately for aid work and restoration of disaster areas. On 28 May 1979, the Director-General of UNESCO issued a worldwide appeal for donations to help the nation recover for the devastation as the federal budget was insufficient for aid funding. Several months later, in October 1979, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO decided to list the Natural and Culturo-historical Region of Kotor in the World Heritage List and in the List of World Heritage in Danger. UNESCO, through ICCROM, aided the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments in Cetinje for the restoration of frescoes in the Church of the Virgin in Podlastva Monastery. Similar help was given for the restoration of the Church of Alexander Nevsky on the island of Sveti Stefan. First estimates of the cost of damaged cultural property was about 10,527,690,000 Yugoslav dinars (US$10.5 billion), which is just under 15% of the total earthquake damage. The 1984 inflation rates put that amount at about 3,174,098,500,000 dinars (3.1 trillion), equaling to US$31,700,000,000 ($31 billion). The Yugoslav Government agreed to pay 82% of the total estimated cost of damaged cultural property, whereas the remaining 18% was to be paid by the local municipalities. To help meet the total costs of the disaster, the Government had set up a statutory fund whereby each worker across SFR Yugoslavia contributed 1% of his monthly salary towards the restoration effort in a ten-year period, from 1979 to 1989. Till September 1, 1983, the Government had budgeted for a total expenditure of 54,722,849,000 dinars (54.7 billion), of which 3.7% or 21,023,620,800 dinars (21 billion) were allocated for cultural property. By 1984, Montenegro was still under restoration, the entire Montenegrin coast, especially Budva and Kotor, and Cetinje receiving the heaviest amounts of restoration. Several objects had been fully restored by 1984, including the Memorial Museum of Jovan Tomasevic in Bar; Monastery of St. Vid and Church of St. Alexander Nevsky in Budva; Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments (former Austrian embassy), State Museum (former Palace of King Nicholas), National Gallery and the Bishop's House in Cetinje; the Archives and Gallery of Josip Bepo Benkovic in Herceg Novi, Cultural Center in Kotor, Church of St. George in Orahovac (Kotor), Church of Our Lady in Krimovice (Kotor), Church of St. John in Dub (Kotor), Church of St. George in Sisici (Kotor), Church of St. George in Sutvara (Kotor), Church of St. George in Prijeradi (Kotor), Church of St. Eustacius in Dobrota (Kotor), Church of Our Lady of the Rocks in Perast (Kotor), Roman mosaics in Risan (Kotor) and twelve church buildings in Grbalj (Kotor).

Constructed by the Boston and Maine Railroad in 1894, the building was abandoned in the 1930s, although passenger service continued to stop until 1957. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Park Street Railroad Station. It is the only extant railroad station building in Medford. History The original Park Street station The Medford branch was built by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) in 1847. A station at Park Street was not added until between 1875 and 1889. The first station was a wooden structure with a gable roof, located on the north side of the tracks just east of Park Street. In the 1890s, the B&M; double-tracked the branch to provide more frequent service to compete with electric streetcars. B&M; vice president Samuel C. Lawrence became the first mayor of Medford in 1893, partially on promises to provide new station buildings at Park Street and Glenwood. The new Park Street station was designed by Clarence B. Cutler, and construction was completed in 1894. It was unusually large and well-appointed for a branch line station due to the influence of Lawrence; he had his personal gardeners attend to the station grounds. The station is a one-story rectangular structure built of red brick with granite base and trim. A hip roof and porte-coch√®re are supported by posts with large curved brackets. The station was located on the south side of the tracks slightly east of the former station; a footbridge was constructed at the station. Reports vary as to whether the original station was demolished, or was moved and reused by the city highway department. Despite the new stations and frequent service, the branch lost most of its ridership to the streetcars and later automobiles. Service was discontinued for a period around 1933-34, and the station building remained in disuse even after service resumed. The abandoned building was given to the city in 1942. Passenger service on the Medford branch, including the stop at the abandoned Park Street building, continued until on October 1, 1957. The tracks were abandoned west of Park Street in 1959, and east to Glenwood in 1961. The former station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Park Street Railroad Station. It has been reused as an adult day care center.

The son of a colliery official, Hood would make his name as a coalowner of collieries first in Scotland and later in Llwynypia in South Wales. History Early history Hood was born in June 1823 in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father was a colliery foreman. His mother had died, so Hood's father brought him up alone, and he received little education ‚Äì aged thirteen he was employed at his father's colliery.Carpenter (2000) p. 26 At the age of 17, after his father was promoted to colliery manager, Hood was able to take classes and qualified as a mining engineer. In 1856 Hood began expanding his business; leasing Whitehill Colliery at Rosewell (then owned by Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery). His successes in expanding and improving the Rosewell colliery allowed Hood to expand his operations, and he soon managed several pits in the area (including Carrington and Polton, to which he extended the railway lines). Hood not only improved the mines in his ownership, he also made provision to improve the living conditions for his workers. He built houses for his workers and their families, and ensured that each house had a garden to provide a small holding. Hood set up home in Rosewell, living at Rosedale house with his family. Welsh interests In 1860, Hood joined the Ely Valley Coal Company in Tonyrefail in the Rhondda in Wales, an area which was undergoing a massive industrial coal boom. He bought Gilfach House in Gilfach Goch, from where he would live during his initial years in the Rhondda. In 1862 he changed the name of the Ely Valley Coal Company to the Glamorgan Coal Company and took ownership of it. In March 1863, after acquiring mineral rights from the local land owners, he sank a pit in Llwynypia. In 1864 the pit reached the No.2 seam and 1865 the No.3 seam was reached. His colliery at Llwynypia was known for the high level of Scottish workers who followed Hood to the area and for the quality of the coke from the site. To protect his interests in the Welsh coalfields he moved permanently to Wales in 1867, residing with his family at 'Sherwood' on Newport Road in Cardiff, though he kept ownership of Rosedale in Rosewell. As he had done so in Scotland, Hood also ensured that homes were built for his workers. Following the model in Rosewell, Hood ensured the buildings each had their own garden, and these building in Llwynypia became known as the 'Scotch Houses'. Hood also ensured that an education system existed for the children of his workers, he built a miners' institute, which housed a library and a swimming baths for sporting interests.Carpenter (2000) p. 27 During the 1880s Hood became a leading promoter in the construction of a new railway line to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, in a bid to find an alternative route to the monopoly controlled by the Taff Vale Railway and Cardiff Docks. He and other pit owners persuaded David Davies of Ocean Collieries, to develop a dock at Barry, which Davies saw to fruition in 1889. Davies placed himself as Deputy Chairman of the newly formed Barry Railway Company, but died just a year after its completion in 1890. Hood took over as Deputy chairman on Davies' death and saw through line expansions as well as the construction of the number 2 dock in Barry. Despite now being based in Wales, Hood ensured that his businesses in Scotland continued to grow. In 1890 he arranged for the amalgamation of his Whitehall colliery in Midlothian with the Newbattle pits owned by Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian. The resulting company was known as Lothian Coal Company. Around this time his son, James Hood (1859‚Äì1941), became general manager of the Lothian Coal Company, moving back to Scotland. Death Hood died in Cardiff on 27 October 1902. Due to the high esteem in which he was held, his workers decided to fund a memorial in his honour. The miners contributed to a statue to be built, amassing over ¬£600 for its construction. The life-size bronze statue was erected on the grounds of Llwynypia Library, pointing towards his colliery and was unveiled in July 1906 by William Abraham (Mabon). It was the first public statue in the Rhondda.

Description and history The main Medford Post Office is set on the west side of Forest Street, just north of the central business district's main intersection. The front portion of the building is a seven-bay brick structure, set on a high foundation. The central three bays project forward and upward, and are topped by a gabled roof with a modillioned marble pediment. The outer bays of the projection house tall windows, and the center one the entrance, which is reached via granite steps. The windows in the outer bays are set in recessed panels, with marble sills and lintels. The interior lobby space features terrazzo marble flooring, marble wainscoting, and dark woodwork. The service area, located to the right is topped by a mural depicting the city's historic shipbuilding and rum industries. The building's principal designing architect was Arthur Blakeslee, and it was built in 1937 with funding from the Public Works Administration (PWA), following that body's guidelines for design and construction. The building's location on a side street (as opposed to a more prominent corner or main street location) was an evolutionary step in the PWA's practices for post office location, allowing the mail handling area to be accessed from the side rather than the rear.

It is located in North Kolkata, between CIT Road and APC Road. The locality has grown around Narkeldanaga Main Road, now renamed as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Sarani, which acts as a connector between CIT Road and APC Road. Thus, Rajabazar can be said to be located between Maniktala, Narkeldanga and Sealdah. Rajabazar is in a prime location and Sealdah Railway Station is a stone's throw distance from Rajabazar crossing. All civic amenities, such as hospitals, colleges, schools, sanitation, malls, gyms, shopping complexes, cinema halls, mosques and temples are located in and around Rajabazar. Dr. B.C. Roy Children's Hospital is located at a distance of 2‚Äì3 km from Rajabazar. History The bazaar was established about 1842 AD on land owned by Raja Ramlochun Ray, a petty zamindar, by Muslim merchants, businessmen, butchers and cattle traders from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, who had immigrated to Calcutta due to the poor economic condition of Muslims in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh following the Sepoy Mutiny. However, Rajabazar area was settled by Urdu-speaking Muslims from 1880 onwards. The market-place colony was established around the same time as the Harrison Road (now called MG Road) was being built in Calcutta, connecting Sealdah Station to Howrah Station. A mosque was built which still exists today known as the Rajabazar Barri Masjid and there is another larger mosque being renovated which is Jama Masjid Darur- Salaam on Narkeldanga Main Road and several residential quarters were established around that area. A police station (Narkeldanga Police Station) was established in 1915 near the canal, on Canal West road. The area is known as \\"Khalpul\\" due to the bridge over the canal that connects Rajabazar to Narkeldanga. Before the building of the bridge in 1910, there was a bamboo- stilt bridge over the canal. Boat ferries were also used to transport people and supplies across the canal. Over the decades, further population growth and immigration resulted in the growth and extension of the original settlement further, up to Narkeldanga and Phoolbagan in the east, Sealdah to the south, Mechua and Kalabagan to the west and further north. Today, the area is densely populated and crowded, with alleys and lanes established. After the riots of 1947 (during the Partition of India), many Muslims from other parts, like Sealdah, Manicktala and Beliaghata moved to Rajabazar. The Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta in 1964, further made Muslims living in areas like Maniktala, Sealdah, Beliaghata and throughout Calcutta, flock to Rajabazar. Over time, therefore, it got transformed into a ghetto. After the 1992-93 Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta, further Muslims moved to Rajabazar, as a result of which, today, Rajabazar boasts of having the second largest Muslim population in Calcutta after Metiabruz. There is a shrine (mazaar) of a Muslim Sufi saint in Rajabazar. The area spans the canal, and crosses over the bridge. There are 9 Mosques located at Rajabazar. The bazaar is famous for its jewellery (SHYAM JEWELLERS is the most prestigious Jeweller), bangles, kites, sweetmeats and mutton and beef shops. Rajabazaar is a major cattle and goat trading center in West Bengal called Bakrichar. A movie hall, \\"Tasveer Mahal\\", is also located at Rajabazar. Demographics Majority of the population of Rajabazar is Sunni Muslim, mostly Urdu-speaking, descended from immigrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Mostly Deobandi theology is practised here, and Bareilvi theology population also co-exists peacefully. There are also many shia families. Many Hindus also live at Rajabazaar. Most of the population is middle-class and lower-middle class, but many rich, educated Muslims also live here in high-rises. More or less there are a total of 12 mosques in the area, 9 managed by the Tablighi Jamaat (Deobandi), 2 mosques are managed by the Sunni Bareilvi sect and 1 mosques are managed by Ahle Hadees Ahle Sunnat wal jammat. Amenities and transport Sealdah ESI Hospital, near Rajabazar B.C.

Built in 1929‚Äì30 for an investment banker, it was the last, and also the grandest estate to be built in the town. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 3, 1986. Description and history Assington is located on the south side of Forest Street in rural eastern Sherborn, between the Rocky Narrows Reservation and Farm Road. The estate is set on of mostly woods, with a winding drive leading south from the road to the main house. The house is set on a rise overlooking the Charles River, and features an allee from the south lawn down to the Charles. The main house is a large 2-1/2 story structure, finished in stucco and covered with a balustraded slate roof. The main block is 7 bays wide, with an enclosed and pedimented entry that is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight. To the east is a large wing, and an arcaded porch runs along the west side. The south facade faces the river, and has a bowed central section that rises to interrupt the roof's balustrade. Outbuildings on the property include a caretaker house, tea house, and service structures. Assington was built in 1929‚Äì1930 for George and Muriel Saltonstall Lewis, to designs by architect William Truman Aldrich (1880‚Äì1966). Aldrich in his design sought to emulate the design and setting of English country houses, and worked with New York City-based landscape designer Inno Chenti. The estate is named for the Gurdon estate in Assington, Suffolk, although its design more closely resembles Heaton Hall in Manchester. The allee leading down to the river faces the estate of Leverett Saltonstall, Muriel's brother. George Lewis was an investment advisor for a Boston investment firm. The portion of the original estate, fronting on the Charles, was given by the Lewises to The Trustees of Reservations, and is now part of the Rocky Narrows Reservation.

The unit fell under the jurisdiction of Pacific Command, the Canadian Army formation responsible for defending the Pacific Coast of Canada against Japanese attack. History Based at the Old Vancouver Hotel and the R.C.A.S.C. wharf (Vancouver) under the command of Major C.G. Matthews, the Pacific Command Water Transport Company of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps was formed in 1942, utilizing fishing packers and seiners 'leased' from local civilians for army use. The company was tasked with re-supplying camps established to build a telephone line from British Columbia to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, after the Aleutian Islands Attu and Kiska were occupied by Japanese Imperial Forces. Upon completion of the communication link, the Water Transport Company was assigned with re-supplying freight and personnel to remote RCAF radar stations on the west coast of British Columbia, basing ships at Coal Harbour, Port Alberni, and Prince Rupert. The Company maintained an estimated 70 vessels (including scows) in its order-of-battle, each motor vessel mounted with a twin-Lewis Gun .303 battery and Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles for all crewmembers, usually eight O.R.s.

Life Henry was co-ruler of the principality of Anhalt with his father from 1244. After his father's death in 1252 the Anhalt state was divided between him and his brothers. Henry took over the old family areas of Aschersleben, Hecklingen, Ermsleben and W√∂rbzig. Through his mother, Henry was related to the Landgraves of Thuringia; in 1247 he intervened in the War of the Thuringian Succession and spoke out in support of an alliance with Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (his brother-in-law), who in return promised to give him some Thuringian lands. He was defeated and captured in battle near Besenstedt in 1263, but was released shortly after. He soon renewed his war against Thuringia. In 1265 he was captured again and forced to renounce completely his claims to lands in Thuringia. In 1257, Henry supported King Alfonso X of Castile as German King and led military actions against the monasteries and archbishops of Magdeburg and bishops of Halberstadt as well as his brothers and cousins.

The director of the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Women's Affairs Department, Peng advocated for the safety and development of women. Peng married Horng Wann-sheng (, a mathematics professor at NTNU) and they had a son together. Murder In November 1996, Peng disappeared in Kaohsiung, Taiwan; the public last saw her board a yellow Ford Telstar taxi after a DPP meeting the night prior to a DPP convention. She was discovered raped and murdered outside of an abandoned warehouse in Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City); her body had more than 30 stab wounds. Despite an extensive investigation, the police were unable to solve the crime. At least 70,000 Taiwanese taxi drivers had their fingerprints analyzed in an effort to find Peng's killer. Hung said that he felt frustrated that the killer was not found. There have been numerous false leads since the murder. In 2015, police received tips from the ex-girlfriend of a taxi driver surnamed Yang, who said that he had told her he had killed Peng. Although Yang did not match DNA samples taken from the crime scene, he did match several fingerprint characteristics. The statute of limitations ran out in 2016, closing the case, which prompted some DPP lawmakers to propose the removal of the twenty-year statute for murder cases and major economic crimes. Response and legacy Peng's murder produced an outcry against the lack of protection women have in Taiwan. Peng's proposed quota for one fourth of the seats of the elected seats to be reserved for women passed during the November 30, 1996 DPP National Congress meeting; the public believes that Peng died during that day. Peng's death, along with two other well-publicized murder cases, led to mass demonstrations in May 1997. Demonstrators marched on and , demanding Premier Lien Chan's resignation over the perceived rise in violent crime as evidenced by the then-unsolved murders of Pai Hsiao-yen, Peng Wan-ru, and Liu Pang-yu. The Peng Wan-ru Foundation (), an organization named after Peng and established in 1997 by Peng's husband, supports women wishing to enter the labour force. It trains women for participation in their child-care programs; once they have passed the courses, the Foundation matches them with households or elementary schools in need of child care.

Description and history The house is located on the east side of South Main Street, at the northern edge of the rural village of South Sherborn. It is a 1-1/2, timber- framed structure, with a flared slate mansard roof and clapboard siding. A polygonal window bay projects from the right side of the front facade, with a flat-roof that has a bracketed cornice. The main roof line is also studded with paired brackets.

Description and history The Daniel Morse III House stands in a rural area of eastern Sherborn, on the west side of Farm Road north of its junction with Forest Road. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and shingled exterior. At the rear the roof extends to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile. The front facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and gabled pediment. An ell extends to the rear of the main block. Other buildings on the property include a barn and chicken coop. The oldest portion of this house was built c. 1710, and is one of a handful of First Period houses in the town. Originally a three-bay structure with off-center chimney, it was extended to its present five-bay configuration with central chimney in the late 18th century. Daniel Morse III, who built the house, was the son of one of Sherborn's first settlers, who acquired of surrounding land in 1656. The house was sold out of the Morse family in the late 18th century.

The original synagogue building was later converted into a Christian church building, the Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church. It's one of multiple synagogues considered in a study of NRHP eligibility.  History  The Agudath Sholom congregation website states that on September 7, 1889, twenty-two members formally declared themselves as \\"Agudath Sholom Synagogue\\"; meaning \\"knot for peace\\" or \\"society for peace\\". The congregation constructed their first synagogue, the Greyrock Synagogue, from 1904 through 1908. The congregation used the building until February 1932 when the Greyrock Synagogue was destroyed in a fire. In order to meet the demands of its growing congregation, funds were raised for a new synagogue. A fund raiser for $1.2 million was done to raise the necessary capital; it was announced that $860,000 was made by February 1963. In 1965, the congregation completed and dedicated a new synagogue on Strawberry Hill Avenue and Colonial Road. The synagogue currently resides at 301 Strawberry Hill Avenue. The Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church now uses the Grove St synagogue.  Construction  The Star of David window Located at 29 Grove Street in Stamford, Connecticut, the Agudath Sholom Synagogue was the second synagogue of the congregation. According to the National Register of Historic Places, the ground breaking occurred on September 12, 1933, and the final dedication was on April 27, 1941. According to the congregation's website, the Agudath Sholom Synagogue was completed in 1938 and the \\"Chanukkat Habayit dedication occurred on the High Holidays\\". The construction delayed by funding difficulties that resulted from the Great Depression. The synagogue is a rectangular brick building constructed on a high basement. The building features a prominent rose window depicting the Star of David.  Significance  While it was originally a synagogue, the Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church continues to use the building as a church, but this did not impact the \\"National Landmark\\" status bestowed upon the building. For the National Register of Historic Places, it was submitted under Criterion C because it was \\"Constructed as a Jewish house of worship, located in an urban setting, exhibits integrity of design and workmanship and constructed prior to 1945.\\" (pages 102-110) and See also *Ahavas Sholem Synagogue, New Haven, listed on the NRHP in New Haven County, Connecticut *Ohev Sholem Synagogue, New London, listed on the NRHP in New London County, Connecticut *National Register of Historic Places listings in Stamford, Connecticut External links * Agudath Sholom Synagogue Website * Faith Tabernacle Website References Former synagogues in Connecticut Buildings and structures in Stamford, Connecticut Churches in Stamford, Connecticut Baptist churches in Connecticut National Register of Historic Places in Fairfield County, Connecticut Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut 1908 establishments in Connecticut Synagogues completed in 1908 Romanesque Revival architecture in Connecticut Romanesque Revival synagogues ","title":"Agudath Sholem Synagogue"},{"id":"18894017","text":"\\"Canzone per te\\" (\\"A song for you\\") was the Swiss entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 1991, sung in Italian by Sandra Studer (who performed with the stage name Sandra Sim√≥).

History The facility was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a contract glider training airfield, known as Antigo Airport. Anderson Air Activities provided preliminary glider training. The school was one of 18 private operator contract schools that ran for 90 days beginning approximately July 6, 1942. There were but a few two place soaring gliders available for training. The Army delivered a few single engine, L type aircraft to be used. The primary training in these aircraft involved so called \\"dead-stick\\" landings. The student and instructor flew to various prescribed altitudes up to and the engine was shut off. The student then landed the plane as a glider. By September 1942 the Southeast Air Forces Training Command had been instructed to shut down the school as the shortage of gliders and single engine aircraft did not allow the school to train and produce the number of students required by the USAAF. Antigo Airport was closed, the Army flew the planes out and the land was returned to the local farmers.

He was also president of the Jersey Senate 21 Club, which was composed of all twenty-one New Jersey senators, Republican and Democrat, from 1941 to 1965. For many years, Senator Farley hosted \\"Senate at the Shore\\": a retreat for the senators and their wives in Atlantic City where Republicans and Democrats could share in relationship-building events. Farley was chairman of the Atlantic County Republican Committee from 1941 to 1972 and treasurer of Atlantic County from 1944 to 1971. He also re-instituted the New Jersey Republican Chairmen's Association and was elected president of that body from 1952 to 1972.

Farley was endeared by his constituents for accomplishing legislation that brought the Atlantic City State Marina in 1941 (renamed the Senator Frank S. Farley State Marina in 1971), sanctioned horse racing and parimutuel betting to the state which brought about the Atlantic City Race Course in 1944, the Fishing Conservation Commission in 1946 which aided in coastal jetty protection, the Garden State Parkway in 1952 (which was referred to by North Jersey legislators as \\"Farley's Folly\\"), the Atlantic City Expressway in 1964 (the service plaza, Farley Service Plaza, of which is now named in his honor), Stockton State College in 1963, numerous county community colleges, the State Aeronautical Space College, the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center, the Cape May Lewes Ferry in 1965, the Police and Firemen's Widow Pension in 1965, the expansion of the New Jersey Medical School, and the educational TV Channel 12 in 1967. By 1960, he held the record of having had more bills passed than any other member of the upper house. Farley believed that his political success lay primarily in persuading other legislators \\"not to hurt us if you can't help us\\", and in treating other legislators the same way. Senator Farley's efforts also reached those most in need in Atlantic County. His bills brought free vaccines to needy children in 1955, established the New Jersey Division against Discrimination in Education in 1960, produced the Atlantic County Improvement Authority, brought about tax deductions for veterans and senior citizens, and established a senior citizen nonprofit housing tax exemption in 1965, Farley's urban renewal bill, passed in 1949, and the state Mosquito Control and Inland Waterway commissions aimed to improve the quality of life for his constituents, particularly. The pristine beaches and world famous boardwalk are two of Atlantic City's main attractions. However, storms often destroy and erode sections of both. To counter this, Senator Farley put forward a permanent annual appropriation for the resort beaches. 75 percent of this was provided by the state and 25 percent was provided by Atlantic City. After a particularly devastating storm, Senator Farley proposed a beneficial city Luxury Tax. The measure taxed hotels, tobacco, liquor, and amusements in Atlantic City. The funds of this tax directly replenished the beach erosion, fortified the boardwalk, and supplied other infrastructural improvements for the city. In 1949, the New Jersey State Beach Erosion Commission became the authority for upkeep; however, in 1962, Senator Farley acquired $5 million from the state to restore the Atlantic City beaches. The city luxury tax still provides funds for the improvement of Atlantic City, and in 2019, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement reported $32,425,000 in luxury tax revenue for the city. When Farley entered the New Jersey Senate, each of the state's twenty-one counties was represented by one senator. This resulted in the smaller counties, which included most South Jersey counties, having an equal amount of power in the senate. Still, Farley was very effective in assembling a majority of the twenty-one senators to support his proposals. Farley's legislative power was ultimately diluted as a result of the United States Supreme Court's 1962 decision in Baker v. Carr, which required that representation in state legislatures be based on population, not counties. As a result, the size of the state senate grew to forty members, with most of the new seats representing districts in North Jersey, and it was much more difficult for Farley to advocate for Atlantic County and southern New Jersey. While Farley served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he was instrumental in getting the New Jersey delegation at the 1968 Republican National Convention to switch their support from favorite son Clifford P. Case to Richard Nixon. In the latter part of Farley's legislative career, a growing number of Atlantic City activists and leaders proposed the legalization of casino gambling as a way to rebuild the deteriorated city and rejuvenate its declining economy. Until near the end of his senatorial career, Farley refused to back casino gambling, a position that some close to him attributed to a desire to avoid the scrutiny that gambling would bring. During his final year as state senator, however, Farley did attempt to enact legislation to authorize a referendum that would legalize gambling in Atlantic City. The proposed legislation, which was officially sponsored by Farley's political ally Senator Frank X. McDermott (R-Union) because Farley feared a backlash if he publicly appeared to support it, lacked safeguards and was soundly defeated in the Senate.Sternlieb, George and Hughes, James W. The Atlantic City Gamble, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1983 After leaving the legislature In 1971, Farley was defeated in his attempt for reelection by Dr. Joseph McGahn, the Democratic candidate.Carroll, Maurice. \\"DEMOCRATIC GAINS POSTED IN JERSEY; G.O.P.

In the early 1970s, after Farley left office, the Federal Aviation Administration planned to close the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (now known as the William J. Hughes Technical Center) located in the Pomona section of Galloway Township, which was, and still is, one of the largest employers in Atlantic County. Farley, at the request of community leaders, intervened in the fate of the center again by going to administration officials in Washington, ensuring the facility was not closed.Sardella, Carlo M. \\"At 74, Farley Reminisces on Politics\\", The New York Times, December 7, 1975.

In 1974, supporters of legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City succeeded in having a referendum placed on the New Jersey general election ballot that would have permitted casino gambling throughout the state. After the proposal was soundly defeated by voters, some criticized the failure of proponents of the measure to involve Farley in the effort,Staff. \\"Outlook Is Bleak For Atlantic City; Gambling Setback Casts a Pall Over Atlantic City Mayors Unit to Meet\\", The New York Times, November 10, 1974, p. 89.

(Mike) Segal, who had served as Chairman of the Committee to Legalize Gambling and the new direction of Mayor Joseph Lazarow, who served as chairman for the Committee to Rebuild Atlantic City--another pro-gambling organization. The gambling proponents were successful in placing another referendum on the November 1976 ballot that would permit casino gambling in only Atlantic City. This time, casino proponents were much better organized than they had been in 1974, and Segal sought the assistance of Senator Farley, who worked extensively behind the scenes to make gambling a reality for Atlantic City.Sardella, Carlo M. \\"Atlantic City Bets on Casinos\\", The New York Times, July 18, 1976, p. 268. Accessed July 25, 2012. Farley successfully urged old political allies in other parts of the state to support the measure, including Bergen County Sheriff Joseph Job, and some observers estimated that these efforts resulted in hundreds of thousands of votes in favor of casinos.Simon, Bryant. Boardwalk of Dreams, New York, Oxford University Press 2004, , p. 178 This time the referendum was approved by a wide margin. Sanford Weiner, the campaign strategist hired by the pro-casino organization, the Committee to Rebuild Atlantic City, considered obtaining Joseph Job's support for the measure to be the decisive factor in securing the victory. Farley died on September 24, 1977, at his home in Ventnor City, New Jersey. More than 7,000 letters and gifts were delivered to his home from constituents, peers, admirers, and others. Among those delivered to the Farley residence were personal notes from President Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, governors, senators, and assemblymen. The New York Times described Farley as \\"probably the most powerful legislator in New Jersey history\\" further noting that he was \\"an artful negotiator whose backroom wheeling and dealing were legendary\\", and that he \\"was credited with pushing through more special legislation for his district, Atlantic City and Atlantic County, than any other legislator\\".

This principle is named after J.C. Luke, who published it in 1967. This variational principle is for incompressible and inviscid potential flows, and is used to derive approximate wave models like the mild-slope equation, or using the averaged Lagrangian approach for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. Luke's Lagrangian formulation can also be recast into a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of the surface elevation and velocity potential at the free surface. Originally appeared in Zhurnal Prildadnoi Mekhaniki i Tekhnicheskoi Fiziki 9(2): 86‚Äì94, 1968. This is often used when modelling the spectral density evolution of the free-surface in a sea state, sometimes called wave turbulence. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations can be extended to include surface tension effects, and by using Clebsch potentials to include vorticity. Luke's Lagrangian Luke's Lagrangian formulation is for non-linear surface gravity waves on an‚Äîincompressible, irrotational and inviscid‚Äîpotential flow. The relevant ingredients, needed in order to describe this flow, are: *Œ¶(x,z,t) is the velocity potential, *œÅ is the fluid density, *g is the acceleration by the Earth's gravity, *x is the horizontal coordinate vector with components x and y, *x and y are the horizontal coordinates, *z is the vertical coordinate, *t is time, and *‚àá is the horizontal gradient operator, so ‚àáŒ¶ is the horizontal flow velocity consisting of ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇx and ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇy, *V(t) is the time-dependent fluid domain with free surface. The Lagrangian \\\\mathcal{L}, as given by Luke, is: : \\\\mathcal{L} = -\\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\iiint_{V(t)} \\\\rho \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\right^2 \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2 \\\\+ g\\\\, z \\\\right]\\\\; \\\\text{d}x\\\\; \\\\text{d}y\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\; \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t. From Bernoulli's principle, this Lagrangian can be seen to be the integral of the fluid pressure over the whole time-dependent fluid domain V(t). This is in agreement with the variational principles for inviscid flow without a free surface, found by Harry Bateman. Variation with respect to the velocity potential Œ¶(x,z,t) and free-moving surfaces like z=Œ∑(x,t) results in the Laplace equation for the potential in the fluid interior and all required boundary conditions: kinematic boundary conditions on all fluid boundaries and dynamic boundary conditions on free surfaces. This may also include moving wavemaker walls and ship motion. For the case of a horizontally unbounded domain with the free fluid surface at z=Œ∑(x,t) and a fixed bed at z=‚àíh(x), Luke's variational principle results in the Lagrangian: : \\\\mathcal{L} = -\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\right^2 +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\; +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\eta^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t. The bed-level term proportional to h2 in the potential energy has been neglected, since it is a constant and does not contribute in the variations. Below, Luke's variational principle is used to arrive at the flow equations for non-linear surface gravity waves on a potential flow. Derivation of the flow equations resulting from Luke's variational principle The variation \\\\delta\\\\mathcal{L}=0 in the Lagrangian with respect to variations in the velocity potential Œ¶(x,z,t), as well as with respect to the surface elevation Œ∑(x,t), have to be zero. We consider both variations subsequently. =Variation with respect to the velocity potential= Consider a small variation Œ¥Œ¶ in the velocity potential Œ¶. Then the resulting variation in the Lagrangian is: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta_\\\\Phi\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\, &=\\\\, \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\Phi+\\\\delta\\\\Phi,\\\\eta)\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\Phi,\\\\eta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\delta\\\\Phi)}{\\\\partial t} +\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} (\\\\delta\\\\Phi) +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z}\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\delta \\\\Phi)}{\\\\partial z}\\\\, \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\, \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t. \\\\end{align} Using Leibniz integral rule, this becomes, in case of constant density œÅ: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta_\\\\Phi\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\, =\\\\, &-\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\delta\\\\Phi\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\; +\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\delta\\\\Phi\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\, \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\ &+\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\delta\\\\Phi\\\\; \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z^2} \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\, \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\ &+\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\eta\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)\\\\, \\\\delta\\\\Phi \\\\right]_{z=\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\ &-\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} h\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)\\\\, \\\\delta\\\\Phi \\\\right]_{z=-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\ =\\\\, &0\\\\. \\\\end{align} The first integral on the right-hand side integrates out to the boundaries, in x and t, of the integration domain and is zero since the variations Œ¥Œ¶ are taken to be zero at these boundaries. For variations Œ¥Œ¶ which are zero at the free surface and the bed, the second integral remains, which is only zero for arbitrary Œ¥Œ¶ in the fluid interior if there the Laplace equation holds: :\\\\Delta \\\\Phi\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{ for } -h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})\\\\, <\\\\, z\\\\, <\\\\, \\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t), with Œî=‚àá*‚àá \\\\+ ‚àÇ2/‚àÇz2 the Laplace operator. If variations Œ¥Œ¶ are considered which are only non-zero at the free surface, only the third integral remains, giving rise to the kinematic free-surface boundary condition: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\eta\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z}\\\\, =\\\\, 0. \\\\qquad \\\\text{ at } z\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t).

This is the Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow, applied at the free surface, and with the pressure above the free surface being a constant ‚Äî which constant pressure is taken equal to zero for simplicity. Hamiltonian formulation The Hamiltonian structure of surface gravity waves on a potential flow was discovered by Vladimir E. Zakharov in 1968, and rediscovered independently by Bert Broer and John Miles: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &=\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\delta\\\\varphi},\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &=\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\delta\\\\eta}, \\\\end{align} where the surface elevation Œ∑ and surface potential œÜ ‚Äî which is the potential Œ¶ at the free surface z=Œ∑(x,t) ‚Äî are the canonical variables. The Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\varphi,\\\\eta) is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the fluid: :\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\int_{-h(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}^{\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)} \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\left \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\right^2\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]\\\\, \\\\text{d}z\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\eta^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}. The additional constraint is that the flow in the fluid domain has to satisfy Laplace's equation with appropriate boundary condition at the bottom z=-h(x) and that the potential at the free surface z=Œ∑ is equal to œÜ: \\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}/\\\\delta\\\\Phi\\\\,=\\\\,0. Relation with Lagrangian formulation The Hamiltonian formulation can be derived from Luke's Lagrangian description by using Leibniz integral rule on the integral of ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇt: :\\\\mathcal{L}_H = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\varphi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, -\\\\, H(\\\\varphi,\\\\eta;\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\; \\\\text{d}t, with \\\\varphi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)=\\\\Phi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),t) the value of the velocity potential at the free surface, and H(\\\\varphi,\\\\eta;\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) the Hamiltonian density ‚Äî sum of the kinetic and potential energy density ‚Äî and related to the Hamiltonian as: :\\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\varphi,\\\\eta)\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\iint H(\\\\varphi,\\\\eta;\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)\\\\; \\\\text{d}\\\\boldsymbol{x}. The Hamiltonian density is written in terms of the surface potential using Green's third identity on the kinetic energy: : H\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\sqrt{ 1\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\left \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\eta \\\\right^2}\\\\;\\\\; \\\\varphi\\\\, \\\\bigl( D(\\\\eta)\\\\; \\\\varphi \\\\bigr)\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\eta^2, where D(Œ∑) œÜ is equal to the normal derivative of ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇn at the free surface. Because of the linearity of the Laplace equation ‚Äî valid in the fluid interior and depending on the boundary condition at the bed z=-h and free surface z=Œ∑ ‚Äî the normal derivative ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇn is a linear function of the surface potential œÜ, but depends non-linear on the surface elevation Œ∑. This is expressed by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator D(Œ∑), acting linearly on œÜ. The Hamiltonian density can also be written as: : H\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\varphi\\\\, \\\\Bigl[ w\\\\, \\\\left( 1\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\left \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\eta \\\\right^2 \\\\right) -\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\eta \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\, \\\\varphi \\\\Bigr]\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\eta^2, with w(x,t) = ‚àÇŒ¶/‚àÇz the vertical velocity at the free surface z = Œ∑. Also w is a linear function of the surface potential œÜ through the Laplace equation, but w depends non-linear on the surface elevation Œ∑: :w\\\\, =\\\\, W(\\\\eta)\\\\, \\\\varphi, with W operating linear on œÜ, but being non-linear in Œ∑. As a result, the Hamiltonian is a quadratic functional of the surface potential œÜ. Also the potential energy part of the Hamiltonian is quadratic. The source of non-linearity in surface gravity waves is through the kinetic energy depending non-linear on the free surface shape Œ∑. Further ‚àáœÜ is not to be mistaken for the horizontal velocity ‚àáŒ¶ at the free surface: : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\varphi\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\Phi\\\\bigl(\\\\boldsymbol{x},\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),t\\\\bigr)\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z}\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\eta \\\\right]_{z=\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)}\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\Bigl[ \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\Phi \\\\Bigr]_{z=\\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t)}\\\\, +\\\\, w\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\eta. Taking the variations of the Lagrangian \\\\mathcal{L}_H with respect to the canonical variables \\\\varphi(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) and \\\\eta(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) gives: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\eta}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &=\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\delta\\\\varphi},\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &=\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\delta\\\\eta}, \\\\end{align} provided in the fluid interior Œ¶ satisfies the Laplace equation, ŒîŒ¶=0, as well as the bottom boundary condition at z=-h and Œ¶=œÜ at the free surface.

The name, but not the move, is due to Tim Cochran. Let K be a component of the link in the diagram and J be a component that circles K as a meridian. Suppose K has integer coefficient n and J has coefficient a rational number r. Then we can obtain a new diagram by deleting J and changing the coefficient of K to n-1/r. This is the slam-dunk. The name of the move is suggested by the proof that these diagrams give the same 3-manifold. First, do the surgery on K, replacing a tubular neighborhood of K by another solid torus T according to the surgery coefficient n. Since J is a meridian, it can be pushed, or \\"slam dunked\\", into T. Since n is an integer, J intersects the meridian of T once, and so J must be isotopic to a longitude of T. Thus when we now do surgery on J, we can think of it as replacing T by another solid torus. This replacement, as shown by a simple calculation, is given by coefficient n - 1/r. The inverse of the slam-dunk can be used to change any rational surgery diagram into an integer one, i.e. a surgery diagram on a framed link.

Held between May and October 1990, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, it lasted 157 days, and received over three million visitors. Attractions included public art displays, a Ferris wheel, and dance, music, theatre and sporting events. The site comprised four areas: Norwood, Riverside, Dunston and Eslington Park, and several modes of transport were provided around the site: a monorail which ran between Norwood and Eslington, a narrow gauge steam railway between Dunston and Redheugh, and a road train which covered the entire site. A ferry across the River Tyne, between Dunston Staithes and Newcastle Quayside, was also provided. The festival site was created over a two-year period, on of derelict land, previously the site of a gasworks, a coal depot and a coking plant. The cost of reclaiming and redeveloping the land was around ¬£37 million. The Evening Chronicle reported: \\"Around 50,000 cubic metres of discarded coal and coke over 25 acres was removed and the area capped with layers of limestone. [‚Ä¶] Nearly two million trees and shrubs and 1.2m bulbs were planted. Enough turf was laid to cover 1,000 domestic lawns and three tonnes of grass seed was sown. Five thousand previously unemployed people were trained for roles in the festival.\\" After the festival ended, much of the site was replaced by housing. Reflecting on the Festival's 25th anniversary in 2015, the Evening Chronicle noted: \\"It [is] also held to have kick started a process which resulted in the Baltic centre, Sage Gateshead and the Millennium Bridge\\".

Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner. Examples of open-ended questions: *Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor. *How do you see your future? *Tell me about the children in this photograph. *What is the purpose of government? *Why did you choose that answer?  Education: open questioning  The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking 'good' questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to closed questions (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for testing. Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley's central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are \\"grammatically closed, but conceptually open\\". For example, in standard parlance, 'is it ever right to lie?' would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be 'opened up' by the questioner ('why do you think that?,' 'Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, \\"gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question\\". Closed questions, simply require 'opening up' strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls 'guess what's in my head' teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.

He served as the Magistrate of Taoyuan County from 1989 until his death in 1996. Taoyuan County is now Taoyuan City, and the office of the Magistrate is now the office of the Mayor. Allegations The Control Yuan indicted Liu due to his role in a corruption case involving the extracting of around $360 million U.S. dollars from the Chungli Farmers' Association. Liu also had been placed under investigation in a separate land speculation deal. Asiaweek reported that some people said that he forged his master's degree. For seven years prosecutors attempted to place Liu in prison. Death On November 21, 1996, Liu and seven others died in an \\"execution style\\" shooting at his residence. A county councilor survived the incident but suffered serious head injuries, memory loss, and a severed spinal cord. Police believe that two killers entered the residence in the early morning, surprising the guards, who were about to change shifts. After subduing the guards, the killers took the guards' guns and bullets, rounded up the occupants of the residence, and bound them. After blindfolding the victims and forcing them to kneel, the killers shot them in their heads. The killers stole a car from one of the victims (Chuang Shun-hsing); a secretary (Liang Mei-chiao) was still in the car, but she was left at the base of Hutou Mountain, where the killers stopped to rendezvous with their accomplices and abandon the stolen car. Residence Occupants * Liu Pang-yu (), Taoyuan County Commissioner (killed). * Chuang Shun-hsing (), County Assemblyman (killed). His car was stolen as the getaway vehicle. * Hsu Chun-kuo (), confidential secretary to the county government (killed). * Liu Pang-ming (), driver for the commissioner (killed). * Chang Tao-mei (), wife of the chief of the County Bureau of Agriculture (killed). * Liu Ju-mei (), a maid or a cook (killed). * Liu Pang-liang (), a guard (killed). * Liu Ming-chi (), a guard (killed). * Teng Wen-chang (), County Assemblyman (survived with injuries). * Liang Mei- chiao (), Teng's secretary (survived unhurt). * Judy, a foreign maid (survived). * Peng Yu-ying (), Liu's wife (survived unhurt). Investigations and Theories Authorities have not solved the crime; some Taiwanese police believe that Chinese gang members recruited from \\"a local group\\" killed Liu and the others. Some investigators believe that \\"conflicts of interest\\" in Liu's politics led to his death. Others believe that Liu's guards may have been involved in gambling. One of the key suspects in Liu's murder, Yang Shih- kang () escaped police custody in 1999. He had a history of abducting politicians and smuggling weapons, which led police to suspect him for Liu's murder. Yang was initially arrested in 1999 after returning to Taiwan; while under police escort to locate his hidden weapon caches, Yang overpowered his escort and escaped with the help of accomplices. Yang was later detained in 2003 in Xiamen on an unrelated robbery charge. The statute of limitations ran out in 2016, closing the case, which prompted some DPP lawmakers to propose the removal of the twenty-year statute for murder cases and major economic crimes. Impact At the time the shooting was the deadliest mass murder in Taiwanese history, and Liu was the only high-ranked government official to be assassinated in his term. The nature of the shootings and the photographs of the aftermath shocked the Taiwanese. A special by-election was held on to fill the vacant office of Taoyuan County Magistrate; Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected, defeating Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Fang Li-hsiu and breaking the KMT hold on the office. The execution-style slaying of Liu was thought to have revealed governmental corruption, which was cited as one reason Lu won, despite pre-election polls predicting a KMT victory. Alt URL Liu's death, along with two later well-publicized murder cases, led to mass demonstrations in May 1997. Demonstrators marched on and , demanding Premier Lien Chan's resignation over the perceived rise in violent crime as evidenced by the then-unsolved murders of Pai Hsiao-yen, Peng Wan-ru, and Liu Pang-yu.

Originally interpreted as a hexactinellid sponge, the organism also bears some coelomate characteristics, including bilateral symmetry. Morphology The organisms take the form of a rounded, dome-like bag, 7-68 mm in diameter, with an uneven margin. Radial grooves define sac- like compartments within the bag. The radial pattern has an element of bilateral symmetry. A stalk emerges from the central point of some specimens, at the top of the organism; in life, it probably extended into the water column. Ray-like filaments radiate outwards from the edge of the bag. Some structures in the organism have been interpreted as spicules. Ecology The organisms have been interpreted as tall suspension feeders, reaching 10 cm or more up into the sea water above them. Original description The genus was originally considered to be a member of the Dictyospongiidae family (hexactinellia), and was among the first Precambrian sponges to be described.

Built in 1926, it is one of the community's most prominent examples of large-scale Colonial Revival architecture, and is historically important as a major element in the popularization of downhill skiing in the area. The inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Eastern Slope Inn stands at the northern fringe of the commercial downtown area of North Conway, on the west side of White Mountain Highway, the town's principal thoroughfare. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof crowned at its center by an open widow's walk. A four-column pedimented gable projects at the center of the main facade, and single-story porches extend from it to either side; that on the left has been enclosed. The interior features richly decorated public spaces. The hotel was built in 1926. It was designed by Harold E. Mason of Haynes & Mason, architects of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, with apparent inspiration from the Mount Vernon estate in Virginia. It was the third hotel on the site, the first two (dating to 1864) having succumbed to fire. Originally the Hotel Randall, it was purchased in 1937 by Harvey Dow Gibson, a native of North Conway, who was by then president of Manufacturers Trust Company of New York. Gibson added the hotel to the Manufacturers Trust's National Hotel Management Company (NMH) range of hotels, which was then overseen by hotel pioneer Ralph Hitz. The hotel was renamed the Eastern Slope Inn as part of a larger effort to promote downhill skiing in the area. Gibson developed the nearby Cranmore Mountain Resort into one of the most successful ski areas of the time, and used the Eastern Slope Inn as a year-round facility. In 1977 the inn was purchased by Eastern Mountain Sports and converted into a retail establishment. As part of this conversion many of the public spaces were altered to accommodate retail functions. Around 1982 it was sold to an ownership group, which has rehabilitated the property and converted it back into a hotel.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description The North Conway 5 and 10 Cent Store occupies a prominent position on the east side of Main Street in downtown North Conway, at its junction with Kearsarge Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with a gabled roof that is obscured by the western-style false front, which extends a full three stories. The ground floor has a single storefront, with plate glass windows flanking a recessed entrance, and a secondary entrance at the far right. Three sash windows are irregularly spaced on the second floor, and a single sash window appears at the center of the third floor. The interior's appearance dates to the turn of the 20th century, with a tin ceiling and plaster walls with vertical board wainscoting, counter displays of glass and wood, and maple floors. An ell at the rear of the store has linoleum flooring and acoustic paneling on the walls, with a dropped ceiling above. History Interior view The building's original construction date is estimated to be about 1840, but its present appearance dates to a major renovation c. 1900. The rear ell was added about 1940. The false front is the only one of its type in North Conway. The store has been in continuous operation since 1939, under several different owners.

Early career After graduating from Warrensburg-Latham High School in Illinois in 1952, Rotz went to work at Fairmount Park Racetrack in Collinsville, Illinois. After working as a groom, hot walker, and exercise rider, he began riding professionally in 1953. Nicknamed \\"Gentleman John\\" because of his polite demeanor, he gained a reputation for being able to handle temperamental Thoroughbreds. Riding career During a 20-year riding career, Rotz won many of the most important races across the United States. In 1969 and 1970, he won more stakes races than any other jockey in American racing. He earned two wins in the American Classic Races, the first coming in 1962 when he rode Greek Money to victory in the Preakness Stakes, A year earlier, he finished second in the Preakness aboard Globemaster and earned another second-place finish in 1968 with King Ranch's Out of the Way. He got his second Classic race win aboard High Echelon in the 1970 Belmont Stakes. In 1973, Rotz was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, given to a jockey in North America who demonstrates high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack. He retired from riding that year following surgery for a foot injury, but he remained active in the industry, working for ten years as a racing steward at various racetracks in Louisiana, Ohio, Delaware, and New York. While working at Thistledown Racecourse in North Randall, Ohio in 1975, he met his wife, Mary, whose sister was a horse trainer at the track.

He is a Professor of Bioengineering at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and an Adjunct Professor in the departments of Biology and Chemistry at Dartmouth. Gerngross has been an active inventor and to date his work has resulted in the founding of five companies (GlycoFi, Inc., Adimab LLC, Arsanis, Inc., Alector LLC and Avitide, Inc.) and over a dozen U.S. and international patents. Academic background Gerngross received a M.S. (Dipl. Ing.) in Chemical Engineering (1989) and later a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. Following his studies in Austria he became a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Arnold Demain (1989‚Äì91) and later joined the laboratory of Anthony Sinskey and JoAnne Stubbe at MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate from 1991 to 1993. From 1993 till 1998 he headed the fermentation and process development group at Metabolix Inc., a small startup company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1998 he left industry to join the faculty at Dartmouth where he focused his research on protein engineering, glycoprotein engineering in yeast, and life cycle analysis of competing manufacturing technologies. In addition to this work, Gerngross‚Äô lab also developed a novel protein expression system based on the industrial fermentation organisms Ralstonia eutropha, formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus. With certain model proteins, this expression system has shown to outperform E. coli, the well proven workhorse of prokaryotic protein expression. The work on Ralstonia eutropha was later expanded in collaboration with Prof. Wood at Princeton University to combine recombinant expression of proteins with the ability to purify them in vivo. In the late 1990s Gerngross became one of the first vocal critics of biobased processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States. Arguably, Gerngross' most important biotechnological contribution consisted of humanizing the glycosylation machinery in yeast to produce human therapeutic proteins, including antibodies, with fully human carbohydrate structures. Much of this work was conducted at Glycofi, Inc., a Lebanon, New Hampshire biotechnology startup company that was acquired in 2006 by Merck in a record-setting $400 million transaction. His work has been frequently cited in the popular press including The Times (London), CNN, Scientific American, BBC, The Guardian, The Economist, New Scientist, Nature Biotechnology and the Los Angeles Times. Industry experience In 2000 Gerngross co-founded Glycofi, Inc.http://www.glycofi.com and served as the company's Chief Scientific Officer until its acquisition by Merck & Co. in the spring of 2006. In the fall of 2006 Dr. Gerngross joined SV Life Sciences as a venture partnerhttp://www.svlsa.com/pages/people/gerngross_tillman.html where he advises on investments in the bio-therapeutics area. SV Life Sciences manages five investment funds with an aggregate capital of about $1.6 billion. In 2007 Dr. Gerngross co-founded Adimab LLC. with Prof. Dane Wittruphttp://web.mit.edu/kdw-lab/ at MIT and Errik B. Anderson to develop a novel platform for the discovery of human antibodies in yeast. To date the company has raised five rounds of venture financing from Polaris Ventures, SV Life Sciences, Google Ventures, OrbiMed Advisors, and Borealis Ventureshttp://sis.windhover.com/buy/abstract.php?id=2007900151 and employs about 70 people in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

She was built in Bordeaux to a 32-gun design by Raymond-Antoine Haran and launched in 1779. She took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781, and in the subsequent Siege of Yorktown, under Sainte-Eulalie. She underwent repairs at Rochefort several times, in January to April 1783 and in May 1790. In 1791 she was coppered, and then underwent further repairs in 1794. On 11 June 1794 she was cruising in the Channel when she encountered and chased the 14-gun cutter off Brest. Ranger engaged in some proforma resistance and then struck. The French treated Rangers crew badly, stripping the men naked and keeping them on deck for two days until they arrived at Brest. The French Navy took Ranger into service and kept her name. Privateer In 1797 the French navy disposed of Railleuse. She became the French privateer √âgyptienne, a 36-gun ship with a crew of 120 based at Bordeaux. In December 1800, the hired armed cutter Nimrod recaptured the Skene, Crawly, master, which had been sailing from Dublin to London when the privateer Egyptian captured Skene.

Capture On 23 March 1804, the British 18-gun sloop Osprey gave chase to four ships that turned out to be a frigate and three merchant ships. Osprey badly damaged the frigate √âgyptienne in a close, 80-minute action near Barbados before √âgyptienne used her superior speed to escape. Osprey lost one man killed and 16 wounded in the action and her hull and rigging were badly damaged.Clowes, p. 341; Colledge, p. 251. On the 25th, Osprey and the British 18-gun sloop Hippomenes recaptured the Reliance, one of several prizes that √âgyptienne had taken. From the prize master the British found out the identity of the vessel that Osprey had fought. On 25 March 1804 or 27 March 1804Clowes, p. 342 Hippomenes captured the damaged √âgyptienne after a 54-hour chase followed by a three-hour, 20-minute single-ship action. √âgyptienne was under the command of M. Placiard and had a crew of 255 men. After Hippomenses captured √âgyptienne, the British found out that she had lost eight men killed and 19 wounded in the fight with Osprey. Hippomenes had only one man slightly wounded. British service and fate The British took √âgyptienne into service as HMS Antigua as there was already an Egyptienne in the Royal Navy. Because √âgyptienne was twenty-five years old, and battered, the Navy decided against sending her to sea again. Lieutenant James Middleton commissioned her in December 1808 and commanded her until 1815. From December 1808 Antigua served as a prison hulk until scrapped in 1816.Colledge (1987), p. 34.

Development The Ph√∂nix D.I was the second design developed by the Ph√∂nix Flugzeug-Werke based on Hansa- Brandenburg D.I design which it has produced under licence. The D.I was a single-seat biplane fighter with improvements over the original Hansa- Brandenburg design which included more efficient wings, a more powerful engine and structural improvements. A prototype was first flown in 1917 and proved to be fast but difficult to handle but because of the urgent need for fighters the D.I entered production. To improve the problems a modified variant, the D.II was introduced with balanced elevators and balanced ailerons on the upper wings. A further development was the D.III which had balanced ailerons on both wings and a more powerful Hiero 6 in-line engine. The last of 158 aircraft of all three types was delivered on 4 November 1918. Operational service Army D.I's entered service in December 1917. It was used as an escort fighter by Fliks 4/D, 15/D, 17/D, 48/D, 54/D and 66/D. (D-Fliks were small general- purpose units, capable of short-range reconnaissance, bombing, defense and artillery-spotting duties, consisting of 4-5 aircraft, both single-seat fighters and twin-seat observation/light bomber types.) It was used as a fighter in Fliks 14/J, 30/J, 60/J, 61/J and 63/J. (J-Fliks - J for \\"Jagd\\", i.e. Hunting - were fighter units, having an official complement of 18 aircraft, something that very few had in practice.) It was favorably received by pilots, not least by those that were used to flying twin-seaters who found it stable, robust and easy to fly. (One complaint however, was that the D.I was \\"almost too stable for quick combat maneuvers\\".) Some were equipped with cameras and thus converted to dedicated reconnaissance machines. Ph√∂nix D.I in Austro-Hungarian service Several Austro-Hungarian aces used this aircraft, among them Kurt Gruber, Roman Schmidt, Karl Teichmann, Godwin Brumowski, Benno Fiala Ritter von Fernbrugg, Franz Gr√§ser, Karl Nikitsch, Frank Linke-Crawford and J√≥zsef Kiss - who was killed while flying a D.II on May 24, 1918.

Hiller was manager and songwriter for the group, but they had recently disbanded and keen to keep the name alive, which was still in demand for television work, he recruited Stevens alongside Martin Lee and Lee Sheriden. In 1973, signed to Deram Records, they released their first single, \\"Happy Ever After\\". Later in the year another female singer was added to the group, Sandra Stevens and as a four-piece, Brotherhood of Man went on to enjoy great success around the world.

She has also won four medals in the World Championships, winning gold in successive years, in 2010 and in 2011. Early life Watkins was born and raised in Leek, Staffordshire, where she attended Westwood College. She studied Natural Sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she started rowing in 2001. Sporting career She took her first strokes with Newnham College Boat Club and was captain of lower boats and then secretary for the club. Watkins represents Leander Club in rowing events. At Cambridge, her college crew were Head of the Cam in 2003, before she moved onto the World Class Start talent identification programme run by UK sport, and based at Rob Roy Boat Club. In 2004, she made her international debut, winning a gold medal in the Coxless IVs at the World Under 23 Regatta in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland with crewmates Natasha Page, Beth Rodford and Alison Knowles. In 2005, Watkins made her senior international debut with the Women's Eight, achieving a fifth place at the World Championships in Gifu, Japan. She also won an Under 23 bronze medal at the World U23 Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. In 2006, Watkins switched to sculling and began competing in the double scull, a boat class she has remained with since then. The World Championships in 2006 were on home water at Eton Dorney. Watkins partnered Annabel Vernon, and they came in fourth place, having won the World Cup series earlier that season. For the next two years, Watkins's partner was Elise Laverick. In this combination, they won bronze medals at both the World Championships and at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The Olympic medal came after a difficult season battling with glandular fever, and at the time was the closest any British oarswoman had come to an Olympic gold with the three medal winning crews separated by 0.23 seconds. In 2009, Watkins once more partnered Annabel Vernon and won a silver medal at the World Championships in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. In 2010, Watkins joined forces with Katherine Grainger for the first time. In their double scull they had an unbeaten season, culminating in their victory at the World Championships in New Zealand. They were named World Rowing Female Crew of the year and also \\"The Sunday Times Women's Sports Team of the Year\\" for 2010. Individually, Watkins became Champion of the Thames in the annual championships, the Wingfield Sculls. In 2011, Watkins beat Grainger in the British Rowing Team trials. They joined forces again in the double scull and continued their unbeaten run, finishing the season with another World Championships gold. Watkins retained her title in the Wingfield Sculls, setting a new record time. At the 2012 London Olympics, Watkins and Grainger broke the Olympic record in the semi-final of the double sculls. Subsequently, they won the final to take the gold medal. Watkins was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours, for services to rowing. Cabinet Office In August 2015, six months after the birth of her second child, Watkins announced her intention to return to competition, and to target the 2016 Rio Olympics. Had she been successful, she would have been the first mother to represent Great Britain in rowing, and possibly the first woman to compete in consecutive Olympics whilst having two children in between. In February 2016, she announced that she was pulling out of the British Olympic rowing programme for Rio 2016, citing her performance, saying \\"This is not a decision that I've taken lightly. I guess I would have always wondered about what might have been if I hadn't given it a go.\\" Personal life In September 2009, she married Oliver Watkins, a part-time rowing coach, who was studying for a PhD in engineering at Cambridge, where the couple met. The couple live in Wokingham, where Oliver works for the McLaren Formula One team as a suspension specialist. Anna announced in March 2013, that the couple were expecting their first child, due in September 2013. Anna gave birth to a boy which they named William James. Anna had a second boy in February 2015. Anna holds a PhD in mathematics from the University of Reading.

She was a member of the Trapp Family Singers, whose lives were the inspiration for the play and film The Sound of Music.Crook III, Lawrence. \\"Maria von Trapp, Last of Famous Singing Siblings, Dies at 99\\". Atlanta, Georgia: CNN, February 24, 2014. She was portrayed as the character \\"Marta\\". Early life Johanna was born on September 7, 1919 at the \\"Erlhof\\" by Zell am See in Austria, as the fourth daughter of Georg and Agathe von Trapp and first child after World War I. She had brown hair and brown eyes, and grew up in Zell am See with her siblings: Rupert (1911‚Äì1992) Agathe (1913‚Äì2010), Maria Franziska (1914‚Äì2014), Werner (1915‚Äì2007) and Hedwig (1917‚Äì1972). The last child, Martina (1921‚Äì1951), was born in Klosterneuburg by Wien (Austria). During the war (WWI) Georg, Agathe and their children, unable to stay at their home in Pola, Istria (today Croatia) came to live with her mother, Agathe Whitehead (n√©e Breunner-Enkevoirth), at Whitehead summer home, the \\"Raingut\\" in Erlberg (by Zell am See).The family then moved from Zell-am-See to Klosterneuburg, because their home became flooded and was no longer inhabitable. In 1922, when Johanna was three years old, her mother died of scarlet fever. Many years later she still recalled looking out the children's nursery window to see a black coach drawn by black horses come to carry her mother to her final resting place in Klosterneuburg. Her childhood was structured by nannies and spent playing with her younger sisters, while the older siblings were going to school. In 1925 Georg moved the family to Salzburg-Aigen. He had purchased and rebuilt a house that now became their new home. In 1927, Georg Johannes von Trapp was married for the second time to Maria Augusta Kutschera. Three more children were born into the von Trapp family: Rosemarie (1929), Eleonore (1931), and Johannes (1939).Wild, Wolfgang. \\"The True Story Behind 'The Sound of Music': Solving a problem like the real Maria\\".

Stowe, Vermont: Stowe Today, January 25, 2018. Just 20 years old, departing Oct. 27th from Bergensford (Sweden) on the 'American Farmer' she and her family began an uncertain unknown journey. Their arrival in the United States began with a stay at Ellis Island, from where they were admitted and shortly thereafter began recording the first album released by RCA. Johanna sang first soprano in the family chorus, together with her sister Agathe von Trapp. After World War II ended, the Trapp family held summer music camps in Stowe Vermont, at which Johanna von Trapp taught aspiring musicians the recorder, cooked for the camp guests and her family. She was secretary of the Trapp Family Austrian Relief, Inc., co-founded by her father Captain Georg von Trapp, to aide his fellow Austrians caught in dire post WWII needs. Their relief effort partnered with CARE (Cooperative for American Remittance to Europe and now Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) to send relief packages of food and clothing to Austria. From 1946 to 1950 they sent a total of 275,000 pounds of material. Throughout her singing career and later during her married life, Johanna found time to express her other artistic talents, working with ceramics, sketching and painting water colors. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1948. Johanna von Trapp married Ernst Florian Winter on Easter Monday in 1948 and changed her middle name to Franziska. She had seven children: Ernst Leopold (1949‚Äì1969), Florian Stefan (1951), Johanna Maria (1952), Notburga Maria (1953), Hemma Maria (1956 ), Agathe (1957 ) and Severin (1959 ). She lived with her family ‚Äì four daughters and three sons ‚Äì in both the United States (West Nyack, NY) and Austria (Salzburg, Schloss Eichbuechl N.O.). With Ernst Florian, she raised her children in an organic homesteading tradition incorporating her rich European heritage into family life. She was known for her hosting, cooking and preparing feast day meals that often were shared with upwards of 50 guests. Her indomitable go-to spirit and ability to persevere through the loss of her oldest son from a car accident, showed her strength and resilience. She was known to her children as the story teller of her childhood life in the von Trapp family. Approaching life with a great sense of humor and faith, carried her throughout her life. During her later years, she focused on painting watercolors and sharing with an up-and-coming younger audience of Sound of Music performers, the true life story behind the musical. Her artwork charmingly expresses flora and fauna in colorful vignettes with an Edelweiss series as a tribute to her father whom she adored and respected. With her sisters Agathe and Maria, Johanna held an exhibition of their combined works of art, in Salzburg 1993. The following year, she died in Vienna after the effects of a stroke, at the age of 75. Her final resting place is with her husband Ernst Florian Winter (1923‚Äì2014) and oldest son, Ernst Leopold, at Gersthof, Vienna, Austria.

He played his entire Major League career with the New York Mets. Early career Kelvin Chapman attended Santa Rosa Junior College. He was signed by the Mets organization as an amateur free agent on December 3, 1975. His first season as a professional was with the Met's Rookie League team, Marion Mets of the Appalachian League in 1976. That season he played 62 games and had a batting average of .269, a slugging percentage of .347, and an on- base percentage of .342. The following year he was promoted to the Mets A-league team, the Wausau Mets of the Midwest League. In 127 games his batting average improved to .306, his slugging percentage improved to .456 and his on- base percentage improved to .378. This performance led to another promotion to the Mets AA-league team, the Jackson Mets of the Texas League for the 1978 season. The team featured several other future New York Mets players, including Mookie Wilson, Neil Allen and Jeff Reardon. Chapman played 131 games for Jackson, 129 of which were at second base. He posted a batting average of .266, a slugging percentage of .383, and an on-base percentage of .347. Major League debut Although he had never played AAA baseball, and although his performance at Jackson was not outstanding, Chapman had an excellent spring training in 1979 for the Mets and earned a spot as the Mets starting second baseman to begin the season. He replaced strong fielding but light hitting Doug Flynn, who was the Mets regular second baseman in 1978. Chapman's major league debut occurred on April 5, 1979 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. He got 2 hits in 5 at-bats in his debut. However, Chapman only batted .150 for the Mets in 80 at bats that season, relinquishing the starting second base job back to Flynn by late April. He was sent to the minors in May, returning to the Mets only in September after the minor league season ended. Chapman played for the Mets AAA-league team, the Tidewater Tides of the International League for most of the 1979 season. He played 106 games as second base for the Tides, with a batting average of .241, a slugging percentage of .318 and an on-base percentage of .341. From 1980 through 1983 Chapman played in AAA without getting back to the Major Leagues. He played with Tidewater in 1980, 1982 and 1983, and with the Syracuse Chiefs in 1981. During that time he played primarily second base, but also played a few games at third base, shortstop and outfield. He batted poorly in 1980 and 1981 but improved in 1982 and 1983. He also played for Tidewater at the beginning of 1984. Return to the Major Leagues The Mets regular second baseman in 1984 was Wally Backman, a switch hitter who was much better when batting lefty. The Mets needed a right-handed hitting second baseman to platoon with Backman. After Chapman got off to a strong start with Tidewater in 1984, he was recalled to the Mets in May, more than 4 years after his previous Major League game in 1979. His first game for the Mets in 1984 was on May 6. Chapman played 75 games for the Mets in 1984, finishing with a batting average of .289, a slugging percentage of .401 and an on-base percentage of .356, helping the Mets finish 2nd in the National League East. Chapman also posted a league average fielding percentage in 57 games at second base of .979 that season, also playing 3 games at third base for the Mets. In 1985, Chapman continued to platoon with Backman as the Mets second basemen. On June 1, 1985, the Mets were playing the San Diego Padres and were down 2-0 when the Mets rallied for three runs in the sixth inning, a rally that was spurred on by Chapman and Ray Knight. Chapman got the rally going by leading off the inning with a single. Not long after Knight singled, George Foster hit a ball that scored both Chapman and Knight.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1985-06-02-sp-15078-story.html However, he did not hit as well as he did the prior season. With a batting average of just .174, Chapman was sent back to the Tidewater Tides after playing his last Major League game on July 24, 1985. Chapman batted just .185 with Tidewater in 1985 and was released by the Mets after the season on November 13, 1985. The Mets did make an offer to remain in the organization, as perhaps a manager in their farm system, but Chapman, who had injured his knee during the 1985 season, opted retire and return home to California.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/sports/sports-of- the-times-for-kelvin-chapman-life-after-baseball.html References External links 1956 births Living people Major League Baseball second basemen New York Mets players Baseball players from California Wausau Mets players People from Willits, California Tidewater Tides players Jackson Mets players Marion Mets players Syracuse Chiefs players Santa Rosa Bear Cubs baseball players ","title":"Kelvin Chapman"},{"id":"18894992","text":"Christiane Huth (born 12 September 1980, Suhl, Germany) is a German rower.

The name of Italy has a long history originating in antiquity. During the Roman Empire, it was extended to refer to the whole Italian geographical region (including the islands of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica). History Italy according to the ancient Greeks, corresponding to the current Calabria Italia, the ancient name of the Italian peninsula, which is also eponymous of the modern republic, originally applied only to a part of what is now Southern Italy. According to Antiochus of Syracuse, it included only the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula (modern Calabria): the actual province of Reggio Calabria and part of the modern provinces of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia. The town of Catanzaro has a road sign (in Italian) also stating this fact. But by this time Oenotria and Italy had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. Coins bearing the name V√≠teli√∫ in Oscan (, also see discussion of the etymology below) were minted by an alliance of Italic peoples (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) competing with Rome in the 1st century BC.Guillotining, M., History of Earliest Italy, trans. Ryle, M & Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p.50 Expansion of the territory called \\"Italia\\" until emperor Diocletian. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name Italia to a larger region, but it was during the reign of Augustus, at the end of the 1st century BC, that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps, now entirely under Roman rule.Pallottino, M., History of Earliest Italy, trans. Ryle, M & Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p. 50 Under Emperor Diocletian the Roman region called \\"Italia\\" was further enlarged with the addition of the three big islands of the western Mediterranean Sea: Sicily (with the Maltese archipelago), Sardinia and Corsica. Dante in the 14th century wrote that the borders of what is geographically and historically called \\"Italia\\" are clearly defined in the north by the Alps (from the Vare river near Montecarlo to the Arsa River in Istria) and, going down the Italian peninsula, in the south by Sicily and its islands. Etymology The ultimate etymology of the name is uncertain, in spite of numerous suggestions.Alberto Manco, Italia. Disegno storico- linguistico, 2009, Naples, L'Orientale, According to the most widely accepted explanation, Latin OLD, p. 974: \\"first syll. naturally short (cf. Quint. Inst. 1.5.18), and so scanned in Lucil.825, but in dactylic verse lengthened metri gratia.\\" may derive from Oscan v√≠teli√∫, meaning \\"[land] of young cattle\\" (c.f.

Adams, Encyclopedia of Indo- European Culture (London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997), 24. The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War. Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that Italy was named after Italus,Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.35, on LacusCurtius mentioned also by AristotleAristotle, Politics, 7.1329b, on Perseus and Thucydides.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 6.2.4, on Perseus After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Lombard invasions, \\"Italia\\" was retained as the name for their kingdom, and for its successor kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire, which nominally lasted until 1806, although it had de facto disintegrated due to factional politics pitting the empire against the ascendant city republics in the 13th century.

The Ray family left their farm in 1946 so the children could benefit from a school education. A year later, John was still moving equipment and the family's belongings out to Clearwater on the long trail south through the Clearwater Valley. His last trip to the farm was in December 1947 and he died there of a heart attack. Alice died in 1959 at age 47 from cancer. Their graves are near the house.Neave, Roland (2015).

This formation is called a tuya. The ice covered the mountain again after the eruption ended. Mount Ray has a distinctly red summit and can be seen from Clearwater Lake. Dragon Cone, just east of Ray Lake, erupted about 7,500 years ago and the lava, called the Dragon's Tongue, flowed down Falls Creek Valley. Ray Lake was dammed and enlarged by this lava. The toe of this lava flow dammed the Clearwater River and raised the level of Clearwater Lake by about .

Alison-Madueke (born 6 December 1960) is a Nigerian politician and the first female President of OPEC. She was elected at the 166th OPEC Ordinary meeting in Vienna on 27 November 2014. She became Nigeria's minister of transportation on 26 July 2007. She was moved to Mines and Steel Development in 2008, and in April 2010 was appointed Minister of Petroleum Resources. Biography Diezani K. Agama was born in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Her father was Chief Frederick Abiye Agama. She studied Architecture in England and then at Howard University in the United States. She graduated from Howard with a bachelor's degree on 8 December 1992. She returned to Nigeria and joined Shell Petroleum Development Corporation that year. In 2002, she attended Cambridge Judge Business School for her MBA degree. After returning to Nigeria, Diezani Alison-Madueke was appointed as an Executive Director in Shell in 2006. She was the first woman ever to be appointed by Shell as an Executive Director in Nigeria Since 1999 she has been married to Admiral Allison Madueke (retired), one-time Chief of Naval Staff who was at various times governor of Imo and Anambra State. She has two sons, Chimezie Madueke and Ugonna Madueke. In September 2011 Alison-Madueke was awarded an honorary Doctorate degree in Management Sciences by the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna.

Federal cabinet positions Diezani Alison-Madueke has held three significant positions in the Nigerian federal government. She was appointed Transportation Minister in July 2007. On 23 December 2008, she became the Minister of Mines and Steel Development. When Vice-President; Goodluck Jonathan became acting President in February 2010, he dissolved the cabinet on 17 March 2010, and swore in a new cabinet on 6 April 2010 with Alison-Madueke as Minister for Petroleum Resources. Minister of Petroleum Resources As Minister of Petroleum Resources, Alison-Madueke pledged to transform Nigeria's oil and gas industry so that all Nigerians benefit. In April 2010, President Goodluck Jonathan signed the Nigerian Content Act, which aimed to increase the percentage of petroleum industry contracts awarded to indigenous Nigerian businesses ‚Äì a reaction to the domination of the sector by foreign operators. One of the most controversial policies introduced under Alison-Madueke was the government's plan to remove state subsidies on fuel prices. Alison-Madueke supported the discontinuation of the subsidy \\"because it poses a huge financial burden on the government, disproportionately benefits the wealthy, [and] encourages inefficiency, corruption and diversion of scarce public resources away from investment in critical infrastructure.\\" Firsts Alison-Madueke was the first woman to hold the position of Minister of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria, and in October 2010 she became the first woman to head a country delegation at the semi-annual OPEC conference.

On 27 November 2014, she was elected as the first female President of OPEC. On working in male-dominated sectors, Alison-Madueke said she warned the young women she mentored while at Shell to \\"change their mode of thinking.\\" Allegations of financial misconducts and arrest A PBS NewsHour segment quoted American and British officials saying that former Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke might personally have organized a diversion of $6 billion (N1.2 trillion) from the Nigerian treasury. She has been charged with responsibility for $20 billion missing from the Petroleum agency. A former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Sanusi, made the comment again during a PBS interview on 2 December 2015. Sanusi believes he was fired from the Central Bank of Nigeria because he went public with charges that $20 billion was missing from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) under Alison-Madueke's management. Alison Madueke says Sanusi made the allegations to retaliate after she didn‚Äôt help him to get appointed as the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and dismissed his allegation. She's been accused of awarding multi-billion Naira contracts without recourse to due process and of recklessly spending government funds. as well as wasting billions of naira inappropriately on private jets. In October 2009, the Senate of Nigeria indicted Diezani Alison-Madueke and recommended prosecution for the transfer of 1.2 billion naira into the private account of a toll company without due process and in breach of concession agreement. She has been officially charged to court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria for 'Money Laundering'. On 2 October 2015, Reuters reported that Alison-Madueke had been arrested by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) in London, along with four other people on suspicion of bribery and corruption offences. However, a spokesperson for the police denied having any knowledge of the incident. Her family and the Nigerian Government confirmed that she had been arrested in London, although the NCA declined to comment on the case. Also in Nigeria, her home in Asokoro, Abuja was raided and sealed by anti- corruption agents of the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a few hours after her alleged arrest in London.

The English name of Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer, an obsolete term for the Swiss, which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries. The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French ', also in use since the 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic ', in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory, one of the Waldst√§tten cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The name originates as an exonym, applied pars pro toto to the troops of the Confederacy. The Swiss themselves began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499, used alongside the term for \\"Confederates\\", Eidgenossen (\\"oath-fellows\\"), used since the 14th century. The Swiss German name of the country is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by the use of the definite article (' for the Confederation, but simply ' for the canton and the town). Schwyz The toponym Schwyz itself is first attested in 972, as villa Suittes. Its etymology is uncertain, it may be either derived from a Germanic name in *swi√æ- ‚Äòstrength‚Äô or from either a Germanic (*swint-) or Celtic (*sveit-) word for \\"clearing\\".A summary of the history of suggestions until 1970 is given in Viktor Weibel, ‚ÄúSuittes - Schwyz - Schweiz: Geschichte und Deutung des Namens Schwyz‚Äù, Mitteilungen des historischen Vereins des Kantons Schwyz 65 (1972). See also Lexikon der schweizerischen Gemeindenamen, Frauenfeld 2005, 819-20. The name is recorded as Schwitz in the 13th century, and in the 17th to 18th century often as Schweitz. The spelling of y for [iÀê] originates as a ligature ij in 15th- century handwriting. The Swiss chroniclers of the 15th and 16th centuries present a legendary eponymous founder, one Suit (Swit, Schwyt, Switer), leader of a population migrating from Sweden due to a famine. Suit is said to have defeated his brother Scheijo (or Scheyg) in single combat in a dispute over leadership of the new settlement. Petermann Etterlin (fl. 1470s, printed 1507).Etterlin's account is supposedly based on a \\"common Swiss chronicle\\" (Gesta Suitensium, gemeine Schwyzerchronik also reflected in the White Book of Sarnen and later by Aegidius Tschudi (Die Geschichte der Ostfriesen, Swedier und andre, so mit jnen gereisset, vnd wie Switer dem Lande den Namen Swiz gegeben). Etterlin presents the three Waldst√§tte as representing three different stocks or races, the people of Schwyz as the most recent immigrants (from Sweden), the people of Uri representing the original \\"Goths and Huns\\", and the people of Unterwalden representing \\"the Romans\\". Vetter, Ueber die Sage von der Herkunft der Schwyzer und Oberhasler aus Schweden und Friesland, 1877, p. 10. Use of Switzer, Switenses, Swicenses for troops raised by the Confederacy as a whole, as it were pars pro toto because of the prominence of Schwyz in the early history of the Confederacy, is in use as an exonym from the later 14th century. The development of the Standard German diphthong ei reflects this early adoption. 16th-century French spelling was variously Soisses, Suysses, Souyces, adopted as Swiss in English. Early Italian spellings include Sviceri, Suyzeri; the modern Italian form Svizzeri is already used by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli in 1515. Use of Schwytzerland for the territory of the Confederacy (as opposed to just the territory of Schwyz) develops in the early 16th century, but Schweiz as an endonym enters wider usage only in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, and then in competition with Helvetia. Johan Jakob Leu in his Allgemeine Helvetische Eydgen√∂ssische oder Schweitzerische Lexicon (20 vols., 1747-1765; viz. using the three alternative names alongside one another in the title of his work) criticized the use of \\"Schweiz\\" for the Confederacy as confusing, arguing it should properly only be used to refer to the territory of Schwyz. Only in the second half of the 19th century did Schweiz did become the dominant or unmarked name for the country only after the formation of the federal state in 1848, and from this time was increasingly also used to refer to the state (officially called Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft in the constitution of 1848). Eidgenossenschaft The original name for the Old Swiss Confederacy was Eidgenossenschaft \\"oath-fellowship\\", Schwyz being just one of the participating Lieus or Orte (see Waldst√§tte). The term has never fallen out of use when referring to the Swiss Confederacy (as opposed to the territory). Eidgenossen translates the Latin conspirati of the Federal Charter of 1291, and the German term Eidgenossen is used in the pact of 1351 between Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden and the cities of Lucerne and Z√ºrich. Attestation of the abstract noun Eidgenossenschaft is somewhat younger, recorded in the Pfaffenbrief of 1370 (as unser Eydgnosschaft \\"our oath-fellowship\\"). In the Holy Roman Empire, emperor Charles IV outlawed any such conjurationes, confederationes, and conspirationes in his Golden Bull of 1356. Albrecht von Bonstetten (1479) called the Swiss Confederacy Superioris Germaniae Confoederatio, i.e. \\"Confederation of Upper Germany\\". This was translated into German in 1480 as Obert√ºtscheit Eidgnosschaft. In Early New High German, the word eidgno√üschaft was often simplified to eidgnoschaft. In early modern Swiss usage, Eidgenossenschaft was used without geographic qualifier, but in the 16th century it was often the epithet loblich \\"praiseworthy\\", as lobliche eidgnoschaft.Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch s.v. 'Eidgenossenschaft', citing Johannes Stumpf (1550) and Josias Simler (1576, von dem regiment loblicher eidgnoschaft zwei b√ºcher). Helvetia The Old Swiss Confederacy of the early modern period was often called Helvetia or Republica Helvetiorum (\\"Republic of the Helvetians\\") in learned humanist Latin. The Latin name is ultimately derived from the name of the Helvetii, the Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss plateau in the Roman era. The allegory Helvetia makes her appearance in 1672. The official Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica was introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in 1848. It appears on coins of the Swiss franc from 1879, and was inscribed on the Federal Palace in 1902. It was used in the official seal from 1948. The abbreviation CH was first introduced in 1909, as international vehicle registration code.

Toronto Blue Jays Considered by many to be one of Milwaukee's top prospects, he was traded on December 6, 2010, to the Toronto Blue Jays for starting pitcher Shaun Marcum. Despite Lawrie already having switched positions from catcher to second base after the Brewers drafted him, the Blue Jays moved Lawrie to third base. On May 31, Lawrie was hit in the hand by a pitch and left the game with what was initially believed to be a broken hand. X-rays were negative and he was considered day-to-day, until it was later revealed by CAT scan that there was a non-displaced fracture, and he was expected to miss 2‚Äì3 weeks.

In a game on June 5 between the Athletics and the Boston Red Sox at Boston's Fenway Park, a fan named Tonya Carpenter was injured when Lawrie's bat broke while swinging at a pitch. The barrel of the bat was thrown into the stands, hitting Carpenter in the head. According to the Boston Police Department, Carpenter lost an extensive amount of blood and suffered life-threatening head injuries, but another fan wrapped her head in his shirt tourniquet and she was quickly treated and taken by Fenway Park medical personnel to Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Lawrie finished the 2015 season with a .260 average, 16 home runs, and 60 RBIs in a career-high 149 games played.

Lawrie played 94 games for Chicago before leaving the July 21 game against Detroit in the fourth inning, with what was originally described as a tweaked hamstring. He did not play for the team again, as the injury was later said to have also involved his quad, knee, and hip. Lawrie avoided salary arbitration with the White Sox by agreeing to a one-year, $3.5 million contract for the 2017 season on December 3, 2016. However, he was released by the White Sox on March 3, 2017.

The taglines were: \\"CANNON MOVIE TALES: Lavish, feature-length new versions of the world's best-loved storybook classics!\\" and \\"Rediscover the magic\\". Plot The story opens with Linet (Amelia Shankley) chasing something she believes to be an elf fairy. Meanwhile, a Wolf tracks her. Linet climbs a tree over a river and nearly falls. She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land. As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter, who scolds her for being foolish. As they walk back, Peter asks Linet why she can't stay home and be a good little girl. Linet answers how good little girls hardly ever see the world (Lost in the Woods). When they arrive at the house, Lady Jean (Isabella Rossellini) raises an eyebrow at Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to actually seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, and no one in the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves. Godfrey (Craig T. Nelson) notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war, and it has been seven years since, meaning that she is legally free to remarry. He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival. Godfrey wonders, as Percival's exact twin, how Jean could not love him when it is clear she doesn't. He offers her riches and beauty, by proposing to enable her to resume her role as lady of the castle, but she refuses. Godfrey loudly proclaims that, as far as he is concerned, she is the only candidate for lady of the castle, meaning that she WILL be his wife. Later in the castle, Godfrey imprisons a peasant farmer, Allen Owen, for back taxes. As he is led away, Allen yells how Godfrey has no heart, something that enrages Godfrey. He orders Allen to be hanged in the morning and storms out. Godfrey goes to his chambers where the same Wolf from the beginning is lounging on a sofa. Godfrey orders: \\"Wolf into Man, as fast as you can.\\" The Wolf then transforms into his human form, Dagger (Rocco Sisto). Godfrey repeats how Allen said he had no heart, and wonders aloud if the truth is really known, how he gave up his heart and soul to possess Dagger, the Power of the Wolf. Godfrey asks Dagger what the people are saying about him. Dagger says that the people are afraid of him, but not all. He remarks how Linet, however, his own \\"flesh and blood\\", has no fear. Godfrey replies that soon she will, like everyone else. After he leaves, Dagger sings how he's good at only one thing (Good at Being Bad). He then goes into the village to spy around, and villagers speaking about Godfrey rapidly become quiet in his presence. Linet awakens from a nightmare about her running through the woods and being chased by a large wolf. Lady Jean comes to comfort her and tell her there is nothing to fear. Linet asks how when there are things to fear. Jean tells her that the night will pass (You Won't Be Here in the Morning). The next day, Lady Jean takes a loaf of bread and goes to beg Godfrey for Allen Owen's life. Godfrey cruelly agrees, but still has Allen whipped while Jean watches. Lady Jean's servants carry him out of the castle, and Jean speaks about sending for her mother, Nanny Bess. Linet skips down the road and arrives at Nanny Bess' country house. She tells Nanny Bess about Allen's wounds, and Nanny gathers some ointments and sneaks a red bundle into her basket. As they walk, they are watched by the Wolf. Nanny makes Linet wait outside, promising her a surprise later. Nanny and Lady Jean attend to Allen while Dagger watches from a window. Linet tries to sit still but sees a goose out of its pen. She chases it near Dagger, causing him to fall into some mud. He tries another window, but falls into the river trying to avoid Linet. She goes back into the house as Nanny massages in the ointment, which miraculously removes Allen's pain. Nanny then holds a 'ceremony' involving a circle of rocks, and adorning Linet with a beautiful hooded cloak, saying it will protect her, and help her see a fairy. The next day Linet and Lady Jean bring bread to a healed Allen and farm workers. Refusing the food, Allen laments to Linet about working so hard only to gain so little, referring to the poor harvest and telling her how the land was fertile (Green in the Blue). Everyone joins in singing and dancing, but the mood changes suddenly when Lord Godfrey appears. In an attempt to quell the situation, Lady Jean speaks to Godfrey, who repeats his marriage request. Jean speaks again of her love for Percival, whom Godfrey declares is dead. Linet speaks up to her uncle, saying her father is alive; Godfrey doesn't want to hear this and starts yelling. He tells Jean this will be the last time he asks. As he rides away, Linet chases him on foot saying her father is alive, before running into the woods. At first she ignores her mother's calls, but eventually Linet returns to Jean and they sadly walk home. Meanwhile, a very much alive Percival (also played by Craig T. Nelson) travels the road on foot and sings (You Won't Be Here in the Morning). He arrives at Nanny Bess's house and they exchange banter before she warmly welcomes him home. Over dinner, he tells her how he has seen the fear in people's eyes, but he did not reveal his identity. Nanny Bess warns him how Godfrey has used black magic to gain power. Percival refuses to believe his brother is that cold and cruel, but Nanny explains how Godfrey gave up his heart for power and is incapable of loving anything or anyone. Meanwhile, in the castle, Godfrey sings how Jean cannot break his heart, since he was without one (Man Without a Heart). He and Dagger briefly talk about love before he mentions how Allen had been healed. Dagger doesn't understand how that is possible, and Godfrey postulates someone in the village is capable of magic. He sends Dagger to find out the source of the magic and to eliminate it. He also says Lady Jean will be his, and Linet is becoming a nuisance. Dagger tries first to talk to Lady Jean, but she knows of his connection to Godfrey and avoids the subject. He then tries to talk to Badger Kate, the maid, and Allen's brother, but she pushes him into the wash bin. Frustrated, he follows Kate and transforms into the Wolf. She spots him and screams for help. The villagers chase the Wolf and shoot bows and arrows. Peter joins the chase and throws his axe. When he catches up, he sees Dagger in human form with a sleeve pinned to a tree by the axe. Dagger sends Peter off in another direction, and grimaces. Percival and Nanny Bess watch Linet from afar, and Nanny Bess keeps him back, warning of Godfrey's spies. They meet up with the villagers looking for the wolf, and Peter recognizes Percival, and they embrace in friendship. Peter is happy that Percival has returned to lead the people, but all Percival wants is to see Jean and Linet. Nanny Bess warns that Godfrey watches Jean too closely, but she will send for Linet to come to her house. Jean gives Linet a basket to take to Nanny Bess. Linet promises to go straight there, but of course gets distracted when she runs into Dagger. They talk about people and how they tend to lie and mislead others (Never Talk to Strangers). Afterwards, Linet does reveal it was Nanny Bess who healed Allen. Dagger distracts her into picking flowers and goes ahead to Nanny Bess. He arrives at the house and tries to attack her, but she escapes. Dagger then hears Linet approaching, so he darts inside and dons Nanny Bess' cap and nightgown. Linet arrives at the house, where Dagger, disguised, convinces her to drink a potion. She does and it blurs her vision, while she dreamily goes into the bedroom. Linet looks at Dagger in the nightcap and gown and utters the famous line: \\"What big eyes you have.\\" When she notes the big teeth, Dagger says: \\"The better to eat you with.\\" He then bites Linet's hand. Linet backs away in fear as Dagger transforms into the Wolf and pounces on her. Percival is talking to the villagers and reveals a secret entrance which Godfrey doesn't know about. They start to plan their attack when Nanny Bess runs up to him, screaming for help. Meanwhile, castle guards lead Lady Jean, her wrists tied, to a waiting Godfrey on horseback. He reminds her that he said he was done asking, before taking the rope and leading her back to the castle. Percival and the villagers return to the house and see in the bed a half wolf/half human form with a bloated stomach. Percival raises his bow, but Nanny Bess stops him when she sees something moving inside the Wolf's stomach. She orders Percival to cut open the stomach, and when he does Dagger/Wolf dies, and an unharmed Linet emerges from within. She see Percival and timidly asks: \\"Father?\\" Both father and daughter embrace. Percival leads the angry villagers towards the castle. Godfrey pulls Lady Jean along, and screams for Dagger. As Percival enters the castle gates, Godfrey reacts in fear; and his guards and Lady Jean shrink away in horror. The villagers storm the castle and Percival and Jean are reunited. Everyone finds Godfrey cringing and groaning on his throne. He is twisting in pain and starting to take on an animal-like appearance. Percival throws the Wolf's skinned hide at Godfrey, and orders him to leave. As he staggers past the stunned villagers, Godfrey grimaces in pain. He eventually changes into a wolf and runs out of the castle gates. As Nanny Bess, Percival, Lady Jean, and Linet walk home, Linet is distracted by pretty flowers. As she picks them and sings, a fairy appears. They look at one another for a moment, but when Linet turns to answer her father, the fairy disappears. Linet smiles and runs to catch up to her family.

She was portrayed as the character \\"Gretl\\". Early life Named after the house she was born in, the Martinsschl√∂ssel, Martina von Trapp had brown hair and brown eyes. She grew up in Klosterneuburg, and later in Salzburg with her siblings Rupert (1911‚Äì1992), Agathe (1913‚Äì2010), Maria Franziska (1914‚Äì2014), Werner (1915‚Äì2007), Hedwig (1917‚Äì1972), and Johanna (1919‚Äì1994). The family moved from Zell-am-See to Klosterneuburg after their home in Zell-am-See, a hotel called Kitzsteinhorn, was flooded. They also lived at one time on a farm called Erlhof near their maternal grandmother and aunts. When Martina was one and a half years old, her mother Agathe died of scarlet fever during an epidemic. Three years later, Georg von Trapp moved his family to the Aigen district of Salzburg. In 1926, her older sister Maria Franziska became ill and was unable to attend school. During her recovery her father arranged for a teacher from a local convent to tutor her; the novice, Maria Augusta Kutschera, married Georg von Trapp the next year. Georg and Maria Augusta had three children together: Rosmarie (born 1929), Eleonore (born 1931), and Johannes (1939). In the 1930s Georg suffered serious financial losses. Maria Augusta, who had taught the children to sing, organized a series of concerts in order to pay the bills. She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1948. Career The Trapp family rehearsing before a concert, near Boston, 27 September 1941. The family left Austria in the summer of 1938 after they declined an invitation to sing for Hitler at his birthday celebration at Berchtesgaden, Germany. They embarked on a concert tour of the US and never went back. Von Trapp was nearly seventeen years old at the time. She sang second soprano in the family chorus together with her sister Maria Franziska. Personal life/death Aged 28, Martina wed French-Canadian Jean Dupire in 1949. She remained home for the 1950‚Äì1951 tour as she was expecting her first child. While the family was touring the western United States in the winter of 1951, she gave birth to a stillborn daughter (Notburga), and died the same day from complications of the Caesarean section she had undergone. She had just recently turned 30 years old. She was buried at the von Trapp's lodge in Vermont, next to her father and with her baby in her arms. Her stepmother and three of her siblings ‚Äì Rupert, Werner, and Hedwig ‚Äì were later buried next to her.

Originally a Roman-Cistercian monastery, it was remodeled during the 17th and early 18th century in the Baroque style, but still exemplifies many of the characteristics of the early building (typifying the Galician Cistercian monasteries and Minhota churches of the time). The beginning of 17th century remodeling began with images of the patron saints and coat-of-arms on the frontispiece, but later extended into the lateral altar (Mannerist) and the chancel retable (Baroque). History Western profile of the church, with the inset belltower and front facade (to the right) The lateral facade (left), showing the holes that supported beams from the historical cloister Records from 815, as suggested by J. Augusto Vieira, already indicated that a convent existed on the site during the era of Ramiro II of Le√≥n and D. Paterna. By 870, the church was constructed (as stated in the chronicles of Father Ant√≥nio da Purifica√ß√£o). By the 11th century, there were rare references to a religious building in Fi√£es, usually referring to a Benedictine monastery who received several donations and active business (exchanges and purchases).Louren√ßo Alves (1982), p. 112 In 1142, Fernando Ted√£o was a principal orator and eventually left behind many of his property to the church. Afonso Henriques also donated property and chattel that he owned in Melga√ßo (most notably in the area of Chavi√£es), which included the lands of Senhora da Orada, but which were later occupied by King Sancho in 1199. Maur de Chocheril, in 1194, recorded that the clergy at the convent adopted the Cistercian religious order, aligning themselves to their brethren at the abbey of S√£o Jo√£o de Tarouca.Lu√≠s Pinto (1997), p. 10 In 1210 Jo√£o Raimundo and his mother donated lands in Doma, on the frontier with Crist√≥val, and later supported the Order's public works the following year with donations to their projects. The wealth of the Convent of Fi√£es was so great that a popular refrain existed that \\"after the King, there was no one as rich as the abbot of Fi√£es\\". An accord between the convent and municipality of Melga√ßo in 1245 established a cost-sharing agreement for the maintenance of the wall around the city. The clergy at the time could afford to be generous, records from 1320 showed that the convent produced 400 pounds from lands rents. In the 14th century, the tomb of Fern√£o Anes de Lima was installed at the church. In 1490, a fire in the archives resulted in an unmeasurable damage to many of the church's records. The first record of a restoration dates to around 1530, when abbot Jo√£o de C√≥s ordered the restoration of the Church, the abbey's residences, cloister and meeting hall. These renovations were important, for in January 1533, the convent was visited by the abbey of Claraval, Edme de Saulieu and his secretary, Cl√°udio de Bronseval. Yet, many of the early projects were left uncompleted at the time of their arrival, including the cloister (which was in ruins). Successive restoration or expansion were completed in the 17th and 18th century, including the restoration of the interior and frontispiece and the opening of two great windows on the northern facade, as well as the construction of the belltower. By the end of the 16th century, there were 20 abbots represented at the convent. In 1730, Colonel Francisco Ayres de Vasconcelos ordered recruitment of soldiers on the grounds of Fi√£es couto (a privileged area immune from taxes and royal justice), which was seen as an afront to the religious orders. The site was also the stage for a later royal order from King John V of Portugal, who summoned all the governors to the plaza to show their respect to the privileges of the grounds. Yet, in 1777, the convent complained to the Captain-Major of Valadares that generals and governors of the local fortifications used carts of parishioners for public works projects in the fortresses. With the extinction of the Religious Orders (1834), the convent was sold to the public and the temple became a parochial church. The remaining dependencies slowly slid into ruins, with little attention paid to these shelters. On 6 November 1836, the couto was extinguished and the lands incorporated into the municipality of Melga√ßo. A cross was erected on the grounds in 1875. By 1903, the right facade of the convent still remained intact. The original 1910 decree was intended to classify the churchyard as a National Monument (), but was elaborated in 1977 to include the Church, its contents and any of the remnants of the ancient convent. The abbot travelled to France (1955) to visit former parishioners, and to collect donations to purchase bells for the convent, conclude the public works on the parochial residence and build a tower to the Chapel of Adedele. The first organized interventions made on the church and remnants of the convent began with the 1958 restoration of the roof and consolidation of the walls, completed by the DGEMN Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) in 1958. This was followed by formal restoration in 1959-1960; reconstruction of the sacristy and western/southern walls in 1961‚Äì1962; and finally the reconstruction of the southern wall and frontispiece in 1963. A new phase of restoration and consolidation began in the 1970s with the southwest corner and roofing, and weathering problems caused by a storms in 1972, which were supported in 1974 by new roofing of the central nave. Minor replacements of doors and windows throughout the church progressed in the intervening years, along with other projects, culminating in the drainage of the posterior facade in 1977. Conservation projects began in 1982, 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1989 to benefit its historical and touristic importance, with a general review of elements in granite, pavement, structural and decorative elements, the cleaning of many of the interior and exterior decoration, treatment of the main beams, the revision and installation of electrical outlets and improvements on the exterior of the building, which included the consolidation of the exterior wall and the construction of an access-way staircase in Portuguese-style cal√ßada. Following the re-roofing of the church, new restorations were accompanied by archaeologists from the University of Minho, under a protocol with the DGMEN. During the opening of drainage perimeter, the archaeologists discovered an older dis-activated channel system, that ran along the principal facade of the church along with an older cal√ßada pavement, which was conserved, eliminating the need for further drainage projects. Architecture The front facade of the Church of Fi√£es, showing the three long windows and pediments with images of saints The Church of Fi√£es is situated in an isolated rural environment, along the flanks of the Serra da Peneda, at about 700 metres above sea level. The ample churchyard includes a cross, and is inserted within a small agricultural tract encircled by oak and chestnut trees. The church is composed in a longitudinal plan, with three naves and four sections, with three rectangular chapels, inset rectangular bell-tower crowned with pinnacles (on the north facade) and sacristy (in the southern facade) with the articulated spaces covered in tile. Typically, the Cistercian Romanesque churches had three square chapels with vaulted ceilings and local marks. Analysis by Carlos A. Ferreira suggest that some remnants from the nave indicate the original architects/designers intended to vault the entire nave, but was never realized. The frontispiece (surmounted by a cross over a plinth) is divided by reinforced spaces, with narrow windows on the lateral spaces, while an arched portico dominates the central space. Above this doorway are three niches with the images of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o, S√£o Bernardo and S√£o Bento, surmounted by three narrow windows and a coat-of- arms. These upper sections of the principal facade were remodeled in the 17th century, with the windows and images of the saints added in this period. The dependencies of the convent were also altered, but these were lost by 1533. The only remnant of this period is a fragment of double capital, decorated in a vegetal form with crochet.Lu√≠s Pinto (1997), p.24 The lateral facades include cornices, with two doors on the southern facade and one on the northern facade. The southern apse chapel dominates the opposite facade to the entrance, with a supported chancel with windows and cornice similar to those along the nave. The interior naves are separated by arched columns on squared pillars. On one of these is a gilded pulpit, while a collateral altar is located to the right of the main altar. Opposite this is tomb. The naves are supported by wood beams and divided into four sections, while the chancel is crossed by two beams. The apse chapel is broken by arches over pilasters, surmounted by windows and frescoes; its two sections and vaulted ceiling, illuminated by two frescoes, has been considered \\"a programmed realization of the best aspects of the Cistercian spirit\\".Almeida (2001), p. 136‚Äì137 A similar conclusion was reached from the analysis of other parts of the architectural design. One of them was the space's decoration, characterized by an almost complete lack of ornamental design, which characterize the principal values of the Cistercian Order: \\"simplicity, austerity and pragmatism\\".Rosas (1987), p. 69 Although the Galician influence of Benedictine churches helped to begin a period of construction, the Cistercian influence inaugurated a new road that would influence 13th century architecture. The chancel which includes vaulted ceiling and broken by a gilded retable. Of the convent, which extended from the southern, nothing remains, although there exist elements associated with its construction including a small space with arches over pilasters and Doric columns, that were part of the convent structure.

Plot summary New York private detective Shamus McCoy is called to the house of Hume, an eccentric diamond dealer, and is given the task of recovering some stolen diamonds. His investigation is thwarted at every turn and it is only when he is beaten by a gang of thugs to warn him off the job that he realizes that he's onto something really big. Using his friend Springy as well as Alexis Montaigne, the sister of a nightclub owner, McCoy digs for the truth about the robbery. The trail leads to an Army colonel called Hardcore who is in cahoots with Alexis's brother, then full circle to Hume, who is behind the plot all along.

Weitman, who had a multi-picture deal with Columbia, the first of which was The Anderson Tapes. Reynolds' signing was announced in February 1972. By this stage Buzz Kulik was attached as director and Sam Pessim was writing the script. Weitman had known Reynolds since the 1960s when he tried to get the actor to appear in a TV series The Lieutenant. Weitman discovered Barry Beckerman's script when he was at MGM in the 1960s. It was then set in the 1940s. Weitman took the script with him when he went to Columbia and set it up as his second film there, getting Beckerman to rewrite it so it was set in the 1970s. Steve McQueen was suggested for the lead but Weitman wanted to go with Reynolds. \\"To me\\", he said, \\"Burt had always worked. I looked at things he'd done and said 'He's funny. He throws away lines like a Kleenex. He was like a hidden iceberg'.\\" It was the first film Reynolds signed for since publication of the Cosmo centerfold. Dyan Cannon had been in semi-retirement since her bad experience on Such Good Friends but agreed to make the film after seeing Reynolds perform on stage in The Rainmaker. \\"It's Bogart and Bacall all over again\\", said Weitman. Filming locations Filmed in New York City, military scenes filmed at Headquarters 1/101 Cavalry NYARNG (New York Army National Guard) located at 321 Manor Road, Staten Island, New York.

Perhaps something was lost in translation to the screen.\\" Roger Greenspun wrote that the film \\"is full of appealing New York locations and much inventive action, ultimately amounts to little more than the kind of situation melodrama that the movies these days offer for excitement. On this level it is workmanlike, well paced, modest, sometimes scary, and sometimes genuinely funny.\\" Burt Reynolds said it was \\"not a bad film, kind of cute. If the picture had been as good as the title sequence it would have made millions. As it was it made $5 million.\\" Sequel Robert M. Weitman produced a TV movie about the same character titled A Matter of Wife... and Death (1976) with the role played by Rod Taylor. It was a pilot for a prospective series that did not come to be.

It currently cares for more than 850 underprivileged, orphaned, abused, neglected and abandoned children and students with disabilities.  History  It was in 1974 that Father Ray Brennan C.Ss.R., an American priest of the Redemptorist order, first accepted an unwanted baby into his care. That one act of kindness would be the start of a life of devotion to help the underprivileged in Thai society. He opened an orphanage, a pre-school facility for deaf toddlers, a vocational school for people with disabilities, a home for street kids and a school for blind children. Father Ray died on the morning of 16 August 2003 and since then the Father Ray Foundation has continued his work in his vision and continues to live by its motto that ‚Äòwe never turn a needy child away‚Äô. Since 2003 the Father Ray Foundation has opened several new projects including a children‚Äôs village, a drop-in center for street kids, a facility for children with special needs and a day care center for toddlers from the poorer slum areas of Pattaya. Projects The Father Ray Foundation helps children through the following projects: *The Father Ray Vocational School for People with Disabilities The School was opened in 1984 and offered part-time courses in Computer Science. It was in 1987 that the school accepted its first full-time students, offering free accommodation, food and medical help to young adults living with a disability. Students study for two years and courses available include - * Information Technology * Electronic Repair * Computer Business Management in English * Elementary English Since the school opened its doors more than 2500 students have successfully graduated and are now able to, in the words of Father Ray, 'earn their own rice'. *The Father Ray School for the Blind Established in 1986, the purpose of the school is to give an education at primary and secondary levels to those children who are blind or severely partially sighted. In the first twenty five years since the school opened more than 400 students have graduated. *The Father Ray Children‚Äôs Home The aim of the Home is to provide assistance to under-privileged children who lack proper care from their own families. At the Home the children live in a safe environment, free from harm and with access to education, medical assistance and a nutritious diet. As in all programs where there is a family breakdown, it is the goal of the Father Ray Foundation to re-unite the family and assist them to maintain their family life. The Home offers scholarship to children living in the local community with the aim of keeping the family together but ensuring the child can continue with their studies. *The Father Ray Outreach Work & Drop-In Center This project is the smallest, but one of the most important of all the Father Ray Foundation projects. It is a temporary place of residence where children and teenagers can find a safe environment to live, one where they will be free from risk of any type of harm. Children from broken families, those who have been abused, orphaned or neglected or those who have run away from home will find a safe haven while a more suitable and permanent location to live is found. Many of the children living at the Father Ray Children's Home and the Children's Village first arrived at the Drop-In Center. The outreach team also work in the slum areas of Pattaya, offering help and support to families where children are at risk of harm or at risk of becoming street kids. *The Half Way House Located on the same site as the Drop-In Center, the Half Way House is where teenagers live while they are seeking work, in employment or continuing their education. They learn to live independently, while knowing support is nearby if they need it. *The Father Ray Day Care Center When the Father Ray Day Care Center opened in 2008 the aim was to provide kindergarten education for children from the poorer slum areas of Pattaya. Children from the age of one to three spent their days in a safe environment while their parents are working or seeking work. No other organisation in the Pattaya area if offering care facilities to children of this age group. *The Father Ray Children‚Äôs Village Opened in 2008 the Children's Village is based on the SOS Children's Villages that were founded in 1949 to provide a home to children who had been orphaned during World War II. Children live at the Father Ray Children's Village is houses with five to eight other children. They live as part of a family, with their new brother and sisters and the lady who will take care of them, cook for them, support them, love them and who they will call mother. *Father Ray Center for Children with Special Needs In 2007 a mother arrived seeking help for her son who is living with cerebral palsy. As word spread of the help that was on offer parents from all over the Pattaya area arrived, all seeking help for their child. The Center offers physiotherapy, occupational therapy and an education to the children while supporting the family and educating they in the condition their child is living with. Food The Father Ray Foundation provides nutritious meals to its children and students every day. Rice, the staple food of Thailand, is served at almost every meal and more than 75,000 kg of rice are cooked each year. On World Food Day, in mid October each year, the Father Ray Foundation appeals to the people of Pattaya to help feed the children and students. During the annual SOS RICE Appeal, taking place each year over one weekend in early December, the children, students and foreign volunteers ask shoppers at all major supermarkets to buy and donate a bag of rice. Each year more than 10,000 kg of rice is donated and almost 1 million Baht in cash is donated to buy rice. The Father Ray Foundation has several initiatives to become more self-sufficient in providing food. At the Father Ray Children's Village the agriculture farm is providing fruits and vegetables, grown without pesticides. At the Father Ray Children's Home the residents take care of two chicken houses, which between them are providing almost 500 eggs each day. The children also take care of several mushroom huts. The children harvest the crop before washing, weighing and distributing the mushrooms to the Central Purchasing department. The mushrooms are also sold at local food markets. Health It is essential that all the children and students under the care of the Father Ray Foundation have access to medical assistance if they need it. Each project managed by the Father Ray Foundation has a designated health care professional who is able to deal with any minor health problems that may occur. Serious injuries or ailments are treated at local hospitals. Funders and supporters The Father Ray Foundatibon receives support from the following organizations and companies: * Rotary International * The Thai Children's Trust - UK and Ireland * Father Ray's Sponsor a Child Foundation  - USA * Les Amis de l'Orphelinat de Pattaya - France * Thomas J. Vincent Foundation, Honolulu, Hawaii * Den Danske Pattaya Fond - Denmark * British Community in Thailand Foundation for the Needy - Bangkok * Pattaya Sports Club Volunteers For many years the Father Ray Foundation has welcomed foreign volunteers who want to come and help improve the lives of the children and students of the Foundation. Volunteers stay for a minimum of 6 months and work in the various projects. Work includes teaching English at the vocational school, helping the nannies at the Day Care Center and organising educational activities for the blind children. On the weekends they teach English at the Children's Village while over at the Children's Home they organise arts & crafts, sports activities and provide English and Chinese lessons. Accommodation and three meals each day is provided free of charge. However the volunteer must pay for their own flight, medical insurance and pocket money Volunteers arrive in late April or in late October, ready for the new school terms  References  * Father Ray Foundation official website Children's charities based in Thailand ","title":"Father Ray Foundation"},{"id":"18895269","text":"Little Rockies National Forest was established by the U.S. Forest Service in Montana on March 2, 1907 with .

Career Rafferty studied Classics at the University of Edinburgh before moving to England in 1948. Rafferty's poetic work is squarely within the Anglo-American modernist tradition, reflecting variously the influence of traditional English lyric, Celtic bardic poetry, balladry, and popular song. Rafferty's poetry has been praised by Sorley MacLean, Ted Hughes, Michael Morpurgo and Hugh MacDiarmid and was posthumously published in collections by the poetry presses Carcanet and Etruscan. Personal life The death of Rafferty's first wife, Betty Bryant, in 1945, by whom he had a daughter, figures prominently in his poetry. He married Peggy Laing in 1947 and the next year moved with her to Iddesleigh, Devon, where he was landlord of the Duke Of York Inn. He lived in Iddesleigh until his death in 1993, at the age of 84.

Several of his figures ornament the Op√©ra Garnier most notoriously the group La Danse, which was commissioned from him after the group by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux was found unacceptable.

He became a prominent sculptor of the Second Empire, who was awarded the Legion d'Honneur, 29 June 1867. When, on the morning of 29 August 1869 it was discovered that ink had been thrown over Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux' marble La Danse in the fa√ßade of the Op√©ra Garnier, it was thought to have been a scandalized gesture by a member of the public because of the nudity of Carpeaux' figures. Charles Garnier, who had already commissioned from Gumery two gilded groups for the cornice of the Palais Garnier, asked Gumery to sculpt a replacement figure of La Danse to replace the disfigured Carpeaux group. With the Franco-Prussian War of the following year, followed by the Paris Commune, during which Gumery died in Paris under obscure circumstances during the privations of the Siege of Paris, when many starved, and then the death of Carpeaux in 1875, the scandal was forgotten: the Carpeaux group remained in place and Gumery's La Danse is conserved in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers.Gumery Family of French Artists & Sculptors Gomery is buried in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre, where his gravestone is surmounted by a bust sculpted by his pupil Jean Gautherin.

He was the last child and only son of Otto I, Prince of Anhalt- Aschersleben, by his wife Hedwig, daughter of Henry III the White, Duke of Breslau. Life After the death of his father in 1304, Otto inherited his principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben. Otto participated in the political feuds typical of his era. In 1307 he supported the House of Wettin. After years of maintaining close ties with his cousin Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg- Stendal, Otto broke with him and became a vassal of King Eric VI of Denmark in 1315. He died shortly after; the last male of his family, the line of Anhalt- Aschersleben became extinct upon his death. The Bishopric of Halberstadt took over his principality and lands (including Aschersleben) as payment for debt after his death. The presiding Anhalt prince at this time, Bernhard II of Anhalt-Bernburg, recognized the validity of the bishop's claim to this territory and the transfer was agreed upon in a contract signed in December 1316.

It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, Wii, PlayStation 3, iOS, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch. Two Tribes released Swords & Soldiers on the Wii U eShop, which was released in North America and Europe on May 22, 2014.Swords & Soldiers HD for Wii U! ¬∑ Two Tribes - 201420 and more A sequel, Swords & Soldiers II, was released on the Wii U eShop in May 2015. In June 2018, Romino Games started a Kickstarter project for a re-release, titled Swords & Soldiers II: Shawarmageddon.  Gameplay  In Swords & Soldiers, three factions (the Aztecs, the Vikings and the Imperial Chinese) are fighting each other to gain the powers of the gods. The game boasts both a single player campaign for all three factions and a skirmish mode, as well as competitive split-screen multiplayer and several other modes and minigames players can unlock by progressing through the game. The single player campaign features 10 missions for each faction, with objectives ranging from conquering the enemy's base on the other side of the play area to surviving a full out assault from the enemy or infiltrating their defenses with a limited number of troops. Players collect gold and mana which are used to purchase units and spells. After being built, units automatically begin marching towards the enemies base and players cast spells to either strengthen their own units or directly attack their enemies. Players must make strategic decisions on what units to build and when to send them out.  Development  Swords & Soldiers began development after THQ acquired the rights to its first game de Blob. While it was originally intended to be a flash game, the developers saw potential in the title and moved it to the WiiWare service. The development team was initially made up by seven developers and a \\"varying amount of interns\\", and the team used the offices of Dutch Game Garden to develop the game. Swords & Soldiers began as simply a split-screen multiplayer game featuring only the Aztecs and the Vikings. The developers validated this decision using arguments such as them not being sure how well WiiWare games sell, that the project was mostly to show that they could develop a game from point A to point Z, that the multiplayer component was one of the strongest features of the game, and that beginning with multiplayer allows the developers to balance the game right away. The single player mode was added after the developers implemented a single player tutorial, which they found fun. While they intended to only put a small amount of single player content, they ended up adding 30 campaign levels, additional challenge modes, achievements, and other features. They used extensive play testing to ensure that the game, especially the single player mode, had a proper difficulty curve and that the gameplay is not complicated. They attempted to utilize it to test the game's balance, but found that testers took too long with strategies to use it accurately with testing factions' strengths. The developers cited the play testers for helping them make it as good as it is and for creating a fan following on the Internet. Several features of the game were implemented late in the development process, including the ability to change the game's pace. A major addition was added balance, which they realized was necessary after discovering that the balance was very poor in spite of believing it to be much better initially. The developers were focused on the idea they had for the game from the beginning. The visual style and gameplay were established early in the development, motivating the developers in how simply the development process progressed. In the first months of its development, the developers had created a tool chain and approximately 90% of the gameplay functionality. Two features of the game were unclear to the developers during development; a \\"troop manipulation\\" mechanic, a common feature found in other real-time strategy video games that allows players to control the movements of their units, was a feature that the developers wanted to include. They attempted to include it by allowing players to drag units backwards or stop them by clicking on them, but felt that such a feature took away from tactical decisions and put too much emphasis on micromanagement and twitch gameplay. The developers added menus to the main gameplay late in the game. The final version was described by them as a \\"very polished version\\" of the vision they had of what they wanted. The audio of Swords & Soldiers was created as a collaboration between the developers and an external audio studio called Sonic Picnic, which was located near their offices, making it very accessible to them. The developers found Sonic Picnic to be helpful, receiving an audio experience from them that matched with their vision. Due to a low budget, the developers offered Sonic Picnic royalties, which Sonic Picnic accepted due to being impressed by the prototype. Developers stated that this process kept them motivated to finish the game. The voice samples for the characters and units were created by recording the various developers and putting their voices in the game. The developers cited the real-time strategy game StarCraft as a strong inspiration, citing in particular its use of factions as something that made it particularly more inspiring than other games in the genre. They add that the quality of StarCrafts factions comes from both the gameplay and their visual appearances. This caused them to focus on having three different factions that played differently from each other. They intended to make sure that every unit and spell was unique as well as different abilities for each faction such as how each one collects mana. The first faction, the Vikings, simply have to buy an upgrade, intending to make the Vikings the most accessible class. The Aztecs sacrifice a unit to turn its health into mana, which the developers state they did so to add \\"playful cruelty\\" to this faction. The Chinese faction has to build a Buddha statue, which generates mana until it is destroyed, requiring players to protect it. The developers intended to make the Chinese faction more complex than the other two. They intended on making each faction's miners different in how they collect gold, but found that this was too difficult to balance. The Chinese faction was originally not included in the game. The developers originally only revealed two factions - the Vikings and the Aztecs. On April Fools' Day, 2009, Ronimo jokingly announced that the yet to be revealed faction would be the Space Marines; however on April 22, 2009 it was confirmed that the third faction will be the Chinese Empire. The developers' marketing plan began as merely releasing screenshots and videos of the game on the Internet. However, they found that this was not adequate to create buzz. Because the deadline was pushed back a half of a year, the marketing started with the original release date in mind, the developers had to fill in the space between its announcement and release with enough marketing material to maintain interest in it. They had to get a full-time artist to create videos, screenshots, logos, and high resolution materials to release, also receiving assistance from Nintendo to promote the game. According to Ronimo's Joost van Dongen, the art style for Swords & Soldiers was inspired by the credits of a video called Super Moine (i.e. \\"Super Monk\\" in French), and from the ability of an artist in the team. The PC version was renamed Swords & Soldiers HD and made available on Steam.Swords & Soldiers HD on Steam The iOS version was originally not 64-bit and not compatible with iOS 11 and up. Apple has policy of removing all non-64-bit apps from their store. S&S; iOS was developed by a third party company that has since gone bankrupt. According to a company representative, Ronimo Games never owned the source code, and therefore had no plans to release an update that will run on current Apple mobile devices.Swords and Soldiers iPad No Longer Supported iOS 11 on Ronimo Games Forum A 64-bit version of S&S; iOS was released by GameClub on June 26, 2020, including enhancements from the Nintendo Switch version of the game.  Reception  Swords and Soldiers has received a positive reception from critics, garnering a score of 84/100 at Metacritic. IGN gave the game its Editor's Choice award, calling it \\"one of the best console real-time strategy games ever\\" while praising the production values and personality of the game, as well as its unique approach to the genre. Nintendo Life called the game an essential download, praising the visuals, music and depth of the gameplay and noting the plethora of modes for players. Edge called it \\"a riot of colour and imagination\\" that \\"towers above everything else WiiWare currently has to offer\\". Official Nintendo Magazine called it \\"a colourful, vibrant and frankly brilliant console strategy title\\".  Sequel  At the end of February 2014, it was announced that a sequel was in development. It will feature the Vikings versus two new factions, one of which will be demons. Players will be able to control the location of their base and tell units where to move.

She was born in Basco, Batanes, a small island in the northernmost part of the Philippines, between Luzon and Taiwan. Her more than 30-year painting career began when she traveled to the United States to undertake graduate studies. She exhibited her work in over 200 museums, galleries, and other venues, including 75 solo shows, around the world. Abad's work is now in public, corporate, and private art collections in over 70 countries. Personal life Ati-Atihan (1981). Acrylic on stitched and padded canvas. Both of Abad's parents served, at different times, as Congressman/Congresswomen of Batanes, and Abad earned a BA in political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1967. In 1970, she went to the United States intending to study law, but she instead earned a master's degree in Asian history at Lone Mountain College (which would later become part of the University of San Francisco) in 1972 while supporting herself as a seamstress and a typist. Abad studied painting at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C. and The Art Students League in New York City. She lived on six continents and worked in more than 50 countries, including Guatemala, Mexico, India, Afghanistan, Yemen, Sudan, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, and Indonesia. At the Corcoran School of Art, Abad studied under Berthold Schmutzhart and Blaine Larson, and the two professors helped launch her artistic career. Abad then pursued her studies at The Art Students League in New York where she concentrated on still life and figurative drawing under John HelickerJohn Helicker and Robert Beverly Hale. Filipina: A racial identity crisis (1990). Acrylic, handwoven cloth, dyed yarn, beads, gold thread on stitched and padded canvas. The painting is considered as Abad's greatest work on canvas. The Painted Bridge in Singapore is believed to be Abad's last creation before succumbing to cancer. During Abad's time in San Francisco's art scene, she married painter George Kleiman, though they later separated. She traveled to art scenes across Asia for a year with Stanford business student Jack Garrity, then returned to the U.S. to study painting, first at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington D.C. and later, at The Art Students League in New York City. While in California, she married Garrity, who became an international development economist.Thelma B. Kintanar, Sylvia Mendez Ventura, Self-Portraits 2: Fourteen Filipina Artists Speak (Ateneo de Manila University Press 1999): pp. 3-22. Works Abad created over 4,500 artworks in her career. Her early paintings were primarily figurative socio- political works of people and primitive masks. Another series was large scale paintings of underwater scenes, tropical flowers, and animal wildlife. Pacita's most extensive body of work, however, is her vibrant, colorful abstract work - many very large scale canvases, but also a number of small collages - on a range of materials from canvas and paper to bark cloth, metal, ceramics, and glass. She painted the 55-meter long Alkaff Bridge in Singapore and covered it with 2,350 multicolored circles, just a few months before she died. Abad developed a technique of trapunto painting (named after a quilting technique), which entailed stitching and stuffing her painted canvases to give them a three-dimensional, sculptural effect. She then began incorporating into the surface of her paintings materials such as traditional cloth, mirrors, beads, shells, plastic buttons, and other objects. Awards and recognition Abad received numerous awards during her artistic career. Her most memorable award was her first, the TOYM Award for Art in the Philippines in 1984. The Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM)Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) is an award that had always been given to men, until 1984, when Abad became the first woman to receive this prestigious award. After she received the award, a public uproar erupted in which angry letters were sent by male artists to editors of published newspapers who thought that she should not have received the award. Despite this opposition, Abad was thrilled that she had broken the sex barrier, and she stated in her acceptance speech that \\"it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women\\", and proudly referred to her mother. *\\"Parangal for Pacita Abad\\" - in memory of the late international artist, National Museum of the Philippines, January 2005 *\\"Art in Embassies - Indonesia\\", United States Department of State, September 2001 *\\"Pamana Ng Pilipino Award\\" for outstanding achievement in the arts, given by the President of the Philippines, Manila, June 2000 *\\"Plaque of Recognition to Pacita B.

Legacy Abad established a unique trapunto technique in painting, and has influenced numerous art scholars. She received numerous international awards in the field of painting. Her works have been acquired and prized by art museums in Tokyo, Paris, London, Singapore, San Francisco, New York City, Hong Kong, and Manila, among others. Her art has been in the national collections of at least 70 countries worldwide. The Fundacion Pacita Batanes Nature Lodge in Basco, Batanes, \\"was lovingly refurbished\\" by her brother, Butch Abad. Pacita Abad's works have been displayed in numerous galleries and museums in the Philippines during the annual Philippine Arts Month and art festivals.

The district serves students in the community of Fleetwood as well as Richmond Township (Walnuttown, Richmond, Moselm Springs, and Virginville) to the north and Maidencreek Township (Blandon, Maidencreek, Evansville, Molltown and Kirbyville) to the south. The district offers a wide variety of academic courses, music, the arts, sports programs and extra curricular activities. The district meets state requirements across their academic areas (Annual Yearly Progress). District Overview The Fleetwood Area School District serves the children of Fleetwood Borough, Maidencreek Township, and Richmond Township. The district covers over thirty-nine square miles in northeastern Berks County. As of the close of school in June 2007, the district‚Äôs enrollment was 2,694 students in grades K-12. These students are served in five buildings, including three K‚Äì4 elementary schools, a 5‚Äì8 middle school, and a high school for grades 9‚Äì12. There is one elementary school located in each of the three district municipalities. The tax base for the school district is primarily residential, with a few exceptions, including the factories of East Penn Manufacturing and Giorgio Food Company. The school district has experienced significant growth in its student population over the past fifteen years. To accommodate additional students, the district built a new high school nine years ago that was followed by renovations and an addition to its middle school. Each of the three elementary schools were renovated with additions between fifteen and twenty years ago. As a result of ongoing growth in the elementary student population, the district opened a new elementary school in fall 2009. The new elementary building, Willow Creek Elementary, replaced Fleetwood Elementary as the third elementary school in the district. In addition to the increasing numbers of students, the district has undergone a gradual shift from primarily a small town and agricultural community to one with an increasing number of students who speak English as a second language or display learning challenges. As a result, the district has employed additional staff to address these needs including English Language Acquisition teachers and instructors to support students with identified special education needs. Overall, 1004 students in grades K-4 are served by 85 instructional staff. There is one principal assigned to each of the three elementary buildings. There are 65 instructional staff to support 813 middle school students and there are 71 instructional staff at the high school to serve 881 students. At both the middle and high school levels, a principal and an assistant are assigned. Central administration includes a superintendent and assistant superintendent who jointly oversee the operation of the school district. The superintendent directly supervises the business operation of the school district in conjunction with the business manager and her assistant. In addition, the superintendent also supervises the director of student services whose responsibilities include special education and pupil services staff and programs. The assistant superintendent is responsible for designing and supervising curriculum implementation district-wide and, together with the superintendent, supervises the principals. The Fleetwood Area School District is the home of the Fleetwood Tigers. The school district colors are red and white. The district is one of eighteen public school districts that comprise the Berks County Intermediate Unit (#14). The intermediate unit hosts regular meetings for leaders of its member districts including superintendents, curriculum coordinators, human resource directors, and principals. These meetings facilitate sharing best practices, addressing problems, and planning professional development initiatives. The district collaborates with local businesses and the Chamber of Commerce. Presently, the superintendent serves as a director on the Northeast Berks Chamber of Commerce board and on the Berks Business Education Coalition board. Both of these organizations support the training of students to provide the county with a viable workforce. There is ongoing communication between the school district and local employers as to their needs and expectations for new employees. In addition, the district has many specialized classes assisting students to not only prepare themselves for college, but also to earn college credit. The district offers advance placement courses in English, World History, US History, Calculus, US Government & Macroeconomics, Chemistry, and Biology. In addition, the district has dual enrollment agreements with the Reading Area Community College for Calculus, US History, Biology, English, Accelerated Physics, and Spanish III & IV. The district also has an agreement with Lehigh Carbon Community College for Television Production.

In spite of his very advanced age, his pontificate lasted almost seven years. On Christmas Day, 1197 the 91-year-old Pope expressed the wish to abdicate the papacy on condition that his close collaborator Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo would be elected the new pope.The Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Innocent III The cardinals rejected the suggestion as inconsistent with the rule that papal elections must be free ones.T.

On the same day that Celestine III had died the cardinals assembled in Septizodium (or possibly in the nearby church of Santa Lucia in Septisolio)Or possibly the Septasolium. There has been confusion about these locations, as described by Dr. J. P. Adams in the voluntary enclosure,For this reason, some authors consider this election as the first papal conclave (A. Piazzoni, p. 176, note 2), but the formal procedures of the conclave would not be developed until the papal election, 1268‚Äì1271, and were first implemented in the papal conclave, January 1276 as reported by pope Innocent himself on a letter on January 9th. This may have been done to guarantee safety and freedom in the election, given the presence and influence of the Germans in Italy. For the first time the electors voted by scrutiny (per scrutinium). Some cardinals were elected scrutineers; they counted the votes, recorded the result and announced it to the rest of the Sacred College.A. Piazzoni, p. 177. Piazzoni cites for this statement two anonymous contemporary sources: Oratio pro eligendo pontifice and Gesta Innocentii papae. However, according to T. Greenwood, p. 299, there is some evidence suggesting that similar procedure might have been already used in the papal election, 1191, but the source that he cited is brief and ambiguous, and is insufficient to ascertain it. In the first scrutiny Cardinal Giovanni di Salerno received the greatest number of votes (ten), but declared that he would not accept the election to the pontificate.W. Maleczek, p. 108 Ottaviani di Paoli also received three votes, but declared his own preference for Lotario. In the second scrutiny the cardinals united their votesUnanimity of the election: Smith, p. 12 in favor of 37-year-old Cardinal Lotario dei Conti di Segni, deacon of SS. Sergio e Bacco, who was the youngest of all the cardinals.S. Miranda Cardinal Lotario dei Conti di Segni. He accepted his election and took the name Innocent III. The name was possibly chosen for him by cardinal Graziano da Pisa, as a means to supplant the memory of Antipope Innocent III. Another possibility (hypothesized more recently) is that he chose the name himself, maybe as a reference to his predecessor Innocent II (1130‚Äì1143), who had succeeded in asserting the papacy's authority over the emperor (in contrast with Celestine III's recent policy).Julien Th√©ry-Astruc, \\"Introduction\\", in Innocent III et le Midi (Cahiers de Fanjeaux, 50), Toulouse, Privat, 2015, pp. 13‚Äì14 On 22 February 1198 the new pope was ordained to the priesthood and consecrated to the episcopate by Cardinal Ottaviano di Paoli, bishop of Ostia e Velletri, and solemnly crowned by Cardinal Graziano da Pisa, protodeacon of SS.

History The Pincher Creek electoral district was founded as one of the original 25 electoral districts contested in the 1905 Alberta general election upon Alberta joining Confederation in September 1905. The Pincher Creek electoral district was abolished prior to the 1940 Alberta general election and the territory was redistributed into the Pincher Creek-Crowsnest and Cardston electoral districts. Electoral history The first general election held in the Pincher Creek electoral district turned into a hotly contested four way race. Large portions of the population worked as coal miners in the mountains while the foothills provided prime land for cattle ranching. Former Mayor of Town of Pincher Creek R. O. Allison would unsuccessful contest the 1926 and 1935 Alberta general elections. Election results 1905 general election The Returning Officer for the election was James H. Schofield. The provincial Liberal candidate in the election was local rancher John Marcellus. The provincial Conservatives ran John Kemmis. The third party candidate in the race was Frank Sherman who stood as a Labor candidate representing the United Mine Workers Union. Rounding out the field was Independent candidate Charles Kettles. Kettles was well known for founding the Pincher Creek townsite in 1882 when he worked for the North-West Mounted Police and served as a Department of Indian Affairs employee. He also ran a grocery store C. Kettles & Co. He dropped out of the race in time to have his name stricken off the ballot. On election night the race between Marcellus and Sherman seesawed back and forth. At one time during the night Marcellus had conceded his defeat as Sherman pulled ahead in first place. However the election turned as the final polls brought in favorable results for Marcellus leading him to a close victory. Kemmis ran a close third through the evening. 1909 general election 1911 by-election 1913 general election 1917 general election 1921 general election 1926 general election 1930 general election 1935 general election See also *Alberta provincial electoral districts *Pincher Creek, Alberta, a town in southern Alberta, Canada References Further reading * External links *Elections Alberta *The Legislative Assembly of Alberta Former Alberta provincial electoral districts ","title":"Pincher Creek (provincial electoral district)"},{"id":"18895480","text":"Spiros Kastanas () (born December 12, 1962) is a former international Cypriot football defender.

As Gaston had married her in secret in defiance of the King; Louis had their marriage nullified when it became known. On his deathbed, Louis permitted them to marry. After their remarriage, Marguerite and Gaston had five children. She was the stepmother of La Grande Mademoiselle. Life She was born in Nancy, Lorraine to Francis II, Duke of Lorraine, and Countess Christina of Salm. One of six children, she grew up in Nancy which was the capital of her father's duchy. After losing her mother in 1627, she was brought up by her aunt Catherine of Lorraine‚Äîthe Abbess of Remiremont. Two of her older brothers, Charles and Nicolas, were successively dukes of Lorraine. Duchess of Orl√©ans While taking refuge from the wrath of the French prime minister, Cardinal Richelieu, Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, younger brother and heir presumptive of Louis XIII of France, had fallen in love with Marguerite,Velde, Fran√ßois. Heraldica.org. Morganatic and Secret Marriages in the French Royal Family. Royal Consent: the case of Gaston d'Orl√©ans. Retrieved 27 February 2010 however as France and Lorraine were enemies, Gaston was refused permission to marry the sister of its duke, Charles IV of Lorraine. Nonetheless, Gaston returned to Lorraine and, in a secret ceremony in the presence of her family at Nancy during the night of 2‚Äì3 January 1632, Gaston took Marguerite as his wife. Since he had not obtained the prior permission of his elder brother‚Äîone of his many acts of defiance‚Äîthe couple could not appear at the French court and the marriage was kept secret. In November that same year, Henri II, Duke of Montmorency, on his way to the scaffold, betrayed Gaston by revealing the elopement to the king and Richelieu. The king had his brother's marriage declared void by the Parlement of Paris in September 1634 and, despite the Pope's protest, the Assembly of the French clergy affirmed the nullification in September 1635 on the grounds that a prince du sang, especially an heir to the throne, could only enter into matrimony with the permission of the king‚Äîconsistent with French sovereignty and custom. Although Marguerite and Gaston had renewed their marriage before the Archbishop of Malines, a French emissary persuaded the Pope not to publicly protest the matter, and Gaston was forced to accept the annulment of his marriage. When Louis XIII was on his death bed in May 1643, he accepted his brother's plea for forgiveness, authorizing his marriage to Marguerite, whereupon the couple took their vows for the third time in July 1643 before the Archbishop of Paris at Meudon. The Duke and Duchess of Orl√©ans were finally received at court and could begin producing lawful progeny. By right of her marriage, Marguerite became known as Madame at court. After the death of his mother in 1642, Gaston was bequeathed the Luxembourg Palace, which became the couple's Parisian residence under the name Palais d'Orl√©ans once they were restored to royal favour. They also sojourned at the Ch√¢teau de Blois, in the Loire Valley, where their first child was born in 1645. Marguerite, however, did not play any significant role at the French court, although she received a warm welcome after the death of Louis XIII, she suffered from agoraphobia and seldom visited the court where her duties were undertaken by her step-daughter, Mademoiselle, with whom she did not get along.Kleinman, Ruth: Anne of Austria.

It is situated on the northeast shore of the Lullwater, a waterway north of Prospect Park's Lake and southeast of the Ravine. History The Boathouse on the Lullwater was built in 1905-07 to a classical design of Helmle, Hudswell and Huberty, prot√©g√©s of McKim, Mead and White. It supplanted an older wooden boathouse further north. The classical design contains an arcade facing the Lullwater, with a canopy supported by columns of the Tuscan order. The entablature at the top of the columns contains triglyphs, and a balustrade runs atop the canopy, surrounding it and forming a second-floor terrace. The interior of the Boathouse had double staircases that ascended to a second floor, merging at a landing in the middle. There was a boat-renting office at ground level, between the staircases. The second floor was composed of a dining room with doors opening outward onto the terrace. The terrace received a shed in 1915. By the 1960s, the structure was underutilized. The boat concession only operated on weekends and the Boathouse was visited by fewer than ten people an hour, even on the busiest summer weekends. At one point in September 1964, the Parks Department was within forty-eight hours of demolishing the Boathouse. The Boathouse shared many features with McKim, Mead and White's original Pennsylvania Station, whose 1960s demolition had been controversial. The resulting historic preservation movement generated public pressure to save the Boathouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. (includes one map) See also: Though the Boathouse was saved, restorations were deferred for several years. The interior renovations began in 1971, under Commissioner August Heckscher. The Boathouse reopened to the public in 1974, but the exterior terracotta was not renovated until 1979. Further restorations were required in the 1980s under Commissioner Gordon Davis to repair damage from a leaking roof. After twenty years as a visitors center and park ranger headquarters, the Boathouse was restored for a third time in the late 1990s because of deterioration in the terracotta. It now houses the Audubon Center, the Audubon Society's only urban interpretive center in the United States. In popular culture The Boathouse was seen in the movie The Age Of Innocence (1993).

He later died in the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery after undergoing extensive emergency surgery to his brain. He was 18 years old at the time of his death. Causer's funeral was held on 2 October 2008 in a local church in Whiston where he lived. Two teenage men, James O'Connor and Gavin Alker, were charged with the murder. Christopher Douglas was charged with witness intimidation in relation to the case. According to evidence put before the jury, the trigger- point for the violence came when Causer's attackers found sexually explicit images of him on his mobile phone as he slept upstairs in a house where a party had been held. This prompted a sustained and brutal attack as he slept leaving him with a fractured skull and a swollen brain. It was alleged that Alker, who had never met Causer, screamed, \\"You little queer faggot\\" and \\"He‚Äôs a little queer, he deserves it\\". During the trial, it was also claimed that Alker used a cigarette lighter to burn the hair on Mr Causer‚Äôs legs, and that threats were made to rip out his body piercings with a knife. Alker pleaded not guilty, claiming he had acted in self-defence, and blaming the attack on O'Connor. Alker was acquitted of murder and manslaughter. James O'Connor was convicted and sentenced to serve life with a minimum of 11 and a half years before he can be considered for parole after pleading guilty to murder. Michael Binsteed was convicted and sentenced to 34 weeks in custody, suspended for two years. A memorial fund was established, initially to support Causer's family with funeral and legal expenses.

It was written by two of the season's co-executive producers Brett Baer and Dave Finkel, and it was directed by Beth McCarthy. It first aired on April 5, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Will Arnett, Kay Cannon, Matt Dickinson, Dave Finkel, Evan Harrington, Chris Parnell, Maulik Pancholy, Maury Povich, Keith Powell, Stu Richel, Al Roker, Mahadeo Shivraj, Kissy Simmons, Jason Sudeikis and Brendon Walsh. In this episode, Jack Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin) stages a televised firework display, in an attempt to show up his rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett). Devon, upon their first meeting, develops a crush on Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) follows Floyd (Jason Sudeikis), a colleague whom she is attracted to, into Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in an attempt to get closer to him. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) discovers that he is related to Thomas Jefferson and decides to honor his ancestor. James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) discovers a shocking secret about one of his own ancestors. Plot When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations visits from Los Angeles, Jack fears that he is trying to take his job. After having his assistant Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway. Meanwhile, Liz sees Floyd, the corporate employee who she has a crush on, go into a church on a Tuesday afternoon. The next week, she follows him in and finds that he is attending an AA meeting. Liz pretends to be an alcoholic so that she can get closer to Floyd and hear his secrets. After finding out that members of the same AA group are not allowed to date, Liz confesses to Floyd that she was never an alcoholic and that she made it up to get close to him. He gets mad and feels betrayed, so she apologizes and tells him all of her secrets to make it up to him. Floyd forgives her and they begin dating. When it comes time for Jack's important meeting with the network and showdown against Devon Banks, Liz is too busy pursuing Floyd to help Jack with his idea. Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but his idea for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended. Tracy is served with paternity papers and insists that the child is not his. After the DNA test, Tracy learns that the child isn't his but that he is a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson. The news angers Tracy and he talks to Toofer and Frank about it. Toofer learns that he is a direct descendant of Tobias Spurlock, a black Confederate soldier. Tracy and Toofer are upset about the news until Tracy has a dream in which Thomas Jefferson (portrayed by Jack Donaghy) appears to him on The Maury Povich Show. In the dream, Jefferson takes credit for \\"inventing\\" America and tells Tracy to forget his past. Tracy decides that he wants Toofer to write a movie about their experiences and Thomas Jefferson's life. Tracy intends to play all of the parts in the movie, except he intends for the film to be a drama. Production Chris Parnell, who is a recurring guest star, appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live along with series stars, Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan. This is Jack McBrayer and Will Arnett's third time working together. McBrayer made guest appearances as a country club waiter in \\"Burning Love\\" and \\"S.O.B.s\\", two episodes of the situation comedy Arrested Development. Arnett, a member of the main cast of Arrested Development, played George Oscar \\"G.O.B.\\" Bluth II in that series. The plot of the Arrested Development episode in which McBrayer appeared revolved around G.O.B. accidentally becoming a waiter at the Bluth family's country club. This episode was advertised by NBC as a \\"supersized\\" episode, with the total runtime extended from 30 minutes to 40 minutes. It aired at 8:40 pm, after \\"The Negotiation\\" episode of The Office, as opposed to 9:00 pm which was the series' usual timeslot. The husband and wife characters who appear in the 10-second internet sitcom, Makin' It Happen, are played by Dave Finkel and Kay Cannon. Finkel and Cannon are both staff writers on 30 Rock. Cannon was, at the time, also married to guest star Jason Sudeikis and Finkel co-wrote this episode. A series of Makin' It Happen was produced and the webisodes aired on NBC.com. Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". Fey said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as \\"the resident expert\\". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own Star Wars and Tootsie so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his hand up to Tracy and says \\"May the Force be with you\\". Reception \\"Fireworks\\" brought in an average of 5.4 million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, achieving a 2.5/7 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old, and the 7 refers to 7% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast. Compared to the previous episode, \\"The Fighting Irish\\", which aired on March 8, 2007, \\"Fireworks\\" gained 200,000 viewers. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide thought that Will Arnett, who appeared as Devon Banks, was \\"shrewdly cast\\". Webb Mitovich added that this episode displayed some \\"good, good stuff\\". Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad declared \\"Fireworks\\" as \\"one of the best episodes so far this season\\" citing that \\"the writers juggled a handful of storylines very, very well\\". She wrote that the best part of the episodes were \\"the one-liners. They had [her] laughing so hard that [she] frequently had to pause the TiVo to recover.\\" Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode \\"was another prime example of what this show is capable of\\". He thought that \\"the choice of Arnett as Jack Donaghy's nemesis was perfect, right down to their shared graveled vocal delivery\\", and that recurring character Chris Parnell's \\"short, quick hitting scenes are always nonsensical perfection\\".

Produced by local arts organisations Handmade Parade CIC, the parade celebrates the creativity, variety and the uniqueness of Hebden Bridge and its surrounding areas.\\"Colourful parade is hit with crowds\\" Hebden Bridge Times (2008-07-24) The parade takes place in June each year. Origin The Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade was first proposed in 2007 by puppet and mask artist Andrew Kim who had worked as a lead in several community parades and festivals in the USA.Andrew Kim‚Äôs Biog (2008-08-16) The 2008 and 2009 Handmade Parades were co-produced by HEADS and Thingumajig Theatre. A new not-for-profit community interest company was set up in 2010 to organise the parade and the making and performance workshops beforehand. Workshops The art for the parade is created largely in open public workshops in the weeks leading up to the parade. These workshops, led by a team of professional parade artists and volunteers, provide ideas, skills and materials for children and adults to make their own parade costumes, banners, puppets and carryable parade art. This workshop structure is styled after In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre's MayDay Parade. To keep this parade a community-based, non-commercial handmade parade, the Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade has two rules: no written words or logos and no motorised vehicles. These rules are based on the rules for the Fremont Solstice Parade. Lantern Events In 2012, as a response to the terrible floods in the Calder Valley, to help bring the community together and strengthen local businesses, Handmade Parade teamed up with Totally Locally to create Valley of Lights, a 3-town nighttime extravaganza. Following on from such an enthusiastic response for a local lantern event, in 2013, Handmade Parade produced the Lamplighter Festival in Todmorden. Other events and future plans In addition to the annual Hebden Bridge Parade, Handmade Parade has created bespoke parades and participatory events for Incredible Edible Todmorden, Skipton International Puppet Festival and the Rochdale Canal Festival. Their giant puppets and parade art have also been part of many events such as the Huddersfield Festival of Lights and the opening of the Hepworth Wakefield Gallery. Along with their Handmade Samba Band which plays in many local events and their new Festival Flag Hire business, they hope to become a sustainable year-round organisation dedicated to producing two excellent events a year ‚Äì the Hebden Bridge Handmade Parade and the Todmorden Lamplighter Festival ‚Äì and be available to bring their parade magic to local events whenever possible.

Geology Fiftytwo Ridge is a volcanic feature associated with the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. It is a subglacial volcano that formed in the Pleistocene epoch when this area was buried beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Quaternary glaciation. The eruptions melted the ice, so the hot magma contacted with water and caused violent explosions. About 20 small craters can be found today. Some contain fine examples of scoria, an extraordinarily light-weight rock with numerous air- holes. When hiking here early in summer, some of the craters may be filled with runoff water (called maars) and are less obvious. Naming Fiftytwo Ridge has only been called that since 1952 when a biological study was conducted here by Ralph Ritcey and Pat Martin. The name has many different versions such as Fifty Two Ridge, Fifty-Two Ridge and 52 Ridge, but the correct spelling according to BC Geographical Names is one word, Fiftytwo Ridge. As early as 1935, it was known as Bull Ridge and the valley between it and Battle Mountain was called Bull Valley. Clearwater Valley ranchers Laurence and Charlie Ludtke often guided big-game hunters into these meadows, in search of the prized bull caribou.Neave, Roland (2015).

Located in the Rhondda Fach valley it is a district of the community of Ynyshir. Prior to mid 19th century industrialisation the area was once little more than a wooded area, sparsely populated by farmsteads. With the coming of the coal industry Wattstown became a busy, densely populated village, but with the closure of the collieries Wattstown suffered an economic downturn that still affects the village today. Wattstown is named after Edmund Hannay Watts, who at one time owned the National Colliery in Wattstown. Early history and industrialisation The earliest evidence of human activity around what would become Wattstown is found on the hillside at Carn Y Wiwer, overlooking the village; a small grouping of Bronze Age cairns are present and in the same vicinity are the remains of five platform houses; rudimentary, Medieval seasonal farm houses.Davis, Paul R. Historic Rhondda, An Archaeological and Topographical Survey 8000 BC - AD 1850, Hackman: Ynyshir (1989) During the Napoleonic Wars the land around Carn Y Wiwer was cultivated by farmers to produce additional crops.The Rhondda Valley, E.D. Lewis, London (1959)pg. 18-20 Prior to industrialisation, the area that would become Wattstown was known as Pont Rhyd Y Cwch or Pont-Y-Cwtch. Compared to other areas in the Rhondda, Wattstown was slow to be developed as a mining area. The first deep mine, the National Colliery, originally known as Cwtch Colliery before being renamed the Standard, was sunk sometime in the late 1870s by Richard Evans and first appeared on the Inspectors' Lists of Mines in 1880.Rhondda Collieries, Volume 1, Number 4 in the Coalfield Series; John Cornwell. D.Brown and Sons Ltd, Cowbridge (1987) pg. 67 The land on which the colliery was built, belonged to Crawshay Bailey and William Bailey, but the mine was owned by several different concerns, including the National Steam Coal Company and Watts & Company, who would give the village its name. Although Wattstown expanded to fulfill the working requirements of its colliery, it never expanded at the same rate as other areas. The village had its own church, dedicated to St. Thomas, built in 1896, schools, chapels and public houses, but its number of private residents was much lower than other similar settlements in the South Wales Valleys. National Colliery 1887 disaster Wattstown would suffer two mining disasters at the National Colliery. The first was on 18 February 1887, when the village was still known as 'Cwtch'. The accident occurred in-between the day and night shifts, which probably saved many lives as 200 men were yet to make their descent into the mine. The explosion was so powerful it damaged the winding gear which delayed the rescue by several hours. Once the rescuers were able to descend they managed to bring to the surface 38 men, 29 of whom were uninjured. In total, the death toll counted thirty nine men and boys, with a total of 6 injured. Although an inquest jury could not come to a conclusion to the cause of the explosion, in his report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, F.A. Bosanquet, placed the cause of the disaster as an explosive cap being fired in an area where there had been a buildup of flammable gas.Rhondda Cynon Taff Library Services Heritage Trail - Wattstown National Colliery 1905 disaster On the 11 July 1905, just four months after the Cambrian Colliery disaster at Clydach Vale, an explosion at the National Colliery in Wattstown resulted in the deaths of 119 men and boys. Only three people were rescued from the mine, but two would later die of their injuries, leaving Matthew Davies as the lone survivor. The report into the cause of the disaster was undertaken by the Inspector of Mines, which concluded that the explosion was caused by illegal use of blasting material underground. Shortly before the explosion occurred, the master sinker had requested blasting cable and a battery to charge the shot. The manager, Mr. Meredith, had entered the mine a quarter of an hour before the explosion and was amongst the list of fatalities. Amongst the messages of condolences received at Wattstown was a message from King Edward VII. On the day of the funeral, the streets were lined by thousands of mourners and the funeral cort√®ge was reported as being over four miles (6 km) long. Sport and leisure Wattstown is home to Wattstown RFC, a rugby union club with over a hundred years of history.

Biography Legeay was the manager of the Peugeot cycling team in its final year of existence in 1986. In 1987, he created the V√©tements Z-Peugeot team as a continuation of the Peugeot cycling team, which he managed until 2008. During its existence, due to changes in sponsorship, the team was renamed Z-Peugeot (1988‚Äì89), Z-Tomasso (1990), Z (1991‚Äì92), GAN (1993‚Äì96) and Cr√©dit Agricole (1997-2008).

He served twice, once before the war then again during the war. He saw active combat while serving aboard three ships, most notably as commander of the USS Essex from 1863‚Äì1864, an ironclad gunship on the Mississippi River. Captain Townsend died of heatstroke while commanding the USS Wachusett in China in 1866, and is buried in Albany, New York. Ancestry Robert Townsend was born on October 21, 1819 in Albany, New York to Isaiah and Hannah Townsend. His father was an executive of the Stirling Iron Works which under his great-grandfather Peter Townsend forged The Great Chain which was strung across the Hudson River at West Point and prevented the British Royal Navy from threatening that important American base and potentially controlling the river. His grandfather was Captain Solomon Townsend who was a merchant ship captain before the American Revolution. Robert Townsend was descended from John and Henry Townsend, New York, among the first settlers of that area in the early 17th century. Early life and pre-Civil War career Townsend received his primary education at The Albany Academy, and his secondary education at the Rev. Dr. Dewey's Boarding School in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. After graduating he attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, but left college before graduating in order to join the board of survey of the Utica and Schenectady Railroad Company. Townsend entered the United States Navy on August 4, 1837, serving first as a midshipman on the ship . In 1838 he was ordered to the battleship , then in each subsequent year to the sloop , the steamship . In 1843 he was promoted to passed midshipman and served on the frigate , then a year later on the brig . He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War from 1846‚Äì1847 where he was engaged in the capture of Vera Cruz. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1850, and resigned from the navy on April 7, 1851. On June 19, 1850, Townsend married Harriet Munro, the daughter of Nathan Munro and Cynthia Champlin, of Elbridge, New York. The couple had three children; a son, Robert Townsend, Jr., born October 4, 1854, and daughters Mary Walker Townsend, born December 23, 1858, and Elizabeth Munroe Townsend, born July 19, 1860. Civil War service At the beginning of the civil war Townsend re-entered the service on 17 September 1861 as acting-lieutenant, receiving a promotion to commander a few months later, and served on a number of fighting ships. USS Miami USS Miami In 1862 Townsend was acting-lieutenant of the under the command of Abram Davis Harrell. The Miami was a side-wheel, double-ender gunboat with a crew of 134 and armament of one 80-pounder Parrott rifle, one 9 inch smoothbore, and four 24-pounder cannon. The ship participated under Admiral David Farragut as part of the Mortar Flotilla in neutralizing Confederate forts below New Orleans. Eliminating the forts permitted the Union ships to move upriver and eventually take New Orleans. Townsend became Commander of the Miami by October of that year. USS Essex USS Essex In 1863, he was promoted to commander and given command of the under Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi Squadron. The Essex was a 1,000 ton ironclad river gunboat of the United States Army and later United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was named for Essex County, Massachusetts. Essex was originally constructed in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana as a steam powered ferry named New Era. She had a crew of 134, armament consisting of one 32-pounder, three 11-inch Dahlgren smooth bores, one 10-inch Dahlgren smoothbore and one 12-pounder howitzer, with armor consisting of 1¬æ inch forward casemate, ¬æ-inch sides. Under Townsend's command the Essex participated in the Siege of Port Hudson which occurred from May 21 to July 9, 1863, when Union Army troops assaulted and then captured the Mississippi River town of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Along with the Mortar Flotilla, the Essex bombarded the area daily and helped bring about the surrender of the city. The Union's success in this battle gave Northern forces effective control of the Mississippi River and effectively cut the states of Arkansas and Texas off from the rest of the confederacy. On July 9, she engaged the enemy at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and although damaged in the battle, carried out her patrol duty at this point through March 6, 1864 when she sailed with the fleet into the mouth of the Red River and assisted in the capture of Fort de Russy on March 15 and 16. Townsend relinquished command of the Essex on November 3, 1864 to Commander Bryson. USS Wachusett USS Wachusett Robert Townsend's grave at the Albany Rural Cemetery. After relinquishing command of the Essex, Townsend was given command of the . The Wachusett was a wooden steam frigate with a detachable propeller, carrying nine guns and a complement of 170 men. She was a large (1,032-ton) steam sloop-of-war that served the United States Navy in the American Civil War. She was outfitted as a gunboat and used by the Navy as part of the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. On February 17, 1865, the ship was given orders to proceed to the East India Station by way of the Cape of Good Hope. There, she joined and in an effort to track down the Confederate commerce raider . While in China the ship was engaged in efforts to track down outlaws and pirates who were harming American interests. In mid-August the ship sailed up the Yangtze River in this mission. The heat was reportedly 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 ¬∞C) in the shade and the ship made difficult passage up the river. A number of cases of heat stroke, some of them fatal occurred. At 1:45 am on August 15, 1866, Robert Townsend died of heat stroke. The executive officer John Woodward (Jack) Philip, (later Admiral), assumed command of the Wachusett and sailed it downriver with the goal of making it to Japan for the health of the crew. That evening the ship anchored by the consulate in Shanghai and held a funeral for their commander. Burial Robert Townsend's body was returned to America and is interred at the Albany Rural Cemetery in New York.

Design and development The J 21 was an all-metal, parasol-wing monoplane of conventional configuration and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The pilot and observer sat in tandem, open cockpits. Two prototypes were constructed at the Junkers factory in Dessau, the second with a wing of reduced area. Despite the fact that the prototypes were unable to attain the performance that had been specified by the Soviets, series production commenced at Fili in August 1923 where it was known as the Ju 21 (–Æ–Ω–∫–µ—Ä—Å –Æ 21 in Cyrillic). The production version differed from the prototypes in having a BMW IV engine in place of the BMW III originally fitted, and carried machine gun armament for both the pilot and observer. Sluggish performance led to a few examples being fitted with L2 and L5 engines, but these provided little improvement. With performance only marginally better than the World War I-vintage de Havilland DH-9A that it had been purchased to replace, the Ju 21 was itself soon replaced by newly built DH-9As built under license as the Polikarpov R-1. The type was also evaluated by the Reichswehrs clandestine training school at Lipetsk, but it was rejected due to its poor performance and the Heinkel HD 17 purchased instead. Variants *J 22 (T 22): single-seat fighter version, very similar to the J 21 but with its wing lowered almost to the top of the fuselage to reduce drag, the pilot's cockpit moved back further than the gunner's position on the J 21 and a more rounded rudder.

Uncommon, it grows mainly at subalpine to alpine elevations in forest openings or above treeline among rocks and sand.Mark Turner & Phyllis Gustafson: Wildflowers of the Pacific Northwest Portland, Or. : Timber Press, c2006., Sericea comes from the Latin sericeus, or silky, referring to the fine hairs on the leaves and stem. Description Phacelia sericea consists of several upright or ascending stems to 0.6 m (2 ft) from a tap-rooted, branched woody base. Its leaves are pinnatifid with cleft or entire segments. The basal leaves are somewhat larger than the upper cauline leaves and are more persistent and petiolate. The leaves and stems are generally covered with silvery silky hairs but are scarcely glandular. P. sericea ssp. sericea flower The inflorescence consists of several short panicles, tightly packed, at the end of the stem, resembling a bottle-brush. The dark blue to purple bell-shaped corolla is 4‚Äì6 mm across. It is hairy inside and out but not glandular. The filaments are two to three times as long as the corolla and give the inflorescence a fuzzy appearance. The anthers are bright yellow or orange and the style is shortly cleft. The fruit consists of two-chambered capsules with 8 to 18 seeds. A subalpine to alpine species of open well-drained slopes, usually above 1500 m elevation, it is found in the mountains of Vancouver Island, the southern British Columbia Pacific Ranges, the Rocky Mountains from Banff National Park to southern Colorado, Olympic National Park, the Cascade Range of Washington, the mountains of eastern Oregon and the northernmost counties of California, and the mountains of Idaho, Nevada and Utah. It generally blooms from near the end of May through the end of August. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognized. *P. sericea ssp. ciliosa is distributed from Oregon and California east to Wyoming and Colorado. *P. sericea ssp. sericea is restricted to the Rocky Mountains, Alaska, British Columbia and Washington. The latter is smaller, more densely hairy, shorter, i.e., less than 0.3 m (1 ft), with relatively narrow and blunt leaf segments. Where the ranges overlap, P. sericea ssp. ciliosa occurs at a lower elevation than ssp. sericea. These are listed as subspecies by the USDA PLANTS database and ITIS, and as varieties by Jepson and Hitchcock. Uses Phacelia sericea is listed by the Federal Highway Administration as a native species suitable for landscaping along roadsides in Colorado. It should be handled with care as the long flower hairs have been reported to irritate skin.

It is flanked by Hemp Creek to the west and Trout Creek to the east.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . Geology About 200,000 years ago, a lake formed in the Hemp Canyonlands with its upper end near the meeting of Trout and Hemp creeks. The lake bottom was about above the present bottom of the Hemp Creek Valley. The surface of the lake was the rim of the Hemp cliffs a few kilometres south of The Flatiron. The lake was created by a blockage downstream on the Clearwater River, but its actual location is unknown, and this could have been an ice dam, a landslide or a lava flow. The Flatiron erupted into this lake and was once much bigger than today. This action is called a ponded lava flow. The lava used to extend right across the Hemp Creek Valley, but floods from melting glaciers carried away the lava and left The Flatiron as a remnant. The water flow might have been 100 times the size of Hemp Creek today. The lava that is exposed today cooled very slowly and formed into columns, one of the park‚Äôs finest examples of columnar basalt. The columns that make up the Flatiron have been falling away regularly and piling up at the base, so the Flatiron keeps gets thinner. Access A one-hour hike from Clearwater Valley Road (also called Wells Gray Park Road) leads to a viewpoint of the Hemp Canyonlands with the Flatiron in the distance. After another 30 minutes hiking, it is necessary to leave the trail and bushwhack to the base of the Flatiron. As the cliffs almost surround the Flatiron, the only access to the top is a scramble from the west side above Hemp Creek.

The name Australia was specifically applied to the continent for the first time in 1794.\\"First Instance of the Word Australia being applied specifically to the Continent - in 1794\\" Zoology of New Holland - Shaw, George, 1751-1813; Sowerby, James, 1757-1822 Page 2. The name Australia (pronounced in Australian EnglishAustralian pronunciations: Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. ) is derived from the Latin australis, meaning \\"southern\\", and specifically from the hypothetical Terra Australis postulated in pre-modern geography. The name was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders from 1804, and it has been in official use since 1817, replacing \\"New Holland,\\" the Dutch name, as the name for the continent. History The name Australia has been applied to two continents. Originally, it was applied to the south polar continent, or sixth continent, now known as Antarctica. The name is a shortened form of Terra Australis which was one of the names given to the imagined (but undiscovered) land mass that was thought to surround the south pole. The earliest known use of the name Australia in Latin was in 1545, when the word appears in a woodcut illustration of the globe titled \\"Sphere of the Winds\\" contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt. In the nineteenth century, the name Australia was re- assigned to New Holland, the fifth continent. Thereafter, the south polar continent remained nameless for some eighty years until the new name of Antarctica was invented. A Terra Australis \\"land of the south\\" appeared on world maps from the 15th century, although it was not based on any actual surveying of such a landmass but rather on the hypothesis that continents in the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the south.John Noble Wilford: The Mapmakers, the Story of the Great Pioneers in Cartography from Antiquity to Space Age, p. 139, Vintage Books, Random House 1982, This theory of balancing land is on record as early as the 5th century on maps by Macrobius.Ambrosius Aurelius Theodosius Macrobius, Zonenkarte. Retrieved 7 July 2014. The earliest recorded use of the word Australia in English was in 1625 in \\"A note of Australia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, written by Sir Richard Hakluyt\\", published by Samuel Purchas in Hakluytus Posthumus, a variation of the original Spanish name \\"Austrialia del Espiritu Santo\\" (Southern-Austrian Land of the Holy Spirit) coined by navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s in 1606 for the largest island of Vanuatu, believing his expedition had reached Terra Australis.Purchas, vol. iv, pp. 1422‚Äì32, 1625. This appears to be variation of the original Spanish \\"Austrialia\\" . A copy at the Library of Congress can be read online . This is a rare combination of terms \\"Austral\\" and \\"Austria\\", the latter in honour of the Habsburg dynasty that ruled Spain at the time.Barber, Peter et al. Mapping Our World: Terra Incognita To Australia, National Library of Australia, 2013, p. 107. The Dutch adjectival form Australische was used in a Dutch book in Batavia (Jakarta) in 1638, to refer to the newly discovered lands to the south. Australia was later used in a 1693 translation of Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la D√©couverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe, a 1676 French novel by Gabriel de Foigny, under the pen-name Jacques Sadeur.Baker, Sidney J. (1966) The Australian Language, 2nd ed. Referring to the entire South Pacific region, Alexander Dalrymple used it in An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean in 1771. The name Australia was specifically applied to the continent for the first time in 1794, with the botanists George Shaw and Sir James Smith writing of \\"the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or New Holland\\" in their 1793 Zoology and Botany of New Holland, and James Wilson including it on a 1799 chart. The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who pushed for it to be formally adopted as early as 1804. When preparing his manuscript and charts for his 1814 A Voyage to Terra Australis, he was persuaded by his patron, Sir Joseph Banks, to use the term Terra Australis as this was the name most familiar to the public. Flinders did so, and published the following rationale: In the footnote to this Flinders wrote: This is the only occurrence of the word Australia in that text; but in Appendix III, Robert Brown's General remarks, geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis, Brown makes use of the adjectival form Australian throughout,‚Äîthe first known use of that form. Despite popular conception, the book was not instrumental in the adoption of the name: the name came gradually to be accepted over the following ten years.Estensen, p. 450 The first time that the name Australia appears to have been officially used was in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of 4 April 1817 in which Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Capt. Flinders' charts of Australia. On 12 December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.Weekend Australian, 30‚Äì31 December 2000, p. 16 In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia. Ulimaroa was a name given to Australia by the Swedish geographer and cartographer Daniel Djurberg in 1776. Djurberg adapted the name from Olhemaroa, a Maori word found in Hawkesworth's edition of Captain James Cook and Sir Joseph Banks' journals which is thought to have been a misunderstood translation the Maori were actually referring to Grand Terre, the largest island of New Caledonia. Djurberg believed the name meant something like \\"big red land\\", whereas modern linguists believe it meant \\"long hand\\" echoing the geography of Grand Terre. The spurious name continued to be reproduced on certain European maps, particularly some Austrian, Czech, German and Swedish maps, until around 1820, including in Carl Almqvist's 1817 novel Parjumouf Saga ifr√•n Nya Holland (Stockholm, 1817). Commonwealth of Australia The sovereign country Australia, formed in 1901 by the Federation of the six British colonies, is officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, abbreviated within the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act and the Constitution of Australia to \\"the Commonwealth\\". Oz The country has been referred to colloquially as Oz by people outside the country since the early 20th century; and by Australians in more recent times. The Oxford English Dictionary records a first occurrence in 1908, in the form Oss. Oz is often taken as an oblique reference to the fictional Land of Oz in the film The Wizard of Oz (1939), based on L. Frank Baum's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900).Jacobson, H. (1988) In the Land of Oz, Penguin, . In 1988, an American opinion was that Australians' \\"image of Australia as a 'Land of Oz' is not new, and dedication to it runs deep\\"The Americana Annual: 1988, Americana Corporation, vol. 13, 1989, p. 66, but evidence for this view within Australia itself is lacking. The spelling Oz is likely to have been influenced by the 1939 film, though the pronunciation was probably always with a /z/, as it is also for Aussie, sometimes spelt Ozzie.Partridge, Eric, et al., The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, Taylor & Francis, 2006, , entries \\"Oz\\" and \\"Ozzie\\", p. 1431. The Baz Luhrmann film Australia (2008) makes repeated reference to The Wizard of Oz, which appeared just before the wartime action of Australia. Some critics have even speculated that Baum was inspired by Australia, in naming the Land of Oz: \\"In Ozma of Oz (1907), Dorothy gets back to Oz as the result of a storm at sea while she and Uncle Henry are travelling by ship to Australia. So, like Australia, Oz is somewhere to the west of California. Like Australia, Oz is an island continent. Like Australia, Oz has inhabited regions bordering on a great desert. One might almost imagine that Baum intended Oz to be Australia, or perhaps a magical land in the center of the great Australian desert.\\"Algeo, J., \\"Australia as the Land of Oz\\", American Speech, Vol. 65, No. 1, 1990, pp. 86‚Äì89. Other epithets and nicknames Australia is colloquially known as \\"the Land Down Under\\" (or just \\"Down Under\\"), which derives from the country's position in the Southern Hemisphere, at the antipodes of the United Kingdom. The term was first recorded in print in 1886, and was popularised internationally by the 1980 song of the same name by Men at Work.Oxford English Dictionary (Electronic), Version 4.0, entry for \\"down under\\". The dictionary recodes the first published use in 1886 by J. A. Froude in Oceana p. 92 \\"We were to bid adieu to the 'Australasian'‚Ä¶She had carried us safely down under.\\" Other less common nicknames include \\"Straya\\" (\\"Australia\\" pronounced in an exaggerated Strine manner), and \\"Aussie\\", which is usually used as a demonym, but occasionally extended to the country as a whole (especially in New Zealand). More poetic epithets used within Australia include \\"the Great Southern Land\\" (re-popularised by a 1980s rock song, and not to be confused with the Great Southern region of Western Australia),For example, in: Helen Trinca (14 February 2015).

The film also stars Susan Clark, Cameron Mitchell, Morgan Woodward, Harris Yulin, Robert Quarry, Joan Lorring, Lawrence Dobkin, Ed Lauter, Mills Watson, Charles Tyner and Catherine Bach.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071838/ Plot A former Chicago policeman, Jim Slade (Lancaster), has just been released on parole from prison for shooting his wife's lover in their bed. He goes to live with friends, Quartz (Cameron Mitchell) and wife Judy (Joan Lorring), in a small town where he has been offered a job (part of his parole agreement) as a night watchman at Jordon College. A coed (Catherine Bach) is murdered and the local sheriff, Casey (Harris Yulin), tries to pin the crime on a creepy college janitor (Charles Tyner) who spouts Biblical revelation while hiding pornography. Slade has other ideas and pursues an unauthorized investigation of his own. \\"Taking the lid off the hornet's nest involves him in considerable danger as blackmails, beatings, attempted rape and further murders wrestle for screentime before the long and-overcomplicated drama grinds to a close.\\" Clinch, Minty, \\"Burt Lancaster\\", Stein and Day, New York, 1984, Library of Congress card number 84-40625, , page 147. The murdered student turns out to be the daughter of Senator Clayborne (Morgan Woodward), who subsequently receives blackmail letters over his daughter Natalie's confession to her campus psychiatric department counselor about an incestuous relationship with her father. Incriminating cassette tapes of the account have fallen into the hands of the blackmailers. Slade questions possible suspects including Natalie Clayborne's estranged boyfriend Arthur King (played by Burt Lancaster's son, William), who declares to Slade that the generation gap \\"just got a little wider,\\" and Dean Collins, the psych professor (played by actual Clemson faculty member Harold N. Cooledge Jr.), as well as a nerdy student whose taped psych rant was also stolen and Senator Clayborne himself. All the while, Slade is being warned off of overstepping his authority as a mere night watchman, no longer a cop, by his parole officer Linda Thorpe (Susan Clark), as well as by his buddy Quartz. A brief affair between Slade and Thorpe begins. A rustic family of thugs, including Leroy (Ed Lauter), overseen by a \\"Ma Barker\\"-ish mother arrive, turning out to be \\"muscle\\" for certain corrupt members of the Sheriff's Department. Slade realizes that both the parole officer and Quartz are the powers behind the crime, a conclusion Slade reaches as he watches his friend hobble around the cinder track, on crutches from a broken leg. Only Quartz could have known one critical clue in the cover-up of the original murder. Sheriff Casey rolls up and arrests Quartz. As they depart, Slade confronts Thorpe, who produces the stolen tapes, hidden in her freezer, knowing that the jig is up and she, too, is about to be arrested. The film concludes with the sheriff offering Slade an apology and a job, even though, as a convicted violent felon, Slade cannot hold a position with the law.

History In the late 1940s the city of Auburn decided that the town needed a centrally-located park and football and baseball facilities for Auburn High School, which had previously been playing home matches at nearby Auburn University. The nearest property suitable for such a park to downtown was owned by Felton Little, who donated the land to the city in September 1947.\\"Eight Acres Is Given City For Park By Little Heirs\\", Lee County Bulletin, September 4, 1947. On September 30, 1949, the park was dedicated as Auburn City Park as the Auburn High football team played Tuskegee High School. As the football field was equipped with outdoor lights, this was the first night football game to be played in Auburn.Lee County Bulletin, September 28, 1949. In 1955, the park was renamed \\"Felton Little Park\\" after its benefactor. In 1967, the Auburn High baseball team moved from the park to a new facility on the high school campus (today Sam Welborn Field), and on October 4, 1968, the football team played its final game at Felton Little before inaugurating its new stadium, Duck Samford Stadium. In the early 1970s, the park was converted to house three youth-league baseball fields, and in 2003 the park underwent a major renovation which converted the three fields to softball fields.Auburn and Opelika Tourism Bureau, Auburn- Opelika Sporting Facilities Guide (2006), 2; Lee County Bulletin, October 2, 1968.

(2001). Larousse gastronomique. New York, Clarkson Potter., though the modern version is usually made with ham, cheese and stale bread added. The name derives from the use of the term garb to describe sheaves of grain depicted on a heraldic shield or coat of arms. Thus the name of garbure, which is eaten with a fork, is a reference to the use of pitchforks to pick up sheaves of grain. It originated in Gascony in southwest France. It is similar to pot√©e.w:fr:Garbure Garbure was the daily sustenance of Gascon peasantry. It differed from one home to the next and varied with the rhythms of the seasons, the resources of the cook, and with household income. The basic principle behind this dish is the lengthy simmering of an assortment of vegetables and meats, generally meats preserved en confit. As far as vegetables go, anything is possible. The cabbage may be accompanied by broad beans, fresh or dried, mangetout peas, potatoes, turnips, peas, onions, carrots, celeriac, kohlrabi, beets, lettuce, chestnuts, nettles or borage. Thus the garbure could be adapted to the needs of every household. A large tureen of garbure is often presented to the table in Bearnais restaurants, and guests can help themselves to as much as they wish at the start of the meal using the ladle supplied. Frequently the meal would end with a traditional chabrot, which is a custom of mixing half a glass of red wine in with the liquid left in the bottom of one's bowl after eating the solid contents, and then consuming it.

It contained a single species, Rhipaeosaurus tricuspidens. A bayesian analysis suggests that it is more closely related to pareiasaurs than to the other nycteroleterids, due to skull and tooth features. For this reason, \\"Nycteroleteridae\\" may be a grade rather than a clade.  Description  Rhipaeosaurus is around a meter long, larger than any other \\"nycteroleterids\\" and closer in size to later pareiasaurs. Postcranial remains were similar to Macroleter, though the limbs were more robust and the ankle bones were unfused. The teeth were flattened and tricuspid (possessing three cusps), seemingly intermediate in form between the one- or two-cusped teeth of earlier nycteroleterids and the multi-cusped teeth of pareiasaurs. Many components of the partial skull and skeleton (which was originally fairly complete) had been lost or degraded between 1940 and 2012, obscuring most aspects of its anatomy.  History  Rhipaeosaurus was first described in 1940, from a fairly complete skeleton found in the Ural Mountains of Russia. The name 'Rhipaeosaurus' comes from '·ø¨ŒπœÄŒ±ŒµŒøœÇ' 'Rhipaeos), a range of mountains in Greek mythology thought to be the Urals, and 'œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ', meaning 'lizard'. 'Tricuspidens' refers to its three-cusped teeth. Rhipaeosaurus' taxonomic history has been full of difficulties. At first it was placed in its own family, the Rhipaeosauridae, and considered the type species. Other taxa, such as Parabradysaurus and Leptoropha, later joined it in this family. However, when more remains of these additional taxa were found, they were determined not to be rhipaeosaurids at all. Parabradysaurus was found to be an estemnosuchid, more closely related to mammals, and Leptoropha was identified as a seymouriamorph amphibian. Rhipaeosaurus's status as a parareptile is still considered relatively stable, either as a basal nycteroleterid or a transitional taxon between other \\"nycteroleterids\\" and pareiasaurus.

Biography Family life Bylandt was born at The Hague, the son of major-general Alexander count of Bylandt and Anne, baroness Van der Duijn. His father was the acting-governor of the fortress of Breda who in 1793 was held responsible for the less-than-vigorous defense of that city against the French armies then invading the Dutch Republic. Alexander was court- martialed and sentenced to life imprisonment.Winkler Prins, p. 532 Bylandt first married Mary Christian (daughter of rear-admiral Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian) on June 20, 1806 at the Isle of Wight. After her death in 1818 he married Virginie Fr√©derique Wilhelmine Aspasia Craan (daughter of Willem Benjamin Craan) on December 22, 1825 in St. Joost-ten-Node (Belgium).Van der Aa, p. 1705 Early career Bylandt was the scion of a well-known Dutch military family, both army and navy officers (a cousin became a well-known admiral of the same epoch). He first entered the service of the Dutch Republic as a cadet at age 12 in a regiment of Dragoons in 1783. In 1786 he became an NCO in the elite Gardes te paard (Horse Guards Regiment), and shortly afterward shifted to the Foot Guards as a second lieutenant (as such he took part on the Orangist side in the suppression of the Revolt of the Patriots). Promoted to captain in 1790 he transferred to the Schwartz battalion in 1794. He participated in the 1792-1795 campaigns of the War of the First Coalition, fighting in the Battle of Fleurus (1794) among others.Van der Aa, p. 1703 After the fall of the Republic and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic in January, 1795 Bylandt resigned his commission and joined the Hereditary Prince (the future William I of the Netherlands) in Bremen with other √©migr√©s, and followed the Prince to England later in the year to join a group of Orangist Dutch military men, who offered their services to the British. On November 25, 1795 he obtained a captain's commission in the regiment Hompesch Hussars that was sent to fight in the West Indies. He transferred to a regiment of chasseurs in 1796 as a major and was promoted to lieutenant- colonel in 1797. He so distinguished himself in the assault on Trinidad that he was entrusted with the military government of Antigua. In 1800 he rejoined the Hompesch Hussars as a lieutenant-colonel to take part in the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He participated in the Battle of Ballinamuck with distinction.Van der Aa, p. 1704 After the Peace of Amiens Bylandt was paid off by the British and returned to the Batavian Republic to manage his estates near Breda. Only after the Netherlands regained its independence in 1813 did he again enter military service, this time as a lieutenant-colonel of the new Battalion Landmilitie (Militia) No. 12 (which was renumbered No. 8 in 1814). He was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1814. On April 21, 1815 he was put in charge of the First Brigade, Second Netherlands Division (Perponcher) as a major-general.For a complete overview of his role and the history of the Netherlands field army prior to 15 June 1815, see: Erwin Muilwijk, From mobilisation to war, Sovereign House Books, 2012. . Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo On the evening of June 15, 1815 Bylandt's brigade was ordered by general Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque, chief of staff of the Netherlands Mobile Army, to take up position at the cross roads of Quatre Bras, because a French attack by Marshal Michel Ney was expected. Bylandt deployed a skirmish line of his 27th Jager Battalion and awaited developments. The next day the expected French attack came, and the Dutch troops (still without British support at this time) were hard pressed. Bylandt's brigade was concentrated around the G√©mioncourt farm and the open fields east of the nearby Bossu woods. The Dutch troops were finally relieved by the arrival of general Thomas Picton's Fifth British Division and the 2nd Dutch Light Cavalry Brigade (general Van Merlen) around 3 pm. After a hard- fought battle the Allies were left in command of the battlefield. Bylandt's brigade was now ordered to the vicinity of Waterloo.Erwin Muilwijk, Quatre Bras, Perponcher's gamble, Sovereign House Books, 2013. . What happened next is the subject of some controversy. The Duke of Wellington placed his allied army in two lines and a reserve behind a ridge on the north side of what would become the battlefield. The ridge was supposed to offer some cover for the Allied troops against artillery fire. At first, however, Bylandt's brigade was placed in front of this ridge on the evening of 17 June. The controversy concerns the question whether this supposed tactical error (the result of sloppy staff work) was remedied in time, before the brigade would have been exposed to the fire of the French Grand Battery. In many accounts of the battle it is asserted that the brigade (already depleted by the losses at Quatre Bras, numbering 11% of its original strength) in fact remained deployed in this exposed position and therefore suffered terribly during Napoleon's opening artillery barrage. But this is doubtful, because the after-battle report by the chief-of-staff of the 2nd Division (then captain) Van Zuylen van Nyevelt states that the brigade was in time moved to a safer position.Erwin Muilwijk, Standing firm at Waterloo, Sovereign House Books, 2014. . Recent research based upon the accounts of numerous Dutch veterans of the battle, including reports after the battle, no longer leave any doubt to the fact that Bylandt's brigade was already placed behind the hollow road and under cover of the ridge by 9 a.m. on the morning of 18 June. Further research in 2016 has discovered several sketched maps of the position, made at the time (shortly afterwards) by Van Bylandt himself and Van Zuylen van Nyevelt. Another official map made by the Hanoverians for Siborne's investigations also shows the brigade behind the ridge from the start of the battle. These Hanoverian maps were never included by Siborne for his model, nor his book on the battle. The famous map of the battlefield by Bylandt's future father-in-law Willem Benjamin Craan and his appended explanatory note, also place the brigade in this safer position. Craan's 1816 history of the battle therefore does not mention heavy casualties for Bylandt's brigade as a consequence of Napoleon's opening barrage of 80 guns, but instead blames the infantry charge by d'Erlon's divisions on the sector of the Allied front that the brigade occupied for these indeed heavy casualties. As the Dutch troops received several point-blank volleys, and because they were deployed in a thin line (to cover as much terrain as possible according to Craan) the French broke through their line and the remnants of two of the Militia battalions retreated in haste, until they were rallied by the 5th Militia Battalion, that was placed in reserve. (1817) An historical account of the battle of Waterloo, pp. 17-18 During this enemy action Bylandt himself was wounded and the command of the brigade was taken over by the commander of the 8th Militia Battalion, lt.-col. W. A. de Jongh. After the battle Bylandt received the Knight's Cross Third Class of the Military William Order for his gallantry.Van der Aa, p. 1704 Later career After the return of the army to the new Kingdom of the United Netherlands Bylandt was appointed military governor of South-Brabant (which contained Brussels). He was military governor of that city when in 1830 the Belgian Revolution started. Because he acted less than decisively the situation soon got out of hand. He was blamed for this and put on non-active status on November 24, 1830. In the following years he published several pamphlets to defend his good name. He retired from the service in 1840 but was nevertheless promoted to lieutenant-general in 1843. Bylandt died aged 84 on his estate at Prinsenhage, near Breda, in 1855.

Gameplay When holding down the attack button, the player moves at slower speed, and all on-screen items are automatically retrieved. The player character is invulnerable when a special attack is in effect. When the player character is close to an enemy bullet, the points gained from destroying enemies and retrieving items is multiplied by a factor based on the distance between the bullet and the player character's center. The closer they are to the bullet, the higher the scoring. When destroying enemy in shikigami mode, the multiplier also applies to the number of items dropped by enemy and all items dropped by the enemy are automatically retrieved. The Xbox release adds Practice mode, Gallery, and Replay mode, while the PlayStation 2 release adds Practice mode, Gallery, and Side Story modes. Windows includes I.R. mode and vertical screen layout from the arcade game. The North American and European releases of the game removed the screen rotation mode and all in-game plot.

Film rights were sold in December 1966. Filmed in Australia and London, this was the last big-screen appearance of Franchot Tone, who plays the American ambassador. Rod Taylor has a rare opportunity to play an Australian, even though that is his native land. Taylor's unsophisticated integrity is contrasted with the London diplomatic scene throughout the film. Taylor accepted the role on the proviso he could rewrite some of the script. In particular, the opening scene where Scobie Malone arrests Jacko (Charles Tingwell) is Rod's work.Stephen Vagg, Rod Taylor: An Aussie in Hollywood, Bear Manor Media, 2010 p 139 Ralph Thomas later said \\"I was a hired hand\\" on the film; \\"It was ok\\".Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-century Cinema by Wheeler W. Dixon, SIU Press, 2001 p113 Differences from novel There were several key changes from the novel, including: *introducing Scobie Malone as an outback policeman; *reducing the emphasis on the peace conference being for the Vietnam War and making it something more vague; *Scobie having sex with Maria Cholon.

Life Linder was born in Hammer√∂, near Karlstad on July 28, 1907. He studied organ with Claes Rendahl and Otto Nordlund (organists of Karlstad cathedral) and is reported to have learned the complete organ works of Bach by the age of ten.Marshall, 288-289. In 1924 he auditioned, unsuccessfully, to study organ at the Stockholm conservatory with Gustaf H√§gg. He was accepted into the conservatory the following year and became the first organ student of the newly appointed organ professor Otto Olsson. His repertoire during his studies at the conservatory included Bach's Piece d'Orgue, Olsson's Prelude and Fugue in C# minor and Widor's Symphonie Romane. He passed the organist's exam in 1927 and the church music exam in 1933.Marshall, 289-290. In 1938-1940 Linder traveled several times to Leipzig to study organ with G√ºnther Ramin, studies that influenced him greatly. He later described the experience in the program notes of a 1977 recording: :When I made my debut recital, in the Gustaf Vasa Church in Stockholm in 1933, I had included this work [The Bach Prelude and Fugue in D-major (BWV 532)] in my program, and I performed it in the way in which Bach was performed at the time. When I came to G√ºnther Ramin in Lepizig, I played the D-major Fugue for him, almost as I had played it at my debut recital in Stockholm (five years earlier). After that, Ramin played the same piece his way, in a light and airy manner with only 8', 4' and 1' registers. It was a completely new experience for me, bot in terms of sound and technique.Marshall, 292. Linder made his first recordings for Swedish Radio in January and March 1940 and he was appointed organist of the Stockholm Concert Hall the same year, a position he held until 1954. He became the organist of Oscar's Church, Stockholm in 1943Marshall, 291. and held that position until his death in 1983. There he arranged 45 minute organ recitals on Saturday nights and played the complete works of Bach within this recital series 1944-1945. He taught organ at the Stockholm Conservatory starting in 1938 and became professor in 1958. In 1954 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.√Östrand.
