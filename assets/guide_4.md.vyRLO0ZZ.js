During his missionary career, he emphasised learning the customs and wisdom of the local population to contribute towards a greater understanding of missionary work, as well as the importance of consideration of the African lifestyle. He was influential in education, religion, and social aspects, eventually helping relieve tensions between anthropologists and missionaries residing in the region. Cullen Young had a broad range of interests, having passion in missionary work, but also education, ethnography, anthropology, and politics. The broader concerns with African culture included in his writing had political implications in both the pre- and post-independence eras. Later in his life, he developed an interest in African language, culture, and history, writing prolifically on these subjects. Young's studies on the Tumbaka-Kamanga peoples provided the first published record of the ethnography and history of northern Malawi. He also had a friendship with Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who became the first President of Malawi. Young is perceived as an important documentalist on this particular period of missionary history. Young went to Britain to work as a second-rank colonial expert in 1931 and died in 1955 at the age of 75.  Early life and education  Young was born on 27 October 1880 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was named after his father's maternal grandmother. He was also the eldest child of the family, and had a non-identical brother named John. His family later expanded to include four other brothers and one sister. His father was the John Young. At the time of Thomas Young's birth, his father was serving as minister of Newington United Presbyterian Church in Edinburgh. The Youngs were strict disciplinarians at home, and informal pressure to follow the same occupation would have been considerable. Young's ancestors were linked to the Borders. Young, as expressed in his writings, was interested in the significance of boundaries between different cultures from a young age. His family was regularly and steadfastly involved in church and municipal interests. Young was therefore bred in the Protestant Christian faith from a young age, with his family instilling religious values in him from childhood. It is supposed that he gained his later evangelical ambitions through these teachings from his upbringing in early life. = Early education = Young first attended school in Edinburgh, then moved to Glasgow, starting attendance at the Glasgow Academy in 1891. All the boys in his family received the same school education. His school teachings involved classical subjects, but had a more modernised emphasis in comparison to other schools in the region. Young participated actively in sports and continued sporting links with the academy even after leaving the school. = Later education = He did not go on to university, but instead began an apprenticeship with the firm of Moores, Carson, and Watson in 1899 to become a charted accountant.  Personal life  In 1906, Young became engaged to Ms. Jessie Fiddes, another missionary who was already at Livingstonia at the time of Young's arrival. She had been born in 1876, and originated from an Aberdeen family with a strong Protestant outlook. She had studied for two years at the Burnbank Missionary Training Home, in Glasgow. Her duties were to work for the medical side of the mission, and to complete preparation, she conducted two years of dispensing for a doctor in London. They were married on 24 June 1908 at the Grand Hotel, Aberdeen. Their son John was born in 1909 in Karonga, Africa. Later in life, his wife had growing mental issues due to long periods of separation from her children due to missionary work. She also had frequent problems with worsening arteriosclerosis, and her mental state deteriorated such that she could become incoherent and at times, even violent. At the time of her mental deterioration, Cullen's brother, John Young, lived as a neighbour in Edinburgh, and his wife was a psychiatrist. They all agreed that she should be admitted to a mental hospital, and it is indicated that she remained there until her death in March 1954. Their son John later obtained a medical degree and engaged in missionary work as well, following the path of his predecessors.  Missionary career (1904‚Äì1931)  Young began his journey to Malawi to officially begin his missionary work in 1904 for the Livingstonia Mission while the region was under British colonial rule. While engaging in missionary work, Young possessed concern that African societies should be viewed on their own terms rather than through a Western lens, which was an unusual perception for missionaries during his period of time. He demonstrated respect for African culture and traditions by translating stories written in the African language for publication in England and other countries, and was passionate about communicating the stories of the African people to other cultures. It is suggested that although Young gained an inside view of Malawi to a certain degree, being open to local customs and respectful of the native people, he still retained his point of view as a foreign missionary. However, he most likely gained more of an insider view than other missionaries of his time, due to his exceptional respect and interest for African culture. = Relationship with Hastings Banda = While Banda was studying in Edinburgh with the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, and while Young was a missionary in Malawi, Young managed to start and sustain a long-term friendship with Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who would later become the first President of Malawi. Banda was well acquainted with many missionaries but was not exceptionally enthusiastic about all of them. Young's appreciation of the African ways and lifestyle seemed to capture Banda's attention, and the pair started a friendship. At certain times, they both displayed an idealised sense of tradition in which the ordinary villager gained favour rather than the educated elite, which may have influenced Banda's later political views and style of leadership. In a formal letter of recommendation, Young referred to Banda as \\"a very sound fellow of good judgment and character.\\" Young's attempt to codify African tradition as an anthropologist missionary can be seen to have played a part in Kamuzu Banda's dictatorial style of rule and, as a result, the eventual authoritative nature of the Malawian political system. There is also evidence that Banda and Young's relationship may have led to subsequent collaborative work within the Malawian community, such as editing the collection of stories, Our African way of life, in 1946. Young's previous records and writing also display some association with Clements Kadalie, the pioneer of black trade unionism in South Africa, although it is not made clear the extent of their relationship. = Views on education and colonialism = Although he did engage in work relating to education and encouraged authorship of African literature, Young did not have a strong belief that education would be a key contribution to African advancement. Similar to many other missionaries during this time period, he remained ambivalent and unsure about the value of higher education for the African people. Furthermore, Young's vernacular interest did not lead him to support nationalism. He \\"favoured independence when ready\\" but was also highly disapproving of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, clearly aiming to criticise within his writings. Young demonstrates evidence of thought that the British Empire was associated with noble virtues, and cannot be seen as a polemical anti-colonist, but can rather be viewed as a gradualist. However, his life's work led to a re-evaluation of the consideration of missionary work as an essential aspect of colonialism, because while he maintained his position as a missionary and not a native, he did manage to contribute to the shaping of modern Africa as a crucial pioneer of translation through his writing contributions.  Anthropology work  Although Young did not receive any formal training as an anthropologist, he had anthropological ambitions and is most recognised for his anthropology work rather than as a missionary. His publication, Notes on the history of the Tumbuka-Kamanga peoples in the Northern Province of Nyasaland, in 1970 provided the first published record of the ethnography and history of northern Malawi. Therefore, these writings truly show why he is perceived as an important documentalist on this particular period of missionary history. Young was chosen as an editor for a writing competition organised by the International African Institute to encourage authorship about African culture. His writings were published in a collection called Our African way of life, and described the typical everyday occurrences in the life of the tribe and the family within African society. These essays also described traditional customs such as rituals and marriage traditions. Young collaborated with Hastings Banda to finish editorial work for this publication. He was also a contributor and translator for a collection of short, narrative fiction stories based on African culture, entitled African new writing; short stories by African authors, which was published in Great Britain in 1947. This book has been called the first collection of modern African prose fiction in English, and contains 14 short stories written by seven African authors which were edited by Cullen Young. Some of the stories are told in a fairy-tale sort of style, and served to raise awareness about African culture in European countries. Young also sponsored publications of vernacular literature in an effort to promote African cultural understanding and acceptance. Young's comprehensive notes on the customs and folklore of the Tumbaka were chosen for publication in 1931. These writings show his desire to learn more knowledge and wisdom from the African people, and to further understand the people he is serving as a missionary. Young also published a guide to anthropology for missionaries in Africa for beginner-level anthropologists in 1940. Some concepts include African ancestor worship, and other important aspects of the culture that Young presumed helpful for a missionary to know. Young was also particularly interested in the African language, and sought to master it while doing missionary work.  Later life (1931‚Äì1955)  In Britain from 1931 to 1955, Young served as a second rank colonial expert who provided his views on African culture and relations, in the midst of a period of decaying colonialism. Young died at 74 years of age on 14 June 1955 due to pancreas cancer. A few days prior, he had expressed his excitement with the prospect of helping with missionary training in Edinburgh.  Mediation of tensions between anthropologists and missionaries  T. Cullen Young is often viewed as an unusual exception to the antagonism between missionaries and anthropologists, and the Disruption of 1843 within the Scottish Presbyterian faith. He often acted as the common ground between the interests of anthropology and missionary work, doing translating and mediation work throughout his lifetime. The period in which Young worked was one in which there were heightened tensions in the relationship between anthropologists and missionaries. Despite this tension, Young continued to work both as a missionary and an anthropologist, providing the slim intersection of spheres between the anthropological field and the missionary field, which demonstrates his bravery and uncommon interdisciplinary mindset.  Legacy  Young's recordings of the Tumbaka people provided the first ever published record of the history and ethnography of the northern Malawi region. As one of the first to publish such historical records, he was a pioneer in his field. Young's vision for the future of African literature and historical conservation is especially crucial and novel, because this viewpoint was extremely rare in missionaries during this contextual period of time. His writings about the occurrences within northern Malawi showcase a talented historian who maintains a conservative missionary perspective. However, this contribution may be viewed with a critical approach, as Young's dependence for data on multiple informants could be seen as invalid because many of his informants were educated and living outside of their own environment. Whereas Young generally succeeded in retaining his objective point of view within the restrictions of the procedures of his time, his missionary and ultimately outsider perspective could have easily contributed bias and blurred his vision. Young's historical reports also brought up important social, political and historical issues. His writing challenged the common Western perspective on Africa as victims in need of rescue and targets of colonialism. He sought for Africa to be considered on its own grounds, and not only through the judgment and analysis of the West. Overall, there is evidence that Young was an influential missionary whose work impacted many in the nation. The most important part of his legacy is likely his influence on the development modern Africa, his historical recordings of the Tumbaka people, and his impact on the future first President of Malawi, Hastings Banda.

Berkman has been the member for Maiwar since the 2017 Queensland state elections, when he became the first Greens member to be elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. He is the first member for Maiwar, after the electorate was created from the merger of the former Indooroopilly and Mt Coot-tha electorates. Early life Berkman was born in Brisbane, Queensland. His father worked in the media and his mother had trained as a secondary school teacher. He grew up in Toowoomba, Queensland after the family moved there when Michael was 3 years old. Berkman attended Wilsonton State School and Toowoomba State High School. Berkman first attended the University of Queensland to commence a Bachelor of Science before moving to Griffith University, attending the Nathan campus, where he graduated in 2009 with a double degree, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Laws. Early career Berkman began his legal career as a clerk with Freehills in Brisbane, and spent some time working there following his graduation. He left legal practice to work in the Queensland Government's office of climate change until this group was made redundant following the election of the Newman Government in 2012. Berkman then accepted a position with the Environmental Defenders Office in Brisbane. In this role, he was involved in litigation with a particular specialisation in ground water in cases against Adani's Carmichael Coal Mine, the Alpha Coal Mine, and the New Acland Coal Mine Stage 3 Expansion. Berkman has also been involved in the not-for-profit sector, having previously worked with Millen Farms. Political career Berkman's political career began in the 2015 Queensland state election where he ran for the Greens in Ferny Grove, achieving a primary vote of 12.11%. In 2016, Berkman ran in the local government elections for Moreton Bay Region in District 10, and then against Peter Dutton for the Dickson at the 2016 federal election. Berkman was the first Greens member to be elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in the seat of Maiwar in Brisbane's inner-west. He achieved a 27.78% primary vote to defeat incumbent Scott Emerson in the 2017 Queensland state election. This followed the removal of the Indooroopilly electorate at the 2017 state election to make way for the new seat of Maiwar which had a notional LNP margin of 3%. Prior to its abolition, the Indooroopilly electorate was briefly held by a Greens MP, Ronan Lee, after he defected from the Labor in 2008 in the middle of a parliamentary term. Political positions =Political donations= In 2018, Berkman introduced a private member's bill to ban all political donations from businesses to state and local government politicians, candidates and parties, excluding charities and employee or employer organisations. Berkman said the community overwhelmingly supported reform to get big money out of politics. \\"People feel like Labor and the LNP are just not listening to them, and it's not hard to see why,\\" Berkman said. \\"This is just more evidence that Labor and the LNP are completely wedded to their corporate donors.\\" The Crime and Corruption Commission did not support the bill, however, Commissioner Alan MacSporran said it was his personal view that in an ideal world all donations would be banned. =Climate rally= In November 2018, Berkman said schools in Maiwar, Berkman's electorate, should allow students to attend climate change events during school hours. According to Berkman, all school principals agreed. The flagship rally took place on 30 November. Over 400 students attended, demanding climate action from the Australian Government and Queensland Government. Personal life Berkman has three children and lives in Bardon.

She was an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) for 56 years.  Early life and background Elizabeth Anne Elliott also known as Betty or \\"Aunt Betty\\" was born March 19, 1918) near New Cordell, Oklahoma. Her father, Bruce W. Baker, was the only physician in Cordell, therefore as a young girl Elizabeth would accompany her father on his numerous travels to visit patients in their community. In high school, Elliott had the highest academic achievements of her class and became the valedictorian. In 1940 she pursued a post-secondary education from the University of Oklahoma, and from a class of 40, she was one of 3 women who graduated with a B.S in geology. Betty had initially enrolled in pre-med but switched her major to geology because she was inspired by Charles Decker, one of the founders of the \\"American Association of Petroleum Geologists\\" (AAPG). Throughout her career she was an active member of the ‚ÄúAmerican Association of Petroleum Geologists‚Äù (AAPG). Continuing her studies, she attended University of Colorado, where she held a teaching fellowship, and research program focusing on micropaleontology and the relationship and correlation of cretaceous shales. Elliott's work with cretaceous shales helped foster a better understanding of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. Elliott also developed a micropaleontology library during her time at the University of Colorado. However, due to the Second World War she was unable to finish her master's degree. She married Guy Elliott and the couple moved to Seattle, Washington where she took a job as a civil engineer at the Corps of Engineers. At that time she also worked as a stratigrapher for the U.S. Geological Services in Denver, Colorado. Afterwards, Elliott worked in Midland, Texas for Gulf Oil. During her time working for Gulf Oil, Elliott worked at a well-site, a job that was very rare for a woman to hold in the 1940s. Later, she worked for the company Mobil Oil in both New York and in Dallas, Texas. After her husband's death in 1960, Elliott moved to Mobil's Oklahoma city office where she worked on the stratigraphy of the Permian and the Arkoma basin. While in Dallas, Elliott evaluated offshore Atlantic basins and Central American concession where she trained many young geologists. Nicknamed ‚ÄúAunt Betty‚Äù by her trainees, she retired around the age of 67, opening up a consulting office in Dallas. Betty Ann Elliott was said to have \\"...excelled at sample identification and \\"sat\\" wells, a very uncommon task for a woman.\\" Elliott served as the 2nd VP for the Dallas Geological Society from 1985-1986. At age 81 Elliott received the Pioneer Award at the AAPG Annual Convention, marking the first time the award had ever been given to a woman. On July, 2001, at age 83, she died.

It is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent. The word curd is used in English to refer to (naturally probiotic) homemade yogurt,The curious case of the Indian curd -Hindustan TimesMaking yogurt -blog while the term yogurt refers to the pasteurized commercial variety known as heat treated fermented milk.Codex Alimentarius Yogurt rules, FAO Preparation Curd is made by bacterial fermentation of milk. In this process lactose in milk is converted into lactic acid by several probiotic microorganisms. The species involved in the fermentation depends on the temperature and humidity of the environment, and may include Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus diacetylactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Curd starter is sometimes made with dried red chillies (or their stems) in hot milk. Milk is boiled and then allowed to cool for a while. When lukewarm, dried chili peppers or their stems are added. The reason for this tradition is that dried chillies are rich in a type of lactobacilli, the bacteria that helps in fermentation of milk to form curd. The bowl is then kept undisturbed in a warm place for 5 to 10 hours. After the starter is made, or saved from previous batch of curd, milk is boiled and cooled. In a separate bowl curd is mixed with its whey, and then mixed together with the milk. It is then left to sit undisturbed for 5 to 10 hours. This practice can also be applied for making curd from milk substitutes, such as soy milk.The secret of making soy yogurt without store bought culture  Types  = Buffalo curd = A pot of buffalo curd with treacle in Sri Lanka Buffalo curd ( mudavƒÅpu meekiri) is a traditional type of yogurt prepared from water buffalo milk. It is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent. Buffalo milk is traditionally considered better for making yogurt than cow milk due to its higher fat content making a thicker yogurt mass. Buffalo curd is usually packaged in clay pots. Buffalo curd is obtained by bacterial fermentation of buffalo milk. In this process lactose in buffalo milk is converted into lactic acid using several micro-organisms. The species involved in the fermentation are the same as above. Buffalo milk has a higher amounts of protein, fat, lactose, minerals and vitamins than cow's milk. Quality of the curd depends on the starter culture. Fermentation also develops the characteristic flavor and colour of the product. Buffalo curd can be made in both traditional and industrial forms. Traditionally buffalo milk is filtered and boiled, the scum is removed and it is cooled to room temperature.

Although terrorist attacks are rare, the UAE has been listed as a place used by investors to raise funds to support militants in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the financing of the September 11 attacks. Businesses based in the UAE have been implicated in the funding of the Taliban and the Haqqani network. In the 72nd session of the UN General assembly in New York, UAE foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan affirmed the United Arab Emirates policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism financing. The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces plays an active role in US- led War on Terrorism and have been nicknamed by US defense secretary James Mattis and other United States Armed Forces Generals as \\"Little Sparta\\" for being the United States' right-hand ally on War on Terrorism, and for conducting operations effectively against terrorists in the Middle East. The Cabinet of the United Arab Emirates, following the implementation of the UAE Federal Law No. 7 in November 2014, designated a list of 83 organizations and entities including the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Hezbollah, Houthis and the Islamic State as terrorist organizations. History =Al Qaeda= The 9/11 Commission Report states that several 9/11 hijackers traveled to the United States via transiting first in Dubai International Airport. 17 of the 19 hijackers transited through the UAE in the months immediately preceding the 9/11 attacks. The Library of Congress, Research Division in its 2007 report stated, ‚ÄúDubai is strongly linked to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States; more than half of the hijackers flew directly out of Dubai International Airport to the United States\\". No official connection to state sponsored terrorism was found between the United Arab Emirates government to the terrorists. The report also indicates that the hijackers received funding from terror investors in the UAE who raised funds through their UAE based business. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, in response to concerns that the UAE banking system has been used by 9/11 hijackers to launder funds, the UAE adopted a legislation giving the Central Bank in 2002 the power to freeze any suspected accounts for 7 days without prior legal permission. The report stated \\"banks have been advised to carefully monitor transactions passing through the UAE from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and are now subject to more stringent transaction and client reporting requirements.\\" Unnamed skeptics in Washington raised concerns that the United Arab Emirates might be associating with Osama Bin Laden, citing a missed opportunity for a drone strike in 1999 mentioned in the September 11 Commission report which was abandoned due to being located in a UAE run hunting camp in Afghanistan. However, no evidence or proof apart from speculations was presented.9/11 report cited possible bin Laden, U.A.E. ties According to the CIA in the 9/11 Commission Report, the strike was called off because the intelligence was dubious. In November 2002, Abd al-Rahim al- Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the bombing of USS Cole and head of Al Qaeda in the Persian Gulf, was captured in the United Arab Emirates by Emirati authorities.https://theintercept.com/2019/12/04/guantanamo-uss-cole-cia- torture The family of the late FBI counter-terrorism chief John P. O‚ÄôNeill, who was killed in the September 11 attacks, filed a lawsuit against Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), a UAE based bank, implicating the bank that it was directly involved in the funding of the 9/11 hijackers. A total of 8 plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against Dubai Islamic Bank. 2 of the plaintiffs have since withdrawn their lawsuits. In 2016, 5 additional lawsuits were filed in concordance with Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), however all of five lawsuits have been dismissed in 2017. According to Dubai Islamic bank, no provision has been made with any outstanding 9/11 legal proceedings as professional advice indicates that it is unlikely that any significant or material costs or loss, other than legal costs in connection with the defence, are expected to be incurred. DIB expects a complete dismissal from any lawsuits because the evidence uncovered would not permit a fact finder to hold DIB liable for damages and argues that unsubstantiated claims harms its reputation. A British petroleum engineer who was held as a hostage while working in Yemen was extracted in 2015 by the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces after a military intelligence operation. The hostage was held by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen for 18 months. A The Washington Post op-ed by Yousef Al Otaiba, UAE ambassador to the US, indicated that more than 2,000 militants have been removed from Yemen, with their controlled areas now having improved security and a better delivered humanitarian and development assistance such as to the port city of Mukalla and other liberated areas. US defense secretary James Mattis called US-UAE joint counter-terrorism operations against Al Qaeda in Yemen a model for American troops, citing how the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces liberated the port of Mukalla in April 2016 from AQAP forces in 36 hours after being held by AQAP for more than a year. In 2018, a report by the Associated Press suggested that the United Arab Emirates, as part of Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, may have brokered deals with Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, and have recruited them to fight against the Houthis. UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi responded to the report by stating that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with in the first place and argued that he has men who have been killed by Al Qaeda, he said ‚ÄúThey are not willing to negotiate, most of these hard-core guys. They are willing to go and fight. We have guys who have been injured, killed by AQAP and there‚Äôs no point in negotiating with these guys.‚Äù The notion of the UAE recruiting or paying AQAP has been thoroughly denied by the United States Pentagon with Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, calling the news source \\"patently false\\". = Lashkar-e-Taiba = Investors based in the UAE are implicated for providing financial aid to the Lashkar-e-Taiba. In 2008, the United Nations Committee conducted an investigation of the terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayibba (LeT) which found them to be associated with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. The investigation found that UAE based banks cleared financial transactions from UAE based investors which was then used to fund the terrorist organization. =Murder of Ibolya Ryan= On 1 December 2014, a lone wolf terrorist attack committed by a woman wearing black gloves and a veiled niqab included the murdering of Hungarian-American kindergarten teacher in Abu Dhabi and a failed attempt to plant a home-made bomb at the home of an Arab‚ÄìAmerican physician. The Hungarian-American teacher, Ibolya Ryan, was stabbed to death by the preperator. The stabbing, which took place in Boutik Mall, an Abu Dhabi shopping mall located on Al Reem Island was caught on tape in a routine surveillance video. Acts of terrorism in Abu Dhabi and in the United Arab Emirates are an extremely rare event. The Emirates have classified the murder as a lone wolf terrorist attack inspired by terrorist ideology acquired online. =Haqqani Network= The Haqqani network, the militant partners of the Afghan Taliban, has received significant funding from UAE-based businesses. In January 2009, the US intelligence sources stated that two of Taliban's senior fundraisers travelled regularly to the UAE where the Haqqani networks and Taliban laundered money via local front companies. =Taliban= The United Arab Emirates is the only Arab country to serve and contribute forces alongside American Green Beret Special Forces to the mission in Afghanistan. On July 31, 2017, a New York Times' correspondent published an article reportedly based on the information gathered from the leaked emails of the UAE Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, stating that in June 2013, both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates competed with each to host a Taliban embassy. In response to the article, ambassador Otaiba wrote an open letter to the New York Times on the August 9, 2017, claiming that the previously issued article carried half information and as a result, told the half story. Ambassador Otaiba commented on the allegation by arguing that the decision to host the Taliban embassy was requested from the US and the UAE offer was made due to being pressured by the US. The ambassador added that the UAE had presented three conditions to the group and the refusal to accept has led the Gulf nation to withdraw its offer to host them. The three conditions states that \\"Taliban must denounce Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, recognize the Afghan constitution, and renounce all violence and lay down their weapons. The Taliban refused all three conditions, and the UAE withdrew its offer.\\"  Measures against state sponsored terrorism  =Lebanon= The UAE advises its citizens to avoid traveling to Lebanon because of safety and security concerns due to the increasing influence of Hezbollah across the Lebanese government. =Qatar= In June 2017, the UAE alongside Bahrain, Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Senegal, Djibouti, the Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government, and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar due to allegations of Qatar being a state sponsor of terrorism, citing sources which implicated that Qatar paid $700 million to Iranian-backed Shi'a militias in Iraq, $120‚Äì140 million to Tahrir al-Sham, and $80 million to Ahrar al-Sham.Erika Solomon, The $1bn hostage deal that enraged Qatar‚Äôs Gulf rivals: Doha reportedly paid al-Qaeda affiliate and Iran to win release of royal hunting party , Financial Times (5 June 2017). The UAE, alongside Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain moved to implement sanction on Qatar by boycotting and banning air travel, shipping, media, finance, and energy between the two countries unless Qatar complies with a list of 13 demands imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain. Qatar has denied the accusations put forth by the four countries.

Known for his studies on the biology of Lectins, Khan was an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Maharashtra Academy of Sciences and the Muslim Association for the Advancement of Science. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to biosciences in 2002.  Biography  Indian Institute of Science Saccharomyces cerevisiae Born on the Christmas eve of 1957, Mohammad Islam Khan obtained an MSc in biotechnology in 1978 and joined the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB) as a faculty, simultaneously doing his doctoral research at the Indian Institute of Science which earned him a PhD in 1986 from Aligarh Muslim University. Moving to the US, he did his post-doctoral work at Albert Einstein College of Medicine during 1987‚Äì90 and on his return to India in 1990, he joined the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) as a scientist where he spent the rest of his career, barring a stint at the University of G√∂ttingen during 2000‚Äì01 as an overseas associate of the Department of Biotechnology. He was holding the post of a scientist at the Division of Biochemical Sciences of NCL when he died in November 2010, aged 53.  Legacy  Khan was known for his contributions in the disciplines of glycobiology and nanobiotechnology with special focus on the biology of lectins. His work was known to have assisted in widening our understanding of cell adhesion. He demonstrated the role of yeast cell surface lectins in the adhesion of yeast cells which is also known as flocculation. He isolated Fusarium sporotrichioides from rose plant which has since been deposited by him at the National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (NCIM), a government-funded microbial culture repository based at NCL. The research team under his leadership was successful in isolating a peptide from Streptomyces that showed potency as an inhibitor of Cysteine proteases and the finding is reported to have use in the prophylaxis of cancer by preventing the migration of cancer cells. Towards the latter part of his career, he worked on the synthesis of metal‚Äëmetal sulphides/metal oxide nanoparticles using fungi and it was reported that the team synthesized the nano-particles outside a cell for the first time. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and PubMed, an online article repository of scientific articles has listed several of them.  Awards and honors  The Indian National Science Academy awarded Khan the INSA Young Scientist Medal in 1987. Five years later, he received the 1992 Young Scientist Award of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2002.

Fifty people were injured, nine seriously. Accident At about 19:30 CET (18:30 UTC), a passenger train operated by National Express Germany ran into the rear of a freight train operated by DB Cargo near station, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The driver of the passenger train was able to give a warning before the collision occurred. Fifty people were injured, nine seriously and three with moderate injuries. The train was carrying 155 passengers. The passenger train was travelling from Krefeld to Neuss. The freight train was travelling from Dillingen, Saarland to Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands. The rear three wagons of the freight train were derailed. The leading carriage of the Bombardier Talent 2 electric multiple unit which formed the passenger train was severely damaged. The rescue of passengers was hampered by fallen power cables, which were made safe by Deutsche Bahn. More than 200 firefighters assisted in the rescue efforts. The line between D√ºsseldorf and Krefeld was closed. Cleanup of the accident aftermath Investigation The Eisenbahn-Unfalluntersuchungsstelle des Bundes (EUB) opened an investigation into the accident. It was reported that the passenger train may have incorrectly been given permission to pass a signal indicating ‚Äústop‚Äù.

The songs were intended to form the basis of the Groovies' fourth studio album, to be entitled A Bucket of Brains. Six of the songs (recorded in May and August 1972 at Rockfield Studios in Wales) were produced by Dave Edmunds, while the seventh (recorded in August 1972 at De Lane Lea Studios in London) was produced by Groovies' leader Cyril Jordan (using the pseudonym \\"Flowerboy Venus\\"). The eighth song on the album is the original \\"correct speed\\" studio version of the Groovies' most famous song, \\"Shake Some Action\\". Although four of the songs were released on two singles by UA, their failure to chart caused UA to terminate the sessions (and the group's contract) at the end of 1972 without finishing the album, and the group returned to the USA before Christmas. However, the unissued recordings of two of those songs (\\"Shake Some Action\\" and \\"You Tore Me Down\\") later became the centerpiece of the Groovies' most successful album, Shake Some Action, in 1976. An unofficial version of this album, entitled The Rockfield Session, was issued by the group's Australian record label, AIM Records, in 1989, with liner notes by Cyril Jordan. However, that EP was transcribed from a copy of the recordings owned by Jordan, did not use the original master recordings of the sessions, and was characterized as sounding \\"a bit muddy\\". EMI, which purchased UA in 1979, decided to release a legitimate version of the recordings, taken from the original masters, in 1995.Storey, Jon. Liner notes to A Bucket of Brains (1995). Retrieved 4 December 2017. Background During most of the recording of Teenage Head in January 1971, Groovies' guitarist Tim Lynch was in jail; thus, almost all of the guitars on the album were performed by Cyril Jordan.Jordan, Cyril. Liner notes to Slow Death (2002). Retrieved 5 December 2017. After the album was finished, Jordan wanted to replace Lynch with guitarist James Ferrell, whom Jordan had met through fellow guitarist Mike Wilhelm. Band co-leader Roy Loney, who had originally started the band with Lynch, agreed but had become disenchanted with the music business. Then the band was dropped by its label, Kama Sutra Records, shortly before the release of Teenage Head over financial disputes. Soon thereafter, Loney also decided to leave the band and was replaced by Chris Wilson, the vocalist/guitarist from Wilhelm's band \\"Loose Gravel\\". However, the group now had no recording contract and also little money. One of the Groovies' fans (to whom the Groovies included a dedication on Teenage Head) was Andrew Lauder, then head of the UA label in Britain. Groovies' bassist George Alexander had sent a letter to Lauder after the band's release by Kama Sutra, noting that they were looking for a new label. The Groovies were surprised when Lauder responded, telling them to meet with Martin Cerf, creative services director of United Artists Records in Los Angeles.Jordan, Cyril. Liner notes to The Rockfield Sessions (1989). Retrieved 5 December 2017. Lauder had recently been successful in having Cerf and the American branch of United Artists sign several of his acts with prior major-label releases, including The Move / Electric Light Orchestra, Family, and Brinsley Schwarz, despite the fact that UA was generally downsizing. However, Cerf turned out to have no interest in signing the Groovies, telling Jordan, \\"You're through.\\" Before leaving the UA offices, Jordan ran into another UA employee, an acquaintance who had managed Ike & Tina Turner, and told him about Lauder's message and Cerf's rejection. The acquaintance took Jordan into his office, and the two of them then called Lauder in London. As a result, two weeks later Jordan was in London, where Lauder and British UA told him that they could offer the Groovies a contract right then as long as the band temporarily moved to Britain, which Jordan agreed to do. One of the reasons for moving the band was the opportunity to work with British musician/producer Dave Edmunds at Rockfield Studios; in Jordan's words, \\"‚ÄúWhen we heard [Edmunds‚Äô version of] ‚ÄòI Hear You Knockin'‚Äô in 1969, the sound on the record was so great that we thought Rockfield was the new Sun recording studios.\\" Lauder assured the band that this would be no problem since Edmunds already produced several acts for UA, and Jordan then discussed it in interviews about the group's signing to UA. However, no one from either the band or UA had contacted Edmunds, who read in the British music press (Melody Maker) that he was supposed to be producing the Groovies on the same day in May 1972 that the band arrived at Rockfield. Because he lived nearby, Edmunds decided to show up to meet the Groovies and see if he actually wanted to work with them. The Groovies, knowing nothing about this, spent about three hours asking Edmunds questions about his own influences, one of which prompted the composition of a new Groovies song, \\"You Tore Me Down\\". By the end of this introduction, there was no doubt that the Groovies and Edmunds wanted to work together, and they promptly cut four songs: three originals, \\"Shake Some Action\\", \\"You Tore Me Down\\", and \\"Slow Death\\", and one Chuck Berry cover, \\"Little Queenie\\". However, the welcome given to an American group by a British label spurred a backlash in the U.K., despite the fact that the Groovies had been living in a leased house in London and touring constantly throughout Europe since arriving,In the Slow Death liner notes, Jordan estimated that the band played at least 200 gigs in Europe during 1972. and so UA decided instead to release a series of singles to introduce the band to the British audience. As a result, the Groovies returned to Rockfield in August to cut two more tracks, both covers: \\"Get a Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\" and \\"Married Woman\\". Due to other commitments, they then returned to London to cut one more cover, \\"Tallahassee Lassie\\", but Edmunds was unable to attend this session, so Jordan produced the track. During this time, the Groovies came up with a name for their upcoming album, thought up by the group's road manager. Wilson noted that \\"Brains\\" was the name of a popular beer in South Wales, and after a particularly hard day of touring, the road manager had ordered \\"a bucket of Brains\\" at a local bar, and the name stuck. However, their first UA single, \\"Slow Death\\", was banned by the BBC for using the word \\"morphine\\" in the lyrics and so failed to chart in the U.K., which caused UA to lose interest in actually finishing the Groovies album. Prior to Christmas 1972, the Groovies were told by UA to return to the US for the holidays, and UA would get back in touch following the new year, but the Groovies never heard from UA again. Jordan said that \\"I was at the same point as I was with Kama Sutra and Epic [the Groovies' prior major labels], let's get rid of these guys and get with someone else.\\" Subsequent developments Although Jordan and Wilson had pushed for \\"Shake Some Action\\" and \\"You Tore Me Down\\" to be issued as singles, those two originals, along with the cover \\"Little Queenie\\", were never issued at all by UA, and the Groovies ended up owning the master tapes to these three songs. UA had objected to \\"Shake Some Action\\" because of its almost five-minute length, and so Edmunds produced a version slightly speeding the song up and so making it almost 30 seconds shorter, but UA also turned this version down. Back in the US in 1973, Jordan produced a version that was only about three-and-a-half minutes long, but that version was then also turned down by Capitol. In 1974, the Groovies allowed Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records to release the Rockfield version of \\"You Tore Me Down\\" as a single, and in 1975 Shaw was able to sign the group to Sire Records. Sire owner Seymour Stein, who loved Edmunds' production (including the \\"sped-up\\" version of \\"Shake Some Action\\"), acquired the rights to both originals from the band and released them on the Groovies' 1976 debut for Sire, which was also called Shake Some Action and was also produced by Edmunds. In 1979, the music magazine Bucketfull of Brains was founded, taking its name from the unreleased album. In 1989, the Flamin' Groovies were recording for the Australian label AIM Records, when Jordan, pursuant to a 1987 conversation with Dave Edmunds during a Groovies tour, decided to allow AIM to release his copy, with some overdubs, of the 1972 Rockfield sessions as an EP, which was simply titled The Rockfield Sessions. According to the liner notes, one of Jordan's motives was trying to spur Edmunds to make an official release of the original UA masters. The official release of the seven master recordings on EMI followed on CD in 1995, including the \\"correct speed\\" original version of \\"Shake Some Action\\" as an extra track, moving the CD closer to album length instead of EP length. When EMI was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2011, the European Commission required that the rights to most artists signed to the British branches of EMI labels (including UA) be divested by Universal Music Group. Despite the fact that the Flamin' Groovies were an American band, they had been signed to UA's British branch, as discussed above, and so rights to this album were transferred in 2013 to the Parlophone division of Warner Music Group.

Unlike most members of the genus Acis, it has pink rather than white flowers. It is grown as an ornamental plant but requires protection from frost. Description Acis rosea is a small bulbous perennial, growing up to 12 cm tall. The grey-green leaves are narrow and usually appear after the flowers. Flowering occurs in autumn. The flowers are small, 5‚Äì9 mm long, and have pink tepals ‚Äì most other species of Acis have white tepals. The pedicels (flower stalks) are short, 1‚Äì5 mm long. There are two spathes. Taxonomy Acis rosea was first described in 1804 by F. Martin, as Leucojum roseum. In 1829, Robert Sweet transferred it to Acis. However, Acis was not accepted by most botanists, who continued to use a broadly circumscribed Leucojum. Acis was reinstated in 2004, after it was determined on morphological and molecular grounds that the broadly defined genus Leucojum was paraphyletic. Distribution and habitat Acis rosea is native to the two western Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia. It is found in rocky ground, dry pastures and sandy places. Cultivation Acis rosea is cultivated as an ornamental bulb. As it is not frost-hardy, it is usually grown in a bulb frame or alpine house.

Hansen, Thorkild, Islands of Slaves, Legon, Sub-Saharan Publishers 2003, p. 80-81 History In 1721 there were 77 sugar plantations on St. Thomas, 28 of them had their own sugar factories and 11 distilled rum. There is no record of when rum first began to be made. What is known is that the West Indies sugar and rum production grew side by side. Rum was known under such names as Rum bullion, Rhum and Rum booze, and the name probably comes from the Latin word for sugar, \\"saccarum\\". The process by which the waste products of sugar were made into Rum took place in the Rum house or distillery. The syrup of four barrels of sugar usually gave a barrel of Rum.Linvald, Steffen, Sukker og Rom, Copenhagen 1967, p. 53-67 Mosquito Bay was the first plantation where baptism of slaves took place. The owner Johan Lorentz Carstens supported a missionary called Martin who worked for the Moravian Church (Herrnhuter brothers ‚Äì whose founder and high superintendent was Count Nikolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf). Johan Lorentz Carstens owned the house where the Brethren held their meetings in the evening. Two of his slaves, Mingo and Andreas, became Martin‚Äôs first native helpers, and when the missionary caught the tropical fever, Mrs. Carstens took care of him and nursed him through his illness. The Brethren were no longer poor and homeless. They could put money aside and Carstens helped them to buy a plantation that they called Bassoon Mountain. Carstens‚Äô friendly disposition towards the Brethren was an exception. Most of planters viewed the missionary work as an encumbrance and tried by all means to get it stopped. Hansen, Thorkild, Islands of Slaves, Legon, Sub-Saharan Publishers 2003, p. 164-165 Production process On a typical plantation the cookhouse or the \\"factory\\" in which sugar juice was processed into raw sugar or muscavado was near the sugar mill. A part of the factory was also used for curinghouse and storage space for sugar, molasses (syrup) and Rum. A wing of the factory was usually designed as Distillery, where the famous Rum was made. All sugar mills were built on higher soil than the cooking, so the juice could run down by itself. In the cookery it was led into a large kettle, siphon, where it was heated while adding a little unlime lime (lime). Then it was allowed to cool while the dirt that rises to the surface was skimmed off using a long shank of foam. All impurities, together with the non-crystallized sugar, dirty molasses (syrup) and other unusable by-products were carefully stored, as it was used later for the Rum distillation. The molasses could be sold as cheap sweetener, but most plants preferred to use it to make Rum. Each planter, or more specifically his Rum burner, was convinced that his special recipe for making Rum - or the kill-devil, as it was called - was the best. The longer the mask was allowed to ferment, the stronger the Rum became. A shorter fermentation process produced a lighter type of Rum called Demerara. Brown, Robert S., Sukkerdyrkning i Dansk Vestindien (Handels- og S√∏fartsmuseets) √Örbog, 1973; s. 7-26 Current St. Thomas is today transformed into a modern tourist resort. The flat fields at Mosquito Bay, where Carstens had his plantation, are covered by the concrete runways of Harry S. Truman Airport. Hansen, Thorkild, Islands of Slaves, Legon, Sub-Saharan Publishers 2003, p. 97 St. Thomas still remembers her Danish past. The islands massive development in connection with the circumstances that cultivation of sugar stopped at an early stage, has resulted in far fewer ruins here that on St. Croix. Today, Carstens‚Äô property, Perlen, is just as impossible to locate as Mosquito bay.

Hydrology  The present-day course of the Amargosa River Lake Tecopa occupied the Tecopa Valley, a pear-shaped valley east of southern Death Valley, in Inyo County, California. The cities of Barstow, California and Las Vegas, Nevada lie close to the lake basin. The lake itself had a roughly triangular shape with a northern, a southwestern and a southeastern corner, and at its highstand it covered about . Outcrops of lake sediments occupy a length of along the Amargosa River and are wide at their broadest. Its southern margin is not clear, given that the height of the sill to the China Ranch basin is undetermined. Several islands existed in Lake Tecopa. Of these, the largest was close to Tecopa, California, and two smaller ones were north of Shoshone, California. The shores of the lake featured marshes and deltas where Amargosa River or spring water entered the lake, as well as freshwater ponds where springs and streams flowed into Lake Tecopa. At the time of the Bishop Tuff eruption, Lake Tecopa was about deep. The waters of the lake were salty and had a high pH, inducing precipitation of calcite in the northern part of the lake where the Amargosa River flowed into it. There is some indication that the centre of the lake was much more saline than its shores. Salt lakes generally form when a lake has no outlet, so evaporation concentrates salts in the lake water until the lake contains saltwater. The Amargosa River at present-day Tecopa CA The Amargosa River flowed into Lake Tecopa, which was the river's terminal lake. Most of the water in Lake Tecopa came from the Amargosa River and to a lesser degree from the washes that drain Chicago Valley and Greenwater Valley; the total size of its catchment was about and most of its water originated in Paiute Mesa, Shoshone Mountains, Timber Mountains and Yucca Mountains. The catchment of the Amargosa River above Tecopa, California is presently about . Later, after Lake Tecopa had disappeared, the river reached Death Valley and its Lake Manly, dramatically increasing the supply of water to the latter. Presently, the river is largely ephemeral except where it is fed by springs.  Geography  The former lake basin is surrounded by various hills and mountain ranges, formed by rocks of Neoproterozoic to Tertiary age. Clockwise from north they are the Resting Spring Range, the Nopah Range, the Sperry Hills, the Ibex Hills, the Greenwater Valley and the Dublin Hills; together they enclose an area of about . The region belongs to the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, where short ranges of mountains lie between plains. This geology consists of normal faults which separate grabens from horsts. It was affected by extensive tectonic activity in the past and may be still active in the present. Presently, the towns of Shoshone, California, Tecopa Hot Springs, California and Tecopa, California lie within the former bed of Lake Tecopa. California State Route 127 and California State Route 178 cross the lake basin from southwest to north and from west to east, respectively, while the Furnace Creek Road traverses it from northwest to southeast. The terrain of the region is characterized by badlands and rugged mountains with little vegetation away from springs. A number of springs form oases in the area, including the locations of the three towns. = Climate = Presently, the area of Lake Tecopa is a hot, dry desert with most precipitation occurring during summer. In Shoshone, California average temperatures are and often exceed , with about of rainfall. Under present-day climates, evaporation is too high and precipitation too low to allow the formation of lakes in the area. 180,000 years before present, precipitation increased to and average temperatures decreased by , lifting the regional water tables.  Sediments  Various sediments were emplaced in the lake, including adularia, clay, gravel and zeolites. Some of these formed when ash or sediments were progressively altered. The sediments take the form of calcareous, sandy, silty material or mudstone. The sediments have undergone increasing amounts of diagenesis the closer they are to the basin center. Among the minerals found at various sites are calcite, gaylussite, halite and sepiolite. After the lake was breached, these deposits were deeply eroded and exposed, showing thicknesses exceeding . Mining for bentonite and pumicite took place from the 1920s to the 1950s. Tufa deposits are found within the lake and partly embedded in its sediments; they were generated from carbonate precipitation within the lake, a process facilitated by the physical properties of the lake water. Many of these tufa deposits occur where fault-controlled springs discharged water into the lake. Several tephra layers have been identified, including the 2.003 million years old Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, the 706,000 years old Bishop Tuff and the 602,000 years old Lava Creek Tuff as well as the 2, 1.2-0.8 million years old Glass Mountain tuffs. They form tuff layers which are very conspicuous in the lake sediments. = Biology = A number of fossils were discovered in the sediments, including chara, diatoms, ostracods, snails and vertebrates. Among mammals are Camelops, Equus, mammoth and muskrat. Footprints have been observed at the edges of the lake basin. Arcellacea and foraminifera have been found in lake sediments, including Bolivina goudkoffi, Centropyxis constricta, Lobatula lobatula and a few other, less widespread species. Foraminifera are mostly oceanic, and since Lake Tecopa was never connected to the ocean, they were most likely transported there by birds.  History  Pleistocene lakes in the region. Note that Lake Tecopa's borders are incorrect Lake Tecopa existed during the Miocene and Pleistocene. The basin of Lake Tecopa formed between 7 and 11 million years ago, but was then tectonically stable during the Quaternary, although tectonic or magmatic activity may be occurring north of Shoshone. From about 5 million years ago to about 186,000 years before present, the lake developed inside the basin. Extensive faulting of lake deposits makes it difficult to reconstruct its history. About 2 million years ago, the Amargosa Desert began to drain into Lake Tecopa and a shallow lake existed back then, but between 1.6 and 0.9 million years ago the lake often became a playa. It is unlikely that the lake was ephemeral, however, given the presence of fossils in the lake sediments of foraminifera which do not tolerate such drying. Probably owing to uplift of the Sierra Nevada and expansion of the catchment, water levels at Lake Tecopa increased during the Pleistocene and reached highstands concurrently with other lakes in the Great Basin. The highest shoreline occurs at about elevation (subsequently tectonically deformed) about 186,000 years before present; it appears to coincide with the Eetza highstand of Lake Lahontan and oxygen isotope stages 8, 7 and 6. Some doubts have been raised about this chronology, however. At some point after 579,000 years ago, a large slump occurred at the southwestern area of the lake, possibly triggered by an earthquake. Such earthquake activity is also responsible for the formation of seismites within the lake sediments. A number of faults criss-cross the area, several of them follow the borders of the Tecopa basin. Finally, there is evidence of uplift in parts of the southern basin. About 200,000 - 150,000 years before present, the lake overflowed and disappeared. Several different dates have been given for the time when the lake breached its boundaries, but it likely happened shortly after highstand. A long gorge was formed by the breaching event, which was triggered either by a river capture-like process or by overflow. Subsidence in Death Valley may be ultimately responsible for the drainage change. It is possible that Lake Tecopa briefly reformed later, due to a temporary blockage of its outflow, and that at times the Amargosa River was blocked upstream from Lake Tecopa. The existence of the lake beds was described first by Levi F. Noble in 1926. In 1931, Eliot Blackwelder identified these lakebeds as the remnants of what he named Lake Tecopa. The area of the former lake has been the subject of numerous studies comprising various fields of geology but also biology, and an important target for field studies and field trips. Research in the paleoclimatic conditions of the region has received impetus from the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, since the future climate of the region is important in establishing how secure the nuclear waste would be.

With the end of the war, the program was changed to that of a research vehicle for missile control systems; both single and twin-rocket-powered versions were built and tested. Design and development The Gorgon missile program began in July 1943 at the Naval Aircraft Modification Unit in Warminster, Pennsylvania, and was intended to develop a family of small air-launched missiles for air-to-air and air-to- surface roles.Parsch 2005 The Gorgon III was intended as an air-to-air missile for use by patrol aircraft; it would have a conventional aircraft-type design, with a high-mounted wing and twin tail fins. Originally three different propulsion systems were to be trialed; Gorgon IIIA was to be rocket-powered; Gorgon IIIB powered by a turbojet engine, and Gorgon IIIC was to use pulsejet propulsion; however Gorgon IIIC was later changed to a rocket-powered configuration. Both Gorgon IIIA and, in its as-built configuration, Gorgon IIIC were to be powered by the Reaction Motors CLM2N liquid-fuel rocket, fueled with monoethylamine and nitric acid,Bowman 1957, p.124. with a single motor in the IIIA and twin motors in the Gorgon IIIC. Guidance was to be provided by a combination of television guidance, the missile steered by radio command from the launching aircraft to the target via a camera in the nose of the missile, with a backup seeker head of unspecified type. In April 1945, orders had been placed for 34 Gorgon IIIA missiles, with 16 Gorgon IIIBs and 20 Gorgon IIICs also on contract. However, the guidance system had proved to be unworkable in tests of the Gorgon IIA missile, and with the end of the war the program was realigned as a pure testing effort for missile control and guidance systems. Operational history =Gorgon IIIA= All 34 of the ordered Gorgon IIIAs were built;Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.181. designated KA3N-1, tests began in late 1945. With the change of the program to research in 1946 the missile was redesignated KU3N-1, with the designation later becoming CTV-6 and then the definitive CTV-N-6. Gorgon IIIA was used to test components and control systems for guided missiles. =Gorgon IIIB= Due to a lack of suitable turbojet engines for missile usage, the Gorgon IIIB was cancelled before any vehicles had been built. However a derivative, the TD2N target drone, was produced, with nine aircraft being produced and tested. =Gorgon IIIC= Given the designation KA3N-2, the Gorgon IIIC was limited to a production run of twelve airframes. Redesignated KU3N-2 with the end of the war, six were utilized by the Navy in trials of missile stability, control, and performance; the other six were used by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) for research into flight conditions at high subsonic speeds, launched from the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station at Wallops Island, Virginia, using a purpose-built launch ramp.Shortal 1978, p.124. The Gorgon IIIC was redesignated RTV-4, then RTV-N-4, before being retired. Some appear to have been expended as target drones at the end of their life.White 1991, p.37. Surviving aircraft The U.S. Navy donated two CTV-N-6 Gorgon IIIAs to the National Air and Space Museum; transferred in 1965 and 1966, they remain unrestored in the museum's storage facilities.

This algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaGo Zero. On December 5, 2017, the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing AlphaZero, which within 24 hours of training achieved a superhuman level of play in these three games by defeating world-champion programs Stockfish, elmo, and the 3-day version of AlphaGo Zero. In each case it made use of custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that the Google programs were optimized to use. AlphaZero was trained solely via \\"self-play\\" using 5,000 first-generation TPUs to generate the games and 64 second-generation TPUs to train the neural networks, all in parallel, with no access to opening books or endgame tables. After four hours of training, DeepMind estimated AlphaZero was playing at a higher Elo rating than Stockfish 8; after 9 hours of training, the algorithm defeated Stockfish 8 in a time- controlled 100-game tournament (28 wins, 0 losses, and 72 draws). The trained algorithm played on a single machine with four TPUs. DeepMind's paper on AlphaZero was published in the journal Science on 7 December 2018. In 2019 DeepMind published a new paper detailing MuZero, a new algorithm able to generalise on AlphaZero work playing both Atari and board games without knowledge of the rules or representations of the game. Relation to AlphaGo Zero AlphaZero (AZ) is a more generalized variant of the AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) algorithm, and is able to play shogi and chess as well as Go. Differences between AZ and AGZ include: * AZ has hard-coded rules for setting search hyperparameters. * The neural network is now updated continually. * Go (unlike chess) is symmetric under certain reflections and rotations; AlphaGo Zero was programmed to take advantage of these symmetries. AlphaZero is not. * Chess can end in a draw unlike Go; therefore AlphaZero can take into account the possibility of a drawn game. Stockfish and elmo Comparing Monte Carlo tree search searches, AlphaZero searches just 80,000 positions per second in chess and 40,000 in shogi, compared to 70 million for Stockfish and 35 million for elmo. AlphaZero compensates for the lower number of evaluations by using its deep neural network to focus much more selectively on the most promising variation. Training AlphaZero was trained solely via self-play, using 5,000 first-generation TPUs to generate the games and 64 second-generation TPUs to train the neural networks. In parallel, the in-training AlphaZero was periodically matched against its benchmark (Stockfish, elmo, or AlphaGo Zero) in brief one-second-per-move games to determine how well the training was progressing. DeepMind judged that AlphaZero's performance exceeded the benchmark after around four hours of training for Stockfish, two hours for elmo, and eight hours for AlphaGo Zero. Preliminary results =Outcome= Chess In AlphaZero's chess match against Stockfish 8 (2016 TCEC world champion), each program was given one minute per move. Stockfish was allocated 64 threads and a hash size of 1 GB, a setting that Stockfish's Tord Romstad later criticized as suboptimal. AlphaZero was trained on chess for a total of nine hours before the match. During the match, AlphaZero ran on a single machine with four application-specific TPUs. In 100 games from the normal starting position, AlphaZero won 25 games as White, won 3 as Black, and drew the remaining 72. In a series of twelve, 100-game matches (of unspecified time or resource constraints) against Stockfish starting from the 12 most popular human openings, AlphaZero won 290, drew 886 and lost 24. Shogi AlphaZero was trained on shogi for a total of two hours before the tournament. In 100 shogi games against elmo (World Computer Shogi Championship 27 summer 2017 tournament version with YaneuraOu 4.73 search), AlphaZero won 90 times, lost 8 times and drew twice. As in the chess games, each program got one minute per move, and elmo was given 64 threads and a hash size of 1 GB. Go After 34 hours of self-learning of Go and against AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero won 60 games and lost 40. =Analysis= DeepMind stated in its preprint, \\"The game of chess represented the pinnacle of AI research over several decades. State-of-the-art programs are based on powerful engines that search many millions of positions, leveraging handcrafted domain expertise and sophisticated domain adaptations. AlphaZero is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm originally devised for the game of go that achieved superior results within a few hours, searching a thousand times fewer positions, given no domain knowledge except the rules.\\" DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, a chess player himself, called AlphaZero's play style \\"alien\\": It sometimes wins by offering counterintuitive sacrifices, like offering up a queen and bishop to exploit a positional advantage. \\"It's like chess from another dimension.\\" Given the difficulty in chess of forcing a win against a strong opponent, the +28 ‚Äì0 =72 result is a significant margin of victory. However, some grandmasters, such as Hikaru Nakamura and Komodo developer Larry Kaufman, downplayed AlphaZero's victory, arguing that the match would have been closer if the programs had access to an opening database (since Stockfish was optimized for that scenario). Romstad additionally pointed out that Stockfish is not optimized for rigidly fixed-time moves and the version used is a year old.Katyanna Quach. \\"DeepMind's AlphaZero AI clobbered rival chess app on non-level playing...board\\". The Register (December 14, 2017). Similarly, some shogi observers argued that the elmo hash size was too low, that the resignation settings and the \\"EnteringKingRule\\" settings (cf. shogi ¬ß Entering King) may have been inappropriate, and that elmo is already obsolete compared with newer programs. (via ) =Reaction and criticism= Papers headlined that the chess training took only four hours: \\"It was managed in little more than the time between breakfast and lunch.\\" Wired hyped AlphaZero as \\"the first multi-skilled AI board-game champ\\". AI expert Joanna Bryson noted that Google's \\"knack for good publicity\\" was putting it in a strong position against challengers. \\"It's not only about hiring the best programmers. It's also very political, as it helps make Google as strong as possible when negotiating with governments and regulators looking at the AI sector.\\" Human chess grandmasters generally expressed excitement about AlphaZero. Danish grandmaster Peter Heine Nielsen likened AlphaZero's play to that of a superior alien species. Norwegian grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer characterized AlphaZero's play as \\"insane attacking chess\\" with profound positional understanding. Former champion Garry Kasparov said \\"It's a remarkable achievement, even if we should have expected it after AlphaGo.\\" Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura was less impressed, and stated \\"I don't necessarily put a lot of credibility in the results simply because my understanding is that AlphaZero is basically using the Google supercomputer and Stockfish doesn't run on that hardware; Stockfish was basically running on what would be my laptop. If you wanna have a match that's comparable you have to have Stockfish running on a supercomputer as well.\\" Top US correspondence chess player Wolff Morrow was also unimpressed, claiming that AlphaZero would probably not make the semifinals of a fair competition such as TCEC where all engines play on equal hardware. Morrow further stated that although he might not be able to beat AlphaZero if AlphaZero played drawish openings such as the Petroff Defence, AlphaZero would not be able to beat him in a correspondence chess game either. Motohiro Isozaki, the author of YaneuraOu, noted that although AlphaZero did comprehensively beat elmo, the rating of AlphaZero in shogi stopped growing at a point which is at most 100~200 higher than elmo. This gap is not that high, and elmo and other shogi software should be able to catch up in 1‚Äì2 years.DeepMindÁ§æ„Åå„ÇÑ„Å≠„ÅÜ„ÇâÁéã„Å´Ê≥®ÁõÆ„ÅóÂßã„ÇÅ„Åü„Çà„ÅÜ„Åß„Åô  „ÇÑ„Å≠„ÅÜ„ÇâÁéã ÂÖ¨Âºè„Çµ„Ç§„Éà, 2017Âπ¥12Êúà7Êó• Final results DeepMind addressed many of the criticisms in their final version of the paper, published in December 2018 in Science. They further clarified that AlphaZero was not running on a supercomputer; it was trained using 5,000 tensor processing units (TPUs), but only ran on four TPUs and a 44-core CPU in its matches.As given in the Science paper, a TPU is \\"roughly similar in inference speed to a Titan V GPU, although the architectures are not directly comparable\\" (Ref. 24). =Chess= In the final results, Stockfish version 8 ran under the same conditions as in the TCEC superfinal: 44 CPU cores, Syzygy endgame tablebases, and a 32GB hash size. Instead of a fixed time control of one move per minute, both engines were given 3 hours plus 15 seconds per move to finish the game. In a 1000-game match, AlphaZero won with a score of 155 wins, 6 losses, and 839 draws. DeepMind also played a series of games using the TCEC opening positions; AlphaZero also won convincingly. =Shogi= Similar to Stockfish, Elmo ran under the same conditions as in the 2017 CSA championship. The version of Elmo used was WCSC27 in combination with YaneuraOu 2017 Early KPPT 4.79 64AVX2 TOURNAMENT. Elmo operated on the same hardware as Stockfish: 44 CPU cores and a 32GB hash size. AlphaZero won 98.2% of games when playing black (which plays first in shogi) and 91.2% overall. =Reactions and criticisms= Human grandmasters were generally impressed with AlphaZero's games against Stockfish. Former world champion Garry Kasparov said it was a pleasure to watch AlphaZero play, especially since its style was open and dynamic like his own. In the chess community, Komodo developer Mark Lefler called it a \\"pretty amazing achievement\\", but also pointed out that the data was old, since Stockfish had gained a lot of strength since January 2018 (when Stockfish 8 was released). Fellow developer Larry Kaufman said AlphaZero would probably lose a match against the latest version of Stockfish, Stockfish 10, under Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC) conditions. Kaufman argued that the only advantage of neural network‚Äìbased engines was that they used a GPU, so if there was no regard for power consumption (e.g. in an equal-hardware contest where both engines had access to the same CPU and GPU) then anything the GPU achieved was \\"free\\". Based on this, he stated that the strongest engine was likely to be a hybrid with neural networks and standard alpha‚Äìbeta search. AlphaZero inspired the computer chess community to develop Leela Chess Zero, using the same techniques as AlphaZero. Leela contested several championships against Stockfish, where it showed similar strength.See TCEC and Leela Chess Zero. In 2019 DeepMind published MuZero, a unified system that played excellent chess, shogi, and go, as well as games in the Atari Learning Environment, without being pre-programmed with their rules.

The event took place on December 8, 1993 at the Tokyo International Trade Harumi Dome in Tokyo, Japan. This was the first Year End Spectacular event and would set the stage for future major events in FMW to close the month of December. In the main event, FMW's ace Atsushi Onita defended the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship against W*ING's ace Mitsuhiro Matsunaga in the first-ever encounter between the Japanese deathmatch wrestling icons for the first time ever. Onita defeated Matsunaga in a no ropes exploding barbed wire deathmatch to retain the title. In another important match on the card, Mr. Pogo defeated Tarzan Goto. Background A rivalry had taken place between FMW and W*ING when W*ING was established in 1991. W*ING's dominance ended when former W*ING wrestlers Mr. Pogo, Hideki Hosaka and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga joined FMW during the summer of 1993. They became Atsushi Onita's main rivals. At Summer Spectacular, Onita defeated Pogo to become the first-ever FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion. Matsunaga had been W*ING's ace in 1992 and he challenged Onita to a title match for the first time ever between FMW's ace and W*ING's ace at Year End Spectacular, which Onita accepted. The match was originally scheduled to be a glass cage deathmatch in which cage would be made out of glass containing explosives and once a wrestler was thrown into the cage, the explosives would blow. The idea was rejected because it was considered unsafe for the wrestlers and fans at ringside. Event =Preliminary matches= In the opening match, the FMW team of Keiko Iwami, Nurse Nakamura, Miwa Sato and Yukie Nabeno defeated Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling's (LLPW) team of Michiko Omukai, Michiko Nagashima, Carol Midori and Otaku Hozumi when Sato applied a Scorpion Death Hold on Omukai. The team of Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Little Frankie defeated Strong Machine Chin and Tomezo Tsunokake when Kuroda applied a single-legged Boston crab on Chin. Katsutoshi Niiyama, Mr. Gannosuke, Koji Nakagawa and Masato Tanaka took on Dark Ranger, Maseru Toi, Hisakatsu Oya and Hideki Hosaka in a tag team match. Niiyama performed a reverse side slam on Ranger to win the match. Tsuppari Mack took on LLPW's Yasha Kurenai, who won by performing a crooked arm lariat. A junior heavyweight match took place in which the team of Battle Ranger Z, SATO and Taka Michinoku took on Michinoku Pro Wrestling's (MPW) Super Delfin, Jinsei Shinzaki and Gran Naniwa. Ranger performed a top- rope frankensteiner on Naniwa to get the win. The Mad Dog Military members Shark Tsuchiya and Crusher Maedomari took on All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW)'s Aja Kong and Kyoko Inoue. Kong performed a backdrop suplex on Tsuchiya to get the win for AJW. In the next match, Mad Dog Military's Combat Toyoda took on AJW's Bull Nakano. Nakano performed a diving guillotine leg drop to hand FMW, their second consecutive defeat against AJW. The Great Sasuke made his first defense of the FMW Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Damien. Sasuke performed a Moonsault to retain the title. Team Canada's Dr. Luther and Dr. Hannibal took on The Sheik and his nephew Sabu. Luther performed Sabu's Facecrusher to win the match. Megumi Kudo defeated AJW's Takako Inoue with a top-rope frankensteiner to get the only win for FMW over AJW at the event. The first major match of the event took place as FMW's Sambo Asako, Katsuji Ueda and Grigory Verichev took on Team Canada's Big Titan, The Gladiator and Ricky Fuji. Titan pinned Asako to win the match. Mr. Pogo and Tarzan Goto competed in a match, during which Hisakatsu Oya blew a fireball on Goto, allowing Pogo to win the match. =Main event match= Atsushi Onita defended the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship against Mitsuhiro Matsunaga in the first-ever no ropes exploding barbed wire deathmatch. Onita performed a Thunder Fire Powerbomb to retain the title. Reception Even though Year End Spectacular managed to draw a crowd of 12,552, the event itself and the Onita/Matsunaga main event was considered a disappointment. Aftermath After their match at Year End Spectacular, Atsushi Onita and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga formed an alliance to feud with Mr. Pogo and his entourage. On January 6, 1994, Pogo defeated Onita to win the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. Pogo and his sidekick Hisakatsu Oya won the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship on April 21 and successfully defended the title against rivals Tarzan Goto and Matsunaga at 5th Anniversary Show. Onita and Matsunaga defeated Pogo and Oya to win the tag team championship on July 31. Pogo and Matsunaga's feud concluded at Summer Spectacular, where Pogo defeated Matsunaga in a non-title street fight deathmatch. The old retired WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Championship was re-installed as the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship after Year End Spectacular and a round robin tournament took place for the vacant title, won by Team Canada's Big Titan and The Gladiator on January 18. They lost the title on April 21 and tension began growing within the group due to their recent losses. At the 5th Anniversary Show, Team Canada took on WAR's Fuyuki- Gun in a match and Titan and Gladiator had a miscommunication with each other. Team Canada won the match but Gladiator walked on Team Canada after the match to end the group.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Scoot McNairy also star as the boy's parents. The film is directed by Christopher Cantwell based on a screenplay by Darren Lemke. The H Collective financed Gran Via's production of the film. Filming took place in Winnipeg, Canada. The Parts You Lose had its world premiere on March 14, 2019 at the 2019 Sun Valley Film Festival in Sun Valley, Idaho. Samuel Goldwyn Films released the film commercially in the United States on October 4, 2019. Synopsis A deaf 10-year-old boy, Wesley, lives on a small farm in North Dakota and commutes to a school for the deaf. He is bullied at the school; at home, he has a good relationship with his mother, though not his father. One day he comes across an injured man who he helps recover, and they become friends. The man teaches the boy how to stand up to the school bully and his father. The police come looking for the man, and Wesley struggles with being loyal to his new friend. Cast * Aaron Paul as The Man * Danny Murphy as Wesley * Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Gail * Scoot McNairy as Ronnie Production The Parts You Lose is directed by Christopher Cantwell based on a screenplay by Darren Lemke. The film's production is financed and overseen by The H Collective. The film originated in 2015 as a German-Canadian co-production based on a screenplay by Lemke and with Dutch director Paula van der Oest attached. Actor Aaron Paul was cast in May of that year, with filming scheduled to begin in the Manitoba province of Canada in the last few months of 2015. By November, Carice van Houten was also cast, with filming having been pushed back to the second quarter of 2016. Van der Oest and Van Houten eventually left the project; these changes and production delays postponed filming. By June 2017, the production-financing entity The H Collective was launched with The Parts You Lose among a dozen films it began financing. By the following November, Christopher Cantwell was hired as the new director to film Lemke's script. British deaf actor Danny Murphy, who is fluent in British Sign Language, was cast as the deaf boy who befriends Paul's character. Murphy was cast after an international casting search, supported by Deaf West Theatre, for a hard of hearing actor. In the following December, actors Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Scoot McNairy were cast as the deaf boy's parents. McNairy had previously starred in the TV series Halt and Catch Fire (2014‚Äì2017), of which Cantwell was one of the creators and showrunners. Principal photography started in Winnipeg in the Manitoba province of Canada on December 5, 2017. Since Murphy and his character use sign language, producers involved students and staff from Winnipeg's Manitoba School for the Deaf. Joanna Hawkins was hired as an American Sign Language consultant. Students and teachers were also filmed in scenes using sign language. Mary Elizabeth Winstead previously worked with Aaron Paul on Smashed but in this film Paul had completed filming before she arrived and they had no scenes together. By March 2018, The Parts You Lose was in post-production. By the following October, the film was officially finished. Release The Parts You Lose had its world premiere on March 14, 2019 at the 2019 Sun Valley Film Festival in Sun Valley, Idaho.

On Metacritic the film has a score of 47% based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a positive review and wrote \\"Paul and young Danny Murphy are terrific together, with Paul playing a wounded bear growling his lines and Murphy delivering a fully realized performance. And for such a bleak and harsh tale, The Parts You Lose finds some rays of light at the end of the night.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter complained about the wasted dramatic potential of the film and wrote: \\"The Parts You Lose somehow manages to be both unmoving and tension-free, wasting the talents of several notable actors in the process.\\" See also * List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing References External links * American films American thriller films 2019 thriller films Films set in North Dakota Films shot in Winnipeg 2019 films Samuel Goldwyn Films films ","title":"The Parts You Lose"},{"id":"55981873","text":"All About Nina is a 2018 comedy-drama film, written and directed by Eva Vives, in her feature directorial debut.

Hydrology This northeast-southwest trending lake had a maximum width of about , a length of around and an elevation of approximately . There were at least two creek inflows, including one from neighbouring O'Connor Lake. The primary outflow was an unnamed creek from the south end of Vermilion Lake to Tetapaga Lake which eventually flows via the Tetapaga River, Lake Temagami, the Temagami River, the Sturgeon River, Lake Nipissing and the French River into Lake Huron. Geology Vermilion Lake was situated at the south end of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This shear zone extends some to the northeast where it ends at Net Lake. The high frequency of gold occurrences in and adjacent to this zone has made it a high potential area for hosting major gold deposits. One of these gold occurrences, Oslund-Hurst, was located at the northeast end of Vermilion Lake. It was named after N. Oslund and F. Hurst who staked mining claims there prior to 1941. The south end of Vermilion Lake was crosscut by banded iron formation of the Vermilion Range, which continued southwestwards to Iron Lake.

History Russian state budget was depleted during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) and the government increased the price for alcohol concessions which, in turn, led to nearly tripling of retail vodka prices to 8‚Äì10 rubles per bucket. The protests originated in September 1858 in the Kovno Governorate, a Catholic province of Tsarist Lithuania, where local villagers took oaths to abstain from drinking vodka, and all other hard liquors except for 'medicinal purposes'. Non-distilled alcohol, such as wine or beer, was still permitted. Supported by the local Catholic clergy, the protesters established local chapters of the Brotherhood of Sobriety (), a temperance society that originated in 1844 in Silesia and received official approval from Pope Pius IX in 1851. By early 1859, the protests had spread to the Orthodox population of the Empire, including much of European Russia, where more and more peasants took oaths of abstention from vodka. In total, there were reports of the boycott actions from 91 uyezds in 32 governorates. The newspaper Kolokol promoted the cause, denouncing the vodka tax farming system that promoted alcohol addiction and poverty among the population in return for tax revenues. Alcohol sales plummeted, with prices dropping to 0.5 rubles a bucket, and in some localities retailers resorted to offering free vodka. In Kovno Governorate, alcohol sales dropped by 70%. In May 1859, the protests turned violent, as taverns came under attack, and the army was called to suppress the movement. The protesters were flogged and forced to drink by having liquor poured into their mouths through funnels, and then imprisoned as rebels. Some 780 people were arrested and temperance societies were outlawed in 1863. The government replaced the alcohol concessions with an excise tax.

Measures  The Automatic Thought Questionnaire 30 (ATQ 30) is a scientific questionnaire created by Steven D. Hollon and Phillip C. Kendall that measures automatic negative thoughts. The ATQ 30 consists of 30 negative statements and asks participants to indicate how often they experienced the negative thought during the course of the week on a scale of 1‚Äì5 (1=Low-High=5). This measure was created in response to Aaron T. Beck‚Äôs hypothesis that thinking in depressed populations tends to be negative. Example statements include \\"I'm worthless\\", \\"I've let people down\\", \\"I can't get started\\" and \\"My future is bleak\\".  Depression  It has been suggested in some studies that depression is associated with having increased levels of automatic negative thoughts. Additionally, the extent of automatic negative thoughts experienced is associated with depression severity.  Social anxiety disorder  In this disorder, people experience a high degree of fear and avoidance of social situations. There has not been much research conducted to date on the association between automatic thoughts and social anxiety disorder. However, one study by Iancu and colleagues attempted to evaluate a possible relationship. They proposed a possible relationship because of the distorted thinking that occurs with social anxiety disorder. In their study, the researchers selected a group of individuals who were diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, and then administered them automatic thought questionnaires. The study found that people with higher levels of automatic negative thoughts were more likely to show more fear and avoidance. In addition, levels of automatic thoughts that were measured were correlated with severity of symptoms.  Reducing Automatic Negative Thoughts  = Mindfulness = Mindfulness is a technique used to help people focus on the present moment, thereby helping in restructuring distorted thoughts and feelings. Some studies suggest that mindfulness reduces automatic negative thinking. Ritvo and colleagues found that university students going through a series of mindfulness courses had an overall group reduction in automatic negative thoughts.

Biography Simpson was born in Newcastle, the daughter of Alister and Ada Alison. She studied art under Elizabeth and Stanhope Forbes at their school, the Forbes School of Painting, in Newlyn during 1911 and 1912. In Newlyn, Simpson lodged with her sister Rose and together they led a full social life. During this time Simpson met the artist Charles Walter Simpson and the couple married in 1913. Their daughter, Leonora, was born the following year in Newlyn. Subsequently, the family lived in different locations throughout Cornwall, including at Carbis Bay, Lamorna and at St Ives. A joint show of their work was held in 1919. In St Ives, starting in 1920 the Simpsons ran their own painting school, the Shore Studio, with Ruth specializing in teaching portrait painting. In 1924, they closed the painting school and moved to London but returned to Cornwall in 1931 and settled in Lamorna where they remained until 1945, when they moved to Penzance. It appears Ruth Simpson did little, if any, painting after returning from London and she died at Redruth in 1964 and is buried in the cemetery at Paul. As an artist, Ruth Simpson largely focused on portrait painting. She developed a distinct style of portraiture, working with colour in a modern style and often using bright coloured backgrounds. She had three works in group shows hosted by the Society of Women Artists. She painted several portraits of women artists who were based in Cornwall, including Ella Naper and Gertrude Harvey. Her three-quarter length Portrait of an Officer is in the collection of the Imperial War Museum while her portrait of Frank Ver Beck is held by the Royal Cornwall Museum. Works by Simpson were included in the exhibition Painting in Newlyn 1880‚Äì1930 held at the Barbican Centre during 1985.

Early life Florence Matomela was born in 1910. She raised five children while working as a teacher in rural Eastern Cape. She also spent time in New Brighton township.V Msila. A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013. SUN MeDIA METRO under SUN PRESS. 2014. Rural activism The activism of women like Matomela, in rural areas, was often neglected however, women in the Herschel and Qumbu district of the Eastern Cape played a very important role in activism. Due to the growing number of male migration away from rural Eastern Cape, many women were left without enough resources to sustain themselves and their children. The women sold their surplus produce such as sorghum, maize and wheat to traders to try and purchase their basic needs. The women were mostly dissatisfied with the treatment that they received from these traders as, there was little regulation of trade in these agricultural communities. These conditions led to a total boycott of trading stores in 1922 led by community members like Mrs Annie Sodyiyo. The arrest of women from the community increased their solidarity and ultimately, traders agreed to regulate prices. Matomela was exposed to female activists and rural political activity from a young age. These environments contributed into creating Florence Matomela into the influential politician that she became. http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-womens-struggle-south-africa Accessed 4 December 2017 Political career Florence Matomela was one of the first women to volunteer in the 1952 Defiance Campaign. The more strict influx control measures and pass laws under the Native Laws Amendment Act implemented in 1952 made it an offence for any African to be in an urban area for longer than 72 hours without the necessary documentation. The only women who were permitted to live in townships were the wives and unmarried daughters of men with permits. For the first time, women were required to carry reference books. The reference book held the holders identity, employment, place of legal residence, tax payments and if applicable permission to be in urban areas. Many women were against this as it would take away their freedom of movement. Protests started when news of the new legislation were leaked to the press. After influx control regulations were implemented in Port Elizabeth. Florence Matomela spearheaded a demonstration which resulted into the burning of passbooks. Making this one of the first acts of the Defiance Campaign in the Eastern Cape. http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-womens-struggle- south-africa Accessed 4 December 2017 Florence Matomela, along with Frances Baard, Hilda Tshaka, Talita Chaba and Christina Jasson played a major role in organising the Defiance Campaign in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth. They held numerous mass meetings. http://sthp.saha.org.za/memorial/articles/why_the_defiance_campaign_was_most_dramatic_in_the_eastern_cape.htm Accessed 5 December 2017 There were police informants who attended these meetings and they reported that Matomela was one of the most effective and militant speakers in New Brighton. Florence Matomela often appealed to women and other volunteers to join the African National Congress, ANC, and drew in many members as the leading figure of the ANC at the time. On the 26 of June 1952 she and other activists held a mass meeting at the civic center in New Brighton. They left the civic center in the early hours of the morning for a demonstration. They planned to enter the \\"Europeans only\\" section of New Brighton Railway Station. Police sergeants were awaiting them by 5 o'clock that morning.R. Mhlaba, T. Mafumadi. Raymond Mahlaba's Personal Memoirs: Reminiscing from Rwanda to Uganda. HSRC Press, 2001 pg 82-83. Florence Matomela and another 34 activists were arrested in Port Elizabeth due to their participation in the Defiance Campaign. Due to her involvement in the campaign, she spent six weeks in prison on a charge for civil disobedience. She was later tried again with leaders of the Cape and given a nine-month suspended sentence. Matomela was the provincial organiser of the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) and vice-president of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) in the mid 1950s. When Florence Matomela was the president of the Eastern Cape branch of the ANCWL, she met with Frances Baard, who was a leader in the Food and Canning Workers Union (FCWU), and Ray Alexander, who was the general secretary of the FCWU in Port Elizabeth. Together they called a meeting to discuss the possibilities of creating a national women's organisation. There is no formal record of the meeting, however Ray Alexander said that about 40 women attended.

Due to poor health provision in prison her health deteriorated, she was sometimes deprived of her insulin injections as a person suffering from diabetes. She was released from prison in 1968 to news that her husband had passed away three years prior without her notification.

As of April 2019, he has produced over 230 publications and numerous patents. His research articles have garnered over 6000 citations, and he has achieved an h-index of 44.  Research achievements  Hocek and his group have contributed significantly to organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry by developing methods to synthesize modified nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids through cross-coupling reactions and C-H activation. They discovered several novel classes of cytostatic agents with nanomolar antitumor activities based on substituted or fused deazapurine nucleosides. In the field of chemical biology, Hocek and his laboratories have developed a simple two-step synthesis of base-modified DNA through cross- coupling reactions of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) followed by polymerase incorporation. They have discovered some modified dNTPs that are better substrates for polymerases than natural nucleotides. The methodology is widely used for enzymatic synthesis of DNA or RNA-bearing fluorescent, redox, or reactive labels, as well as for modulation of transcription.

He is best known for a single attack on a Spanish pearl-diving fleet. His story appears only in Alexandre Exquemelin's History of the Buccaneers and the truth of his account is uncertain. History No definitive dates are given for Francois' exploits. According to Exquemelin, Francois had been lying in wait for Spanish ships traveling between Campeche and Maracaibo but had little success. His 26-man crew grew restless so they elected to raid the Spanish pearl-diving operations off Rio de le Hacha. Francois tried to slip in unnoticed but the small pearl-diving boats fled under the guns of a man-of-war for protection. When they let down their guard Francois instead attacked the Vice-Admiral's 8-gun, 60-man ship, capturing it after a fierce boarding action. He sunk his old leaking vessel and forced the Spanish crew to help man the new ship. Putting up a Spanish flag, he tried to board the 200-man, 24-gun man-of-war itself but the warship gave chase. Francois fled the warship but unfurled too much sail in a strong wind, breaking his ship's mast. The warship caught them and defeated Francois and his buccaneers, who agreed to surrender \\"on condition that they should not be used as slaves to carry stones, or be employed in other labours for three or four years, as they served their negroes\\" and were instead set ashore. Another source (via Exquemelin, from a different translation) claims Francois and his men were sentenced to servitude anyway, eventually sent to Spain where they escaped and returned to France. Morgan, L'olonnais, Francois, Portugues, and Brasiliano Authenticity The story of Pierre Francois is known from a single source, Alexandre Exquemelin's History of the Buccaneers in America. Exquemelin accompanied Henry Morgan and other buccaneers during their exploits in the 1660s and 1670s and wrote detailed accounts. Exquemelin's eyewitness account of Morgan, L'Olonnais, and the other expeditions he directly witnessed is \\"generally reliable; modern historians judge it to be largely accurate in its descriptions.\\" But especially regarding second-hand accounts he related, such as Pierre Francois, \\"it remains a matter of opinion as to how much of Exquemelin's book is reliable.\\" See also *Alexandre Bras-de-Fer and Daniel Montbars ‚Äì two buccaneers whose stories were not in Exquemelin's original Dutch book, but appeared only in later French translations.

In early November 2016, Montenegro's special prosecutor for organised crime and corruption, Milivoje Katniƒá, alleged that \\"a powerful organisation\\" that comprised about 500 people from Russia, Serbia and Montenegro was behind the coup plot.Montenegro PM Accuses Opposition Over 'Plot to Kill Him' Balkan Insight, 10 November 2016. In February 2017, Montenegrin officials accused the Russian 'state structures' of being behind the attempted coup, which allegedly envisaged an attack on the country's parliament and assassination of prime minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá. The details about the coup plot were first made public at the end of October 2016 by Serbia's prime minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, whose public statement on the matter stressed the role of Serbia's law enforcers, especially the Serbian Security Intelligence Agency, in thwarting it.–°–æ–≤–±–µ–∑–Ω—ã–º–∏ —É—Å–∏–ª–∏—è–º–∏: –û—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ-—Å–µ—Ä–±—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ –≤–º–µ—à–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –ü–∞—Ç—Ä—É—à–µ–≤–∞ –ö–æ–º–º–µ—Ä—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–™, 28 October 2016. The statement was immediately followed by an unscheduled visit to Belgrade by Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council. According to the prime minister Du≈°ko Markoviƒá‚Ä≤s statements made in February 2017, the government received definitive information about the coup being prepared on 12 October 2016, when a person involved in the plot gave away the fallback scenario of his Russian minders; this information was also corroborated by the security services of NATO member countries, who helped the Montenegrin government to investigate the plot.Q&A;: Du≈°ko Markoviƒá, the Prime Minister Stuck Between Putin and Trump in the Balkans Time, 16 February 2017.

Bogiƒáeviƒá, in Serbian detention, said through his lawyer that there was no talks whatsoever on a coup and no mentions of ƒêukanoviƒá. The Moscow‚Äìbased Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS), which has close ties to Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), was mentioned by mass media as one of the organisations involved in devising the coup plot; in early November 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin sacked the RISS director, Leonid P.

He is best known for the development of inertial confinement fusion, which is a major branch of fusion power research to this day. He was also the lab's director from 1988 until 1994, when he resigned to become an Associate Director at Large. He was awarded the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1969, the James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics in 1981 and the Edward Teller Award in 1991. Career Nuckolls was born 17 November 1930 in Chicago, Il. He received his BSc from Wheaton College in 1953, and his MSc from Columbia University in 1955. Nuckolls joined what was then the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory immediately after graduation in 1955, only three years after the lab's formation. He initially worked in \\"A Division\\", responsible for nuclear weapon design. He joined the Project Plowshare efforts in 1957 after attending a meeting on the topic arranged by Edward Teller. There are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based atomic bomb known as the primary, and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the secondary. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes fusion. As a fission device, the primary releases a significant amount of radioactive material, whereas the secondary releases primarily neutrons which are stopped by the ground. Nuckolls began work on weapon designs that minimized the amount of fission and maximized the fusion, in order to reduce the radioactive byproducts of peaceful explosions. It was this work that won him the Lawrence Award. Among Plowshare's many concepts was the Project PACER, which intended to produce electrical power from the explosions of nuclear weapons in caverns. Nuckolls was struck by the size of the caverns needed to contain the explosions, and began to wonder if they could be scaled down. The secondary relies on neutrons to carry out a chain reaction that converts lithium deuteride (LiD) into deuterium and tritium which then undergoes fusion. The fusion releases neutrons which continue the reaction, but to get the reaction going some external source is needed. However, if the LiD fuel is replaced by \\"raw\\" deuterium and tritium, the initial source of neutrons is not needed. In that case, there is no lower limit to the size of the secondary. The limiting factor in that case is the size of the primary, which cannot be made much smaller than critical mass. However, Nuckolls noticed that as the secondary became very small, on the order of milligrams, the energy needed to start the reaction began to fall into the kilojoule range. At that point a primary would not be needed, there were a variety of devices that could produce that amount of energy. The demonstration of the first laser in 1960 provided the right mix of features to be a potential driver for these reactions. As these improved, in the late 1960s Nuckolls led an effort to characterize this inertial approach to fusion, much of which was revealed in a 1972 article in Nature. It was this work that won him the James Clerk Maxwell Award in 1981. Livermore started its laser fusion program in 1962-63 and began to greatly expand its inertial fusion program in the early 1970s as the first high-power lasers became available. In 1975, Nuckolls was promoted to become the Associate Leader of the Laser Fusion Program, as well as the Divisional Leader of the \\"X-group\\" that designed the fuel targets. In 1983 he was promoted to become the Associate Director of the entire Physics branch. In 1988 he was promoted to become the Director of the entire Livermore lab. In 1991, Nuckolls was awarded the Edward Teller Award for his contributions to inertial confinement fusion. Controversial Directorship Nuckolls' tenure as Director was controversial. When he was being promoted, a number of colleagues warned that he was not a decision maker. Early in his tenure, Nuckolls joined Lowell Wood and Edward Teller in a visit to the White House to brief President George Bush Sr. on Wood's Brilliant Pebbles concept for the Strategic Defense Initiative. This was a break with tradition, where Directors generally remained aloof from such actives, and a number of commenters stated this made the lab \\"like any other defense contractor\\". This led to a \\"devastating decline in morale among Livermore scientists.\\" Other issues plagued the lab as it transitioned from its cold war weapon-making role to a support system for a much wider array of potentially civilian topics; Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary had proposed to move all weapons research to Los Alamos National Laboratory, a move that Nuckolls \\"fiercely opposed.\\" This led to an increasingly confrontational relationship in Washington, culminating in his public statement that the Clinton administration was failing in its constitutional duty to \\"provide for the common defense.\\" Adding to the lab's woes, in November 1993 the Government Accountability Office released a report that found serious problems with the lab's budget and accounting. In late 1993 the University of California, who managed the lab, called for a review of Nuckolls' directorship. The review was \\"universally negative\\" and there were private calls for his resignation. At first he refused, claiming there was support for his position within the Department of Energy and the Pentagon, and then calling into question the objectivity of the review due to its chair being Richard Truly, who had been dismissed after being criticized by Teller. The University called a meeting for 6 April to discuss the issues, but on 4 April Nuckolls offered his resignation.

On 22 July 1900, he was assassinated by a Bulgarian nationalist, due his criticism of the activity of pro-Bulgarian paramilitary activism during the course of the Macedonian Struggle. Biography MihƒÉileanu's dictionary »òtefan MihƒÉileanu was born in 1859, in Beala di Supr√¢, Ottoman Empire. An ethnic Aromanian, he was one of the first students in Ottoman Macedonia to attend classes in the Aromanian language. Due to the political turmoil that preceded the Macedonian Struggle, MihƒÉileanu's uncle brought him to Romania where he continued his education in the Saint Sava National College. The Macedonian Struggle, a series of intertwined cultural, political and military conflicts between the various ethnic and religious communities residing in Macedonia was to preoccupy MihƒÉileanu until the end of his life. He combined his career as a teacher with publishing the Macedonia newspaper between 1888 and 1889. Later on he continued to produce articles for Peninsula BalcanicƒÉ (1893‚Äì1900). There he put out proposals on the resolution of the Macedonian conflict and engaged in polemics with Greek and Bulgarian newspapers. Proposing the slogan \\"Aromanians by Themselves\\", he promoted the foundation of churches and schools in Aromanian communities across Macedonia where a separate Aromanian identity was to be forged. His newspaper was widely distributed in Aromanian communities in Macedonia and even Thessaly and Epirus. Unlike Greek and Bulgarian activists he rejected anti‚ÄìOttoman irredentism. On February 1, 1900, in Bucharest the Supreme Macedonian- Adrianople Committee (SMAC) agents killed Kiril Fitovski, who was sent by the Committee to buy weapons in Romania, but subsequently was suspected of spying on behalf of the Ottoman government. Romanian police captured the assassins Boicho Iliev and Hristo Karambulov, who made full confessions and revealed the involvement of the Supreme Macedonian Committee in the assassination. Subsequently MihƒÉileanu published a number of articles in Peninsula BalcanicƒÉ, in which he branded SMAC as a criminal organization extorting wealthy people (including Aromanians) for money and revealed details of its preparations for armed struggle in Macedonia.

On 22 July 1900, MihƒÉileanu was assassinated by a Bulgarian SMAC komitadji Stoyan Dimitrov in Bucharest. His assassination created a diplomatic crisis between Romania and Bulgaria. An outcry of public opinion followed, tributes to MihƒÉileanu were published in the press and letters of support were sent to his place of birth describing him as a martyr of Romanianism. A play and several poems were dedicated to his memory. On 30 October, a Romanian court sentenced everyone involved in the plot both captured and in absentia to life in prison.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History Bay Port was settled in the early 1860s, but it was not until the arrival of the railroad in 1886 that commercial fishing became a viable industry in the area. At about that time, Charles Gillingham and his family moved their fishing operations from North Island, located northwest of Bay Port, to this location on a man-made peninsula. In 1895, other local investors established the Bay Port Fish Company nearby. Both companies quickly grew, shipping lake herring, walleye, and whitefish via ice-filled rail cars to customers throughout the eastern United States. By the 1920s and 1930s, Bay Port was known as the largest freshwater fishing port in the world, with over 30 fishing boats working from the port. Operations in what is now the historic district included ports for the boats, and also processing of the catch, repairs, and advertising and promotional offices. However, in 1945, a fire destroyed most of both Gillingham's operation and the Bay Port Fish Company's buildings. The Bay Port Fish Company closed, and Gillingham's president, Otto Schmidt, rebuilt some of the buildings. However, a general economic decline affected profits, and in 1949 Schmidt liquidated the previous company, reforming it as another entity to operate the remaining facilities. In 1965, Schmidt sold out to Henry Engelhard and Mel Dutcher, and by 1973 Engelhard was the sole owner of the business. In 1978, Engelhard died, and his heirs sold the operation to the Williams family, who continue to operate the Bay Port Fish Company as of 2017. Description The Bay Port Historic Commercial Fishing District is centered on a man-made peninsula approximately 600 feet long and 100 to 500 feetin width, extending into Saginaw Bay. When the district was designated in 1977, only seven buildings were still extant in the district. As of 2017, it appears that only three of these are still standing. These are: * Bay Port Fish Company Office Building: This building is located at the base of the peninsula. It is a two-story gable-roof wooden building on cement foundations. Built around 1920, the building houses the company offices and a storage area. * Twine House: This building is located adjacent to the Office Building. It is a one-and-a-half story building sitting on a cement block foundation, with a sheet-metal gambrel roof accented by dormers. The building was constructed in 1945. * Fish Processing Plant: This building is located at the end of the peninsula. It is a one-and-a-half story structure, with a cement block foundation and sheet-metal gambrel roof similar to the Twine House. Also constructed in 1945, the building is used to unload boats, process catch, and the public sale of fish.

(born Michel Etchegorria; fl. 1666-1668) was a pirate and flibustier (French buccaneer) from the Kingdom of Navarre in the southwest of France. He is best known as a companion of Fran√ßois L'Olonnais, with whom he sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. History Michel le Basque of Saint-Jean-de-Luz was an early buccaneer, hunting oxen and wild pigs on Santo Domingo and neighboring islands around 1657. Successful as a buccaneer, he retired to Santo Domingo and was appointed as a district official by Governor Bertrand D‚ÄôOgeron. In 1666 in Portobelo he took part in the seizure of the Spanish galleon Margarita from the Tierra Firme squadron, a capture yielding over a million piastres. He then joined forces with corsair L‚ÄôOlonnais, using his own ship to ferry their ground troops. Later in 1666 they undertook one of the first great buccaneer expeditions on the South American continent. They gathered eight boats and a landing force of 650 men. On the way to Maracaibo they captured a few vessels, including a large Spanish ship loaded with cocoa and 300,000 talers of silver. Maracaibo, located at the end of the lake of the same name, was connected to the sea by a narrow channel defended by a 16-gun fort called Castillo de San Carlos. L‚ÄôOlonnais and le Basque landed their troops out of reach of the fort‚Äôs guns, capturing it after a three-hour land battle. They made their way up the channel and attacked the city, which then had 4,000 inhabitants and a 250-man, 14-gun garrison who defended the town bitterly. While they were still engaged at Maracaibo, the buccaneers learned that a Spanish detachment had been sent as reinforcement. L‚ÄôOlonnais marched to meet them with 380 men, and ambushed them not far from the small town of Gibraltar. The Spaniards lost 500 men, while the buccaneers suffered only 40 dead and 30 wounded. L'Olonnais spent six weeks in the city of Gibraltar, which he ransacked, collecting an enormous haul of cattle, gold, jewels, silver ingots, silks, and slaves. When an epidemic broke out in the ranks of pirates, they set fire to the city and returned to Maracaibo, which they plundered thoroughly. The city was largely deserted; L‚ÄôOlonnais tortured the captives they‚Äôd taken to force them to reveal where they‚Äôd hidden their valuables. The buccaneers‚Äô treasure amounted to 260,000 pieces of eight and a great deal of religious objects and jewelry. After the capture of Maracaibo, le Basque continued piracy for a few years. The Spanish sent two ships to capture him; with two small boats he boarded the larger Spanish ships and seized them in turn. Reportedly he sent a letter thanking the Governor of Cartagena for having equipped him with such good ships.This incident, possibly apocryphal, is more commonly attributed to buccaneer Laurens de Graaf. Again in 1667, le Basque returned with only forty men and once more attacked Maracaibo, taking the richest inhabitants as hostages for ransom. Finally he returned to Basque Country where he, like Jean-Baptiste du Casse and others, was received and congratulated by the Sun King, Louis XIV of France. Some sources say he returned to the Caribbean where he captured a Spanish ship off Portobello in 1668, and was killed later that year leading a raiding party upriver. In popular culture The story of the attacks on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, although softened and treated with artistic license, is used by Emilio Salgari in his novel The Black Corsair. Purported female buccaneer Jacquotte Delahaye (actually an invention of a 1940s French novelist) was said to have rejected a marriage proposal from le Basque. le Basque's story was dramatized as the serial novelette \\"The Pearl-Fisher\\" by Emmanuel Gonzales.

Estonian art is said to have started since the Stone Age time (9000 ‚Äì 4200 B.C.). The Stone Age era art was found in caves and natural underground passageways, these paintings were found all over Estonia. Estonian art is mostly realism but Estonia also has surrealism. Estonian art from the 1200s to the 1500s are quick, simplistic and flat, they would only have 2 subjects in the foreground and the background would be the interesting feature by holding all the information in each image. The art depicts mostly common situations such as a picnic or a family dinner. History =Prehistoric art= Cave paintings were the first pieces of art, they were found in caves and tunnels. Ancestral farmers and gatherers would use blood, bone marrow and crushed up animal hair to add pigmentation to the illustrations. For example, they used blood to make prey look different from the hunters. Eventually they started incorporating wood into their tools and started making more accurate illustrations and paintings by making brushes from wood and animal hair. =Gothic art= Gothic art in Estonia was mostly found in churches and cathedrals, these churches and cathedrals had paintings and sculptures of religious figures in them. Most of them had Christian symbolism in paintings (most of which were over 8 feet tall); these painting would show Jesus and his disciples in a very artistic and symmetrical way. The Gothic Age in Estonia started around 1200 and ended around 1600, the art paintings from the start of this era were paintings about gods and their disciples (mostly portraying Jesus). The Church of the Holy Spirit, one of more famous churches found in Estonia, has a Gothic interior and exterior. The art on the sides of the loft (above the pews) is about Jesus and his journey to enlighten people. The paintings do not have a known artist but it is known that the artist painted them in the first half of the 1300s. =Medieval= Most of the Estonian art in the medieval period (mid-1500s to the 1700s) was inspired by Swedish art. The medieval art style would show the concepts of death and battle. Most pieces of art from this era would be flat and would not resemble reality. The art pieces would have skeletons and walking corpses, these would symbolize the death of people from the wars they had with the Swedish forces. 1918-1940 1917-1918 existed organization called Noorte Kujurite √úhing \\"Vikerla\\" ('Young Sculptors Union \\"Vikerla\\"'). Members were Oskar Kallis, Balder Tomasberg, V√§lko Tuul, Aleksander M√ºlber, Aleksander Krims-Radava ja Roman Haavam√§gi and Paul Liivak. This organization was so short-lived because some members died during Estonian War of Independence. =Soviet era= Suur Toll Ninase During the Soviet rule (from 1940‚Äì1991), the art movement of socialist realism emerged. Socialist realism would show the struggles of the people that were affected by Soviet rule; it would show the struggles of the middle to lower class households in workplace scenarios or as a family in a home. This period of art was not as popular when compared to other art periods. =The Great World Wars= The most notable work is the Bronze Soldier (made by Enn Roos and Supervising architect Arnold Alas) it was unveiled on the 22 September 1947 on the second anniversary of the Soviet Red Army re-entering Tallinn in September 1944. It was originally a war memorial for the people lost in the Second World War, and was moved between several war graves, but subsequently was put at the Tallinn military cemetery where it still resides. =Post independence era= Estonia started surreal art from early 1900 and is quite renowned in comparison to other countries in the region. This era of art is one of the hardest to plot in skill due to the vast variety each art piece conveys but this then led to the next art style. Modernism started in the early 1900s but did not get famous until around the 1950s in Estonia. Estonia is well known for its modernist paintings and illustrations. Most of the post-independence art is modern and talks about the struggles of the past; some depict the most notable moment in Estonian art, the day of their fight for independence. After modern art, Estonia is going through the phase of contemporary art style as of this moment. Contemporary art is a style of art of the 20th and 21st century, it is an art style that does not have boundaries like other styles. One recent contemporary artists is Nelly Drell, A well-known artist, she is mostly known for her paintings. She was born on October 19, 1979 where she would build her artistic talent growing up in the capitol city Tallinn. She got her bachelors from the University of Miami and her masters from the New York Academy of Art, getting a degree in painting. One of her paintings called ‚ÄúEstonian peacekeepers in Iraq‚Äù was made in 2005 and shows the struggles of the Estonian people and their involvements in the war in Iraq.

He served as the justice minister under the cabinet of Ali Amini, during which he was noted for forming a powerful anti-corruption division that led to \\"the last serious attempt to realize the rule of law\\" in Pahlavi dynasty.  Early life  He came from the rural district of Alamut. In 1919, he joined the Democrat Party and was imprisoned in 1923 for \\"agitating among the local peasantry\\". Alamouti was employed at the justice ministry during rule of Reza Shah.  Political career  One of the members of the \\"group of fifty-three\\", he was jailed in 1938. He later joined the Tudeh Party of Iran immediately after its establishment in 1941 and was elected to its provisional central committee. At the party's first congress in 1944, he was elected to the central committee and served as the party's general-secretary, a position he shared with Mohammad Bahrami and Iraj Eskandari. He was listed by Tudeh for a Tehran seat in Iranian legislative election, 1943‚Äì1944, but was defeated. In 1946, Alamouti was excluded from the central committee because he was \\"not [a] full- fledged Marxist\\". He left the party in 1947 and joined the entourage of Ahmad Qavam. Alamouti was allegedly detested by Mohammad Reza Shah.  Ministry  Alamouti was appointed as the justice minister in 1961 and served in the capacity until July 1962. He launched a campaign to fight corruption and abuse of power among the ruling elite that led to jailing several high-ranking officials, including police chief general Alavi-Moghadam (charged with bribetaking), military prosecutor Hossein Azmoudeh and former plan and budget head Abolhassan Ebtehaj (charged with $69 million embezzlement). He appointed Ahmad Sadr Haj Seyyed Javadi as prosecutor of Tehran, who joined him in the anti-corruption legal activism. Among the military officers prosecuted during the period, were general Kia, Zarghami, Daftari, Khazaei and Nevissi. After he left office following resignation of Ali Amini, all detainees were released and the charges were dropped, however the effects of the activism were not forgotten. Three years later, some 100 judges were dismissed.

The series stars Tom Riley as DI Will Wagstaffe, a police detective haunted by the unsolved double murder of his parents when he was just sixteen years old. A single feature-length pilot, based on the novel Suffer the Children, was written by Chris Lang and directed by Colin Teague. It first broadcast on ITV Encore on 9 November 2016. The initial pilot co-stars Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Tom Brooke, Anjli Mohindra, Charlotte Riley and Miranda Raison. Following strong audience reception, a series of six hour-long episodes was commissioned in December 2017, with filming taking place in Spring 2018. The series consists of four newly-written episodes alongside the pilot, which has been re-edited, with some scenes re-shot, to form the first two episodes of the series. Lang returned to pen the four new episodes; including two which were co-written by Ben Harris. Teague returned as director. Jason Maza, Michele Austin, Alex Carter and Gregg Chillin joined the cast following the departures of Brooke and Holdbrook-Smith, who was unable to return to the series because of other filming commitments. Due to the closure of ITV Encore in March 2018, the series transmitted on ITV, alongside a number of other projects originally set for broadcast on Encore. The series began broadcasting on 31 October 2018, with episodes shown on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9:00 pm. Production Tom Riley stated the intention of the pilot being re-shot to become the first two episodes of the series was to remove elements of violence and torture suited more to a \\"cable audience\\", and commented \\"we got the chance to look at it again to see what worked and what didn't work, or which way we wanted it to go. You don't really get that option. It was strange to go back, but at the same time, a luxury that you don't normally get.\\" Notable edits made include close-up shots of a murder victim's face being removed during a scene where his testicles are shown to have been inserted into his eyesockets; scenes involving dialogue between Staffe and Josie (Anjli Mohindra) where she is seen to \\"admire\\" him being removed; and several scenes involving Staffe and Sylvie (Miranda Raison), including having dinner and making love, being entirely re-shot. Notably, the \\"blurry\\" close-up filming style used in the pilot is also toned-down for the remainder of the series, following negative feedback from viewers. Production filmed scenes at one of the beach chalets on Shellness Beach, Kent and also filmed a drone shot of a car travelling along Shellness Road, Kent. Broadcast The rebroadcasting of the pilot prompted an article in the Daily Express, detailing complaints from several viewers, who claimed that ITV's failure to bill the first two episodes as a repeat were \\"misleading\\". Those who were unaware that the first two episodes were a recut of the pilot noted a considerable unexplained change come episode three, with a number of new cast members (Jason Maza, Michele Austin, Alex Carter and Gregg Chillin) appearing without explanation, and the unexplained aging of Will's nephew Harry (Joseph Teague), who appears to be of primary school age in the pilot, but suddenly looks considerably older and is seen to be attending high school.

It is one of three main churches in the town, all built in brick Gothic style. The church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is a basilica with three naves, built from 1407 to 1440. It features a \\"star\\" rib vault that is unique in Northern Germany. When the Reformation was introduced in L√ºneburg in 1530, the church became Lutheran. The high steeple was added in the 19th century.  History  Nave towards the altar Floor plan The building was erected on the site of a former chapel which the town council had initiated while other churches were built by religious orders. It served the people of the Wasserviertel and was consecrated in 1409, to Saint Nicholas. In 1420, the town council decided to expand the chapel to a church, which was completed in 1440. The church is one of the latest brick Gothic basilicas. It features a prominent nave with a \\"star\\" rib vault which is unique in Northern Germany. Twenty years later, a steeple was built, but it was not completed due to financing problems, and proved unstable. When the Reformation was introduced in L√ºneburg in 1530, the first Lutheran sermon in town was given in St. Nicolai. The steeple was finished with a Helm in 1587. It was demolished in 1831 because it reached a state beyond repair. Due to problems of the foundation, the nave was also damaged. In 1843, an association for the rescue of the church was (Verein zur Rettung der Kirche), achieving first a stabilisation of the nave, then the building of a new steeple. The restorations during the 19th century changed the original appearance. The prominent steeple was built in 1895/96 in Gothic Revival style. It is one of the highest in the state. The church is one of the attractions of the European Route of Brick Gothic.  Furnishings  Main altar The church features several treasures of Gothic painting and carving artistry. The main altar came from St. Lamberti, another L√ºneburg church which was demolished in 1861. The altar was carved by Hans Snitker, with paintings attributed to Hans Bornemann. Its predella shows six prophets in the garb of medieval merchants. Behind the choir (Chorumgang), parts of a former high altar from the dissolved monastery Heiligenthal are shown. It features reliefs carved in L√ºneburg c. 1425 and paintings from c. 1450 with four scenes from the life of the saints Laurentius and Andreas. One of the paintings contains one of the earliest views of the town. They are also attributed to Hans Bornemann. Modern stained-glass windows were created by Johannes Schreiter in 1987. = Organ = The organ The organ was built in 1899 by the firm .

The Van‚ÄîSufian railway (, ) is a long single track railway in eastern Turkey and western Iran. The railway begins at the Van Pier in Van, Turkey, on the eastern shore of Lake Van, and runs east to Sufian, Iran, where it connects to the Tabriz-Jolfa railway. History The oldest segment of the railway dates back to the early 20th century, during World War I, when a branch railway was built from Sufian to Sharafkhaneh. The construction of a railway to Iran, via Van, was approved on 15 June 1937. The railway would continue east from Diyarbakƒ±r to Van and to the Iranian border at Kapƒ±k√∂y. Construction began shortly after and the railway reached Kurtalan in 1940. Due to the mountainous terrain between Kurtalan and Tatvan, the route was changed and its western starting became Elazƒ±ƒü. From Elazƒ±ƒü the railway would be built to Tatvan, via Mu≈ü, reaching Tuƒü in 1964. A train ferry was established as a temporary means of transport between Tuƒü and Van, as a bypass of Lake Van was planned. In the 1960s, Turkey and Iran came to an agreement to construct a railway from Van to Sharafkhaneh. The Van-Razi segment opened in 1971, while the Razi-Sharafkhaneh segment opened in 1977. Operations The railway is used primarily for freight rail, although the Iranian Railways operates passenger trains between Salmas and Sufian. The last passenger rail service in Turkey was suspended in July 2015, due to safety concerns regarding the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict. Prior to suspension of passenger rail, the Trans- Asian Express used the railway between 2001 and 2015 on its journey from Istanbul, later Ankara, to Tehran. Other international trains were from Van to Tabriz and Damascus to Tehran. The latter was cancelled after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. A daily regional train also operated between Van and √ñzalp until 2015. The line is used mostly for through-traffic since freight rail facilities are minimal. The largest railyard along the route is in Van, adjacent to the city's railway station. Other small yards/sidings are located at Kapƒ±k√∂y and Razi.

Not only conserving the excellence of OCT, doppler optical coherence tomography also combines the doppler effect principle as a whole, which result in tomographic images with high resolution.W. Drexler, J. Fujimoto, Optical Coherence Tomography: Technology and Applications, p. 621-651, (2008)  History  Due to the recognized significance of noninvasive techniques of imaging in the medical field, especially for imaging in vivo blood flow, OCT has become a popular research topic recently. Not only conserving the excellence of OCT, Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography also combines the Doppler effect principle as a whole, which results in tomographic images with high resolution with static and moving constituents.Z. Chen, T.E. Milner, S. Srinivas, X.J. Wang, A. Malekafzali, M.J.C. van Gemert, J.S. Nelson, Opt. Lett. 22, 1119 (1997) In 1991, the first use of coherence gating to localized flow velocity was reported. The author of that article measured the 1-dimensional velocity of the flow of particles, which blazed away in coherence gating measurements. Scientists continue to find ways to measure 2-dimensional velocity, and the first result was reported in 1997, where it reported using spectrogram in doing in vivo DOCT.Z. Chen, T.E. Milner, D. Dave, J.S. Nelson, Opt. Lett. 22, 64 (1997) The same disadvantages occur when using the spectrogram method to do in vivo tissue structure and flow velocity imaging, as spectral-domain OCT is limited to fast imaging. Phase-resolved Doppler OCT, based around the invention of Fourier-Domain OCT, was invented to overcome these limitations. There are two types of Doppler OCT: Time domain Doppler OCT and Fourier Domain Doppler OCT. The basic principle of Phase-resolved Doppler OCT uses the phase change between sequential A-line scans for velocity image reconstruction. Using this principle, scanning speed is prominently increased. While decoupling the spatial resolution and velocity sensitivity in flow images, again it increases imaging speed. This improvement shows prominent increase in the scanning speed and sensitivity, which makes it possible to image in vivo tissue microcirculation in human skin.Y. Zhao, Z. Chen, C. Saxer, Q. Shen, S. Xiang, J.F. de Boer, J.S. Nelson, Opt.Lett. 25, 1358 (2000) Because of its exceptionally high spatial resolution and velocity sensitivity, Doppler OCT has its own position in the field of biomedical research and clinical medicine. Principles of Doppler OCT Optical coherence tomogram of a fingertip. It is possible to observe the sweat glands, having \\"corkscrew appearance\\" Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography is an extension of OCT, where it combines the Doppler effect principle to achieve high resolution tomographic images in biological tissues. And because of its high resolution and velocity sensitivity, there are many applications in the medical field. The basic phenomenon of Doppler OCT can be explained below. Light is emitted from the instrument's light source, and enters the medium. Light hits the moving particles and is backscattered from the sample. Then the light interferes with the light in the reference beam, causing a Doppler frequency shift F_D in the interference fringe: : F _D left ( v right ) = left [ left ( frac{1}{2 pi } right ) right] cdot ( v ) (k_o-k_i) qquad quad (1) where k_i and k_o are wave vectors of incident and out scattered light, and v is the velocity of the moving particle the instrument is detecting. Doppler OCT measures the light backscattered from the sample medium. Defining the angle between the particle flow and the incident light beam is Œ∏, the Doppler shift is then simplified to : F_D left ( theta right ) = left [ left ( frac{ 2 V cos theta }{ lambda } right ) right] qquad quad (2) where lambda_0 is the wavelength of the light source. The instrumentation system of Doppler OCT is an extension of the system of OCT. It also uses a fiber optic Michelson interferometer with a broadband light as a source. The main difference is what happens in the signal processing. After the light emitting from the broadband light source, the light goes through a 2,2 fiber coupler, which split the light equally and separately into the reference and samples arms. The light that goes through the sample arms enters the sample medium and backscattered. At the same time, the light in the reference arm is reflected back from the mirror and couples with the light in the sample arm. The spectral domain fringe signal, P_{ODT} is given by : F _{ODT} left ( u right ) = 2S_0 left ( u right ) K_r left ( u right ) K_s left ( u right ) cos[2 pi u (( Delta + 2n V_zt)/c+ tau )] qquad quad (3) The corresponding time domain signal, T_{ODT}, is given by : T _{ODT} left ( tau right ) = 2 int S_0 left ( u right ) K_r left ( u right ) K_s left ( u right ) cos[2 pi u (( Delta + 2n V_zt)/c+ tau )] ,d u. qquad quad (4) Fourier Transform relations between the time domain signals and spectral domain signals are shown in the equations above, which correspond to the two types of OCT. As a result, the time domain method and the Fourier domain method can both achieve high-resolutions. Time Domain Doppler OCT Based on Spectrogram Method Time domain Doppler OCT uses the spectrogram method to create the image. When the spectrum changes with time, it is defined as Spectrogram. The power spectrum represents the power of signal at certain frequencies, which can be used to calculate the spectrogram. The short-time fast Fourier transformation (STFFT) is used to calculate the power spectrum. : T _{ODT} left ( tau right ) = (STFFT(f_m, tau _{ODT}))^2 qquad quad (5) where f_m is the various frequency. Fluid flow velocity can be calculated as: : V _{ODT} left ( i right) = frac{ lambda _0 f_D}{ 2ncos theta} = frac{ lambda _0 (f_c - f_o)}{ 2ncos theta} qquad quad (6) where f_{D} is the Doppler frequency shift, f_{0} is the carrier frequency, f_{c} is the centroid frequency and Œ∏ is the angle between ki and v. When dealing with high speed imaging, due to many factors, the velocity sensitivity is unsatisfied. When the velocity resolution is increased, imaging speed and spatial resolution are decreased. As a result, the spectrogram method cannot satisfy both high imaging speed and high velocity sensitivity. Phase-Resolved Doppler OCT Method In each scan, the phase would be different. Phase-resolved Doppler OCT uses this phase change to develop flow velocity images, which can obtain both high imaging speed, high velocity sensitivity, and high spatial resolution. By calculating the phase change, the Doppler frequency shift f_{n} can be determined: : f_n = frac{Delta Phi }{2 pi T} qquad quad (7) The standard deviation of the Doppler spectrum is as follow: : sigma ^2= frac{int (f-f_D)^2 (P left(fright))df}{int(P left(fright))df }qquad quad (8) where P(f) is the Doppler power spectrum and f_{D} is the centroid value of the Doppler frequency shift. Changing flow velocity impacts the value of the standard deviation. When the difference in flow velocity becomes larger, the Doppler frequency spectrum becomes wider. As a result, the standard deviation becomes larger.  Fourier domain phase-resolved doppler OCT method Fourier domain OCT measures interference fringes in the spectral domain.

He was an influential American artist, greatly known for his oil painting and printmaking. He immigrated to the United States, specifically Seattle, Washington in 1906 and studied law for a brief period. He then moved to San Francisco in 1919 where he began submitting his drawings and cartoons to several California newspapers as well as Japanese publications. That same year, Hibi enrolled at the. California School of Fine Arts. He eventually worked as a staff member, working in multiple capacities that included: gardening, custodian, sales clerk and as a teaching assistant, offering demonstrations on batik processes, and several other technical artistic skills, he offered demonstrations on the batik process. Hibi's art work was heavily influenced by Paul C√©zanne's style of art, where he uses plains of color follow by small brush strokes to slowly form complex fields. Hibi participated in several group exhibitions in Northern California well throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He was one of the several founders of the East West Art Society. He helped to arrange the group's exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1922, and the Amateur and Professional Artist Society in 1927. In 1930, Hibi married Hisako Shimizu, an artist and fellow alumni from the California School of Fine Arts. They had two children and raised them in Hayward, California. In Hayward, Hibi began a Japanese-language school. During World War II, Hibi and his family was held in the Topaz internment camp in Utah. In 1937, he had a solo show in which he presented ninety works. He was included in numerous group exhibitions at this time, in venues across California such as the California State Fair, Sacramento (1938), the San Francisco Museum of Art (1939, 1940), and even at the Oakland Art Gallery (1943), while still incarcerated in a World War II concentration camp. In 1943, still living in the internment camp. Hibi painted the Untitled (Winter Internment Scene) where he showcases the brutal winter at the internment camp in Topaz. Even till this day, the painting stands up with its uses of stunning palette of gray and violet colors with hints of jewel-like greens. Hibi died on June 30, 1947 of cancer.

It has the dimensions of 96 x 96 inches. This contemporary piece is part of a collection Flack compiled titled Vanitas. It focuses heavily on an intensely colored, realistic presentation, symbolism dating back to historical work, formal sources, and historical context. The work is in the collection of the University of Arizona Museum of Art. Formal Aspects An opened book page with a photograph of the icon Marilyn Monroe is the focal point of Flack‚Äôs piece. This is one of the few objects without intense coloration, however the high contrast of black and white unifies it with the surrounding. Most shapes in the piece are curved and rounded, however a sepia- toned, squared photograph lies on top of the text of the book. Unlike the grown woman illustrated on the page, two children are shown in this photo. Symbolism Josephine Withers describes Flack‚Äôs attention to precise details: ‚ÄúIf these objects, which are an intimate part of her own life, seem rich, sensuous, and precious, it is because Flack herself has invested them with those qualities.‚ÄùWithers, \\"Monumental Still Lives.\\" 526 The objects surrounding Marilyn include a rose, fruit which is both whole and cut, a calendar, an hourglass, a pocket watch, a drinking glass, pearls, paint pots, a mirror, a candle, cosmetics, a photograph, and wrinkled cloth, which the objects rest upon. These objects in nature and color come across as feminine, reflecting Marilyn‚Äôs public persona.Hauser, \\"Audrey Flack's Still Lives: Between Femininity and Feminism.,‚Äù 26 Many of the objects are reflective and Flack made a point to include visible shine on them. Two mirrors are shown, emphasizing this ‚Äì one of which reflects Marilyn‚Äôs face. Similar Work A piece which Flack may have drawn inspiration from is David Bailly‚Äôs Vanitas Still Life with Portrait of a Young Painter. Like Flack‚Äôs work, Bailly incorporates symbols such as flowers, portraits, candles, books, hourglasses, glasses, and jewelry. Iconography Flack seemed to identify with the ideals of feminine behavior and presence, which Marilyn Monroe was expected to possess.Fine, ‚ÄúOne Point Perspective,‚Äù 2. The symbols of beauty are more obvious as they take the form of cosmetics and flowers. Likewise, the pocket watch, hourglass, and calendar refer to the passage of time straight- forwardly. The fruit and flowers also symbolize time in that they will decompose. The discolored photograph pictured is outdated compared to its surroundings, which implies time passage as well.

The Sasanians successfully defended the city and defeated the Roman force. In line with \\"Justinianic model\\", the Romans mobilized garrisoned engineers for the attack, and ordered them to perform a \\"very complex siege\\". The reason behind the Roman rout at Nisibis was reportedly due to quarreling amongst the Roman officers. According to the Syriac chronicles, however, the Sasanian forces were able to delay the Roman army, allowing them to prepare for extensive defense. An account also cited a failure of intelligence from Arab clients so that the Romans were unaware of the Sasanian army's movement to the Euphrates junction with the Khabur. This army attacked the Romans from the rear. After the siege was lifted, the Sasanians used the Roman trebuchets that were left behind at the successful siege of Dara, later that year. This particular siege lasted six months and the victory gave Khosrow I another important fortress in the eastern Mesopotamia in addition to Nisibis.

After the early death of her husband, the campaigning \\"Auschwitz journalist\\" Thomas Gnielka, she herself became more widely known as a German television journalist.  Life  Ingeborg Euler was born in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was known at that time), her parents' only child. Her upbringing was a secure one apart from the impact on the entire family of her father's traumatic wartime experiences. By the time she enrolled at school, in 1934, they were living in Dresden. In 1937, after only three years at primary school, she moved on to secondary school in the Steglitz quarter of Berlin, then in 1942 passing her school final exams (abitur) as a pupil at the secondary school in Zossen, just outside Berlin. At school she participated in drama, playing a lead male role ‚Äì that of Ferdinand in Schiller's play, Kabale und Liebe (\\"Intrigue and Love\\") in a wartime production by the school's drama society. War ended in May 1945. The country faced a desperate shortage of working age population, notably among teachers, and under the \\"Neulehrer\\" (literally: \\"new teacher\\") scheme imposed by the military administration, she embarked on a career as a \\"new teacher\\" at a school in Brusendorf without needing to train and qualify in the way that would have been required in more normal times. However, in 1946 she enrolled at Berlin University (subsequently known as \\"The Humboldt\\") where she was the youngest female student of her year group at the philosophy faculty. After the war the western two-thirds of Germany had been divided into four large military occupation zones. Berlin had been subdivided into four separate occupation zones. The eastern part of the city, incorporating the university, was part of the Soviet occupation zone. As a student Inge Euler also pursued her active interest in stage work, appearing alongside Ursula Herking and Jo Herbst in student cabaret shows. In November 1947 an Arts Commission (\\"Kommission des Kulturbundes\\") initiative was publicised in newspapers aimed at young people, intended to identify new writers from the younger generation who had not, till that point, had their work published. In February 1948 Ingeborg Euler was one of the young authors \\"discovered\\" in the followup. Her piece \\"Zwischen heut und morgen\\" (\\"Between today and tomorrow\\") appeared in the youth magazine Horizont. The next year her short story \\"I wanted to go to the Wannsee\\" (\\"Ich wollte nach Wannsee fahren\\") had received a special commendation from the (East) German Arts League (\\"Kulturbund der DDR\\") and appeared in the July edition of the news magazine \\"Ost und West\\". (The Soviet occupation zone was relaunched, formally in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany).) Directly after the war the full political and practical implications of the military division of Berlin were not immediately apparent, least of all to the city's traumatised residents, preoccupied with simply staying alive. People could move freely between the western enclaves and the eastern half of the city, administered by the Soviet Union, until well into the 1950s. In 1948 Ingeborg Euler learned for herself that there were differences, however. As early as April 1946 she had placed herself on record as an advocate of open free speech. Writing a review in Horizont about a meeting at the local cinema in Rangsdorf, held in anticipation of the first democratic local elections since 1933, she urged her young readers, who had grown up till that point learning the advisability of remaining \\"silent\\" on political matters, to speak out: \\"How can we seek to built a democratic state if we dare not say what we think?\\" (\\"Wie wollen wir uns denn einen demokratischen Staat aufbauen, wenn wir nicht einmal wagen, unsere Meinung zu sagen?\\"). With the twelve Nazi years having come to an end, it was a time of hope. During the next couple of years the cinema became a regular meeting point for a group of young people who founded a theatre group, on the initiative of the local Soviet commander: Ingeborg Euler became a star of this improvised local stage. True to her belief in sharing her views, in 1948 Ingeborg Euler addressed a letter to the allied military commanders controlling Berlin. She was promptly arrested and detained in a Soviet administered jail in East Berlin. Here she was accused of espionage. It was only through the energetic persistence of her mother, who was able to call upon backing from prominent celebrities in good standing with the Soviet authorities, including Johannes R. Becher, Gustav von Wangenheim and G√ºnther Weisenborn, that after eleven days she was released and unceremoniously flown out of the city, ending up in Frankfurt am Main, which was in the western part of occupied Germany and a principal administrative base for the United States occupation zone. She quickly moved on to Munich, also in the American zone, which is where she now built a new life. It was in Munich that she met Thomas Gnielka. He set her lyrics to music and accompanied her on the piano when she appeared as a young cabaret artiste in the Simpl quarter of Munich, as often as not performing together in exchange for no more than a hot dinner. The two of them were married towards the end of 1949. Between 1950 and 1962 the marriage produced five recorded children. It was therefore as a family of seven that in 1963 they relocated to the Wiesbaden area in connection with Thomas Gnielka's work. In October 1949 Euler was introduced to the meetings of Group 47, a prominent circle of writers organised by (and around) Hans Werner Richter. The first meeting in which she participated was held in the extreme south of Upper Bavaria at Utting on the shores of the Ammersee (lake). At the meeting she presented her Wannsee text (\\"Ich wollte nach Wannsee fahren\\") and her poem \\"Wer war Andreas?\\" (\\"Who was Andreas?\\"), a literary tribute to her fallen childhood sweetheart. In 1956 she published her light hearted \\"K√ºchengeschichten\\" (\\"Rales from the kitchen\\"). Euler would later describe 1956 and the years immediately following it as a \\"very intensive, but also political time\\" (\\"sehr intensive, aber auch politische Zeit \\") for them both. By this time Gnielka had also accepted the invitation, in 1952, to join Group 47. Insa Wilke: Krieg statt Kinderstube. Rezension, in: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 3 December 2014, p. 14 He was working during this time as a regional editor on the Wiesbadener Kurier (newspaper), till switching to an equivalent post on the Frankfurter Rundschau in February 1957. In 1960 he became a freelance investigative journalist. In 1963 he embarked on the investigation for which he would become well known across Germany, unearthing important files for what became known as the second Auschwitz trial, which involved the arrest of the former camp commander, Richard Baer. Before and during the trial, which opened on 20 December 1963, Gnielka was able to testify regularly on the dreadful atrocities committed.Claudia Michels: Eine Frankfurter Heldengeschichte, Frankfurter Rundschau, 12 October 2013, p. 24f However, he was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1963, and in 1965, before being able to complete his contribution to the court proceedings, he died. During the early 1960s she was commissioned to produce several documentaries for Hessischer Rundfunk, the Frankfurt-based broadcaster on contemporary history themes, including a major project on the Second World War and another on workplace accidents in industry. After she was widowed Ingeborg Euler, with her five children now aged between 3 and 15, moved from Wiesbaden to Frankfurt am Main. Both to recover from the shock of her bereavement and to finance the family she now plunged into a full-time career as a television journalist with Hessischer Rundfunk. She was well supported in combining her family and professional lives by her own mother who had been widowed just six months earlier. In 1969 she switched to ZDF. The focus of her work, again, was on documentaries including the memorably titled \\"Beton ist fantastisch\\" (\\"Concrete is fantastic\\") and features on artist-celebrities. She worked on the broadcaster's long-running arts magazine series Aspekte. Her so-called \\"Bamberg films\\" were notably successful: her film \\"Was soll aus Bamberg werden?\\" (\\"What should become of Bamberg?\\") won a prize for the ZDF arts magazine Aspekte. In 1973 the family moved again, this time to West Berlin. Here, from 1977 until the mid 1980s Ingeborg Eurler produced the series \\"Berlinische Berichte\\", a series of films comprising half-hour \\"Berlin portraits\\" of different quarters and suburbs of the city, and other films for the ZDF which were transmitted during peak viewing times during the early evenings. In addition to these, she was particularly proud of a \\"science fiction\\" film, \\"Radfahrerstadt\\" (\\"Cyclists' city\\") which dealt with cycling as a serious means of transport. Other topics that she tackled included the city's architecture and more television portraits of celebrity artists such as , Matthias Koeppel, Joachim Schmettau and , along with Christa and . In 1980 Euler acquired an old workshop, which became a second home, in Eschwege (not far from Kassel). This provided space for her to explore her creativity as a painter and sculptor. Around 1985 she retired from her media career to devote more time to her own artistic ambitions and to her family. At a reunion in 1992 she met up with Alfred Hintze, a classmate half a century early when they were at school together in Zossen. Like her, he was widowed, and their relationship moved on to the point at which they moved together to a new home in Rangsdorf, just outside Berlin on its south side. Hintze retained his Berlin apartment and they were therefore able to keep in touch with city life and became frequent visitors to the university where they were able to attend lectures on subjects that interested them. Towards the end of her life Ingeborg Euler was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. She died in Berlin well supported by her family. By the time she died she had not merely produced five children, but also acquired eight grand children and two great grand children.

He is the co-founder and current President and COO of Republic Records. Over the course of his career, he had been involved with numerous acts including 3 Doors Down, Ariana Grande, Godsmack, Jack Johnson, Julia Michaels, The Naked and Famous, Blue October, Post Malone, Phantogram and numerous others. He is the brother of fellow Republic co-founder and executive, Monte Lipman. Early life and education Avery Lipman grew up partially in Montclair, New Jersey. He attended Montclair High School where he played on the school's football and baseball teams and graduated in 1984. He then attended the University at Albany where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1988. Career One of Lipman's first jobs after college was as Clive Davis' assistant at Arista Records. He parlayed that into a job at Sony Music International as the director of business administration in 1991. In 1995, he and his older brother, Monte Lipman, founded the independent label, Republic Records. The first act signed by the Lipmans was Bloodhound Gang whose record \\"Fire Water Burn\\" was picked up by the Los Angeles radio station, KROQ. The brothers followed that by signing Chumbawamba to Republic after listening to the band's album Tubthumper just one time. That album sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It was also the first Republic album to be distributed by Universal Records after the Lipmans signed a joint venture to make Republic an imprint of Universal. Both the Lipmans have been associated with Universal Music in one way or another since that point. Other acts Lipman helped sign in Republic's early years included 3 Doors Down, Godsmack, Blue October, and numerous others. In January 2000, Universal Music Group outright acquired Republic Records. As a result, Lipman was named the senior vice president of Republic after having been the label's general manager for several years. In January 2001, he was named the President of Republic Records. In 2006, corporate restructuring saw Universal Records merge with Republic, creating Universal Republic Records. Lipman became a senior vice president of the new combined label. In January 2008, Lipman was named co-president and COO of Universal Republic with his brother Monte (who also held the title of CEO). At the time, the label's acts included Amy Winehouse, Jack Johnson, Blue October, Colbie Caillat, Hinder, Damian Marley, India Arie, and others. In the ensuing years, Lipman helped foster joint ventures with Big Machine Records and Cash Money Records (among others) to bring artists like Taylor Swift, The Band Perry, Lil Wayne, Drake, and Nicki Minaj under the Republic fold. In February 2013, Universal Music Group signed both Avery and Monte Lipman to long-term contracts, giving Avery the title of sole president and COO of Republic. By that point, the label's roster had expanded to include The Weeknd, Gotye, and PSY, among others. The label officially returned to its original Republic moniker around that time. Ariana Grande was signed to the label later that year. The success of releases from Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Florence + the Machine, and others led to Republic being the number one label in market share in 2014. The following year, it was Billboard's \\"Top Label,\\" \\"Top Hot 100 Label,\\" and \\"Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Label,\\" among other plaudits. In 2017, Republic had two of Billboards top 10 most-streamed songs in \\"Despacito\\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and \\"Congratulations\\" by Post Malone. In November 2018, Lipman helped officially bring Taylor Swift to Republic. Swift had previously released music through a partnership with Republic and Big Machine Records. Philanthropy Lipman is involved in numerous philanthropic endeavors. He sits on the board of the T.J. Martell Foundation, which honored him and his brother with the Humanitarian of the Year Award in 2010. He and his brother were collectively honored as the \\"Music Visionaries of the Year\\" by the UJA- Federation of New York for their contributions to the organization. In 2017, Lipman was given the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's \\"Spirit of Hope Award\\" for his contributions to that organization. In 2018, Lipman was among four honorees at the Angel Ball, a fundraising event for Gabrielle's Angel Foundation for Cancer Research. Lipman has also noted that he is involved with the organization, Hope for Heroism, which assists Israeli soldiers who were wounded in combat.

Career  After studying music at the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon, he was successively oboe-solo at the Orchestre national de Lyon and the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra. He led a brilliant career as a chamber musician and orchestral musician, before devoting himself fully to conducting. Passionate about conducting orchestras and opera, it was with the strongest encouragement from Armin Jordan, of whom he was assistant, and Franz Welser-M√∂st, that his career as conductor began in 2001 with Lucio Silla by Mozart in Lausanne and Caen. Since then, Nicolas Chalvin has performed in concert at the head of prestigious orchestras in a repertoire ranging from early classics (Mozart, Haydn) to the latest contemporary works. He has been invited in particular by the Lausanne Opera chamber orchestra, the Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg, the , the Orchestre symphonique de Mulhouse, the , the , the Op√©ra national de Lorraine orchestra, the orchestre national de Lyon, the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra, the Portuguese Symphony Orchestra and the Wurtemberg philharmonic orchestra. Since September 2009, he has been music director of the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie.  Direction and development of a chamber orchestra  The work accomplished with the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie was a new stage in his career. As permanent musical director, he undertook the development of this Haydn type formation. With collaborations that also allowed to expand the training during certain programs (particularly with the Orchestre de chambre de Gen√®ve), he developed the repertoire, new collaborations of artists and encouraged new creations or commissions for the orchestra, an institution that was also very active in the field of mediation and cultural transmission. In 2011, two new discographic releases and a tour in Russia were representative of the orchestra's new dynamism.  Collaborations around new creations  The Orchestre des Pays de Savoie was the occasion for new creations on stage and on record. Nevertheless, the defence of new or unpublished operatic works is a mark of his career. In particular, he directed a new production of Niob√© et M√©d√©e by Pascal Dusapin and Julie by Philippe Boesmans. On disc, he delivered the first recordings of the Sophie ArnouldSophie Arnould on Forum op√©ra opera by Gabriel Piern√© (Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra, label Timpani, nominated at the BBC Awards 2008 and Aucassin et Nicolette by Paul Le Flem with Bernard T√©tu and the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie (label Timpani, 2011).  Activity in the operatic field  After his debut in Lausanne ( Lucio Silla), commitments immediately followed at the Op√©ra de Lausanne, for V√©ronique by Messager and the Z√ºrich Opera House for the La Belle Vie ballet then the following year Daphnis et Chlo√© by Ravel, with choreographies by Heinz Spoerli. Since then, Nicolas Chalvin has performed in many opera houses, directing works that bear witness to great curiosity and were as many opportunities to work with the greatest directors, such as Matthew Jocelyn, Alain Garichot, Stephan Gr√∂gler, , J√©r√¥me Savary, Daniel Slater, Jean-Louis Martinoty, Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier: Don Pasquale by Donizetti, Orfeo ed Euridice by Gluck, Reigen by Philippe Boesmans, La vie parisienne by Offenbach, Carmen by Bizet at the Op√©ra de Lausanne, The Nose by Shostakovitch, The Rake's Progress by Stravinsky at Nantes-Angers Op√©ra, Maria Stuarda, L'elisir d'amore, Don Pasquale by Donizetti, L'italiana in Algeri by Rossini, A Midsummer Night's Dream by Benjamin Britten and Eugene On√©guin by Tchaikovski at the Th√©√¢tre de Caen, V√©ronique by Messager in Nancy and Rouen, Dolor√®sDolor√®s ou Le miracle de la femme laide on data.bnf.fr by Andr√© Jolivet and Rita by Donizetti in Rennes, Cos√¨ fan tutte by Mozart at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve, Les Troyens by Berlioz at the Tiroler Landestheater of Innsbruck. Chalvin is very attached to collaborations with lyrical artists, and also attaches great importance to the programming of concerts that integrate lyrical pieces in recital, within the season of the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie, but also by regularly conducting concerts such as the final concert of the competition for lyric art of Clermont Ferrand.

The Rye Fire burned a total of , before it was fully contained on December 12. The fire destroyed six buildings, including minor structures located at the Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center. Events The Rye Fire, was reported as a small brush fire at 9:32 AM PST on December 5, 2017, on Rye Canyon Loop in Santa Clarita, California. The fire was named for Rye Canyon Loop where it originated. That day, Highway 5 was closed in both directions and Rye Canyon Loop was evacuated, as well as the entire community of Westridge, totaling 1,300 homes. Rancho Pico Junior High and West Ranch High schools in the William S. Hart Union High School District were evacuated to College of the Canyons and Saugus Union School District evacuated West Creek Academy. Valencia High School was also evacuated. The fire interrupted production of television programs S.W.A.T. and Westworld. Electricity was also interrupted for over 2,000 customers. School resumed on Wednesday, December 6, after evacuation orders for the Westridge Valencia neighborhood were lifted the evening of December 5. However, Simi Valley Unified School District closed all schools on Wednesday due to poor air quality. The fire continued to grow and by December 7 one structure had been destroyed and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has expressed concern about strong offshore winds which could cause the fire to grow. Power went out for over 8,880 customers. One firefighter was injured and airlifted to a burn center. Overnight, no fire growth was observed by Cal Fire and firefighters continued to mop up the fire and maintain perimeters. By the morning of December 8, power had been restored to all customers in the area. On December 9, firefighters continued to mop up the area and keep the fire within the perimeter, bolstering containment lines. During an evaluation of the Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center, they discovered that minor structures were damaged or destroyed, bringing the total destroyed buildings to six and damaged structures to three. All evacuation orders were lifted by December 9. The Rye Fire burned , and threatened 5,460 structures. On December 12, the Rye Fire was fully contained, with no further increases in size. At its height, over 900 fire personnel fought the Rye Fire. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

The game is part of the Bridge Constructor series, and incorporates elements of Valve's Portal series, taking place in Aperture Laboratories. The game was released on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows in December 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2018. By August 2018, the game had sold over 500,000 copies. Gameplay Bridge Constructor Portal is an engineering simulation and puzzle video game set in the universe of the Portal series. Players are tasked with designing and constructing bridges to get one or more trucks from one location to another at Aperture Laboratories under the supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The game merges elements from the Bridge Constructor series and Portal series. Players are tasked with building bridges using struts (which can be converted to road segments) and cables, anchored to pre-designated fixed points on the level's walls. The limited availability of fixed points may require the player to construct self- supporting bridges. These bridges must be able to withstand their own weight, as well as the trucks and any force they impart when landing on the bridge. Elements from Portal require the player to guide the trucks across the bridges, navigate through portals, cross over buttons to open doors or other actions, avoid coming in sight of sentry turrets or in contact with deadly fluid or laser fields, and use other Portal gameplay elements like propulsion and repulsion gels and launching pads. Players can switch between construction mode, test mode, and vehicle mode to visualize their solution. Test mode simulates the physics of the level to see how the bridge components stand up under their own weight. Vehicle mode sends one or more trucks through the player's solution. During either of these, the game shows any struts or cables that are under stress (highlighted in red). If they exceed their stress limit, they will break and cause the bridge to collapse. If the player designs a bridge to successfully allow one vehicle to pass, they can then try to send a convoy of vehicles through the course. These vehicles are released one at a time at regular intervals, and tests to see if the bridge components stand up to repeated stress or if the crossing of paths causes any collisions. There is no building limit for a level, but each bridge component placed in a solution has a monetary value, and the player is challenged separately to keep the total monetary value as low as possible. The player clears a puzzle by getting one vehicle across, but is rated higher by getting all of the vehicles in a convoy through the course without harm. Development and release Bridge Constructor Portal is developed by ClockStone and published by Headup Games. The two studios worked throughout 2017 on a successor to their 2011 video game Bridge Constructor. They partnered with Valve who created and own the Portal series to help with gameplay elements from Portal, art assets, and lore from the Portal series. This includes bringing Ellen McLain to voice GLaDOS for the game. The game was announced on December 6, 2017. It was released on December 20, 2017, for Android and iOS mobile devices, and for Linux, macOS and Windows-based personal computers. The game was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on February 28, 2018. The Xbox One and Windows 10 versions are shared between versions as part of Xbox Play Anywhere. This includes sharing not only the save file between versions, but the graphic settings from the Windows 10 version. Reception Bridge Constructor Portal received \\"generally favorable\\" reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN reviewer TJ Hafer found the game to be simple and intuitive while still managing to offer and fulfilling level of depth and challenge. He was slightly disappointed that the portals remained static in the levels and that the game featured no puzzles that involved placing portals. Although he did not think the humor was on par with previous Portal games, he noted that the aesthetics and sound design were reminiscent of those earlier titles. Destructoid writer Jordan Devore agreed that the game was straightforward and that constructing structures was easy to carry out. He found the pacing of the game to be good during the first half but thought it had exhausted introducing new mechanics by the later half, opting to focus on greater complexity and more variables in the puzzles. The game was nominated for \\"Puzzle\\" at the 2018 Webby Awards. By August 2018, the game had sold over 500,000 copies.

Her family descended from John Gallup who immigrated with the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Her father was an attorney and Lillian was the second child, and daughter in the family. On 4 September 1889, Gallup married Charles N. Haskell, an attorney practicing in Ottawa and recent widower, who had three children, Norman, Murray, and Lucie. The couple had their first child Frances in 1890, followed by Charles Joseph in 1891, and Jane in 1894. During the time in Ohio, Charles became involved in railroad work and was approached about the possibility of acquiring a line from Fayetteville, Arkansas, to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Career In 1901, the family moved to Muskogee, Indian Territory, where Charles became involved in the city's development and took part in both the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention and the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. During the convention, Haskell supported her husband's anti-suffragist stance, believing that political differences would cause discord in the family. In 1907 Charles was elected as the first governor of the State of Oklahoma. With his election, Haskell became the inaugural First Lady of Oklahoma. Haskell's immediate task as First Lady was to design a national flag to include the new state. She organized the Betsy Ross Association in Guthrie. The association had ninety-two members from across the state who created the flag. Each woman sewed a single star on the \\"field of blue\\", adding forty-six stars to each side of the banner. The flag was flown from the mast at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th in 1908, announcing the state as the 46th star in the national flag. Throughout Charles' tenure as governor, she accompanied him on business meetings, and political ventures. As part of her official duties, she was made president of the Association of Mothers, serving a four year term.

The impacts of such a tightly controlled and regulated economy are widespread and impact currency value, international investment and the standard of living. As a result of the competitive advantage experienced by the military over private enterprise, non-military affiliated companies experience an economic handicap. As military affiliated corporations are not required to pay taxes, the VAT and import taxes experienced by civilian organisations further increases the difficulty of operating commercially independent of the Armed Forces.‚ÄúBeyond the Start-up Nation.‚Äù The Economist, The Economist Newspaper, 1 Jan. 2011, www.economist.com/node/17796932.  Construction and infrastructure  Since the Arab Spring in 2011 hundreds of large infrastructure projects have been channelled through the Egyptian Armed Forces Engineering Authority, providing large revenues to the military. While official documentation of the profits from these projects are generally not made public, many billions of Egyptian pounds in revenue have been accumulated. Concerns about the cost-benefit calculations for these major construction projects have raised questions over the military's intervention in the economy. It has been argued that the resources allocated to these projects can be used more efficiently.Abu-Bader, Suleiman, and Aamer S. Abu-Qarn. \\"Government expenditures, military spending and economic growth: causality evidence from Egypt, Israel, and Syria.\\" Journal of Policy Modeling 25.6 (2003): 567‚Äì583. = Suez Canal expansion project = Before and after Suez Canal expansion The Suez Canal expansion was Egypt's largest infrastructure project in recent years. It involved creating a new shipping lane in the canal and deepening the existing channel to enable vessels to pass in both directions simultaneously. The anticipated financial outcomes of this project have not yet been released. President Sisi has invested more than $8 bn USD in an expansion of the Suez Canal in an attempt to increase the Canal's revenue by decreasing waiting times for vessels passing through it. The anticipated level of revenue has not been met. One of the main reasons for this sluggish growth in revenues can be traced to the fact that global trade has still not recovered from the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Lieutenant General Mohab Mamish, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said that the canal's annual revenue would surpass $13 billion by 2023. However, revenue has barely increased since the opening of the second lane and in some periods it decreased.Samir, Mohamed. ‚ÄúSuez Canal Revenues Decline in Wake of Sluggish Global Trade.‚Äù Daily News Egypt, 22 Feb. 2017, dailynewsegypt.com/2017/02/22/suez-canal-revenues-decline-wake-sluggish- global-trade/. Critics suggest that Sisi's regime should have foreseen this, given that the Canal was not working at full capacity before the expansion. Government officials and President Sisi assert that revenue has increased since the expansion, without providing detailed data. It has been argued that given Egypt's economic situation resources should be allocated with care as misallocation may have long lasting negative impacts. Another reason for the low revenues is the marketing model that the government adopted to promote the new Suez Canal. Large amounts of money were allocated for marketing, but instead of using major international companies to manage the marketing, money was spent in inefficient ways such as in a giant billboard in New York.Pkhoury. ‚ÄúNew Suez Canal Income Slowly Sinking.‚Äù Al-Monitor, 11 Sept. 2017, www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/09/egypt-new-suez-canal- revenues-drop-trade-giant-project.html. = New capital of Egypt project = The military is also involved in the government plan to create a new capital to replace Cairo by 2022. The New Administrative Capital for Urban Development is a company formed by the Egyptian government to oversee the construction of the new capital.Werr, Patrick. ‚ÄúAspiring Plans for New Capital City Put Egypt‚Äôs Resources to the Test.‚Äù The National, The National, 8 Nov. 2017, www.thenational.ae/business/economy/aspiring-plans-for-new-capital-city-put- egypt-s-resources-to-the-test-1.674116. The Egyptian military owns 51 percent of this company, while the remaining 49 percent is vested in the state-owned New Urban Communities Authority. Most of the construction costs will be covered by the New Administrative Capital for Urban Development, which will then either sell or rent the developed sites to other parties making it a profitable venture for the Egyptian Military. During the first phase, 3,500 acres of land, for residential, commercial, and administrative uses, were sold to real estate companies. Concerns about the transparency of this process have been raised.Darwish, Mohamed. ‚ÄúAdministrative Capital Allocates 3,500 Acres for Real Estate Companies.‚Äù Https://Dailynewsegypt.com/2017/11/26/Administrative-Capital- Allocates-3500-Acres-Real-Estate-Companies/, Dailynewsegypt, 26 Nov. 2017, dailynewsegypt.com/2017/11/26/administrative-capital-allocates-3500-acres- real-estate-companies/. The new capital is planned to cover over 490 square kilometres. However, it will only absorb 6.5 million people by the time the final phase is complete which will leave the population of Cairo at approximately 18 million, given a 2 percent growth rate, by the year 2027. Therefore, most of Cairo's population will remain in Cairo, where resources for maintenance and repairs to the infrastructure are lacking. It has been suggested that available resources are likely to be preferentially deployed to the infrastructure needs of the new capital. The new capital will house a zoo, a wildlife park, an aquarium, an arboretum and botanical gardens, and so require a large quantity of water. The Government has stated that two major pipelines will connect the Nile to the new capital and that at some point a third line will provide desalinated water from the Red Sea. Cairo has suffered from multiple power outages over the past few years and the government has struggled to meet demand. This has raised concerns that the government will prioritise the new capital leaving Cairo's inhabitants with the unsolved issue of power shortages.Roll, Stephan and Matthias Sailer. 2015. ‚ÄúBuilt on Sand: Egypt‚Äôs Questionable Strategy for Growth and Development‚Äù.

(2017). Historical Exchange Rates EGY:USD The lack of stability combined with rampant devaluation has made it difficult for the private sector to afford imports of basic goods and services. In addition, instead of providing subsidies to support the private sector, the military tends to centralise production or provide contracts specifically to affiliated companies. This occurred in 1977, when President Sadat organised military provision of bread after cutting subsidies, sparking riots across the country . = Taxation = President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi All companies of the Egyptian Armed Forces are exempt from various state taxes, including income, sales and import taxes. This was extended to property taxes in 2015 by Defense Minister Sedki Sobhi and included military owned supermarkets and hotels. As military recruits are used as cheap labour the cost of production for the military can remain low relative to private enterprise. However, taxes on civilian activities increased in 2016, namely a 13% value added tax on internal trade and various import taxes on hundreds of products of up to 60%. As a result, private enterprises generally have difficulty remaining competitive. = Investment = The manner in which national leaders prioritise domestic investment has flow on effects to broader international investment. Ever since Sisi consolidated power with the Military, the Egyptian economy has attracted greater international investment. Even though freedoms are sacrificed at times, Sisi firmly believes that economic progress is should be prioritised over all other factors, such as some human rights. Sisi's dissent on opposition and centralisation of power proved to increase the value of international investments. Major international corporations such as BP, Coca- Cola and Majid Al Futtaim intend to collectively invest billions of dollars into the Egyptian economy as a result of Sisi's fiscal and economic reforms. Consequently, Egypt's credit-rating has been rising over the past few years.‚ÄúThe Lure of Sisi.‚Äù The Economist, The Economist Newspaper, 16 May 2015, www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21651278-president-has-secured- investment-not-yet-fixed-economy-lure However, the authoritarian policies being implemented by Sisi has other implications for stability and foreign investments in the long run. Sisi's crackdown on opposition might have provided temporary boosts where the economy can benefit from investments, however it has also ‚Äòpushed grievances underground‚Äô. This way, recent attacks in Sinai and scattered bombings in other parts of the country are not a good indicator of long term stability and economic prosperity.  Despotic state  For the past few hundred years Egypt had different regimes in power, each with its own leadership and unique approaches to the issues facing the country. All have followed the despotic state model where the civil society has little say in how the country is run, while a powerful state rules as it sees fit. The dynamics governing the relation between the state and civil society has remained broadly similar over the past few hundred years for Egypt. The army has become so powerful that only the army can scrutinise the army's budget. The parliament elected at the end of 2015 lacks any constitutional authority to control or examine the Army's expenditure It has been argued that during the current period of unrest in the region, the military's increasing intervention within the state is necessary for stability. Therefore, any sort of uncertainty in the Egyptian political sphere might negatively impact the economy.  Protests  Former President of Egypt Mohamed Morsi Numerous protests have occurred in Egypt in an attempt to reduce the degree of military control over the state and associated economy. While these protests have often been successful in changing the political party in power, the high level of military involvement in economic activity generally continues.Acemoglu, Daron, Tarek A.

National Bureau of Economic Research, 2014. = Arab Spring = > In the wake of the Arab Spring, the military was seen as restoring order to > the Middle East‚Äôs largest Arab country. This allowed Egypt to repurpose its > security apparatus, making it the sole arbiter of Egypt‚Äôs economic and > political system at a time when the country was still in transition. The mass protests of the Arab Spring led to the 11February 2011 resignation of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and sparked largescale economic changes. Mubarak's National Democratic Party was replaced temporarily by military rule until June 2012 when Mohamed Morsi was elected on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood. The economic impacts of this transition were extensive and correlated to major changes in military power. The impact can be seen in the Egyptian stock market, where the end of Mubarak's reign saw a 13% drop in the value of stocks connected to the National Democratic Party relative to non- connected stocks over the nine trading days following his fall. In particular, military connected companies experienced major gains during this period since Mubarak's fall was seen by many as the result of a lack of military support.

The holotype, MPC D-102/109, was found in a layer of orange sandstone of the Bayn Dzak Member of the Djadochta Formation, dating from the late Campanian, about seventy-five million years old. It consists of a relatively complete skeleton with skull. In 2017, the fossil was not further prepared. Work by the fossil dealers had at that point generally exposed the left side of the skeleton. The synchrotron revealed that the bones continued into the rock and that the piece was probably not a chimaera, an artificial assembly of bones of disparate species, though the top of the snout had been restored with plaster and some elements had been reattached to the rock by glue. The skeleton is largely articulated and not compressed. It represents a subadult individual, about one year old. The type species Halszkaraptor escuilliei was in 2017 named and described by Andrea Cau, Vincent Beyrand, Dennis F. A. E. Voeten, Vincent Fernandez, Paul Tafforeau, Koen Stein, Rinchen Barsbold, Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar, Philip John Currie, and Pascal Godefroit. The generic name combines a reference to the late Polish paleontologist Halszka Osm√≥lska, who was involved in many expeditions to Mongolia and named the closely related Hulsanpes, with Latin raptor, \\"robber\\". The specific name honours Escuilli√© for having made the specimen available to science. Description Size compared to a human Halszkaraptor was about the size of a mallard duck. The head was about long, the neck , the back and the sacrum . The describing authors indicated some distinguishing traits. Some of these were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The premaxilla, the front snout bone, forms a flattened snout, occupying 32% of the snout length. The premaxilla bears eleven teeth. The jugal bone is rod-shaped and its ascending branch occupies only a tenth of the bar behind the eye socket, not reaching the orbit. The neck is extremely elongated, representing half of the snout-sacrum length. The postzygapophyses, rear joint processes, of the neck vertebrae bear no epipophyses, additional processes on their upper rim. The neck vertebrae have extremely reduced neural spines: on the second to fifth vertebrae these are only low ridges and subsequent neck vertebrae lack them completely. In the second to fifth neck vertebrae the normally paired postzygapophyses have fused into a single lobe- shaped process. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are extremely shortened: at the first three tail vertebrae they are formed like low bumps and subsequent tail vertebrae lack them completely. The chevrons of the tail base are large with a pentagonal profile. The first phalanx of the third finger has 47% of the length of the third metacarpal. Furthermore, a unique combination is present of traits that in themselves are not unique. The external bony nostril is situated behind the main body of the premaxilla, the point where it connects to the front branch of the maxilla. The descending branch of the postorbital bone is rod-shaped. The number of vertebrae of the neck and back totals twenty-two. Only the seventh, eighth and ninth neck vertebrae have pleurocoels, pneumatic depressions on their sides. The transition between the tail base and the middle tail is situated at the seventh to eighth vertebra. The third finger is longer than the second finger. =Skull= Skull of holotype MPC D-102/109 The snout, though elongated, is transversely expanded in front, creating a spoon-shaped profile in top view. It is also flat, and its width is 180% of its height. The top profile in side view is hollow. The expanded area consists of a relatively long premaxilla. This bone is internally excavated by a system of air chambers. From a larger chamber in the rear, neurovascular channels permeate the entire bone, not just the sides as in Neovenator, but the top also. These channels probably housed electro-sensory organs. Each premaxilla bears eleven teeth, a record among the entire Dinosauria. Theropods normally have four premaxillary teeth and the previous record for this group was seven, as found in spinosaurids. In Halskaraptor, the premaxillary teeth are very closely packed, touching each other, and are very elongated, gradually curving to behind. The teeth in the maxilla, estimated in number at twenty to twenty-five, are more robust, curve only at their tips, and are spaced at a larger distance. They are more transversely flattened, with an oval cross-section. The dentary of the lower jaw likewise bears an estimated twenty to twenty-five teeth. The nostrils are relatively retracted. They are also unique for a theropod in being obliquely oriented to the top in front view. Despite the length of the snout, the main opening in the side of the front skull, the antorbital fenestra, is short; shorter than high. The rear skull roof is vaulted. =Postcranial skeleton= Pelvis area of holotype MPC D-102/109 The vertebral column of Halszkaraptor contains ten neck vertebrae, twelve back vertebrae and six sacral vertebrae. The preserved tail vertebrae include the first twenty caudals and a series of six from the middle tail. The neck is very elongated. It equals 290% of the skull length and 150% of the back length. This implies that it represents half of the snout-sacrum length, a value that is the highest for all known Mesozoic paravians. Within the Paraves, only some more recent birds have a proportionally longer neck. Among more basal theropods only some oviraptorosaurs approach this value; even ornithomimosaurs never surpass 40%. The length is not caused by a greater number of vertebrae, as in the Oviraptorosauria, but by an elongation of the individual vertebrae. The sixth cervical vertebra is the longest, being four times longer than tall. The neck vertebrae generally have a simplified structure, as exemplified by the lack of rear epipophyses. Most are not pneumatised by pleurocoels, depressions in which diverticula of air sacs penetrate the bone walls. On the front neck, the neural spines, normally rectangular plates, have been reduced to a low ridge; more to behind they have disappeared. At the first five neck vertebrae, the postzygapophyses have no separating space in between them but are fused into a single lobe. With other basal maniraptoriforms these rear joint processes are sometimes connected by a plate, but in that case the bony shelf is notched by a postspinal fossa causing a concave profile in top view; in Halszkaraptor this groove is absent and the profile is convex. The neck ribs are short, no longer than the vertebral bodies. The back vertebrae are not pneumatised. The tail is not stiffened by long zygapophyses or chevrons as in derived eudromaeosaurs. The tail base is rather short in that the transition point to the middle tail, where the transverse processes cease to exist, is at the eighth vertebra. The transition is also very gradual in morphology. The neural spines of the front tail are already strongly reduced: only the first three vertebrae possess them and they are formed like low bumps. Classification Halszkaraptor was placed in the Dromaeosauridae in 2017. A new clade Halszkaraptorinae was coined, containing Halszkaraptor and its close relatives Hulsanpes and Mahakala. The cladogram below is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted in 2017 by Cau etal. using updated data from the Theropod Working Group. The analysis showed that Halszkaraptorinae was the basalmost known dromaeosaurid group. Halszkaraptor occupied a basal position within Halszkaraptorinae, as the sister group of a clade formed by Hulsanpes and Mahakala. Paleobiology Reconstruction of Halszkaraptor escuilliei, with plumage and swimming posture based on aquatic birds that use wing-propelled swimming Halszkaraptor had characteristics that allowed it to spend time both in water and on land, including strong hindlimbs for running and smaller flipper-like forelimbs for swimming. The short tail would have brought the centre of gravity more to the front, which is more useful for swimming than walking. The torso would have been held more vertical than is normal with theropods. To this end, there are adaptations for an improved extension of the hindlimb, in the hip joint and the thighbone. It had many sharp, backward- curving teeth in its mouth, a long neck and sensory neurons in its snout that may have allowed it to detect vibrations in water, leading scientists to believe that it hunted aquatic prey. It had to come up onto land to reproduce, because, like all dinosaurs, it needed to lay its eggs on land. A more recent analysis performed by Cau specifically points out similarities to modern-day mergansers. He stated that these birds are probably the closest ecological analogous to Halszkaraptor as they share similar traits with this dromaeosaurid taxon, such as the long neck and a serrated snout edge used to catch small prey. While they are less active moving on land, assuming a hip- extended body posture, on water, they use a distinct swimming model including forelimb-propelled locomotion. This particular behaviour has also been inferred for Halszkaraptor, and seems to support a piscivorous and aquatic life-style similar to that of mergansers.

Her most well-known books are Dr. Andrew Turnbull and the New Smyrna Colony of Florida and The Key to the Golden Islands. Corse, an early suffragette, became the director of Florida's chapter of the newly created Planned Parenthood. In 1978, she was recognized for her work as an historian by the Florida Historical Society, and, in 1997, was posthumously inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame, an honor roll recognizing women who have \\"made significant contributions to the improvement of life for women and all Florida citizens.\\" Biography Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Carita Doggett was the daughter of a prominent Jacksonville attorney and the eldest of four children. She earned her bachelor's degree at Vassar College and her master's degree at Columbia University; she was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters by the University of the South. As a Jacksonville resident, she was involved in numerous social and civic activities and, as a young woman, taught History and English at a private school. In 1921, Carita Doggett married Herbert Montgomery Corse, an engineer and Jacksonville businessman; they had four children. A brother, Frank Doggett, became an early authority on the American Modernist poet, Wallace Stevens. Florida Historian and Author Carita Doggett Corse was born into a family with historical connections dating to the early English settlement of what is now the United States as well as to the later development of Florida and the city of Jacksonville. Her ancestor, Thomas Doggett (Doged), in 1637 sailed to Boston, where he became a man of means and influence. His grandson married the great- granddaughter of Samuel Fuller, a passenger on the ship Mayflower. Corse was also a descendant of Andrew Turnbull, a Scottish physician who founded the colony at New Smyrna, the largest single attempt at British colonization in the New World. She was a great-granddaughter of John Locke Doggett, one of Jacksonville's founders, who came to Florida in 1820, purchased land on the St. Johns River and became a territorial judge and president of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida. Her grandfather, a captain in the Confederate Army, became a county judge and was corporate counsel for the City of Jacksonville. Carita Corse combined scholarly research with an ability to describe Florida's historical heritage for a lay audience. She authored numerous historical publications on Florida, the best-known being Dr. Andrew Turnbull and the New Smyrna Colony of Florida, an account of the founding of the colony based on her research of previously unavailable documents and manuscripts at the British Colonial Office, and The Key to the Golden Islands, the story of the history and settlement of Fort George Island, located near Jacksonville at the northern end of the St. Johns. The Federal Writers' Project Carita Doggett Corse served as Florida's director of the Writers' Project from 1935 to 1942 (after 1939 it was funded by the state of Florida). She was one of the few state directors retained for the project's duration. The Federal Writers' Project was part of the Federal Works Progress Administration (WPA), and provided jobs for unemployed white-collar workers, including new and experienced writers. They produced books and pamphlets‚Äîin particular, state guidebooks. The guide to Florida, Florida: A Guide to the Southern-Most State was published within four years. As director, Corse was able to incorporate her ideas in the Florida project programs and publications. She was especially interested in the ethnic diversity of Florida and was one of the first state directors to actively collect folk history as a part of the project. Recalling conversations with a former slave while conducting research for her book on Fort George Island, Corse conceived the idea of doing something similar to achieve the Federal Writers' Projects emphasis on personal histories. She traveled across the state with other writers, conducting interviews, recording songs, collecting stories and taking photographs. Corse advocated for African-American participation in the project and created a Negro Writers' Unit to focus on black history and culture. Florida was one of just three states in the South to establish a Negro Writers' Unit and those writers were instrumental in producing the ex-slave narratives. Folklorist and author Zora Neale Hurston was the best-known African-American writer to contribute to the Florida Writers' Project. Efforts to obtain slave narratives were subsequently expanded to other southern states. More than 90 of the nearly 2,000 works published by the Federal Writers' Project were produced by Florida writers under the direction of Carita Doggett Corse.

The specific epithet maletae is in honor of the discoverer's wife, author Maleta M. Walls, who helped collect many of the original specimens. It was originally described as a subspecies of Orconectes difficilis, but later elevated to full species status. The common name refers to the Kisatchie National Forest, near where the original specimens were found in Bayou Santabarb. Description Kisatchie painted crawfish are brown or olive with red, blue, and white to yellow markings. The red is mainly on the central joints of the pereiopods, the postorbital ridges, and a little on the posterior margins of the uropods (tail fins) and abdominal segments. The fingers of the long, stout chelae (claws) are in order from tip to base, red, yellow/cream, blue, and greenish brown/brown. Its cephalothorax is about long, to a maximum of . The rostrum (beak) is acuminate and has lateral spines. It has a closed areola (the hourglass shaped lines on the back). It is very similar to Faxonius difficilis but has a central projection that is longer and more curved, with a more smoothly curved expanded mesial process. It can be distinguished from F. palmeri by its shorter gonopods (which may reach the third coxa) and a shorter and stouter central projection. It is fairly indistinguishable from F. h. blacki except that form I (breeding) males have an apex of their first pleopod (swimming leg) that is slender, long, and curved. They only have simple copulatory hooks on their third legs. It is also unique among members of its clade for having a structure like a sulcus caused by a single cephalomedian (anterior) prominence. Behaviour Form I males are found in low-water conditions between June and October, peaking in September‚ÄìOctober. Males have mating plugs in October. Kisatchie painted crawfish reproduce with the male depositing sperm into an external receptacle under the female's abdomen. She then fertilizes her eggs as she excretes them. Both eggs and hatchlings remain with the mother, held under her body by her pleopods until they are big enough to swim and crawl without assistance. June and July are when juveniles are most commonly found. Habitat and ecology F. maletae prefers clear flowing streams with sandy bottoms and plenty of plant litter and rocks. Occasionally it found in reed beds. It eats carrion and plants. Distribution The Kisatchie painted crayfish has a very restricted and fragmented range. It has been found in Rapides, Natchitoches, and Sabine Parishes, Louisiana; Upshur, Titus, Franklin, Gregg, Harrison, and Marion Counties, Texas; Pittsburg and Latimer Counties, Oklahoma; and Washington County, Arkansas. By river, it is found in Bayou Teche, Kisatchie Bayou, tributaries of the Red River of the South, and in Cypress Creek. There is also evidence of it interbreeding with F. difficiis in Coal County, Oklahoma. Some consider the observations in Louisiana to be of F. hathawayi or F. h. blacki and not F. maletae. Phylogenetic study of the Texas populations indicate they are distinct genetically, perhaps even a separate cryptic species. The populations also inhabited separate ecological niches, which may further drive speciation. Threats Kisatchie painted crayfish are susceptible to increased sediment in the water, particularly related to agricultural runoff and logging. The loss of shade from their practices also negatively impacts the animal. Habitat destruction is specifically a concern in Louisiana, where local extinction has happened. With this and the disjointed range of the species, the population is in decline. In 1996 the species was listed by the IUCN Red List as being vulnerable, but as of 2010 it is listed as data deficient. NatureServe rated the species as G2 (imperiled) in 2009. The American Fisheries Society rated it \\"Threatened\\" in 2007. Taxonomy F. maletae is in the Hespericambarus subgenus of Faxonius, originally described by Joseph F. Fitzpatrick Jr.. The name derives from the Latin ' (literally 'western') and ' (lit. 'shrimp').

It connects the Sandanski-Petrich Valley of the river Struma basin in the west and the Gotse Delchev Valley of the river Mesta basin in the east. It begins to the north-east from the village of Paril at 817 m altitude and runs in western direction upstream of the Chokovitsa valley. It reaches its highest point of 1176 m after 4.6 km and then descends westwards along the valley of the river Chereshar where it terminates after 7 km at an altitude of 756 m. Paril is traversed by a 10.6 km long section of the III-1906 third-class road Koprivlen‚ÄìParil‚ÄìKatuntsi. This section is in poor condition and is accessible only for off-road vehicles. It is not maintained in winter. The saddle itself is short, wide and deep with mild slopes and has erosion origin. The geological foundation is predominantly of granite. The soils are brown forest. Paril is covered with beech forests. The saddle is crossed by the E4 European long distance path that links Pirin and Slavyanka. To the south is situated the Alibotush Reserve.

Pencil and monochrome wash drawing, 1906. Cyrus Cincinato Cuneo (18 June 187923 July 1916), known as Ciro, was an artist, born into an Italian American family of artists and musicians. His parents were Giovanni (John) and Annie Cuneo; his brothers Rinaldo (1877-1939) and Egisto (1890‚Äì1972), and his son Terence Cuneo (1907‚Äì1996) also became artists. Early Life The family lived on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco's Italian American neighborhood of North Beach. Cuneo's first published drawings appeared in an Italian newspaper when he was 16, and he spent the next three years he worked for the San Francisco Press. Cuneo trained as a boxer, becoming the fly-weight champion at the Olympic Club in San Francisco and his prize money, together with earnings from spare-time jobs, and the sale of sketches and to travel to Paris to learn painting. The Times reported that he left San Francisco for Paris with ¬£40 in his pocket. Art Education Cuneo began his studied in art while still living in San Francisco, at the Mark Hopkins Art Institute. When he travelled to Paris in 1896, he joined the Colarossi‚Äôs studio and trained under Whistler eventually becoming his massier or head student. Cuneo set up a afternoon sketching school with Edith ≈ínone Somerville (18581949). Teaching sketching and boxing helped Cuneo to support himself in Paris. The Times said that Cuneo had a fine physique and was a notable athlete, and as a boxer was famous not only on the Pacific slope, but also in Paris and in London. Cuneo was living at 9, Rue Campagne, Premi√®re Montparnasse, Paris, in 1900 when he first exhibited at the Royal Academy. He showed two works in that year, both of them illustrations from King Lear by Shakespeare. Cunoe also exhibited at other venues. The move to London While Greenwall states that Cuneo moved to London in 1902, Kirkpatrick notes that the 1901 census found him lodging with his future wife's parents in London (while she was still in Paris). Cuneo married fellow artist Nellie Tenison (28 August 186923 May 1953) in London on 20 October 1903. Assessment Cuneo was elected ROI in 1908. Cuneo was a successful artist in terms of earning a living. During World War One he painted war subjects in London and the sale by auction of one of his paintings paid for two motor ambulances for the front. Thorpe considered this illustration by Cuneo for a story in The Pall Mall Magazine to be a beauty. Cuneo's illustration work was unusual in that he often painted in oils on board. Peppin and Micklethwait state that Cuneo worked with considerable panache in crayon or in black and white oil on board painted without preliminary pencil drafts. Thorpe considered one of his illustrations for The Pall Mall Magazine in 1900 to be a beauty and reproduced it in his survey of English illustration in the 1890s. Cuneo was selected by Percy Bradshaw for inclusion in his 1918 The Art of the Illustrator which included a portfolio for each of twenty illustrators. Sudden death Cuneo got blood poisoning after being accidentally scratched with a hat-pin at a dance. He died on 23 July 1916. His estate was valued at ¬£13,798 17s. 6d. and his wife Nellie acted as his executor.

Despite the lack of evidence, the HPV vaccine is infamous in Japan due to misattributed adverse effects, with government suspending promotion and coverage. While the World Health Organization (WHO) safety and efficacy information about the vaccine is consistent with Muranaka's reporting, a court ruled against Muranaka in an unrelated slander lawsuit in 2016 for claims of alleged fabrication. Under threat of legal harassment by antivaccine activists, publishers declined some of her works including a book on the HPV vaccine (ultimately, Heibonsha accepted to publish the book).  Biography  Muranaka received an M.A. in sociology from Hitotsubashi University and an M.D. from Hokkaido University School of Medicine. According to her own profile, she was known as a journalist writing about the Ebola fever in 2014. In February 2018, she published her first book. Muranaka is part-time lecturer at the Japan Kyoto University School of Medicine. As of 2019, she lives in Germany. Lawsuit In 2016, Muranaka wrote in the Wedge magazine about research done by Shinshu University neurologist Shuichi Ikeda, alleging that some results to demonstrate a link between an HPV vaccine and brain cancer in mouse had been fabricated, resulting in a slander lawsuit. While Japanese's Health Ministry stated that Ikeda's results \\"have not proven anything about whether the symptoms that occurred after HPV vaccination were caused by the HPV vaccine,\\" the court ruled that evidence of fabrication was absent. The university investigation on Ikeda's work concluded that he did not commit scientific misconduct, but that conclusions may have been overstated, then released a statement, including that the research did not conclusively provide a link in relation to vaccine safety. Muranaka lost the slander case. Wedge magazine had to retract claims of fabrication from the article with both needing to pay for damages. Muranaka intends to appeal, also stating that she needs to win the lawsuit for science and that the court case was still an opportunity to make friends and gain recognition despite its negative aspects. According to Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, \\"I think what is important is that media coverage does not distort the point and imply Dr. Ikeda's science won: It was Dr. Muranaka's manners and language that lost\\".  John Maddox Prize delivery ceremony  Ceremony held on November 30, 2017. thumb At the award ceremony of the John Maddox Prize, Riko Murunaka's speech highlighted the circumstances that, according to the award winner, could have given rise to the distinction received.  Vaccination against human papillomavirus  The WHO has evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine against human papilloma virus (HPV) concluding that it is extremely safe and that it is not related to the adverse effects attributed to it. At 2016, 79 out of almost 200 countries have HPV vaccine programs for girls and adolescents. However, Japan stopped recommending vaccination despite the fact that its own technical committees found no relationship with the alleged adverse effects falsely attributed to this vaccine, and as a consequence, vaccination coverage fell to levels close to zero, not seen in no other country.

It was published by the clergy and later by the christian democrats, thus it reflected and advocated for Roman Catholic ideals and values. Its motto was \\"All for Lithuania, Lithuania for Christ\\" (). With interruptions, it was published until 2000. First magazine in 1896‚Äì1904 Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, one of the key people in publishing Tƒóvynƒós sargas, in 1921 Tƒóvynƒós sargas was first printed in January 1896 in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). Its staff was based mostly in Mosƒódis (where Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas worked as a vicar) and Kretinga Monastery (where several priests were deported due to anti-Tsarist activities). It competed with and quickly replaced more conservative ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga. The magazine, 32‚Äì60 pages in length, had a circulation of about 2,000 copies and was published monthly. Because Lithuanian-language press in the Latin alphabet was banned in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire), the periodical had to be smuggled across the border. Tƒóvynƒós sargas was published until May 1904 when the press ban was lifted. Tƒóvynƒós sargas wrote on patriotic topics and defended religious and cultural rights. It advocated against various Russification policies, particularly the Russian government schools, and urged resistance to Polonization and promoted the Lithuanian National Revival. That presented a challenge as Catholicism was long associated with the Polish identity; the clergy needed to become less Polish without becoming less Catholic. The magazine thus criticized Catholic hierarchy, particularly in the Diocese of Vilnius, for supporting various Russification or Polonization policies. The magazine did not encourage political resistance against the Tsarist regime and in general accepted the existing social and political order. It also published more practical advice for farming and financial planning, encouraged commerce and learning a trade. It laid the ideological groundwork for the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party established in 1904. From 1898, each issue had a supplement of literary fiction, popular science, or practical advice. Its editors were Felicijonas Lelis (1896), Domininkas Tumƒónas (1896‚Äì97), Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas (1897‚Äì1902; reassigned to he was unable to attend day-to-day needs of the magazine), Antanas Milukas (1902‚Äì04). Officially, Jurgis Lapinas was listed as the editor as he lived in East Prussia. Its contributors included Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Jurgis Bielinis, Kazimieras B≈´ga, Liudas Gira, Motiejus Gustaitis, Jonas Jablonskis, Maironis, ≈†atrijos Ragana, Jurgis Smolskis Jurgis ≈†aulys, ≈Ωemaitƒó. Revivals =In 1917‚Äì1926= The magazine was revived by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party in 1917. It was published weekly in Vilnius in 1917‚Äì18 and in Kaunas in 1920‚Äì26. It had weekly supplement ≈™kininkas (Farmer; 1921‚Äì22) and monthly supplements ≈Ωvaig≈ædutƒó (Little Star; 1923), ≈†eimyna (Family; 1923‚Äì26), Naujakuris (New Settler; 1925‚Äì26), Svirplys (Cricket; 1925‚Äì26), Jaunimas (Youth; 1925‚Äì26).

Its noted contributors included Kazys Bizauskas, Liudas Gira, Justinas Staugaitis, Antanas Vilei≈°is. =In 1947‚Äì2000= The periodical was revived again in 1947 by Lithuanian displaced persons in Reutlingen and Fellbach, Germany. In 1950, the magazine moved to United States where it continued to be published until 1991. It was published in various cities, including Chicago, New York, Hot Springs, Arkansas and Euclid, Ohio. After Lithuania regained independence, it returned to Vilnius, Lithuania, where it was published by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party until 2000. It was edited by Domas Jasaitis (1968‚Äì75), Petras Maldeikis (1976‚Äì83), Algirdas Jonas Kasulaitis (1984‚Äì91), Audronƒó Viktorija ≈†kiudaitƒó (1993‚Äì2000).

They raised funds for civic improvements, most of which benefited the cemetery. The entrance gates, and fence were completed in 1917 and the shelter house was completed in 1926. They were both executed in the rather rare Egyptian Revival style. The fence and gates feature six obelisk posts and three iron gates. The posts are composed of river rock and capped by a square concrete slab with a flat pyramid top. The shelter house is a square clay tile and stucco building with stone obelisks at the corners.

Early life and education  Abaev was born in 1932, in Baku. Having finished his secondary education in Baku, he entered Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial University (now Azerbaijan State Oil Academy). Later he continued his career working as a professor at the following institutes: Azerbaijan Oil Refining Scientific Research Institute, All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Polefins (Baku), Scientific Research Institute (Yaroslavl), All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Polymers (Dzerzhinsk, Gorky Oblast), Bioengineering Research Institute of the Russian Federation (Moscow). Abaev defended his Doctoral thesis in 1971. The same year he was elected a specialty committee member of Higher Attestation Commission of the USSR. Further inventions of Genrikh Abaev were implemented in the procedures such as: butyl rubber synthesis technology process, paraffin C4-C5 two-stage dehydrogenation, isobutylene hydration process based on molded cation exchange resin. Abaev had received numerous awards and honours for his investigation of new manufacture technologies.  Career  Abaev\`s scientific work was mostly connected with the chemical engineering and biotechnological modeling (fluidized bed and pneumatic conveying, propylene oxidative ammonolysis, butyl rubber jet aeration, acrylic fiber synthesis, oil distillation, fermentation). In fact, there were 3 Doctoral and 19 PhD theses in Engineering Sciences defended under Abaev\`s supervision. It was Abaev\`s credit, that the new courses appeared at the Belarusian higher education institutes. The advanced courses were \\"Modeling and Design of Chemical Engineering Processes\\" and \\"Energy and Resource Conservation \\". In 1997, he organized the Interdisciplinary Science Conference on Technology \\"Energy and Resource Conservation\\" (The Regional Energy Commission) at Polotsk State University. Abaev was the founder and the chairman of The Academic Board for Doctor\`s thesis defense in Engineering Sciences in 1993. By the 2000, under his initiative the international contract with the French company ISL was made. The goal of that project was to develop a rapid analysis tool for oil. Later, the patent for that specific tool was obtained. Nowadays the tool is sold in 13 countries all over the world. Moreover, since 2002 Polotsk State University has been receiving quarterly cash awards from the invented tool sales.  Publications  Abaev published over 300 articles.

It is native to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. It is a parasitic castrator of small mud crabs in the family Panopeidae, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Taxonomy L. panopaei was first described by the American zoologist Charles F. Gissler in 1884; it was parasitizing the mud crab Panopeus lacustris and was collected at Tampa, Florida. The barnacle infects a number of species of mud crab and it seems likely that it is a species complex. Further taxonomic studies should clarify the position. Description The parasitic adult L. panopaei consists of an externa, a yellowish-orange mass of soft tissue, attached by a stalk to a host crab's abdomen; the stalk branches internally into tubes which surround the crab's gut. Distribution L. panopaei is native to the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic coasts from Cape Canaveral to Florida and those of Venezuela. It has increased its range northward, being found for the first time in Chesapeake Bay in 1964. It arrived in the bay because many oysters there were infected by Haplosporidium nelsoni and stocks were replenished by importing eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from the Gulf of Mexico. Accompanying these oysters were some crabs Eurypanopeus depressus which were parasitized by L. panopaei, the parasitic barnacle thus was inadvertently introduced to Chesapeake Bay where it found new species of crab to infect. Ecology The adult barnacle bears no resemblance to an acorn barnacle but the larval development is typical of a barnacle, with four nauplius larval stages and one cyprid larval stage. The female cyprid larva of L. panopaei has a spear-like stylet. When it settles on a suitable crab host, it pierces the carapace and develops underneath as an endoparasite for about a month. It then extrudes an externa, or brood sac, beneath the crab's abdomen. This is fertilised by a free-swimming male cyprid larva. When the eggs in the brood sac have matured, the sac releases several thousand nauplius larvae at intervals. Female crabs care for their eggs by carrying them beneath their abdomen, keeping them well aerated and protecting them. L. panopaei manipulates the behaviour of both sexes of the crab on which it settles, so that the host treats the barnacle's brood sac as if it contained the crab's own eggs. In the case of male crabs, the parasite causes the ventral abdominal plate to widen, which makes it more suitable for brooding, and alters the crab's behaviour so that it looks after the brood sac, despite this not being a normal behaviour for a male crab. Reproduction is completely suppressed in both male and female crabs which are effectively castrated. The barnacle seems able to take control of the timing of the crab's moult, extruding its brood sac immediately after ecdysis, when the crab's shell is soft. Suitable host crabs include the flatback mud crab (Eurypanopeus depressus), the Say's mud crab (Dyspanopeus sayi), the knotfinger mud crab (Panopeus lacustris), P. obessus, the furrowed mud crab (P. occidentalis), the oystershell mud crab (P. simpsoni), the Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), Tetraplax quadridentata, and the inflated mud crab (Tetraxanthus rathbunae), all found in the western Atlantic Ocean, as well as the black-clawed crab (Lophopanopeus bellus) which is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

He is the 4th and incumbent President of Russia; previously he was the 33rd Prime Minister of Russia, 2nd President of Russia and 4th Federal Security Service Director. This campaign is his fourth. Prior to this he successfully participated in elections in 2000, 2004 and 2012. Vladimir Putin had consistently scored higher than 40% in opinion polls since the last presidential election. According to opinion poll conducted in December 2017 by Gallup International, if Putin was not to be on the ballot 46% wouldn't have known for whom to vote and 19% would have made the ballot paper invalid.Gallup: –±–µ–∑ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä—ã —Ä–∏—Å–∫—É—é—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å—Å—è Putin was re-elected as the President of the Russian Federation on 18 March 2018. Background Putin became the President in 2012. According to the Constitution of Russia he is entitled to another re- election. Until December 2017 it was not clear whether Putin would seek re- election or not. Some political analysts believed that Putin was not going to run, which is why he refused to answer questions about his nomination. Some named Governor of Tula Oblast Alexey Dyumin as Putin's successor. Others, on the contrary, believed that Putin would participate in the elections, but would announce it as late as possible in order to conduct a short campaign. =Announcement= Putin announces his nomination as a candidate for the 2018 Russian presidential election. It was assumed that Putin would announce his nomination on 14 December 2017, during his annual press conference. However, at the beginning of December 2017, some experts said that Putin would announce his participation in the elections on 6 December, during the Volunteer of Russia 2017 awards. Putin's press Secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on these reports said that Putin could announce the nomination any day. On 6 December, after the presentation of awards, Putin declined to answer the question about participation in the elections, saying that in the near future he will decide on whether to participate in the election. A few hours later, speaking to the workers of the GAZ automobile plant, Putin announced that he will again run for president. =Nomination= Putin at a forum held by the All-Russia People's Front on 19 December 2017 In the 2012 election, Putin was nominated by the United Russia party, which he led at the time. Putin announced that he will run as an independent on 14 December 2017 during his annual press conference. This is the third time he will run as an independent. He will have to collect at least 300,000 signatures in his support, only then will he be admitted to the election. The official nomination of Putin took place at a meeting of his initiative group on 26 December 2017. The initiative group included 668 people, among them the former Minister of Economics Alexander Shokhin, hockey player Alexander Karelin, Moscow State University rector Viktor Sadovnichy, Director of Bakulev Scientific Center of Cardiovascular Surgery Leo Boqueria, Senator and Secretary-General of United Russia Andrey Turchak, the President of Support of Russia Alexander Kalinin, co-founder of Kaspersky Lab Natalya Kaspersky, leader of the party A Just Russia Sergey Mironov, as well as members of the State Duma and senators. Campaign On 27 December 2017, Putin submitted documents for participation in the elections to the Central Election Commission. On 28 December, the CEC registered the initiative group and allowed him to start collecting signatures. =Collection of signatures= On 5 January 2018, signatures started being collected in support of Putin. It was necessary to collect from 300,000 to 315,000 signatures to be admitted to the elections. In each subject of the Russian Federation it was necessary to collect no more than 7,500 signatures. By 12 January Putin had gathered the required number of signatures, and even exceeded this number by almost 100,000. Putin's staff decided to continue collecting signatures. In total the campaign gathered more than 1.5 million signatures, of which around 315,000 were submitted to the CEC on 29 January. By 2 February they had been verified - only 232 signatures were deemed invalid. =Visits and campaign= On 7 February Putin visited Krasnoyarsk. Although it was officially a work trip many believe it was linked to his campaign. His visit was linked to the preparation to the Universaide, which will be held in the winter of 2019. Before addressing the issue he visited the multi-functional sports center Sopka. During the meeting concerning the issue Putin noted that Russia \\"without a doubt remains a leader in international sport\\". Next he went to a council concerning ecological problems. Near the end of his visit he entered the sport watching complex Platinum Arena Krasnoyarsk, where he took photos with training hockey players and met with the three players of the youth team Totem.

He met with Andrey Travnikov, who is Acting Governor of Novosibirsk Oblast. He was present at the meeting of the council for education and science, where he revealed a few details of the speech he would give to the Federal Assembly. During his campaign he refused to take part in any presidential debates personally like he did in previous ones in 2000, 2004 and 2012, citing his spokesman, being \\"too busy\\". Though he was presented by his representative and his most presidential campaign is done by his trusted figures. Vladimir Putin rally in Sevastopol. On 3 March, in Moscow at the Luzhniki stadium held a rally in support of Vladimir Putin. In total, more than 130,000 people came to the rally. The rally was made by confidants of Putin, among whom were star athletes, figures of culture and science. Speaking at the meeting, Vladimir Putin said: \\"We want to make our country bright, looking forward to the future, because our ancestors lived here, we live, our children live and our children and grandchildren will live. We will do everything to make them happy. For us and apart from us no one else will. But if we do this, the next 10 years, the entire XXI century will be marked by our bright victories. We'll do it!\\". On 14 March, Vladimir Putin spoke at a rally in Sevastopol to mark the anniversary of the Crimean status referendum. Vladimir Putin voted in the election.

However, during the presidential campaign, nothing was said by Putin on this subject ‚Äî so that Russian citizens would not expect any changes in this socially-sensitive area. Moreover, for many years Putin promised not to hike the retirement age, and in several articles published by Russian media before the election, the existence of any intentions to change the pension age until 2030 were denied. In the aftermath, more than 60% of Russians interpreted his silence as a trick aimed at securing victory in the election, which would have been questionable if he had presented his plan in advance. All this has severely affected Putin‚Äôs reputation, Forbes estimated the whole story as cynical and heavily compromising the leader of the nation. Endorsements =Parties supporting Putin's presidential bid= The following political parties support Putin in the election: =PutinTeam= PutinTeam logo The PutinTeam movement was created by ice hockey player Alexander Ovechkin on 2 November 2017 in support of Vladimir Putin.

The chief of staff is Andrey Yarin. The press secretary of the headquarters will be the journalist Andrey Kondrashov. Potential Prime Ministers According to Russian law, after the inauguration of the elected President of Russia, the incumbent Prime Minister is obliged to resign, and the President has to appoint a new head of government, or re-assign the current one. According to political analysts, the Prime Minister appointed during the fourth and last term of Putin will most likely be his successor as President in 2024. Various media outlets called the possible candidates for the post of head of government, this is: First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, Deputy Prime Ministers Sergei Prikhodko, Arkady Dvorkovich, Yury Trutnev and Olga Golodets, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Maxim Topilin, Minister of Health Veronika Skvortsova, Kremlin Chief of Staff Anton Vaino, Kremlin First Deputy Chief of Staff (Prime Minister during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin) Sergey Kiriyenko, Economic Presidential Assistant Andrey Belousov, the former Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin, Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov, the head of Federal Agency for State Property Management Dmitry Pristanskov, Minister of Energy Alexander Novak, Chairman and CEO of Sberbank Herman Gref, CEO of Gazprom Alexey Miller, CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov, Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko, Chairwoman of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina, Head of the Account Chamber Tatyana Golikova or former Governor of Tula Oblast Vladimir Gruzdev.–ü—Ä–µ–º—å–µ—Ä –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–æ–≤: –∫—Ç–æ –∑–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏—è –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥–µ–≤–∞ In addition, one of the main contenders is current Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, despite the fact that his popularity has declined in 2017 as the result of a corruption scandal, although he still remains the second most popular politician in Russia after Putin.

She is known for her research in the field of cognitive psychology, spanning diverse topics including short-term memory, long-term memory, psycholinguistics, reading, decision-making, and cognitive training. Healy and her colleague Lyle E. Bourne, Jr. are authors of the book Train Your Mind for Peak Performance: A Science-Based Approach for Achieving Your Goals and the textbook Cognitive Processes with Roger Dominowski and Elizabeth Loftus. Healy and Bourne co-edited several volumes together including Training Cognition: Optimizing Efficiency, Durability, and Generalizability, Foreign Language Learning: Psycholinguistic Studies on Training and Retention, and Learning and Memory of Knowledge and Skills: Durability and Specificity. Healy co-edited, with Robert Proctor, the Handbook of Psychology, Volume 4 Experimental Psychology. With Stephen Kosslyn and Richard Shiffrin, she co-edited a two-volume Festschrift in honor of her doctoral advisor, William Kaye Estes. Healy is a fellow of the American Psychological Association (Division 1 and Division 3), the Association for Psychological Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. She has served as President of Division 3 (Experimental Psychology) of the American Psychological Association, as Chair of the Psychology Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and as Chair of the Society of Experimental Psychologists. She was recipient of the James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award and the Women in Cognitive Science Mentorship Award. Healy was honored by the Federation of Associations of the Behavioral and Brain Sciences as a scientist who \\"made important and lasting contributions to the sciences of mind, brain, and behavior\\" in 2014. That year, her career was celebrated with a Festschrift, with participants contributing to a Special Issue of the American Journal of Psychology.  Biography  Healy received her bachelor's degree in psychology (summa cum laude) at Vassar College in 1968. She continued her education at The Rockefeller University where she completed her Ph.D. dissertation titled Short-term Memory for Temporal and Spatial Order Information in 1973, under the supervision of Estes. Healy was a member of the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Yale University from 1973 to 1981. She moved to the Department of Psychology at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1981, where was promoted to professor in 1984 and named College Professor of Distinction in 2007. Healy married James Bruce Healy in 1970. Together they have a daughter, Charlotte Healy. Healy's research program has been supported by grants from agencies including the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U. S. Air Force, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Research  Healy's research interests are diverse and span a wide range of topics in the field of cognitive psychology. Her research on cognitive training has examined conditions under which skills are learned, retained, and transferred, and has drawn attention to the need for specificity in skill training. Participants tend to show benefits of training on subsequent tasks only when able to use the same cognitive operations acquired during the training. Her work on psycholinguistics and reading has investigated the processing of word boundaries and sublexical units of words during reading. Healy observed that participants exhibited a greater number of letter detection errors when they were reading word sequences that were familiar or have contained function words, such as the and and. Her findings suggest that familiar word sequences are often read in chunks comprising units larger than a single letter. In other research, Healy and her colleagues investigated the effect of temporal and spatial order of information on short- term memory. In a study of memory for lines of a school song, Overstreet and Healy observed primacy and recency effects when students were instructed to reorder the lines of the song. In an item selection task, participants were presented with lines from the song with a word omitted and were tasked with choosing the correct word (out of two options) to fill in the missing word. Overstreet and Healy observed a serial position effect in the reconstruction task, but not the item selection task, which suggested that the serial position effect was due to the retention of individual lines of the song, and not due the particular items within each line.

However, there have been recent campaigns that have called for its legalisation. For instance, former member of parliament for Kibra Constituency Ken Okoth advocated for its legalisation on the basis of its medicinal values. In March 2019, the New York-based company GoIP Global Inc announced that it had obtained a licence to grow cannabis, although their claim was denied by the Kenyan government. Cultivation Cannabis hotbeds in Kenya include Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, with cultivation also being observed in the coastal regions of the country. Negotiable amounts of cannabis are smuggled out of the country by foreign visitors. In 1999, Kenyan authorities reportedly seized of cannabis; however, there are no official crop size or yield estimates. Consumption Cannabis in Kenya is commonly available in joints that cost anywhere from 10 shillings to 100 shillings. According to a 1991 study, cannabis is the third-to-most abused substance in Kenya, after alcohol and tobacco. According to a 2012 study by the National Agency for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA), the incidence of cannabis consumption was higher among men, the unemployed, and those residing in more developed areas, although consumption in rural areas was also increasing. The study also found that the most common users of cannabis in Kenya were aged 18 to 25 years. Legislation Cannabis consumption is illegal in Kenya, with offenders facing up to eight years (formerly fifteen) of imprisonment.

In a track career which lasted from June 2004 until September 2006 she raced in four different countries and won five races over distances ranging from six furlongs to one and a half miles. She showed very promising form as a juvenile in 2004 when she won two of her three races including the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes. In the following year she failed in the Irish Oaks, her principal objective but recorded victories in the Silver Stakes, Ballyroan Stakes and Dance Design Stakes. As a four-year-old in 2006 she failed to win a race but finished second in the Glencairn Stakes, Pretty Polly Stakes and Royal Whip Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a successful broodmare. Background Chelsea Rose is a chestnut mare with a white blaze and a long white sock on her right hind leg bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Airlie Stud. As a yearling she was consigned to the Tattersalls sale in October 2003 and was bought for 38,000 guineas by Emerald Bloodstock. The filly entered the ownership of Frances Donnelly and was sent into training with Con Collins at the Curragh. She was ridden in all but two of her races by Pat Shanahan. She was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Desert King whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Irish Derby in 1997. As breeding stallion he had considerable success in both Europe and Australia, with his offspring including Makybe Diva, Desert War and Mr Dinos Chelsea Rose's dam Cinnamon Rose showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from nine starts. She was descended from Senones, a full-sister to the Prix du Jockey Club winner Sicambre. Racing career =2004: two-year- old season= On her racecourse debut Chelsea Rose started the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting in a thirteen-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 9 June. Racing on good to firm ground she headed the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Silk And Scarlet a furlong out and won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths. On 8 August the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Debutante Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh but after disputing the lead for most of the way she was overtaken in the closing stages and came home third behind Silk And Scarlet and Luas Line. Despite her defeat in the Debutante, Chelsea Rose was moved up to Group 1 class for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course and distance on 5 September and started at odds of 9/1 in a twelve-runner field. Silk And Scarlet started favourite, while the other fancied runners included Jewel In The Sand (winner of the Albany Stakes and Cherry Hinton Stakes), Saoire, Slip Dance (Empress Stakes) and the Jim Bolger-trained Pictavia. After racing just behind the leaders as Drama set the pace, Chelsea Rose went to the front two and a half furlongs from the finish and stayed on well to repel several challengers in the closing stages. She crossed the finishing line three quarters of a length in front of Pictavia, with Saoire, Umniya, Belle Artiste and Silk And Scarlet close behind. Pat Shanahan, who had won the Irish Oaks on the Collins-trained Princess Pati in 1984 said \\"It's fantastic to ride another group one for Con after all the years we've worked together. My filly traveled really well and as I knew she would stay I decided to kick on almost three (furlongs) down. The ground wasn't ideal for her ‚Äì she likes a bit of an ease ‚Äì but it wasn't as fast as it was when she ran here last month and that helped her\\". Con Collins commented \\"I thought she had a bit of a chance, but they were good fillies in the race and it was hard to be confident. I thought she would run well, but I didn't back her. I haven't backed one for about three years. The money is so good when you win a race these days, there is no point\\". Collins' daughter Tracy added \\"We deliberately didn't enter her in the Guineas because we've always felt anything she did this year would be a bonus. Her career next year will be planned around the Irish Oaks\\". =2005: three-year-old season= Chelsea Rose missed the first part of the 2005 season, and returned to the track in the Silver Stakes over ten furlongs at Lepardstown on 8 June in which she was matched against male opposition and older horses including Sublimity, Solskjaer (Royal Whip Stakes) and Napper Tandy (Diamond Stakes). Carrying a seven-pound weight penalty for her Group 1 win she took the lead in the straight and rallied after being headed by the favourite Merger to regain the advantage and win by a head. In the Pretty Polly Stakes two weeks later she started second favourite but ran poorly and came home ninth of ten runners behind Alexander Goldrun. In the Irish Oaks in July she was moved up in distance but made no impact and finished unplaced in a race won by the French- trained Shawanda. On 14 August Chelsea Rose was theoretically dropped to Listed class for the Ballyroan Stakes over one and a half miles at Leopardstown and started third choice in the betting behind Shalapour (third in the Irish Derby) and Vinnie Roe. After racing at the rear of the field she moved up on the outside to make her challenge in the straight, by which point Vinnie Roe had gone to the front. Shalapour overtook Vinnie Roe a furlong out, but Chelsea Rose produced a sustained run to take the lead in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length. Tracey Collins commented \\"She is very tough and genuine and the horses are only now starting to run well\\". Three weeks later the filly returned to all-female competition and started 2/1 favourite for the Listed Dance Design Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh. She raced in third place before going to the front a furlong and a half from the finish and drew away from her opponents to win \\"easily\\" by two lengths from Pictavia. The Dance Design Stakes proved to be Chelsea Rose's last victory. In the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh September she stayed on in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished fourth to the British-trained favourite Red Bloom. In October she was sent to Italy and came home third of the nine runners behind Dubai Surprise in the Group 1 Premio Lydia Tesio. =2006: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Chelsea Rose failed to win in six races but ran well in defeat on several occasions. Ridden by Willie Supple in her first two races, she finished fourth in the Blue Wind Stakes at Naas Racecourse in May, and then failed by a neck to hold off the late challenge of Mustameet in the Listed Glencairn Stakes at Leopardstown. In the Pretty Polly Stakes on 1 July she produced her best effort when she rallied after being headed inside the final furlong but narrowly failed to overhaul the favored Alexander Goldrun. In August she ran for the only time in England and finished fourth to Ouija Board in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood, before returning to the Curragh to run second to Mustameet when favourite for the Royal Whip Stakes. For her final start Chelsea Rose was sent to France to contest the Prix de Royallieu over 2500 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 30 September. She reached second place in the straight but then faded and finished seventh of the eight runners. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Chelsea Rose was retired to become a broodmare at the Airlie Stud. In November 2012, the mare was auctioned at the Goffs sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨450,000 by the bloodstock agency BBA Ireland. The agency's representative Adrian Nicoll commented \\"she was the standout mare here today... we know she produces good-looking stock and that's half the battle\\". She has produced at least seven foals and four winners: *Hamlool, a bay colt, foaled in 2008, sired by Red Ransom. Failed to win in nine races. *Pale Orchid, bay filly, 2009, by Invincible Spirit. Won five races. *Thawaany, chestnut filly, 2010, by Tamayuz. Won four races including Prix de Ris- Orangis. *Amytis, filly, 2011, by Marju. Unraced. *Flowers On Venus (previously named Alquds), 2012, chestnut colt (gelded), by Ravens Pass. Won five races. *Jazz Cat, chestnut filly, 2013, by Tamayuz. Failed to win in four races. *Kew Gardens, bay colt, 2015, by Galileo. Won Zetland Stakes, Queen's Vase, Grand Prix de Paris and St Leger. Pedigree *Like all of Desert King's offspring, Chelsea Rose was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Biography Hilda L√≥pez was born in Montevideo in 1922, and that same year her family settled in Mataojo, Lavalleja Department, to attend to her father's business in that town. In 1941 she entered the School of Plastic Arts of the Universidad del Trabajo in Montevideo, where she received painting lessons with and engraving with . In 1952 she entered the workshop of , and in 1958 she began to work with , strengthening her artistic training. In 1946 she married Alberto Angenscheidt, with whom she had two children, Eduardo and Virginia. In 1960 L√≥pez held her first solo exhibition at the Zaffaroni Gallery. From that moment on she participated in numerous exhibitions and received official awards for her works that became part of the country's public collections. Hilda L√≥pez, center, surrounded by Ricardo Casas, Katusha S√°nchez, , and at Galer√≠a Cinemateca, 1993 Spanish sculptor Jorge Oteiza's presence in Montevideo had great influence on her work. His theories about Romero Brest's vacuum aesthetics and informalism prompted Hilda to arrive at her own plastic universe. Her series Streets and inlets of Montevideo, exhibited in Washington in 1961, received a glowing critique from Frank Getlein in The Sunday Star. In 1964 L√≥pez traveled to Portugal accompanying an exhibition of Uruguayan artists, where she stayed for a time and had a stormy relationship with the Portuguese painter Henriques Tavares. When the relationship ended, she returned to Montevideo. In 1965 she assembled the Uruguayan submission to the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. Her social and political activity was intense. She participated in the occupation of the Municipal Subway in protest of the appointment of representatives of the Municipal Salon of Plastic Arts, and in 1972 she participated in the reconstruction of Section 20 of the Communist Party in the Paso Molino neighborhood. In 1973, with the closure of official artistic training courses by the de facto government, L√≥pez began to teach. Her workshop, as well as those of , Nelson Ramos, and , persevered in difficult times and were decisive in the formation of the next generation of Uruguayan artists, achieving the continuity of the national artistic process during the dictatorial period. In 1986 she made a mural in stone and cement in homage to the victims of the dictatorship at the Central Headquarters of the Communist Party of Uruguay. Work The work of Hilda L√≥pez is characterized by her great mastery of technical resources used with versatility in expressionist compositions of denunciation and testimony of her time. The series created by the artist mark times in the life of her country. Graf√≠as (1963) shows her dexterity and temperament in ink on paper. Retratos y Coral (1978) comprises works in oil and charcoal, portraits of friends and colleagues symbolically emblematic. Los Adioses (1978) shows abandoned suitcases that evoke the melancholy of the uprooting caused by exile. Pueblos (1981) denotes the human emptiness, and Campo (1983) the social hardships of the interior of the country. El problema principal es la pobreza (1988) rounds off a testimonial sequence of the painful period of the military dictatorship in her country. The series made in 1962 on large format canvases used planographic ink, filling in her creative intention through expressive gesture. With great craft in the drawing, her works on paper, using ink on paper with nib, rice cane, brush, or spatula, was defined by the artist as \\"an understanding with space\\". The ambiguous character between figuration and abstraction recorded by her works generate evocative spaces of melancholy, uprooting, and reflection. One of her best-known works, Autorretrato con golilla roja, made in 1978 and now part of the collection of the National Museum of Visual Arts, is defined in its expressive composition by the cutting red spot of the ruff, on the monochromatism of the figure. The symbolic climate of the work reflects the situation that her country was experiencing at that time. In the series Los Adioses and Pueblos, her informalist gestures are transformed into subtlety and line suggestion. Her work transits the border between figuration and abstraction, with a palette of asordinated colors, almost monochromatic, that alludes to oppression, jail, exile, and the fear to which Uruguayan society was subjected in times of dictatorship.

He won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling for the biographical films Darkest Hour (2017) and Bombshell (2019) after earning nominations for the comedies Click (2006) and Norbit (2007). Life and career Kazu Hiro grew up in Kyoto, where he spent much of his time alone engaging in art projects. Kazu Hiro came across an issue of Fangoria which featured Dick Smith and his work turning Hal Holbrook into Abraham Lincoln for the 1976 miniseries Lincoln. This led to Kazu Hiro's own experiments with special make-up effects, photos of which he began sending to Dick Smith after discovering his P.O. box in the back of a magazine. The two would eventually meet in person when Smith traveled to Japan to work on Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Sweet Home. Smith invited Kazu Hiro to work on the film with him and this began his film career. While working on Sweet Home, Kazu Hiro met fellow artist Eddie Yang, who was visiting from the United States. In 1996, Kazu Hiro moved to Los Angeles to work with Yang and Smith's protege, Rick Baker, on his first U.S. work, Men in Black. Continuing his work with Baker, Kazu Hiro worked on many projects including Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas for which he won a BAFTA. Kazu Hiro crafted the silicone model of Brad Pitt's head used to artificially age him via CGI for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in 2008. In 2012, Kazu Hiro created the prosthetics which turned Joseph Gordon-Levitt into a young Bruce Willis for Looper. After his work on Looper, Kazu Hiro retired from the film industry and focus on sculpture, crafting giant busts of people such as Frida Kahlo, Salvador Dal√≠, Abraham Lincoln, as well as Smith. For the 2017 film Darkest Hour, Gary Oldman talked Kazu Hiro out of retirement to create the Winston Churchill prosthetics. Oldman had been considered for the role of General Thade in Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (the role went to his Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead co-star, Tim Roth) and Kazu Hiro's work at that time had impressed Oldman enough that for him, Kazu Hiro was the only man to turn him into Churchill. For this work, Kazu Hiro won the 2018 Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. He won the award again in 2020 for his work in the 2019 film Bombshell, where he made prosthetics for Charlize Theron as news anchor Megyn Kelly. Personal life In March 2019, Tsuji became an American citizen and officially changed his name to Kazu Hiro. At the 2020 Academy Awards, Kazu Hiro said he became an American citizen because he \\"got tired\\" of Japanese culture, which he found \\"too submissive\\" and a place where it is \\"hard to make a dream come true\\".

The Gallery was known for exhibiting key figures in Boston Expressionism, New York and international modern art styles and non- western art. Mirski himself was known for supporting young, emerging and often Jewish-American artists. The gallery was at the center of Boston's burgeoning modern art scene in the 1940s, as well as instrumental to the birth and development of Boston Expressionism, the most significant branch in American Figurative Expressionism.  History  In the early 1940s, Boris Mirski, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, opened a frame shop and small gallery on Charles Street in Boston. In October 1945, he moved his business to a redbrick mansion at 166 Newbury Street, next door to the Guild of Boston Artists. Here he opened a larger gallery and an art school in addition to the frame shop. The gallery made its debut with an exhibition of 53 paintings by the Guatemalan cubist Carlos M√©rida. Boston's art scene was notoriously conservative, dominated by the genteel Impressionist painters of the Boston School. Few local collectors were interested in modern art, and only a few galleries deigned to exhibit it. Art historian Charles Giuliano describes the \\"sea change\\" that occurred in the late 1940s: The faculty and focus of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts changed from polite and innocuous, ersatz American Impressionism to gritty and graphic Boston Expressionism. The old guard and its socially acceptable artists showed with the Copley Society of Art or the Guild of Boston Artists. The young Turks, Jews, and immigrants or their sons-- like the Lebanese-American Gibran--showed with gallerist Boris Mirski or his former assistants Hyman Swetzoff and Alan Fink of Alpha Gallery. The Mirski Gallery was an important venue for local artists who did not fit the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant or traditionalist mold, such as Hyman Bloom, Giglio Dante, Kahlil Gibran, and John Woodrow Wilson. Mirksi employed struggling artists in his frame shop and as teachers in his art school. The gallery also hosted exchange shows with Edith Halpert's Downtown Gallery in New York. Alan Fink, who managed the gallery in the 1950s and early 60s, later recalled: The Mirski Gallery was very conservative by today's standards, but in the '50s it was considered daring. We got protests for showing artists who are now famous and not considered controversial in the least, artists like Hans Hoffmann and Leonard Baskin. And the Boston police once took a picture of a nude out of our window...Mirski and a couple of other galleries were the only ones selling modern art in Boston at the time. Boston Globe critic Robert Taylor contrasted Mirski's aesthetic with that of two other important Boston gallerists, Margaret Brown and Hyman Swetzoff. Mirski, he said, introduced an \\"urban, Jewish, introverted and lyrical\\" visual sensibility to Boston. Mirski died in Tel Aviv in 1974. The gallery closed in 1979.

While working as an intern, Givner remained in the Democratic National Committee's Watergate offices until just after midnight, making free long-distance phone calls to friends and family. His presence substantially delayed the break-in and indirectly led to the eventual arrests of the burglars.  Early life  Givner was born and raised in Lorain, Ohio. Givner's father, Eugene, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Givner was eight years old. Givner's father was forced out of the family business‚ÄîGivner's Luggage and Jewelry, a general store of sorts in Lorain that sold luggage, jewelry, and the engraving of it, as well as men's clothing. Due to his illness, Eugene Givner was restricted to a wheelchair and was told he would have to move his family to a less humid climate. The family chose to move to Encino, California, after finding a wheelchair-friendly home in that town. Givner's mother, Sonia Ann (\\"Sunny\\") worked as a realtor (and sometimes in the Givner store's jewelry department).  Education  Givner attended the following schools: * Washington Elementary School (1956 to 1963) * Hawthorne Junior High (1963 to 1964) * Lorain Admiral King High School, Lorain, Ohio (1965 to 1969) * University of California, Los Angeles, CA (1973); B.A. - Major: History * Columbia Law School, New York, New York, (1976); J.D.\\"Columbia Law School Alumni\\". Super Lawyers. * New York University School of Law, New York, New York, (1977); LL.M. (Tax) The day after Givner graduated from Admiral King High School in Ohio, he flew to Los Angeles and moved into Sproul Hall at UCLA. By the end of 1971, his sophomore year, he became involved in student government. The faculty assigned him to a group that included Rick Tuttle, an original freedom rider with Martin Luther King Jr. who would later became treasurer of the city of Los Angeles. Sheila Kuehl, a future L.A. County Commissioner, was also a part of that group. At the end of his junior year at UCLA, Givner entered the Summer Internship Program which placed students in various government offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Washington, D.C.. Givner landed an internship at the Democratic National Committee, not the most coveted position; those who were lucky were given ones with members of Congress.  Watergate  Givner played a role in the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal. He was featured in Joseph Rodota's book The Watergate: Inside America's Most Infamous Address. Givner is also cited in many articles such as Harper's January 1980 feature story: \\"The McCord File\\" by Jim Hougan. He also was the only subject in Columbia Law School News' \\"If Not for Him, Nixon Might Still Be President\\" by Jim Shaw, referring to Givner as the person \\"if not for‚Ä¶\\". He also has been written about in a book by Roger Stone and Mike Colapietro titled Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall, and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon, and White House Call Girl: The Real Story written by Phil Stanford. Givner was a 21-year-old intern working at the DNC offices on the sixth floor of the Watergate office complex when his prolonged stay on that floor the night of June 16, 1972, precluded the group of \\"bandits\\" from entering the building to correct their earlier wiretap work. The criminals were set up across the street in a suite above the Howard Johnson's, while they waited for the lights to go out in the offices on the sixth floor at the DNC offices. Though Givner finished his intern duties around 7:30 p.m., he stayed to use a WATS line to make \\"about 20\\" free long-distance calls to friends and family, both in Los Angeles and Ohio. Sometime during the middle of those calls, Givner needed to use the restroom. Realizing he could not re-enter the suites when using the bathroom in the hallway because he had no key to re-enter, Givner stepped out onto the balcony and relieved himself in a cement planter. (The Watergate burglars likely witnessed that event through binoculars as they lay in wait for the right time to make their move, which they finally did less than an hour after Givner left the building shortly after midnight.) That was long after the burglars had hoped to get in. After his phone calls that evening, Givner finally turned off the lights on Saturday, June 17, 1972, at 12:05 a.m., he told numerous reporters over the years. He then bolted down the stairwell, where he began chatting in the lobby with Frank Wills, the security guard on duty at midnight at the Watergate. After some friendly small talk, Wills and Givner headed across the street to the Howard Johnson's restaurant for cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Wills began to follow up with his supervisor's supervisor (he couldn't reach his own)‚Äîthe person to whom he reported the tape on the level two basement door before he left for the Howard Johnson's. The tape was still there which prevented the door from locking. Shortly after reconnecting with his supervisor's supervisor, Wills called police, who arrived within minutes. The burglars had sneaked in, and arrests were quickly made. When Givner returned to his office at the DNC the following daySaturday afternoon, around 3 p.m.the sixth floor was swarming with police, FBI and other authorities. Givner let them know he had not left the building until shortly after midnight. That critical piece of information was pivotal to the investigation. On November 10, 1974, The New York Times Sunday Magazine published an article by Sol Stern about the Watergate break-in, \\"A Watergate Footnote,\\" wherein Stern refers to Givner as \\"the mystery man\\" in the Watergate event. Givner wrote to the Times explaining who he was and downplaying any participation in the critical and historical event. The Times published his letter. Givner also was interviewed by Bob Fink, a researcher for The Washington Post, who had been hired by Woodward and Bernstein to work on their book, All the President's Men. Fink confronted Givner, at first, strongly suggesting that Givner may have been a part of the botched event, a plant, but shortly after that conversation, Fink was convinced Givner had not played a role in the crime. Wills was lauded as the hero who alerted police of the break-in, though later, Givner was credited as having provided critical information. Givner was not only questioned by the D.C. police and the FBI, but in October 1973 he also was interviewed by Senator Fred Thompson, who was the minority counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities. Givner was credited with having stopped the McCord group from getting into the building to do their dirty work \\"on time\\". In 2019, Givner released a book titled My Watergate Scandal Tell-All: How I Unwittingly Caused This Historic Event (www.mywatergatescandal.com) recalling and detailing his experiences and life before and during the Watergate events. He held a press conference at the former DNC headquarters (now SAGE publishing) along with Watergate arresting officers, Paul Leeper and John Barrett. The three took media on a tour of the 6th floor of the Watergate describing each moment of Givner's late stay there and the officers' blow-by-blow description of the arrest.  Career  Givner was admitted to the State Bar of California in December 1976 and began practicing law in Encino. Givner currently practices tax law in Los Angeles at the law offices of KFBLawgroup.

Once in Rome, Sergio meets the mysterious Kira, known as the Queen Bee because of her direct relation with Berlusconi. Meanwhile, Tamara becomes acquainted with former minister Santino Recchia. She flirts with the politician in order to help Sergio to get a contact with Berlusconi. Recchia wants to replace Berlusconi as leader of the centre-right coalition and asks to deputy Cupa Caiafa if she is going to support him in the challenge of the party secretariat. Sergio manages to gather many young escorts and rents an imposing villa in Sardinia that borders with Berlusconi's summer residence in order to get noticed by him. But Berlusconi is having a very difficult time: alone with his wife Veronica Lario, Berlusconi tries to engage her attentions, but Veronica is now very icy towards him. Diamonds, jokes or a song by the trusted Mariano Apicella are not enough to warm Veronica up again, that claims back her dignity. Forza Italia is no longer in government and Berlusconi, left without government offices, has nothing to do, since his family businesses are now controlled by his children. One day, Recchia comes to Berlusconi pleading for help, since Tamara is blackmailing him, asking more money for Sergio, otherwise she will reveal that Recchia is betraying his wife. Berlusconi at first shows himself willing, but then he furiously reveals that he has known that Recchia wants to replace him. Then Berlusconi goes to Rome, telling Veronica that he is involved in political commitments, but he is actually participating in a fashion event with Noemi Letizia, a young and uninhibited girl. Back at Sardinia, during a talk on his yacht where Veronica suggests that he take back Mike Bongiorno on TV, Berlusconi notices Morra's boat with many naked girls, but, despite a little interest, he decides to take a ride with Veronica on his watercraft and, after a sudden storm, they return to the villa. Back there, Veronica asks Berlusconi if he remembers the song that was played on the day of their marriage: after pretending not to remembering the song, Berlusconi demonstrates his affection to Veronica by summoning Fabio Concato, who sings Una domenica bestiale for her, the song that was played when they got married. =Act 2= Ennio Doris, an entrepreneur and an old friend of Berlusconi, boasts of his wealth, praising at the same time the entrepreneurial genius of Berlusconi, who is more concerned that he has lost the elections by only 25,000 votes. Ennio suggests Berlusconi to pass six senators to his side in order to bring down the centre- left government. Meanwhile Veronica decides to leave Berlusconi for a while, announcing that she wants to travel to Cambodia. Berlusconi manages to persuade several senators to join his side by giving them money or helping them by giving a place to their girlfriends in films or TV productions. The government falls and Berlusconi wins the new elections. The loneliness at his Sardinian villa pushes Berlusconi to give in to the requests from Sergio Morra to whom he asks to helping him to organize a party in his villa by bringing as many girls as possible. The army of Morra's escorts are at first happy to be noticed by Berlusconi, but then they clash with a boring and disappointing reality. Kira tries to get some attention from Berlusconi, but she's not able to compete with Sergio and Tamara. After the party, Berlusconi only shows interest for a young girl, Stella, and tries to seduce her, but she refuses him and leaves with a controversial vein. Kira is not in Berlusconi's graces anymore and Sergio and Tamara understand that having arrived to Berlusconi has led to nothing. As soon as Berlusconi becomes prime minister again, he has to face the consequences of the L'Aquila earthquake, showing up among the refugees and promising new houses for the needing. Nevertheless his behavior in international meetings is embarrassing the highest authorities of Italy and Crepuscolo, one of Berlusconi's most trusted men, asks him to do his job more seriously. One day, Berlusconi is preparing to fly to New York City in order to talk at the United Nations, but once on the plane he decides to fly to Naples instead, to see Noemi Letizia on the day of her 18th birthday. As more details about his dissoluted behavior come out, Berlusconi finds himself at the centre of a political scandal and sees the allies of a lifetime, including Cupa Caiafa, leaving him. Veronica, back from Cambodia, announces to Berlusconi that she wants to divorce and a furious quarrel begins between the two of them. Crushed by political scandals and more isolated, Berlusconi finally invites Mike Bongiorno to his villa to dinner, even if the presenter is in the end dismissed without much regard. Once alone, Berlusconi activates the fake volcano in his garden, an attraction he said he would have shown to all his guests but that he actually never powered on. Meanwhile in L'Aquila, refugees enter the new houses built for them by Berlusconi, while firefighters manage to recover an enormous statue of Jesus Christ by extracting it from a church that was destroyed during the earthquake. The credits are accompanied by a long sequence of shots of the tired firefighters' faces after a long night of work. Cast Production The screenplay was co-written by Paolo Sorrentino and Umberto Contarello. The title Loro is Italian for \\"them\\", but also a word play on l'oro, meaning \\"the gold\\". The film is produced through Indigo Film and co-produced by France's Path√©. An obstacle was that Sorrentino's usual Italian co-financier Medusa Film, which is controlled by Berlusconi, was not willing to participate in this production. Filming took place in Rome and Tuscany. Release In Italy, the film came out in theatres in two acts: the first act, called Loro 1, came out on 24 April 2018, while the second act, Loro 2, came out on 10 May 2018. On 7 August 2018, a new 145-minute cut of Loro was announced for release on 13 September 2018. This new international cut was made in order to allow the movie to run for the 91st Academy Awards. In the United Kingdom, Loro was released on 19 April 2019. Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78%, with an average rating of 6.45/10, based on 69 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Loro uses the larger-than-life exploits of an infamous public figure to present a messily compelling snapshot of how power attracts -- and corrupts.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

The ULAS J1342+0928 quasar is located in the Bo√∂tes constellation. The related supermassive black hole is reported to be \\"800 million times the mass of the Sun\\". Discovery On 6 December 2017, astronomers published that they had found the quasar using data from the Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) combined with ground-based surveys from one of the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, as well as the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona and the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. The related black hole of the quasar existed when the universe was about 690 million years old (about 5 percent of its currently known age of 13.80 billion years). The quasar comes from a time known as \\"the epoch of reionization\\", when the universe emerged from its Dark Ages. Extensive amounts of dust and gas have been detected to be released from the quasar into the interstellar medium of its host galaxy. Description ULAS J1342+0928 has a measured redshift of 7.54, which corresponds to a comoving distance of 29.36 billion light-years from Earth. , it is the most distant quasar yet observed. The quasar emitted the light observed on Earth today less than 690 million years after the Big Bang, about 13.1 billion years ago. The quasar's luminosity is estimated at solar luminosities. This energy output is generated by a supermassive black hole estimated at solar masses. According to lead astronomer Ba√±ados, \\"This particular quasar is so bright that it will become a gold mine for follow-up studies and will be a crucial laboratory to study the early universe.\\" Significance The light from ULAS J1342+0928 was emitted before the end of the theoretically-predicted transition of the intergalactic medium from an electrically neutral to an ionized state (the epoch of reionization). Quasars may have been an important energy source in this process, which marked the end of the cosmic Dark Ages, so observing a quasar from before the transition is of major interest to theoreticians.preprint of this paper Because of their high ultraviolet luminosity, quasars also are some of the best sources for studying the reionization process. The discovery is also described as challenging theories of black hole formation, by having a supermassive black hole much larger than expected at such an early stage in the Universe's history, though this is not the first distant quasar to offer such a challenge.

They worked together from approximately 1922‚Äì1929, although their individual work as artists and poets existed prior to this and continued after their collaboration ended. Grupo dos Cinco included Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral, Menotti Del Picchia, Oswald de Andrade and Mario de Andrade. While Malfatti and Amaral were painters, their three male counterparts were poets and writers. Grupo dos Cinco are known for their pivotal role in seeking what it is to be Brazilian as well as their work and involvement with the Semana de Arte Moderna, although Amaral did not participate. As a group, they developed ideas and manifestos that would inspire future generations of Brazilian artists such as the Pau-Brasil poetry manifesto and Antropofagia movement.  Overview  In December 1917, Anita Malfatti caused a scandal with her solo exhibition Exposi√ß√£o de Pintura Moderna (Modern Painting Exhibition). Her use of bright colors and abstract figures could not be more in more opposition to the romantic, naturalistic paintings that conservative Brazilian culture revered. While mass reception was overwhelmingly critical, Malfatti's work attracted the attention of Brazilian intellectuals such as Oswald de Andrade and Menotti del Picchia. Brazil was a conservative country during this time and had yet to be properly introduced to modern art styles such as Cubism, Expressionism or Fauvism that were being practiced in places such as Paris and New York. Malfatti's exhibition highlighted Brazil's conservative art views and inspired artists and intellectuals to push for modern Brazilian art. Oswald was one such inspired figure and later became the chief organizer of the Semana de Arte Moderna- an exhibition dedicated to modern art in Brazil. Malfatti's work was featured prominently and it was here that the Grupo dos Cinco began to form ties with one another. Amaral was in Paris at the time of the exhibition, but came to Brazil three months later and met with Malfatti, Picchia and the Andrades in her studio on the Rua Vitoria. In this moment, the Grupo dos Cinco was formed and began their quest to discover Brazil. They traveled across the country, sketching and writing about their discoveries. Reflecting on these times, Amaral wrote, \\"We must have seemed like a bunch of lunatics shooting off everywhere in Oswald's Cadillac, deliriously happy and out to conquer the world in order to renew it\\".Tarsila do Amaral, \\"General Confession,\\" in Tarsila do Amaral, (Madrid: Fundacion Juan March, 2009), 46-47. During the group's 1922 period of intellectual debates and travels, Amaral described the Grupo dos Cinco as \\"inseparable\\". While the group stayed in contact with one another, following 1922 they were often apart. Amaral and O. Andrade, especially, traveled together around Brazil without the rest of the group. In December 1923, the pair made a trip to the towns of Minas Gerais with the Swiss poet Blaise Cendrars. While the group never had an official disbandment, most scholars note that the start of the feud between Mario de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade signals the ending of Grupo dos Cinco's collaboration.  Members  = Anita Malfatti = Malfatti's 1917 exhibition caught the eye of the future members of Grupo dos Cinco and served as inspiration for the Semana de Arte Moderna that would help to officially bring the group together. Malfatti was born in S√£o Paulo and studied art in Germany and France. In 1915, Malfatti went to study in New York where she began to develop her modernist style that would cause controversy Brazil a few years later. In fact, the criticism and backlash that Malfatti received in 1917 caused her to fall into depression. When she returned to painting, her works were more subdued and conservative. Nevertheless, she still befriended the four artistic revolutionaries of Grupo dos Cinco. Tarsila do Amaral in particular would become a close friend of Malfatti. thumb Photograph of Tarsila do Amaral, 1925 = Tarsila do Amaral = > \\"I feel myself ever more Brazilian. I want to be the painter of my > country... I want, in art, to be the little country girl from S√£o Bernardo, > playing with straw dolls, like in the last picture I am working on... Don't > think that this tendency is viewed negatively here. On the contrary. What > they want here is that each one brings the contribution of his own > country... Paris has had enough of Parisian art.\\" - Tarsila do Amaral, > letter to her family in 1923 Tarsila do Amaral is easily the most famous member of Grupo dos Cinco, affectionately referred to as \\"Tarsila\\" and often cited as the artist who officially established modern painting in Brazil. From 1916 to 1922 Tarsila was more focused on conservative European styles and received most of her art training in France and other parts of Europe. It was not until her trip back to Brazil in 1922 and her involvement with Grupo dos Cinco that she converted entirely to modernism. Tarsila is most known for her works La Negra (1923), Abaporu (1928) and Antropofagia (1929). In her travels with Oswald and Grupo dos Cinco she was inspired by the Brazilian culture she witnessed, creating a series of landscapes and urban scenes of Brazil. Along with Oswald de Andrade, Tarsila do Amaral is credited as being an inspiration for and later a participant in the Antropofagia movement. = Menotti Del Picchia = Picchia was born in S√£o Paulo and raised in an urban lifestyle. Although most known for his poetry, Picchia has had many titles including, \\"landowner, industrialist, banker, political figure, as well as poet, novelist, journalist, painter, and sculptor\\". For his work with Grupo dos Cinco, he was primarily engaged in writing poetry and political activism. Some of his significant work includes Poemas de Amor (1927) and Republica dos Estados Unidos do Brasil (1928). These two collections differ wildly, the latter being a politically-motivated piece that shows devoted patriotism and less attention to prose. = Mario de Andrade = M. Andrade was another poet and writer who worked to establish a modern Brazil. His 1922 novel Hallucinated City is hailed as the first book of modern Brazilian poetry and effectively introduced modernist literature to the Brazilian public. He was supportive of Malfatti's 1917 exhibition, but there is little additional account of his direct work and connections with the group, although Amaral has mentioned the group's closeness multiple times, so it is fair to assume that at least at one point he was close with all of the members. = Oswald de Andrade = > \\"We followed our way across this lengthy sea/ Until the eighth day of > Easter/ We chanced upon birds/ And caught sight of the land\\" - Oswald de > Andrade, \\"The History of Brazil\\", translated by Pero Vaz Caminha Oswald Andrade was invaluable in bringing Grupo dos Cinco together. Not only was he one of the loudest proponents for Malfatti's 1917 controversial work, Oswald also played a large role in organizing the Semana de Arte Moderna. His Cadillac was famously used by the Grupo to travel across Brazil, while he is also the author of both the Pau-Brasil Manifesto and the Antropofagia manifesto that was inspired by Tarsila's works and subsequently inspired later painting by Tarsila. His ideas of distinctly Brazilian art and poetry had lasting effects of Brazil culture as a whole. Poster for Semana de Arte Moderna, created by Emiliano di Calvacanti (1922)  Semana de Arte Moderna  The Semana de Arte Moderna, although occurring slightly before the Grupo dos Cinco's formation, highlights the ideas and passions that the group would focus on and develop during their collaboration. It also played an essential role in bringing the five poets and artists together. The exhibition took place in February 1922 and was \\"an inaugural event on a symbolic level, comparable to the Armory show that had taken place in the United States nine years earlier\\". Primarily organized by Oswald de Andrade, the show was intent on pushing Brazil towards modernism. The conservative culture of Brazil at the time was hesitant to welcome such a change, for as shown with the scathing reception of Malfatti's earlier exhibition, Brazil was still unfamiliar with the popular \\"isms\\" of modern art. The Semana de Arte Moderna particularly focused on works from Fauvism, Expressionism, and post-Cubism- art movements that were considered bizarre when suddenly presented to a conservative Brazil. This exhibition is best regarded not for the quality of the work it displayed, but rather for the purposefully provocative nature of the exhibition. \\"The real quest for Modernism in art began after the Semana de arte moderna\\", due largely to the formation of Grupo dos Cinco.

Dedication Window depicting the legend of St Sabinus It is not known why the church is dedicated to St Sabinus; in the 13th-century there was a chapel in nearby Barnstaple dedicated to him but this no longer exists.

History The baptismal font dates to 1916 View down the nave towards the chancel The original St Sabinus' Church was a small building known as the \\"Iron Church\\" erected about 200 yards up the hill out of Woolacombe. This catered for the increasing numbers of Victorian tourists who were regular visitors to the village and was extended in 1895 to include a chancel. This church was funded by the Chichester Family whose country seat was at Arlington Court 15 miles away. An appeal was launched to raise funds for a permanent church for the town. The Chichester Family donated the land, ¬£200 and the necessary stone towards the building of the churchouse. The new church was designed by the architect W. D. Car√∂e and built between 1909 and 1912 and consecrated in 1912; it is sited on the main road into the village centre and is designed to resist winter storms from the Atlantic Ocean.

The historian, originary from Alcamo, describes the presence of the Company and the Chapel with the adjoining oratory in the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in this way. Its possible founder was Father Giuseppe Terrana, guardian of the friary for several years: a group of people undertook to form the Confraternity, regulated by some chapters (religion) which were later inserted into the new ones. On 30 July 1596, after a trial period of one year, the act was renewed: the Community of the friary, besides Father Giuseppe Terrana, was represented by the Fathers Nicol√≤ Badalucco, Palma Pietro, Nicolantonio Centorbi and Fra' Vincenzo Sutera. They signed some agreements with the Confraternity of the Immaculate, represented by Vincenzo Cucinario Lo Vinario, governor (=President), the councillors, the master Vincenzo La Ghirlanda, the chancellor Leonardo da Messana and the cashier Michelangelo Ferrara. Following this enactment, the monastery annexed the Confraternity and undertook to take part in the legacies of maritaggio and gave it a warehouseVincenzo Regina, Una compagnia quattro volte centenaria e l'Immacolata nel culto e nell'iconografia alcamese, Cassa Rurale ed Artigiana di Alcamo \\"Don Rizzo\\", 1995. against a charge. The Confraternity made the commitments to celebrate the festivity of the Immaculate every year, to leave the wax offered for its dead brethren to the friary, take part in the procession of Corpus Domini and carry the baldachin; they also were allowed to receive alms, goods and administer them. After the first approval of its Statute by the bishop Luciano de Rubeis in 1599, it was approved for the second time in 1697, with some additions and a praise by the bishop Bartolomeo Castelli. The eulogy was for some chapters which were enunciated in a very wise way: in fact the brethren's number does not have to exceed 50 (because multitude badly ordered degenerates into confusion), the administrators, over-25, last only one year acciocch√© ognuno delli fratelli partecipino dell'honoranze e delle fatiche (cap.III) (=in this way each brother can take part in the honours and labour), li fratelli debbiano essere sempre honesti e non giocare a giochi proibiti, ne quelli star a vedere, ne mai biasimare ne mai mormorare ne dir male di alcuna persona, conservando i matrimoni come sonno obbligati per legge divina, e l'altri vivere in castit√† e pudicitia (cap.XVI). (that is: \\"They must be honest and not to play forbidden games, neither watch other playing them, never blame or denigrate any people, saving their weddings in the way they are obliged by divine law, and the unmarried live in chastity and prudery\\".). This old Statute was abrogated in the 1954, when the Curia Vescovile of Trapani stated a new one by decree, removing some initial rites and duties; besides, it qualified the Company as a Confraternity. At the beginning the Confraternity was made up with civilian people, teachers and priests\\"; today most of the brethren belong to the working class. It is one of the oldest confraternities that pursues for the Immaculate Conception, preparing the solemn festivity with a novenary. In 1600 every congregation, confraternity or company adopted its own tunic with a visor which prevented others to recognize their members. Later the brethren wearing this garment were called wolves, because of this mask. Today the members of the Compagnia dell'Immacolata still wear a white tunic with a cincture and a small mantle with a white visor on their heads. Description =The Chapel= The Chapel of the Immaculate The Company has its own chapel inside the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, located on the right side of the entrance of the Church.Touring Club.com ‚Äì S. Francesco d'Assisi They celebrated here all the religious functions provided by the Statute: the introduction of new members, the washing of 12 brethren by the Governor on Maundy Thursday, the office for the dead members' burial, and the weekly meetings which took place every Saturday (the so-called sabatini). On both sides of the first part of the chapel they buried some friars of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual: at the corner of the pillar on the left there is a stone clothing and the stairs leading to the big sepulture where they buried the dead brethren, due to the shortage of cemeteries. Inside the chapel, besides the painting made by Giuseppe Carrera and the wooden statue placed in the niche, there are 4 paintings realized by Rosolino La Mattina which represent the most important circumstances during the life of the Virgin Immaculate: the Visitation (Christianity), the Annunciation, the Marriage, the Nativity of Jesus. On the ceiling, on the occasion of the Great Jubilee, the same painter made a fresco representing God the Father while creating the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, by painting her like a picture.

Carrera had to paint a picture large 4 metres by 2,75 metres, representing the Immaculate Conception with the crescent under her feet and the symbols of her mysteries, and also 34 paintings, 4 palms large and 13 centimetres high, with the image chosen by the member paying for its cost, with the right to put his name and the family crest. The works were completed in 1613: the 34 paintings existed until 1927, then they were destroyed due to the spoiling of the ceiling following the leaking of rainwater. =The Statue= The present wooden statue, venerated in the Church, was carved in 1695 by Ignazio Ingrassia (a sculptor from Trapani) at the expense of the members of the Company. It was gilded by Mariano Pisano: in 1738 this coating was modified by Gioacchino Restivo.Cataldo, Carlo (1992). I giardini di Adone- Fede,feste e sinodi diocesani nel folklore di Alcamo p.319-323. Alcamo: Ed. Grafiche Campo. The statue, instead, has recently been restored in 1982 and in 2013. =The festivity= The Procession of 8 December (in the '60s) During the days before the feast of 8 December there is a solemn novenary and the simulacrum of the Immaculate is placed on the high altar; they put some decorations on the walls and embellish the altar with flowers. After the recital of the Rosary, a Father expert in homiletics, usually a stranger, will preside the Holy Mass. In ancient times it was a pleasure to listen to these sermons, as they were real orators. After Mass they say the Stellario, and finally there is the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament. On the eve of the feast, after the evening Mass, there are the solemn Vespers, with the presence of the Arcipriest of Alcamo, the believers, the members of Compagnia dell'Immacolata, the civil and military authorities. Since 1948, following the official invitation by Salvatore Pugliesi (president of the Company at that time), the Lord Mayor, his municipal Administration, together with the other authorities and the Clergy, take part in the Vespers of the eve, the morning solemn Mass of 8 December, presided by the Bishop or his Vicary, and finally, in the afternoon procession. Every year, since 1954 (Marian year) on the eve of the festivity of the Immaculate, the Lord Mayor offers a Church candle, 5 kilos heavy, to Our Lady and entrusts the town under her protection. After the end of Vespers the Premiato Complesso Bandistico \\"Citt√† di Alcamo\\", whose service has been paid by the municipal Administration for more than 100 years, play the two characteristic pastorals (called \\"ninnareddi\\" in sicilian) composed by the bandmasters Surdi and Barbera; at dawn of 8 December, the Band goes round the town and plays these melodious pastorals. =Stellario= Stellario is a prayer referring to the crown with twelve stars placed on the head of the statues and pictures of The Virgin Mary: it has inspired this ancient devotion: the stellario of the Immaculate, with the 12 blessings given by the Holy Trinity to Her. The stars are twelve because traditionally twelve is a number rich with symbols. During the prayer they contemplate the privileges of Mary, in groups of four, each one preceded by the Lord's Prayer and a Gloria Patri; at the end of every privilege they say a Hail Mary. Then there are three Lord's Prayers, three Gloria and 12 Hail Mary; finally a prayer of entrusting to the Immaculate. In Alcamo the 12 verses are alternated in this way: one is sung, the other is said. If you want to see the comple text, here is a link: http://www.unavox.it/Strumenti/Preghiere/Stellario_Maria_Immacolata.html =Saint Benedict Joseph Labre= As this saint wanted to visit the Sanctuary of Madonna of Miracles of Alcamo, he lodged in the Oratory of the Compagnia dell'Immacolata four days in 1777: then he went to Erice on foot, and visited also the sanctuary of Maria Santissima of Custonaci and then the sanctuary of Madonna of Trapani. He finally arrived in Rome on the Wednesday of the Holy Week and died there on 16 April 1783. In 1883, on the first centenary of his death, Giuseppe Provenzano (President of the Company pro tempore) commissioned the painting of a portrait of this saint to Nicol√≤ Pizzitola, a painter from Alcamo. In 1983 it was restored by Professore Rosolino La Mattina from Palermo. =Administration= According to its statute, the Confraternity is run by an administration, elected by the members every 3 years, and is formed by the President, 2 administrators, the Secretary, the cashier, the prefect and the Master of Novices, chosen by the Parson of the Church. Within a week, the proc√®s-verbal of the election is sent to the Bishop for its approval; then the new administrators are in charge. The last four presidents are: Salvatore Pugliesi, Antonino Corrao, Giuseppe Coppola and Gian Battista Giaconia (in charge at present).

Practitioners of slow medicine have published several different definitions, but the common emphasis is on the word \\"slow,\\" meaning to allow the medical practitioner to have sufficient time with the patient. Like for the slow food movement, slow medicine is a call to balance over-emphasis on fast processes which reduce quality. \\"The Doctor\\" by the British artist Luke Fildes.  Development of slow medicine The first mention of slow medicine in print took place in the first decade of the twenty-first century, about fifteen years after the start of the slow food movement in Italy. In the year 2002 an article was published in an Italian medical journal which used the words \\"slow medicine\\" to mean an approach to medicine which would allow practitioners sufficient time to evaluate the patient and his or her wider social context, to reduce anxiety, to evaluate new methods and technologies, to prevent premature release from the hospital and also to provide adequate emotional support. Later, in English-language publications, several physicians independently started using the term slow medicine. A slow medicine society was formed in Italy in the year 2011, and the first Italian national conference on slow medicine took place in Turin, Italy in November, 2011. Since that time, slow medicine societies have been formed in other countries. Principles of slow medicine Different medical practitioners emphasize different aspects of medicine when using the term \\"slow medicine.\\" For some, slow medicine means taking time and not rushing when evaluating a patient. For others, slow medicine is a careful evaluation of medical evidence and a desire not to \\"overdiagnose\\" or \\"overtreat.\\" The original Slow Medicine society in Italy points to three key words of being \\"measured,\\" \\"respectful\\" and \\"equitable,\\" which focuses on the social and political aspects of medicine. One early practitioner of slow medicine sees the patient in the metaphor of a plant which needs to be nourished and for impediments to be removed in order to allow healing to occur.

It was created and edited by Peter Hutchinson, Kelly Nyks, and Jared P. Scott. It lays out Chomsky's analysis of neoliberalism. It focuses on the concentration of wealth and power in United States over the past forty years, analyzing the phenomenon known as income inequality. The book was published by Seven Stories Press in 2017.  Synopsis  The book charts Chomsky's analysis of the concentration of wealth from the 1970s to now. Chomsky analyzes the way in which power relations shifted from the late 1940s to today, in the name of \\"plutocratic interests\\". This shift in power relations ends up being an assault \\"on lower- and middle-class people, which has escalated in recent decades during the ascendancy of what is known as 'neoliberalism' ‚Äì with fiscal austerity for the poor and tax cuts and other subsidies for the wealthy minority.\\" Chomsky is most interested in how the rise of financialization, which \\"is a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes,\\"Palley, Thomas. \\"Financialization: What It Is and Why It Matters\\". ‚ÄúFinance-led Capitalism?

This has been shown to lead to phenomena like the richest people in the world having as much wealth as the bottom half of the world. = Summary of the ten principles = Chomsky starts by observing that concentration of wealth yields concentration of power, particularly so as the cost of elections skyrockets, which forces the political parties into the pockets of major corporations. This political power then quickly translates into legislation that increases the concentration of wealth. Hence, fiscal policy like tax policy, deregulation, rules of corporate governance and a whole variety of political measures increase the concentration of wealth and power which, in turn, yields more political power to the rich. The book is organized around what Chomsky argues are the 10 principles which lead to this concentration of wealth and power. # Reduce Democracy: James Madison, one of the founding fathers of the United States constitution pointed out that with more democracy, the poor could be able to join forces and take away the property of the rich, in his own words \\"the major concern of society has to be to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority\\". Aristotle's Politics points out the same dilemma but proposes a different solution, instead of 'reducing democracy' he suggests to reduce inequalities with what we nowadays call a welfare state. The United States has seen an ongoing clash between pressure for more freedom and democracy (coming from below) and elite control (coming from above). For instance, the 1960s were a period of significant democratization during which consciousness about minority rights, women's rights, the environment and warfare shifted. # Shape Ideology: This period of democratization was followed by a backlash from multinational corporations and financial institutions in the 1970s. On the right side, the Powell Memorandum warned that business was losing control of society and that something had to be done to control these forces. On the liberal side, similar ideas arose. The first major report of the Trilateral Commission warns about 'the crisis of democracy', more precisely an 'excess of democracy'. In this report, liberals were particularly concerned with was happening to young people \\"the young people are getting too free and independent\\" and the schools and the universities are responsible for the \\"indoctrination of the young\\". Interestingly, this report never mentions private business. This omission can be interpreted as private business being de facto the national interest. # Redesign the Economy # Shift the Burden # Attack Solidarity # Run the Regulators # Engineer Elections # Keep the Rabble in Line # Manufacture Consent # Marginalize the Population  Reception  Reception to this has been generally positive, with Publisher's Weekly saying \\"Chomsky and his collaborators have created a perceptive and revelatory examination of the forces driving America inequality.\\"  Film  A documentary film of the same name, Requiem for the American Dream,Requiem for the American Dream, PF Pictures, Accessed August 3, 2017 featuring Noam Chomsky and directed by Peter D.

While themes and elements change across the series, each game is based on planning out a bridge across a river or ravine using a number of parts, limited by the geometry of the space and the total cost of the parts. The goal for each scenario is to make sure that one or more vehicles driving across the bridge can reach the other side safely. History The GIF image that was posted to Reddit that led to the success of Bridge Constructor in North America. It shows the typical gameplay of the series, having constructed a bridge to the stage's limitations by testing that bridge by setting a vehicle (in this case, a tanker-truck) across it. The first Bridge Constructor game, eponymous to the series, was released for Microsoft Windows on 1 December 2011. While it was generally successful in Europe and topped the app charts there, it didn't really catch on in North America until after a Reddit post by a player of the game within the \\"GamePhysics\\" subforum in March 2014. The post showed a GIF- image of a truck just making it across a bridge as it was collapsing underneath it. This created a large interest in the title, resulting it being the top paid iOS within 10 days of the image's posting. Headup Games took initiative to offer sales on the game and cross-promote the other titles in the series. With the boost in North America, the game saw over 27 million free and paid downloads, and a \\"good seven-digit figure\\" in paid sales by March 2014, according to Gregor Ebert of Headup Games. Games =Bridge Constructor (2011)= =Bridge Constructor Playground (2012)= =Bridge Constructor Medieval (2013)= =Bridge Constructor Stunts (2015)= =Bridge Constructor Portal (2017)= Bridge Constructor Portal was announced in December 2017, for release on mobile and personal computers later that same month, and for consoles in 2018. Developed under license from Valve, the game sets challenges in the Aperture Laboratory facilities from the Portal series, under the watchful eye of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The game will use the same core gameplay of Bridge Constructor, but add in elements from Portal such as the wormhole-like portals, turrets, and other features. =Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead (2020)= Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead was revealed in August 2020 at Gamescom. It was confirmed to be released later in 2020.

It is situated in Bansko Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province. Yulen was declared on 26 August 1994 to monitor the growth of alpine plant species without human influence, as well as to protect rare plant and animal species. It spans a territory of 3156 ha or 31.56 km2.  Geographic overview  Yulen is situated at an altitude between 1600 m and 2851 m. The rocks are predominantly granite and gneiss, but there are also carbonate rock. The reserve is rich in water resources and protects a number of glacial lakes, such as the Vasilashki Lakes, Tipitski Lakes, Gazeyski Lakes, Polezhanski Lakes and others which are the source of several rivers. The climate is alpine due to the high altitude. The soils are mainly brown forest and alpine meadow soils.  Flora  The flora consists of over 700 species of vascular plants; of them 44 are included in the Red Book of Bulgaria. Some of the important species are globeflower (Trollius europaeus), narcissus anemone (Anemone narcissiflora), Aquilegia aurea, lake quillwort (Isoetes lacustris) ‚Äì the only place where this plant is found in Bulgaria, Rhynchocorys elephas, curly sedge (Carex rupestris), etc. There are glacial relicts such as black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) and creeping sibbaldia (Sibbaldia procumbens). There are old growth forests of Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and European silver fir (Abies alba), as well as isolated groups of Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii).  Fauna  The most typical mammals in Yulen are brown bear, gray wolf and chamois. Birds are of species conservation importance and include spotted nutcracker, jack snipe, western capercaillie, rock partridge, horned lark, golden eagle, northern goshawk, etc. In sunnier areas there are common European vipers. The rivers and some of the glacial lakes have abundant brown trout populations.  Landmarks  On the territory of the Yulen Reserve there is fortress from the Antiquity. The fortress is located at about 12 km from the town of Bansko. The excavations and the archaeological finds date its foundation from before the rule of the Roman Empire. The fortress is almost 100 m in length and between 25 and 40 m wide. The only visible remains of fortification is a small section of the northern walls.

He was exiled by the verdict of the Odessa court for the organization of the South-Russian Workers Union. Being imprisoned and exiled from 1900 to 1902, Trotsky married and actively engaged in both self-education (which included reading the classics of Marxism) and journalistic work. Under the pseudonym \\"Antid Oto\\" Trotsky collaborated with the newspaper \\"Vostochnoye obozreniye\\" (, \\"The Eastern Review\\"), which published three dozen of his articles and essays, warmly accepted by the audience. During his first exile, the future Soviet People's Commissar was involved in literary studies, was writing about general issues of sociology and creativity, plus - about the themes of Siberian peasant life. Traveling between the villages of Ust-Kut, Nizhne-Ilimsk and the city of Verkholensk, Trotsky came into contact with many former and future revolutionary personalities, including Moisei Uritsky and Felix Dzerzhinsky. The printed works of Trotsky, published even in Western Europe, as well as his public lectures in Irkutsk, attracted attention of the leaders of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) to the young revolutionary: he was escaped from the Siberian exile. As a result, Trotsky left his wife with two little daughters. After the escape, he first appeared in Vienna and then in London, where his first meeting with Vladimir Lenin - who had recently published his book \\"What Is To Be Done?\\" - took place. Historians of the 21st century believed that staying in Siberia and contacts with local revolutionaries were of great importance for shaping the political views of the future leader of the October Revolution - for \\"his political self- determination\\".

It is based on the novel The Temptation to Be Happy by Lorenzo Marone. Plot Lorenzo, an elderly retired lawyer, has just had a heart attack but in the hospital he refuses to speak with his children Elena and Saverio, with whom he has no relationship. The only relative with whom he has affectionate relations is Francesco, the son Elena had while studying in Egypt to become an interpreter. Back home, Lorenzo makes the acquaintance of Michela, his new neighbor, who moved with her husband Fabio and their two children to the apartment next to his, while he was in hospital. Lorenzo grows fond of this family from the north, especially Michela who invites him to smile more, proving to be an affectionate presence in his solitary life. Lorenzo soon discovers that Fabio, a neurotic engineer, is unable to bond with his children, just like him. One Sunday, speaking with Michela, Lorenzo confides that when his children were children, he loved them very much, but once they grew up he was completely detached from them. Michela speculates that it is a psychological defense not to feel pain in seeing them suffer. Point on the spot, Lorenzo leaves the house. In the evening, on his return, the elderly lawyer discovers that Fabio has committed a massacre by killing his children and committing suicide. The only survivor is Michela who is hospitalized dying at the hospital. Posing as her father, Lorenzo visits her constantly. During this period in which he visits Michela daily, Lorenzo meets Aurora, Fabio's mother, already paranoid and unable to manage relationships with others since he was a child, and returns to find his old lover Rossana, whose relationship now ended seems to have led to the starvation of Lorenzo's wife. Discovered that he is not Michela's father, Lorenzo receives a restraining order and it comes to light that during the exercise of his profession, Lorenzo had won all the cases, but had repeatedly cheated the state by putting himself at the service of false invalids or for scams. One morning Michela dies and Lorenzo moves away from home causing agitation to his daughter Elena, who despite her father's silence had always worried about him hoping for a reconciliation. A few days later, Lorenzo goes to court, where he witnesses his daughter's work as an interpreter during a trial. Once the session is over, Elena leaves the court and finds her father sitting on a bench. Silently she sits beside her and he, without saying anything, shakes her hand.

Myriophora are flies that kill their definitive host, millipedes.  Geographic distribution  This is a \\"new world\\" parasite that has been found in the Southwestern part of the United States, and Central America specifically, Costa Rica  Attraction to host's natural defense  Myriophora are initially attracted to the chemical toxin released by their host that is used to keep predators away. However, this same toxin is what attracts the Myriophora. Specifically, the flies are more attracted when 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone is combined with another chemical 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone.  Morphology  An adult female body length ranges form 1.54-1.93 mm. Each adult has one ovipositor located on the posterior end of the parasite that is a needle like shape. It has two wings and each wing ranges from 1.4-1.96mm in length. The top half of the parasite is brown and the bottom half is white.  Life cycle  When an adult female Myriophora locates a millipede, it uses its ovipositor to penetrate the millipede in an unprotected areas (e.g. base of the antennae, between body segments, and the unprotected underbelly) of the millipede. An egg is delivered through the ovipositor and hatches inside of the millipede. Once the egg hatches, the maggot ingests the insides of the millipede a process that takes approximately five days. Once the millipede is fully consumed, all that will be left is the hind-gut and the exuvia. The Myriophora maggot then metamorphoses into an adult fly.

He is credited with the founding of religious institutions and the revival of Torah study in Tripoli, Libya, in the mid-sixteenth century, where he served as spiritual leader and dayan (rabbinical court judge) for more than three decades. He authored a commentary on the Zohar titled Ketem Paz and the piyyut, \\"Bar Yochai\\", a kabbalistic hymn which became widely popular in the Jewish world. Libyan Jews consider him their greatest scholar. Biography As a child, Lavi was expelled from his homeland of Spain together with his family in the Spanish Expulsion of 1492. They resettled in Fez, Morocco, where Lavi studied both Torah and Kabbalah. In 1549 Lavi set out to immigrate to Israel, but was kidnapped and held for ransom by \\"Arab bandits\\". He was redeemed and came to Tripoli, where he found the community lacking spiritual guidance and decided to settle there instead. Lavi is credited with the founding of the Tripoli Jewish community's religious institutions, the revival of Torah study, and the establishment of takkanot (Jewish community regulations). Serving as a posek and dayan (rabbinical court judge), Lavi put the rabbinical court on a firm footing and appointed more judges to lead the community into the future. In later generations, Tripoli Jews had the custom of reciting a memorial prayer every Yom Kippur eve on behalf of all the judges who had served on the rabbinical court from Lavi's time to the present. Lavi's efforts to revive Torah education also halted the spiritual decline among Tripoli Jewry; 300 years after his death, eleven rabbinical academies were operating in the city. Libyan Jews consider Lavi their greatest scholar. An outstanding kabbalist, Lavi incorporated the study of Jewish mystical texts into the community's daily ritual. The Zohar took its place as a holy book alongside the Tanakh and Talmud, with people reading from it on weekdays, Shabbats, and at special social gatherings. Lavi fixed the prayer rite in Tripoli according to the Sephardi custom. His piyyut, \\"Bar Yochai\\", was sung every Friday night by Tripoli Jews to the melody that Lavi himself composed. Lavi also served as a physician to the Turkish governor and represented the Jewish community to the ruling authorities. He was said to be highly respected by the government ministers. Works =Ketem Paz= Around 1570 Lavi authored a commentary on the Zohar (Books of Genesis and Exodus). The commentary was noted for its emphasis on the peshat (direct meaning) of the Zohar text rather than on derush (comparative analysis). In addition to his kabbalistic discussion, Lavi displayed knowledge of and partiality toward alchemy. The manuscript remained in handwritten form until 1795, when wealthy Tripoli Jews arranged for the publication of the commentary for the Book of Genesis only, in two parts. The title of this work, Ketem Paz, was chosen by the Chida, who was in Livorno while the work was being printed there. Additionally, Lavi wrote the commentary Bi'ur Millot Zarot she'b'Sefer HaZohar (Explanation of Foreign Words in the Book of the Zohar), which displays his mastery of Spanish and Arabic. This work was published in Yad Ne'eman (1804) by Rabbi Avraham Miranda. Lavi also wrote the Seder Tikkunei Kallah, readings for Shavuot night (Venice, 1680). =\\"Bar Yochai\\"= Lavi composed numerous piyyutim, the most well-known of which is \\"Bar Yochai\\", written in praise of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, author of the Zohar. This composition displays Lavi's mastery of Torah and Kabbalah, as the rhyming stanzas incorporate expressions from the Tanakh, rabbinical teachings and ideas, and expressions from the Zohar and other mystical texts. The first letter of each stanza forms an acrostic of the author's name. Lavi sang the song both in Hebrew and in a Judeo-Arabic translation. The song was brought to Safed, Palestine, and was accepted by the students of the Arizal, who in turn brought it to Europe. It was first printed at the beginning of the seventeenth century in Prague and Krakow. In the 1795 printing of Ketem Paz, this and other compositions by Lavi were included. The song became widely popular in the Jewish world. Customs vary regarding singing the song on the Shabbat, but all communities, Sephardi and Ashkenazi alike, sing it on Lag BaOmer, the Yom Hillula of Shimon bar Yochai. Tomb Lavi's tomb in Tripoli was visited by Jewish pilgrims from throughout Libya both during the year and on his Yom Hillula. The tomb was also venerated by Muslims, who called him \\"Ibn Limam\\".

The approach is an attempt to more closely mimic biological neural organization. The idea is to add structures called ‚Äúcapsules‚Äù to a convolutional neural network (CNN), and to reuse output from several of those capsules to form more stable (with respect to various perturbations) representations for higher capsules. The output is a vector consisting of the probability of an observation, and a pose for that observation. This vector is similar to what is done for example when doing classification with localization in CNNs. Among other benefits, capsnets address the \\"Picasso problem\\" in image recognition: images that have all the right parts but that are not in the correct spatial relationship (e.g., in a \\"face\\", the positions of the mouth and one eye are switched). For image recognition, capsnets exploit the fact that while viewpoint changes have nonlinear effects at the pixel level, they have linear effects at the part/object level. This can be compared to inverting the rendering of an object of multiple parts.  History  In 2000, Geoffrey Hinton et al. described an imaging system that combined segmentation and recognition into a single inference process using parse trees. So-called credibility networks described the joint distribution over the latent variables and over the possible parse trees. That system proved useful on the MNIST handwritten digit database. A dynamic routing mechanism for capsule networks was introduced by Hinton and his team in 2017. The approach was claimed to reduce error rates on MNIST and to reduce training set sizes. Results were claimed to be considerably better than a CNN on highly overlapped digits. In Hinton's original idea one minicolumn would represent and detect one multidimensional entity.  Transformations  An invariant is an object property that does not change as a result of some transformation. For example, the area of a circle does not change if the circle is shifted to the left. Informally, an equivariant is a property that changes predictably under transformation. For example, the center of a circle moves by the same amount as the circle when shifted. A nonequivariant is a property whose value does not change predictably under a transformation. For example, transforming a circle into an ellipse means that its perimeter can no longer be computed as œÄ times the diameter. In computer vision, the class of an object is expected to be an invariant over many transformations. I.e., a cat is still a cat if it is shifted, turned upside down or shrunken in size. However, many other properties are instead equivariant. The volume of a cat changes when it is scaled. Equivariant properties such as a spatial relationship are captured in a pose, data that describes an object's translation, rotation, scale and reflection. Translation is a change in location in one or more dimensions. Rotation is a change in orientation. Scale is a change in size. Reflection is a mirror image. Unsupervised capsnets learn a global linear manifold between an object and its pose as a matrix of weights. In other words, capsnets can identify an object independent of its pose, rather than having to learn to recognize the object while including its spatial relationships as part of the object. In capsnets, the pose can incorporate properties other than spatial relationships, e.g., color (cats can be of various colors). Multiplying the object by the manifold poses the object (for an object, in space).  Pooling  Capsnets reject the pooling layer strategy of conventional CNNs that reduces the amount of detail to be processed at the next higher layer. Pooling allows a degree of translational invariance (it can recognize the same object in a somewhat different location) and allows a larger number of feature types to be represented. Capsnet proponents argue that pooling: * violates biological shape perception in that it has no intrinsic coordinate frame; * provides invariance (discarding positional information) instead of equivariance (disentangling that information); * ignores the linear manifold that underlies many variations among images; * routes statically instead of communicating a potential \\"find\\" to the feature that can appreciate it; * damages nearby feature detectors, by deleting the information they rely upon. Capsules  A capsule is a set of neurons that individually activate for various properties of a type of object, such as position, size and hue. Formally, a capsule is a set of neurons that collectively produce an activity vector with one element for each neuron to hold that neuron's instantiation value (e.g., hue). Graphics programs use instantiation value to draw an object. Capsnets attempt to derive these from their input. The probability of the entity's presence in a specific input is the vector's length, while the vector's orientation quantifies the capsule's properties. Artificial neurons traditionally output a scalar, real-valued activation that loosely represents the probability of an observation. Capsnets replace scalar-output feature detectors with vector-output capsules and max-pooling with routing-by- agreement. Because capsules are independent, when multiple capsules agree, the probability of correct detection is much higher. A minimal cluster of two capsules considering a six-dimensional entity would agree within 10% by chance only once in a million trials. As the number of dimensions increase, the likelihood of a chance agreement across a larger cluster with higher dimensions decreases exponentially. Capsules in higher layers take outputs from capsules at lower layers, and accept those whose outputs cluster. A cluster causes the higher capsule to output a high probability of observation that an entity is present and also output a high-dimensional (20-50+) pose. Higher-level capsules ignore outliers, concentrating on clusters. This is similar to the Hough transform, the RHT and RANSAC from classic digital image processing.  Routing by agreement  The outputs from one capsule (child) are routed to capsules in the next layer (parent) according to the child's ability to predict the parents' outputs. Over the course of a few iterations, each parents' outputs may converge with the predictions of some children and diverge from those of others, meaning that that parent is present or absent from the scene. For each possible parent, each child computes a prediction vector by multiplying its output by a weight matrix (trained by backpropagation). Next the output of the parent is computed as the scalar product of a prediction with a coefficient representing the probability that this child belongs to that parent. A child whose predictions are relatively close to the resulting output successively increases the coefficient between that parent and child and decreases it for parents that it matches less well. This increases the contribution that that child makes to that parent, thus increasing the scalar product of the capsule's prediction with the parent's output. After a few iterations, the coefficients strongly connect a parent to its most likely children, indicating that the presence of the children imply the presence of the parent in the scene. The more children whose predictions are close to a parent's output, the more quickly the coefficients grow, driving convergence. The pose of the parent (reflected in its output) progressively becomes compatible with that of its children. The coefficients' initial logits are the log prior probabilities that a child belongs to a parent. The priors can be trained discriminatively along with the weights. The priors depend on the location and type of the child and parent capsules, but not on the current input. At each iteration, the coefficients are adjusted via a \\"routing\\" softmax so that they continue to sum to 1 (to express the probability that a given capsule is the parent of a given child.) Softmax amplifies larger values and diminishes smaller values beyond their proportion of the total. Similarly, the probability that a feature is present in the input is exaggerated by a nonlinear \\"squashing\\" function that reduces values (smaller ones drastically and larger ones such that they are less than 1). This dynamic routing mechanism provides the necessary deprecation of alternatives (\\"explaining away\\") that is needed for segmenting overlapped objects. This learned routing of signals has no clear biological equivalent. Some operations can be found in cortical layers, but they do not seem to relate this technique. = Math/code = The pose vector mathbf{u}_{i} is rotated and translated by a matrix mathbf{W}_{ij} into a vector mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji} that predicts the output of the parent capsule. :mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji} = mathbf{W}_{ij} mathbf{u}_{i} Capsules s_{j} in the next higher level are fed the sum of the predictions from all capsules in the lower layer, each with a coupling coefficient c_{ij} :s_{j} = sum{c_{ij} mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji}}  Procedure softmax  The coupling coefficients from a capsule i in layer l to all capsules in layer l+1 sum to one, and are defined by a \\"routing softmax\\". The initial logits b_{ij} are prior log probabilities for the routing. That is the prior probability that capsule i in layer l should connect to capsule j in layer l+1. Normalization of the coupling coefficients: :begin{array}{lcl} 1: mathbf{procedure}~ mathrm{softmax} ( mathbf{b}, i )  2: quad triangleright mbox{argument matrix}  3: quad triangleright mbox{argument scalar}  4: quad triangleright mbox{memorize on}~mathbf{b}  5: quad triangleright mbox{return vector}  6: quad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{index}~i,j~mathbf{do}  7: qquad c_{ij} leftarrow frac{e^{b_{ij}}}{sum_{k}{e^{b_{ik}}}}  8: quad mathbf{return}~ mathbf{c}_{i}  end{array} For this procedure to be optimum it would have to memorize several values, and reset those values on each iteration. That is if the vector mathbf{b} changes, then the memorized values must be updated. It is not shown how this should be done. Neither memorizing the divisor is shown.  Procedure squash  Because the length of the vectors represents probabilities they should be between zero (0) and one (1), and to do that a squashing function is applied: :begin{array}{lcl} 1: mathbf{procedure}~ mathrm{squash} ( mathbf{a} )  2: quad triangleright mbox{argument vector}  2: quad triangleright mbox{return vector}  3: qquad mathbf{a} leftarrow frac{mathbf{a}^2}{1+mathbf{a}^2} frac{mathbf{a}}{mathbf{a}}  4: quad mathbf{return}~ mathbf{a}  end{array} A vector squashed to zero has a vanishing gradient.  Procedure routing  One approach to routing is the following :begin{array}{lcl} ~~1: mathbf{procedure}~ mathrm{routing} ( mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji}, r, l )  ~~2: quad triangleright mbox{argument vector}  ~~3: quad triangleright mbox{argument scalar}  ~~4: quad triangleright mbox{argument scalar}  ~~5: quad triangleright mbox{return vector}  ~~6: quad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{capsule}~i~mbox{in layer}~l,~mbox{capsule}~j~mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~mathbf{do}~b_{ij} leftarrow 0  ~~7: quad mathbf{for}~mbox{iteration}~r~mathbf{do}  ~~8: qquad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{capsule}~i~mbox{in layer}~l~mathbf{do}~mathbf{c}_{i} leftarrow operatorname{softmax}(mathbf{b}, i)  ~~9: qquad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{capsule}~j~mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~mathbf{do}~mathbf{s}_{j} leftarrow sum_{i}{c_{ij}mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji}}  10: qquad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{capsule}~j~mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~mathbf{do}~mathbf{v}_{j} leftarrow operatorname{squash}(mathbf{s}_{j})  11: qquad mathbf{foreach}~mbox{capsule}~i~mbox{in layer}~l,~j~mbox{in layer}~(l+1)~mathbf{do}~mathbf{b}_{ij} leftarrow mathbf{b}_{ij} + mathbf{hat{u}}_{ji} cdot mathbf{v}_{j}  12: quad mathbf{return}~mathbf{v}_{j}  end{array} At line 8, the softmax function can be replaced by any type of winner-take-all network. Biologically this somewhat resembles chandelier cells, but they can also be involved in calculation of coupling coefficients (line 9) or calculation of agreements (line 11). At line 9, the weight matrix for the coupling coefficients and the hidden prediction matrix are shown. The structure in layer I and II is somewhat similar to the cerebral cortex if stellate cells are assumed to be involved in transposing input vectors. Whether both types of stellate cells have the same function is not clear, as layer I has excitatory spiny cells and layer II has inhibitory aspiny cells. The latter indicates a much different network. At line 10, the squash function can be replaced by other functions and network topologies that retain the vector direction. The procedure conducts r iterations, usually 4‚Äì5, with l the index for the source capsule layer or primary layer, where the routing goes from, and the capsule layer l+1 the next higher layer.  Training  Learning is supervised. The network is trained by minimizing the euclidean distance between the image and the output of a CNN that reconstructs the input from the output of the terminal capsules. The network is discriminatively trained, using iterative routing-by-agreement. The activity vectors of all but the correct parent are masked. = Margin loss = The length of the instantiation vector represents the probability that a capsule's entity is present in the scene. A top-level capsule has a long vector if and only if its associated entity is present. To allow for multiple entities, a separate margin loss is computed for each capsule. Downweighting the loss for absent entities stops the learning from shrinking activity vector lengths for all entities. The total loss is the sum of the losses of all entities. In Hinton's example the loss function is: :begin{align} L_{k} & = underbrace{T_{k} ~ { max left ( 0, m^{+} -  mathbf{v}_{k}  right )}^{2}}_mbox{class present} + underbrace{lambda left ( 1 - T_{k} right ) ~ { max left ( 0,  mathbf{v}_{k}  - m^{-} right )}^{2}}_mbox{class not present} , & T_{k} = begin{cases} 1, & mbox{digit of class}~k~mbox{present}  0, & mbox{otherwise}  end{cases} end{align} This type of loss function is common in ANNs. The parameters m^{+} and m^{-} are set so the length does not max out or collapse, m^{+} = 0.9 and m^{-} = 0.1. Down-weighting of initial weights for absent classes are controlled by lambda, with lambda = 0.5 as a reasonable choice. = Reconstruction loss = An additional reconstruction loss encourages entities to encode their inputs' instantiation parameters. The final activity vector is then used to reconstruct the input image via a CNN decoder consisting of 3 fully connected layers. The reconstruction minimizes the sum of squared differences between the outputs of the logistic units and the pixel intensities. This reconstruction loss is scaled down by 0.0005 so that it does not dominate the margin loss during training.  Example configuration  The first convolutional layers perform feature extraction. For the 28x28 pixel MNIST image test an initial 256 9x9 pixel convolutional kernels (using stride 1 and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, defining 20x20 receptive fields) convert the pixel input into 1D feature activations and induce nonlinearity. The primary (lowest) capsule layer divides the 256 kernels into 32 capsules of 8 9x9 kernels each (using stride 2, defining 6x6 receptive fields). Capsule activations effectively invert the graphics rendering process, going from pixels to features. A single weight matrix is used by each capsule across all receptive fields. Each primary capsule sees all of the lower-layer outputs whose fields overlap with the center of the field in the primary layer. Each primary capsule output (for a particular field) is an 8-dimensional vector. A second, digit capsule layer has one 16-dimensional capsule for each digit (0-9). Dynamic routing connects (only) primary and digit capsule layers. A [32x6x6] x 10 weight matrix controls the mapping between layers. Capsnets are hierarchical, in that each lower-level capsule contributes significantly to only one higher-level capsule. However, replicating learned knowledge remains valuable. To achieve this, a capsnet's lower layers are convolutional, including hidden capsule layers. Higher layers thus cover larger regions, while retaining information about the precise position of each object within the region. For low level capsules, location information is ‚Äúplace-coded‚Äù according to which capsule is active. Higher up, more and more of the positional information is rate-coded in the capsule's output vector. This shift from place-coding to rate-coding, combined with the fact that higher- level capsules represent more complex objects with more degrees of freedom, suggests that capsule dimensionality increases with level.  Human vision  Human vision examines a sequence of focal points (directed by saccades), processing only a fraction of the scene at its highest resolution. Capsnets build on inspirations from cortical minicolumns (also called cortical microcolumns) in the cerebral cortex. A minicolumn is a structure containing 80-120 neurons, with a diameter of about 28-40 ¬µm, spanning all layers in the cerebral cortex. All neurons in the larger minicolumns have the same receptive field, and they output their activations as action potentials or spikes. Neurons within the microcolumn receive common inputs, have common outputs, are interconnected and may constitute a fundamental computational unit of the cerebral cortex. Capsnets explore the intuition that the human visual system creates a tree-like structure for each focal point and coordinates these trees to recognize objects. However, with capsnets each tree is \\"carved\\" from a fixed network (by adjusting coefficients) rather than assembled on the fly.  Alternatives  CapsNets are claimed to have four major conceptual advantages over convolutional neural networks (CNN): * Viewpoint invariance: the use of pose matrices allows capsule networks to recognize objects regardless of the perspective from which they are viewed. * Fewer parameters: Because capsules group neurons, the connections between layers require fewer parameters. * Better generalization to new viewpoints: CNNs, when trained to understand rotations, often learn that an object can be viewed similarly from several different rotations. However, capsule networks generalize better to new viewpoints because pose matrices can capture these characteristics as linear transformations. * Defense against white-box adversarial attacks: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is a typical method for attacking CNNs. It evaluates the gradient of each pixel against the loss of the network, and changes each pixel by at most epsilon (the error term) to maximize the loss. Although this method can drop the accuracy of CNNs dramatically (e.g.: to below 20%), capsule networks maintain accuracy above 70%. Purely convolutional nets cannot generalize to unlearned viewpoints (other than translation). For other affine transformations, either feature detectors must be repeated on a grid that grows exponentially with the number of transformation dimensions, or the size of the labelled training set must (exponentially) expand to encompass those viewpoints. These exponential explosions make them unsuitable for larger problems. Capsnet's transformation matrices learn the (viewpoint independent) spatial relationship between a part and a whole, allowing the latter to be recognized based on such relationships. However, capsnets assume that each location displays at most one instance of a capsule's object. This assumption allows a capsule to use a distributed representation (its activity vector) of an object to represent that object at that location. Capsnets use neural activities that vary with viewpoint. They do not have to normalize objects (as in spatial transformer networks) and can even recognize multiply transformed objects. Capsnets can also process segmented objects.  See also  * Convolutional neural network * Geoffrey Hinton * MNIST database  Notes  In Hinton's own words this is \\"wild speculation\\".

Club facilities included two tracks and a polo field. A grandstand was also built and inaugurated in 1900. During the first two years of existence, the club focused on equestrian activities, including dressage and other disciplines such as gymnastics and calisthenics. In June 1902, Baron Antnio de Marchi (who had married one of Roca's daughters), became president of Sociedad H√≠pica. Under his presidency, the club changed its name to \\"Sociedad Sportiva Argentina\\",Historia de la C.A.D. on Confederaci√≥n Argentina de Deportes expanding the range of activities to other sports. Club's facilities included two tracks (one of 1,100 x 20 m for trot and sulky competitions and the other of 1,000 x 20 m for show jumping). In the centre of both tracks, there was a land of 335 x 116 m used for polo and football matches. Around the tracks there also were grandstands divided into two sections, one for member and their families and another for general public. Other disciplines practised there were athletics and even car, motorcycle and bicycle racing. Football, polo and racing seasons ran from Abril to September.Julio Luqui Lagleyze, Las tierras de la Sportiva (A los 75 a√±os de la primera ascensi√≥n aerost√°tica), Instituto Argentino de Historia Aeron√°utica Jorge Newbery, Buenos Aires, 1983, p. 17 Alumni (in striped jersey) and Rosario A.C. played the Tie Cup finals of 1902 and 1903 at Sociedad Sportiva In football, the SSA held the Tie Cup finals of 1902, 1903 (played by Rosario A.C. and Alumni in both occasions) and 1905. In September 1903, the Argentina national football team played its first home game at Sociedad Sportiva, when the side lost to \\"Orientales\\" (represented by 11 Nacional players) by 3‚Äì2.

Nevertheless, the club would continue in that location during the 10 successive years. The Autom√≥vil Club Argentino was established in the SSA clubhouse. Football returned in 1905 when another English team, Nottingham Forest, toured Argentina to play a series of friendly matches, some of them at SSA. On August 15, 1905, the Argentina and Uruguay national teams played the first edition of Copa Lipton at SSA.

Segal is a research scholar at the University of Maryland and the president of the Jewish Peace Lobby. He was a candidate in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in the 2018 election in Maryland. In August 2019, he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Early life and education Segal was born and raised in The Bronx. His father, a socialist and member of the Jewish Labor Bund, was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States, where he found employment as a factory worker in the garment industry. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, Segal went to City College of New York, where he received honors in philosophy and economics, and was awarded the Brittain Prize in Moral Philosophy. Segal went on to receive a PhD from the University of Michigan, and taught in the philosophy department of the University of Pennsylvania. He later received an MPA from the Hubert Humphrey School of the University of Minnesota. Career After receiving his MPA from the University of Minnesota, Segal moved to Washington, D.C. in 1974 to work as an aide to Congressman Donald M. Fraser and administrator of the House Budget Committee's task force on distributive impacts of economic policy. In 1979, he became Coordinator for the Near East in the policy bureau of the US Agency for International Development and, later, Senior Advisor for Agency Planning. After leaving government, he joined the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland as Senior Research Scholar. Segal has been a leader of the American Jewish peace movement, starting in 1982 with Washington Area Jews for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (WAJIPP), a group that opposed the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In 1987, he traveled to Tunis to meet Yasser Arafat and leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization. No American Jewish delegation had ever met with the PLO, which the U.S. government officially considered a terrorist organization at the time. In August 1988, Israel raided the offices of Faisal al-Husseini, a Palestinian militant, and discovered a plan, based in part on earlier writings by Segal, for a declaration of Palestinian independence.\\" That plan, along with other writings by Segal in Palestinian papers such as Al-Quds, were a catalyst for the Palestinian Declaration of Independence later that year and the Palestinian peace initiative in which Israel's right to exist was recognized. In May 1989, Segal founded the Jewish Peace Lobby, which he envisioned as acting as a counterweight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The Peace Lobby remains active today, with about 5,000 members (including 400 rabbis). As a candidate In 2018, Segal announced the creation of a new socialist political party called \\"Bread and Roses\\", after raising the requisite 10,000 signatures needed by the Maryland Board of Elections. The party is named after a slogan used by striking workers during the 1912 Lawrence textile strike. Segal ran for a seat in the US Senate against Ben Cardin in the 2018 mid-term elections. After losing in the Democratic primary to Cardin, he attempted to be included in the general election under the Bread and Roses party, but was prohibited due to the \\"sore loser\\" statute of Maryland state law, which prohibits candidates from running in the general election after losing a primary. After the 2018 election, Segal submitted a petition with more than 15,000 signatures to the Maryland Board of Elections. The Board certified the Bread and Roses party in January 2019, allowing its candidates to run for office in Maryland in the 2020 election. In August 2019, Segal announced that he would run for president under the Bread and Roses party. He said that he would not compete in swing states to avoid taking votes from a Democratic candidate running against Donald Trump. The Bread and Roses party identifies itself as \\"socialistic\\" in nature, distinguishing itself from \\"traditional socialism\\". The party advocates socialist ideals such as \\"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\" while also advocating democratic principles of limited government, individual liberty and rule of law. Their website also advertises ideals like \\"plain living, high thinking and a Utopian future\\".

She appeared in almost 290 movies, including a non-pornographic film in 2016, and was nominated for several AVN Awards. In 2017, at the age of 23, Ames committed suicide after a particular event of social media backlash following a Twitter post that she had made. Life August Ames was born Mercedes Grabowski in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. She grew up in Petawawa, Ontario, and later lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado. She graduated from Oromocto High School. She was of Polish ancestry and was also one-quarter African-American. Both her parents worked in the army and she spent her early years as a military brat, including a number of years living beside Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. Ames's mother suffered from bipolar disorder. Ames alleged that she was routinely sexually molested by her paternal grandfather as a child, but her father refused to believe her and at 12 years old she was sent to live in a group home. In her early years, she worked as a nanny, animal-assisted aide, and horseback trainer. Ames was married to Kevin Moore, a pornography producer and director for Evil Angel. Weeks prior to her death, Ames had confirmed that she had a history of bipolar depressive disorder and dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality) due to a traumatic childhood, stating: \\"Some days I'll be fine and if I'm not doing anything I'll get these awful flashbacks of my childhood and I get very depressed and I can't get out of bed and cancel my scenes for like a week or two.\\" Career Ames's career as a pornographic actress began at the age of 19, in November 2013. She performed in over 270 films, including productions by companies such as Brazzers, Elegant Angel, Evil Angel, Girlfriends Films, Jules Jordan Video, New Sensations and Sweetheart Video. She was nominated for four AVN Awards in her lifetime, including three nominations for Female Performer of the Year. In 2016, she appeared in the non-pornographic film Model for Murder: The Centerfold Killer. In December 2017, Ames was due to perform in a pornographic scene, but withdrew when she learned that the co- star was a man who had appeared in gay pornography. On 3 December 2017, Ames wrote on Twitter: The tweet drew criticism and abuse from social media users. Jaxton Wheeler, a pansexual performer, demanded that Ames apologize or take a cyanide pill which he later said he regretted. Ames, who was bisexual, asserted that she loved the LGBT community and that she had a right to exercise her sexual autonomy.  Death  On 5 December 2017, two days after her tweet, Ames was found dead in a park in Camarillo, California, at the age of 23. Her death was ruled a suicide due to asphyxia by hanging by the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office. Upon her autopsy, toxicology results revealed that she had cocaine, marijuana, the antidepressant Sertraline (Zoloft), and the anxiolytic Alprazolam (Xanax) in her system at her time of death. Close friends stated that cyberbullying led her to end her life. An investigation into her suicide was covered in the Audible series The Last Days of August by Jon Ronson after her husband, Kevin Moore, encouraged Ronson and his producer to look into the cyberbullying that he claimed had led to Ames's death. In the podcast, Ronson investigates the cyberbullying aspect of the story but then goes further and looks more closely at Moore's role in Ames's death by examining his prior relationships and Ames's history of mental illness. Ronson concludes that a number of people around Ames contributed to the poor mental state that led to her death and draws comparisons between Ames's suicide and the fictional suicide of the young girl in J. B. Priestley's play An Inspector Calls. In the wake of Ames' death, and the deaths of several other adult performers that year, several initiatives within the industry were proposed to deal with the issue, including The August Project, a hotline conceived by Moore, and Pineapple Support, a non-profit organization launched in April 2018 by British performer Leya Tanit.

The 100 Gates Project began as an effort to help community revitalization in Manhattan. The mission of the project was to enhance the beauty of the neighborhoods by working exclusively with local artists and merchants to paint murals on the metal security gates of participating stores. In 2014, the project began creating murals in the Lower East Side, New York and set out to paint a total of 100 security gates. As of 2016, the project has surpassed its name and is currently working towards creating over 100 more murals in East Harlem and Downtown Staten Island combined. Natalie Raben and Ayana Hosten currently run the project by reaching out to local artists and merchants. Artwork on security gate of Mexico Travel on 238 E 116th Street, New York Artwork on security gate in front of Jahlookova on 1962 Madison Ave, New York Artwork Merchants are paired with artists to collaborate on an art piece that will be available for the public to view. The 100 Gates Project uses 50 local artists in each neighborhood to participate in the project. Mini-portfolios are created and presented to store merchants who then decide on an artist to collaborate with. The store merchant and artist meet and discuss potential ideas for the gate as a representative from the 100 Gates Project mediates the conversation. Artwork is based on what the merchant feels best represents the store and the community it is a part of. Once the final mock-up is agreed on between both the merchant and the artist, the creation of the mural occurs after business hours. Certain murals created by the 100 Gates Project try to exemplify what the store represents by including New York Skyscrapers in front and ethnic symbols, influences, or references in the background of the skyscrapers, while other gates include messages of positivity and vibrant colors. Funding In 2014, the 100 Gates Project was originally funded by the Lower East Side Partnership as they searched for merchants and artists willing to participate in the program. In 2016, Tiger Beer approached the 100 Gates Project and became a partner in helping the organization reach its goal of 100 gates. After the 100 gate goal was met, in 2017 the New York City Department of Small Business granted the 100 Gates Project the Neighborhood 360 grant to expand the project from the Lower East Side to East Harlem and Downtown Staten Island.

Biography = Youth = Vera Oredsson's father was a German engineer, soldier and a member of the Storm Detachment, and she was herself a member of the League of German Girls, the female wing of the Hitler Youth of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. During the Battle of Berlin, her family's home was hit by a firebomb. With her brother, the journalist Folke Schimanski, and their Swedish mother, she arrived in Sweden in April 1945 as a refugee via White Buses. = Life in Sweden = There, she married Sven-Olov Lindholm, the leader of the Swedish Socialist Union, in 1950. They got divorced in 1962, and then she married G√∂ran Assar Oredsson, the leader of the Nordic Realm Party. = Political activism = In 1960, Oredsson joined the Nordic Realm Party (then known as the National Socialist Combat League of Sweden) and became its party secretary in 1962. In 1975, she succeeded her husband as the party's leader, and is therefore Sweden's first female party leader.https://tv.nrk.no/serie/brennpunkt \\"Rasekrigerne\\" Just a few years after, however, in 1978, her husband became the party's leader again. Oredsson was charged in 1973 for breaking the law for political uniforms when she, her husband and Deputy Party leader Heinz Burgmeister wore armbands with swastikas. Oredsson claimed that the Swastika was not a political symbol, rather a spiritual one, and said that the armbands were only worn on private land. Varberg's District Court acquitted them. On 27 February 2018, Oredsson was found guilty of inciting racial hatred after allegedly giving a Nazi salute at one of the Nordic Resistance Movement's demonstrations in Borl√§ngehttp://expo.se/2018/vera-oredsson-doms-for-hitlerhalsning_7554.html but was later acquitted by Svea Hovr√§tt. In the 2018 election in Sweden, Oredsson ran for parliament, representing the Nordic Resistance Movement. If she had won, it would have made her the oldest member of parliament, being six years older than the current oldest MP. = Media appearance = She appeared in a documentary by NRK, the public broadcasting company of Norway, titled \\"Rasekrigerne\\" (\\"The Race Warriors\\"). The documentary was a collection of footage of demonstrations, activism and interviews from the Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi organization that Oredsson is currently a member of. In the documentary, she mourns her deceased husband G√∂ran, who died in 2010, and says \\"May the f√ºhrer take care of him. And if the F√ºhrer's not there, then may God take care of him.\\" In Rasekrigerne, she revealed her annual attendance to secret meetings in Berlin with other veterans of Nazism.

The organization is a space for LGBTQ artists to experiment with form and content. Performed work includes theatre, music, dance, spoken word, interactive media, and visual arts.  History  The venue was founded in May 1989 by writer Linda Frye Burnham and performance artist Tim Miller. They were co-directors until 1992, when Burnham stepped down, leaving Miller as Artistic Director throughout the 1990s. Danielle Brazell served the position until December 2003, when Leo Garcia took over. As of December 2017, he has developed over 650 works with the organization, and is currently the Executive Director alongside Artistic Director Patrick Kennelly. The space prides itself on avoiding censoring its artists, and has thrived so far despite historical censorships and regulations on artists discussing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, one of the key issues facing the LGBTQ community in the organization‚Äôs earlier years.  Galleries and Workshops  In addition to the main performance space, Highways also features two galleries and a workshop program, the Highways Performance Lab. Together, all the spaces present approximately 250 performances per year, and curate and exhibit about 12 contemporary visual art exhibits annually. They commission and premiere new work, organize special events, curate festivals, and offer residency and educational programs to engage community members in the arts. Some of the earliest workshops were led my Tim Miller himself, centered on gay male performance, and these workshops eventually expanded to other venues in the United States and Britain. Workshops ranged from one-day affairs to more complex processes, culminating in performances by the workshop participants. Several of Miller‚Äôs performances drew from experiences at the workshops, including his famous pieces My Queer Body and Us.  Past Artists  Highways has presented work from thousands of emerging artists and collectives. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some noteworthy artists that have had their work presented at Highways: Luis Alfaro, Elia Arce, Ron Athey, Cornerstone Theater, Quentin Crisp, Diavolo Dance Theater, Karen Finley, John Fleck, Simone Forti, Rosanna Gamson Worldwide, Stephanie Gilliland, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, The Hittite Empire, Dan Kwong, Los Angeles Poverty Dept., Victoria Marks, Sir Ian McKellan, Rudy Perez, Phranc, Denise Uyehara,  Current Festivals  = Latina/o New Works Festival & Working Titles = Latina/o New Works series, featuring new performance, spoken word, dance, and inter-disciplinary works that speak to the evolution of established and emerging Latina/o artists on both a local and international level. = Highways‚Äô Annual Poetry Festival = Features embraced local and national poets, slam champions, youth poets, editors, actors, authors, teachers and cultural workers from the queer, black, Asian, literary, Latina/o and hip-hop communities = Highways‚Äô BEHOLD!

County Department of Cultural Affairs, The Getty Grant Program and the City of West Hollywood, among others. However, due to the controversial nature of many of their projects, they have faced difficulties regarding funding in the past, including a 1995 incident regarding their Ecce Lesbo/Ecco Homo festival, which caused the NEA to revoke all their funding towards the institution and left them dependent on fund- raisers and ticket sales.

During his career (which spanned from 1952 - 1986) he held over 55 championships including 14 reigns as NWA World Tag Team Champion, most famously with Jackie Fargo as part of The Fabulous Fargos. He was a mainstay for various territories throughout the United States including NWA Mid-America, Georgia Championship Wrestling, Western States Sports and Big Time Wrestling (later World Class Championship wrestling). Gulf Coast wrestler Terry Lathan has called Fargo \\"one of the most colourful, fascinating personalities ever in wrestling\\". He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum (Class of 2014), the NWA Wrestling Legends Hall of Heroes (Class of 2009) and was an Honouree of the Cauliflower Alley Club in 2004. Professional wrestling career Donald Vincent Kalt was born on October 3, 1930. He was born in Germany but was raised in New York City and Pittsburgh, where he became involved in bodybuilding, winning the 1952 Mr. Pittsburgh bodybuilding competition. He began his professional wrestling career in Al Haft's Columbus promotion, competing under the ring name \\"Don Stevens\\", the kayfabe brother of Ray Stevens. While in Ohio, Kalt met former World Heavyweight Champion \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers, whom Kalt credits his success to. \\"He was my idol\\" Kalt said of Rogers \\"I mirrored him a little bit. He didn't mind because I was doing such a good job or it\\". He had stints under different names, including Don Juan the Magnificent - managed by Bobby Davis, also the manager of Buddy Rogers - before going to form \\"The Fabulous Fargos\\" with Jackie Fargo. \\"(They were) the best in the world. They were just ahead of their time...just way ahead of everybody else\\" Cowboy Bob Kelly said of the Fargos in \\"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams\\". They spent 1956-1960 competing throughout the United States as perhaps the most popular team of their day. Together they won the NWA World Tag Team titles in 1958 and dominated the National Wrestling Alliance during the late 1950s, headlining events throughout the northeast, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and Chicago. In 1957 Vincent J. McMahon reopened wrestling in Madison Square Garden, where the Fargos were booked. On Match 30, 1957, they headlined a World Tag Team Championship bout against Argentina Rocca and Miguel Perez before 20,125 fans which was the largest crowd drew in the area for over 25 years, dating back to Jim Londos in 1931. In the 1960s The Fabulous Fargos also embarked on successful singles runs but would reunite occasionally, especially in the South, where they had a huge run in Tennessee in 64/65. \\"When me and Jackie were together, we were the greatest team\\" Don stated, \\"that sounds like bragging, but we had a good thing going.¬î\\" In the early 1960s, Fargo became Jack Dalton and had title reigns as a tag team with Kenny Mack as a biker duo and Rene Goulet as a foreign legion duo, among others. He is retrospectively known for his many ring names in various promotions. Regardless of name, Fargo could draw money and heat in whichever territory he competed. Bob Kelly later stated that \\"it didn't matter who Don Kalt was portraying\\" and that Fargo \\"had phenomenal ring psychology\\". In Texas, Don teamed with Jim Dalton to form The Dirty Daltons. The team had success throughout the South until their breakup in 1965. In Detroit, Fargo formed a tag team with a young Greg Valentine. \\"He was a great worker\\" Valentine said of Fargo, \\"I learned a lot from him...he really helped me out a lot\\". Valentine would later introduce Don Fargo to the audience as the Fargo Brothers were induced into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, class of 2014. In 1969, Fargo formed a new team with Kenny Mack (now known as Frank Dillinger), achieving their greatest success in the World Wrestling Association, where they became two-time WWA World Tag Team Champions as \\"The Chain Gang\\". The team (and Frank Dillinger career) ended after Frank was shot and injured in a bar fight in Wisconsin. The pair had been jumped by a real biker gang who had taken offence to the Dillingers; Don Fargo escaped unscathed by jumping into a river. Fargo's autography, The Hard Way, has been called \\"required reading from how kayfabe once existed\\" due to his commitment to \\"living the gimmick\\" and being his wrestling persona at all times in public. \\"Every gimmick I did, I'm the only guy that lived. I lived it\\" Fargo said, \\"I stayed in costume 24 hours a day\\". Personal life In his later years, Fargo lived in rural woodland near Cantonment, Florida with his wife Margie and their many dogs. In the year preceding his death he had been battling cancer. He died on November 8, 2015.

Cast * Catherine Mary Stewart as Miranda Dorlac * Michael Praed as Royd Eris * John Standing as Michael D'Brannin * Lisa Blount as Audrey * Glenn Withrow as Keelor * James Avery as Darryl * Annabel Brooks as Eliza * Michael Des Barres as Jon Winderman Production =Development= The film is based on a novella that appears in George R. R. Martin's 1985 short story collection. Originally written in 1980, the 23,000-word novella was published by Analog Science Fiction and Fact. In 1981, at the request of his editor at the time, James Frenkel, Martin expanded the story into a 30,000-word piece, which was published by Dell Publishing, together with Vernor Vinge's True Names, as part of their Binary Star series. In the extended version, Martin supplied additional backstory on several characters, and named secondary characters which were not named in the original version. Nightflyers is set in the same fictional \\"Thousand Worlds\\" universe as several of Martin's other works, including Dying of the Light, Sandkings, A Song for Lya, \\"The Way of Cross and Dragon\\", \\"With Morning Comes Mistfall\\", and the stories collected in Tuf Voyaging. =Adaptation= Screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation with a screenplay co- written by Martin, with writer/producer Robert Jaffe. It was directed by Robert Collector, using the pseudonymn \\"T. C. Blake\\" as he left before post- production was completed. According to Martin, writer/producer Robert Jaffe probably adapted his script from the shorter novella version, since all the secondary characters had different names than the ones he chose in the expanded version. The film grossed $1,149,470. Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film's small budget. While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it. Home media The film was released on VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc in 1988 by International Video Entertainment.

Directed by Richard Thorpe, the film stars Buddy Roosevelt, Alma Rayford, and Rennie Young. It was released on February 13, 1927. Plot When Tom Rawlins inherits a ranch, he heads out to take possession. On the way he is waylaid by three crooks in a saloon who knock him out and take the ownership papers to the ranch. When he wakes up, he hitches a ride on a freight train which drops him off in Cactus City, the nearest town to his ranch. Shortly after his arrival, the local bank is robbed and one of the citizens is killed. Santine, the foreman at the Cross P Ranch, Rawlins' inheritance, incites the citizenry to believe that Rawlins is the culprit in the bank robbery, and he is arrested. However, while in jail he convinces the sheriff and the sheriff's daughter, Sue Conway, that he is innocent. Meanwhile Santine gets one of his henchmen, Charlie, to pose as Rawlins in order to claim possession of the ranch. Santine has been working with the attorney who drew up the will of the ranch owner to cheat Rawlins out of his inheritance. When Sue overhears that Santine actually murdered the former ranch owner, she is captured by Santine and the attorney. Rawlins escapes from the jail, and rescues Sue. During the rescue, Santine falls off a cliff to his death. Rawlins recovers his ownership papers and takes possession of his ranch, as well as getting the girl.

Motion Picture News also enjoyed the film, and while it was incredibly melodramatic, they called it a \\"good, plausible melodrama\\", which gives \\"...thrills galore and many exciting, hectic situations.\\" The felt the plot was \\"intricate and interesting\\", and praised the direction and the acting. \\"Magazine Story Provides Buddy Roosevelt With Exceptionally Fast Vehicle ‚Äì One Of His Best\\" was the subtitle of the review in The Moving Picture World.

His video essays often highlight a particular aesthetic used by film directors. He is a regular contributor for Sight & Sound magazine and is frequently commissioned by home video distributor The Criterion Collection to create supplemental videos for its releases. Video essays Kogonada made his first video essay \\"Breaking Bad // POV\\" in January 2012. Using clips from the American television series Breaking Bad, the video displays the series' use of numerous point of view shots from unusual angles and objects. Kogonada was inspired to create the video essay while he watched the series, noticing a recurring visual aesthetic used throughout the series. Kogonada's first commissioned work was for Sight & Sound magazine in February 2013, titled \\"The World According to Koreeda Hirokazu\\", which highlights director Hirokazu's regular focus on everyday life in his films. Since then, most of his video essays are commissions for companies which include the British Film Institute (publisher of Sight & Sound), The Criterion Collection, Samsung, and the Lincoln Motor Company. Kogonada's works are part of a growing movement of creating video essays as a visual form of analysis, appreciation, and criticism on the internet, with other known creators of video essays including Nelson Carvajal and Tony Zhou, as well as film critics Kevin B. Lee, Matt Zoller Seitz and Scout Tafoya. His video essay \\"Hands of Bresson\\" was chosen by filmmaker Robert Greene for Sight & Sound as one of the best documentaries of 2014, with Greene stating that works like his \\"make clear that the line between nonfiction film and video essay is at best blurry and the best work should simply be celebrated as cinema.\\" In March 2016, Kogonada was part of the official jury for the 16th LPA Film Festival at the Canary Islands, Spain, where he taught a master class and had screenings for 14 of his video essays at the \\"Bande √† part\\" section. Kogonada's video essays about influential film directors include *Breaking Bad: POV (2011) *Wes Anderson: From Above (2011) *Quentin Tarantino: From Below (2011) *Sounds of Aronofsky (2012) *Kubrick: One-Point Perspective (2012) *Ozu: Passageways (2012) *The World According to Koreeda Hirokazu (2013) *Malick: Fire & Water (2013) *What Is Neorealism? (2013) *Linklater: On Cinema & Time (2013) *Wes Anderson: Centered (2014) *The Fox & Mr. Anderson (2014) *Hands of Bresson (2014) *Eyes of Hitchcock (2014) *Trick or Truth (2014) *Auteur in Space (2015) *Mirrors of Bergman (2015) *Godard in Fragments (2016) *Way of Ozu (2016) *Once There Was Everything (2017) *Nothing at Stake (2020) Technique Kogonada's video essays typically showcase a particular theme or aesthetic regularly used by a filmmaker either throughout a filmography or within a single work. Some examples are his three video essays on the aesthetics of American director Wes Anderson, who is known for using unusually symmetrical framing in his films. His video essays are formed through the juxtaposition of images, conveying thoughts through a particular arrangement of clips. In an interview for Nashville Scene in March 2015, Kogonada likened creating video essays with preparing sushi: \\"With sushi, every cut matters. And so do the ingredients. Those two ongoing choices are the difference. What you select, and how you cut it.\\" In comparing written essays with visual essays, Kogonada noted how words form precise observations of ideas, while visuals could convey a particular idea without providing a definite explanation. He explained that \\"[i]f you want to delve deep into theory, texts are the perfect medium .... However, when I'm making visual essays, I treat words as supplementary.\\" Personal life Kogonada's identity is nearly unknown, wishing to keep his identity anonymous, although he does attend screenings of his works. He explained in an interview through e-mail for Filmmaker Magazine: \\"I like Chris Marker's idea about your work being your work. I‚Äôve also never identified much with my American name, which always feels a little strange to see or hear .... And I'm quite fond of heteronyms.\\" The moniker is taken from Kogo Noda, frequent screenwriter for Yasujiro Ozu's films.

An account told by a NgƒÅpuhi informant to British ethnographer John White of the visit of Marion du Fresne to the Bay of Islands in 1772 describes Tohitapu as participating in the massacre when du Fresne and 26 men of his crew were killed and cannibalised. Spiritual leader As a Tohunga o Tumatauenga (expert in weapons or war party chaplain) he was acknowledged by the NgƒÅpuhi of the Bay of Islands as a spiritual leader who possessed the ability of communicating between the spiritual and temporal realms through karakia (prayers), pƒÅtere (chants) or performing waiata (songs). On 28 November 1832, the Revd. Alfred Brown witnessed Tohitapu practicing as a Tohunga to foresee the success of Tƒ´tore‚Äôs second muru (war expedition)\\"Traditional Maori Concepts, Muru\\" Ministry of Justice website to Tauranga, which followed the Girls' War in the Bay of Islands.Smith, S. Percy ‚Äì Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century (Christchurch 1910) page 450. at NZETC The gate incident Tohitapu lived at Te Haumi and was a frequent visitor to the Revd. Henry Williams at Paihia. Although there occurred miss- understandings and several confrontations between them. One of the most severe was the confrontation on 12 January 1824, which was witnessed by other chiefs. The incident began when Tohitapu visited the mission. As the gate was shut, Tohitapu jumped over the fence. Williams demanded that Tohitapu enter the mission using the gate. Tohitapu was a chief and a tohunga, skilled in the magic known as makutu. Tohitapu was offended by William's demand and began a threatening haka flourishing his mere and taiaha. Williams faced down this challenge. Tohitapu then seized a pot, which he claimed as compensation for hurting his foot in jumping over the fence, whereupon Williams seized the pot from Tohitapu. The incidence continued through the night during which Tohitapu began a karakia or incantation of bewitchment. Williams had no fear of the karakia. The next morning Tohitapu and Williams reconciled their differences, although the failure of the karakia to have any effect on Henry Williams reinforced his mana and created doubt among the NgƒÅpuhi as to the powers of a Tohunga. Tohitapu remained a supporter of Williams and the mission at Paihia.Fitzgerald 2004, p. 94 (letter of 7 October 1824) In 1829, Tohitapu came to the assistance of the CMS missionaries when the action of one of the MƒÅori assistants of the mission damaged part of one of Te Koki‚Äôs houses, which was an serious offence against MƒÅori custom. Te Koki was the principal chief of the NgƒÅpuhi at Paihia, uncle of Hongi Hika, brother to Tuhikura, of NgƒÅti Rehua, and husband of Ana Hamu. Tohitapu accepted changes that followed from the work of the CMS missionaries. In March 1828, Tohitapu, Henry Williams and George Clarke were present at fighting occurring between the NgƒÅpuhi and Te Mahurehure hapu (subtribe). Tohitapu addressed the NgƒÅpuhi and ordered that no fighting would take place the next day as it was a Sunday.Missionary Register (1828) Vol. 20, page 468 The Revd A. N. Brown reported in his journal of August 1831 that Tohitapu choose to apply a less severe punishment to a slave, when the penalty under MƒÅori custom was usually death.Missionary Register (1832) Vol. 20, page 191 As a mediator Tohitapu also engaged in mediation of conflicts between NgƒÅpuhi chiefs. The death of Tiki, a son of P≈çmare I (also called Whetoi) and the subsequent death of Te Whareumu in 1828 threw the Hokianga into a state of uncertainty as the NgƒÅpuhi chiefs debated whether revenge was necessary following the death of a chief. Henry Williams, Richard Davis and Tohitapu mediated between the combatants. As the chiefs did not want to escalate the fighting, a peaceful resolution was achieved. During the Girls' War in March 1830, Tohitapu sounght the assistance of the CMS missionaries to mediated between the combatants. In December 1831, Tohitapu requested that the CMS missionaries intervene to stop the fighting at KororƒÅreka between the warriors of Tƒ´tore and Tareha. Tohitapu The journals of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries describe Tohitapu as a person of high intelligence and considerable mana among the Te Roroa and NgƒÅpuhi. The Revd. Henry Williams said ‚Äúhe is a very important person in his way, though our good folks generally cannot manage him‚Äù. Tohitapu did not renounce his status as a Tohunga and warrior or become a Christian. From January 1832 until late July 1832 Tohitapu was part of the muru,\\"Traditional Maori Concepts, Muru\\" Ministry of Justice website or war expedition, that Tƒ´tore and NgƒÅpuhi warriors made to Tauranga, which followed the Girls' War. In February 1833, Tohitapu joined the second muru led by Tƒ´tore with Te Rarawa warriors, allies of the NgƒÅpuhi, from the North Cape back to Tauranga to continue the war expedition.Proceedings of the Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East, (1834) vol 5, page 263 Henry Williams accompanied both expeditions in an attempt to bring them to a peaceful conclusion. Tohitapu died in the Bay of Islands on 14 July 1833.Smith, S. Percy ‚Äì Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century (Christchurch 1910) page 458. online at NZETC On 17 January 1834, CMS missionaries went to Wangai, a settlement south-east of Paihia, to attend the funeral feast held at the hahunga (disinterment and bone cleansing ceremony) of the bones of Tohitapu.

She was one of the first people who studied the application of stones in cultural heritage as a legacy of physical artifacts, and intangible attributes inherited from past generations. Porter's extensive knowledge and contribution to her research can be said to have transformed this area of study into an established field of cross-disciplinary research.  Personal life  Mary ‚ÄúPolly‚Äù Winearls Porter was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk in 1886. Born to Robert Porter, an international journalist for the Times, and Alice Hobbins Porter, also a journalist, Mary enjoyed the typical childhood of a young girl at that time. During her teen years, her family had moved to Rome for her father's work and required a long stay in the city due to her mother becoming ill. While in Rome Porter began to collect Roman artifacts and developed her interest into ancient Roman architecture and society. Porter became increasingly interested in the works of Giacomo Boni and other archaeologists in Rome. However, upon finding out that only few archeologists could give her accurate information to help identify different kinds of marbles she decided to tackle this issue. The guides used by archeologists at that time differed in knowledge and Porter saw the need to create a book that would become an ultimate guide to the stones of Rome. Fuelled by her ambition and enthusiasm of youth Porter began to seriously study marble. Teaching herself, Porter developed a rudimentary understanding of the basic of geology and continued to research the various Roman architecture and stones until her family moved back to England. Her brothers were impressed with her potential and suggested to their parents that she should be given a formal education; they refused. After returning to England Porter became fascinated by the Corsi collection of antique marbles in the Oxford Museum. Here she met Henry Miers, a Professor of Mineralogy at the University, who was impressed by her frequent visits and passion and tasked her with translating the Corsi Collection from Italian to English. Following her retirement, Porter continued to be active within Somerville, often participating in the college's fundraisers and events.  Education  Mary's father, Robert Porter, found that education was unnecessary for woman. Therefore, she received a basic education; including reading and writing at home, but she never obtained a formal education during her childhood. Even so, she went against the societal demands and continued her studies to become an influential crystallographer. In 1918, eleven years after Porter published her first book, she earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of Oxford. Her success was only made when her mentor, Henry Miers, tutored her personally and urged Porter to go to university.  Career  Porter's career first began at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, where she translated various pieces of the Corsi Collection from Italian to English. She translated it, reclassified the entire collection and prepared a complete catalogue. As she began to study Corsi Collection at the Oxford University she started to work on her own book, obtaining material first-hand while studying the collections during her visits in Rome, Naples, Brussels, Edinburgh and London. With correspondence to William Brindley, co-director of Farmer & Brindley, an ancient stone collector and contractor, and her access to the ancient stone catalog at the museum, Porter was able to publish her first book, What Rome was Built With: A Description of the Stones Employed in Ancient Times for its Building and Decoration in 1907. On the cover of the book is engraved the prominent Augustan phrase, ‚ÄúI found it of brick, but left it of marble‚Äù which uniquely suits the contents of Porter's well-written volume.The analysis of the plethora of stone and marble discovered from European and Asiatic countries includes the discussion of marble that were also used in the construction of the Imperial Rome. Porter's book is concluded with two-indexes containing more than 115 entries and a list of works of reference. As a result of the success of her book What Rome was Built With: A Description of the Stones Employed in Ancient Times for its Building and Decoration and labor at Oxford University Porter began to receive offers from other museums abroad to classify and catalogue their collections of minerals and marbles. Following this success, Porter was personally tutored by Miers, who wanted her to go to university for a formal education. It was only in 1918, 11 years after publishing her first book, that Porter would earn her Bachelor of Science from the University of Oxford. During the summer of 1913, Porter returned to the US to work with pioneering geologist Florence Bascom at Bryn Mawr College. She returned to the UK to take up a scholarship at Somerville College, Oxford and finally in 1932 was awarded a Doctor of Science degree. She went on to be an influential crystallographer, working with Dorothy Hodgkin and co-editing with R. C. Spiller the Barker Index of Crystals. A year later, Porter was appointed to the Mary Carlisle Fellowship at Somerville College. Porter continued her research in crystallography well throughout her life, until the year 1959. During these years, Porter was a member of the Somerville College Council from 1937 to 1947 and became an honorary research fellow in the following year of 1948. She was also a council member for the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain from 1918 to 1921, 1929 to 1932 and a fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America from 1921 to 1927. When her mentor, Miers, took leave, Porter attended a number of academic institutions, but began her most major work with fellow geologist Florence Bascom. It was here that Porter began training as a crystallographer and was soon put into contact with Victor Goldschmidt, at the University of Heidelberg. Soon after Porter would begin working with Dorothy Hodgkin. Porter was at the forefront of emerging crystallography technologies, quickly embracing and contributing to the new era of X-ray crystallography. She was involved in publishing a number of research articles concerning X-Ray crystallography in journals such as Mineralogical Magazine, American Mineralogist, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Nature and Acta Crystallographica and continued to make contributions to the Corsi Collection at Oxford.  Major publications  She was quick to observe the lack of knowledge surrounding the stones within digs and began to record and research the stones herself at the age of 15. After being tasked with translating the Corsi Collection Porter's expertise in her field grew, and she was able to publish her book, What Rome was Built With: A Description of the Stones Employed in Ancient Times for its Building and Decoration (1907), which is still relevant in today's geological studies. Hovewer, the authenticity of Porter's work was often questioned at the time of the publication of her books, regarding the lack of basis for various statements and revisions. The most critical review of her book highlights the need to check facts represented by Porter by authorities in the field. Specifically, critics accentuate that there isn't an authority for Bruzza's assertion on which Porter bases her statement, that the columns of the original basilica were of marble at all. At the same time, Porter's book found supporters like Henry Frowd who praised Porter for providing detailed descriptions of stones and their history, as well as tracing their places of origin. Henry Frowd notes that Carrara marble industry is one of the most interesting sections written by Porter and that the book itself describes not only the stones of Rome, but the ancient quarries from which they came. Overall, What Rome was Built With: A Description of the Stones Employed in Ancient Times for its Building and Decoration is considered to be a good material that is in need of revisions. She is also known as being a co-editor of the Barker Index of Crystals.

The album was released via Six Shooter Records on July 7, 2017.  Writing and production  Whitehorse is a Canadian band consisting of husband- and-wife musicians and songwriters Luke Doucet and Melissa McClelland. For Panther in the Dollhouse, they followed their usual writing pattern: each of them wrote songs individually. In an interview with Vue Weekly, McClelland says \\"We will each have a batch of songs and the ones we both gravitate to we claim are Whitehorse songs\\". The track \\"Nighthawks\\" was written in response to Canada's Bill C-36, a law that modified the Canadian Criminal Code with respect to offenses related to prostitution. Several other songs on the album, including \\"Trophy Wife\\" and \\"Boys Like You\\", also relate to sexual politics. This theme was carried into the album launch show, which included a taping of Dan Savage's Savage Love podcast, and featured sex worker advocate Terri-Jean Bedford participating in a panel discussion. Financial support for the recording came from FACTOR and the Ontario Media Development Corporation.  Reception  On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 78/100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". Kyle Mullin, writing for Exclaim!, called Panther in the Dollhouse \\"one of the best albums of the summer, if not the year\\", and identified \\"Boys Like You\\" as one of the best songs on the album. Hal Horowitz, reviewing the album for American Songwriter, described Whitehorse's genre as \\"impossible to pigeonhole\\" and praised the album's production; Horowitz considered \\"Nighthawks\\" to be a highlight of the album. Chrissie Dickinson, wrote in the Chicago Tribune that the first single (\\"Boys Like You\\") is a \\"rhythm-heavy and shivery rock-pop song\\", and the accompanying video is \\"sleek and cinematic sendup of rock & roll stardom\\". Steve Horowitz rated the album 7/10, and said \\"the music has a strong, charismatic appeal\\" in his review for PopMatters. James Fenney, writing in Never Enough Notes, said that Whitehorse \\"swapped Americana for slick noir rock\\" for this album, and that \\"Whitehorse‚Äôs successes outweigh the problematic moments on Panther in the Dollhouse\\", rating the album 3/5.

They became the first permanent English settles in America. They named the colony of Jamestown after the English King James. The site was chosen precisely for its location and beneficial factors. Jamestown was surrounded by water on three sides of the land; this made it easily accessible for ships to come and go. It was far enough inland which made it easier to defend from a possible Spanish attack. Lastly, the land was not currently being inhabited by the natives. At the time it was said that the men had to be able to create a living before any women could be a part of the colony. In the early days of the colony, the Powhatan Indians were known for helping the settlers. They would provide food and other supplies to the English settlers. In 1609, the Powhatan tribe could not help the settlers due to a drought, and insufficient amount of supplies to share between their tribe and the settlers. This was known as the starving time in Virginia, most of the settlers had died of starvation and diseases due to the lack of supplies. The essay, A Short History of Jamestown, notes that \\"As a result they ate anything they could: various animals, leather from their shoes and belts, and sometimes fellow settlers who had already died due to starvation and disease.\\" This illustrates just how desperate for supplies and food the early settlers were.  Women's Roles Before and After European Colonization  In the early Virginia colonies, Native American women were responsible for both household tasks and hard labor in the fields. It was normal for the Native American women to have more responsibilities than men, as they were viewed as superior to men in certain ways. Powhatan women (the tribe of Pochohontas) did not eat with the men, and the men had many wives Most of the time the men would have to travel for food or trade and leave the women alone for long periods of time. Therefore, women had to be able to cope and live without relying or depending on their husbands to do the heavy lifting. Once European women arrived in the New World the views on what women's roles were conflicted. European women were always expected to do the household tasks, while caring for and teaching their children. In the eyes of European, women were never supposed to step into men's roles. Some European women were also sent into some of the Native American tribes to teach them the way of the English, primarily by teaching the women to weave clothes. as well as their religion, and culture. European wives, whose families were wealthy to own a slave did not have to complete household tasks. However, those who were not wealthy enough to own a slave did not receive any help with the house hold chores.  Why Women Came to Virginia Colonies  Women were known to provide a sense of stability. They came to the Jamestown Colony to marry men in the colony or to serve as indentured servants. Some women were also known to come to the colony at a young age with their families, such as Cecily Jordan Farrar. In 1610, the colony's focus was on establishing families. Women were married soon after their arrival to the colony, and were then expected to provide children. Women who were single could not own land after 1618, because the Virginia Company felt that if women could uphold land than they would be less likely to marry. This was a problem because early on a woman was expected to marry and produce children to support the growth of the colony. This was a concern, since \\"Women frequently gave birth to ten or twelve children, but childbirth was very dangerous for women.\\" Until 1654 and the Anthony Johnson v. John Casor case If a woman was of African descent, then she was a part of the indentured servant population, after that case there was a change in legal status and they were slaves. African American women were first brought to Virginia in 1619 three women and 20 men. They were sold into bondage to wealthy Planters like Governor George Yeardley.As time passed African American women forced to work in the fields and do jobs that were known as part of the men's role in American and European society, as well as perform domestic duties.. Black women were also seen as a way to produce native born slaves. There was class, race and gender structure in Colonial America. The female indentured servants, did not encounter any conditions different than what they experienced at home in England, from household chores to farming. The role of women was clearly defined. If of the Planter (upper) class, she was expected to supervise the slaves attending to the household, and play a supporting role to the man. The wives of farmers, found life harder, toiling dawn to dusk and beyond, in the house and in the field, but this harder life led to more dependence on and respect for the woman's role.  Women's Rights  In the Early stages of the Virginia colonies, women did not have as many rights as they did in England. Women were not able to take part in many things, such as voting, owning land, or even holding a spot in political office. If a woman was not married, then their fathers held the rights to them until married and were taken into the care of their husband. The only women allowed to escape the control of a man were widows. Even if a widow decided to remarry after her husband's death, she had the right to control her property. To keep control over the property given to her by her deceased husband, a widow would have to make legal arrangements. These arrangements would prevent a future husband from taking over the rights to the land.  Indentured Servant  Twenty African, indentured servants were brought over in a Portuguese ship in 1619 Anyone who was considered an indentured servant before this were white. Blacks were not enslaved until the case of Anthony Johnson v. John Casor in 1654. Being an indentured servant meant that one had to work for a particular time frame to pay for their transportation to the New World. They were also not allowed to be married while being an indentured servant. After they had served their time, the indentured servants were free. In the 1620s, indentured servants became the main contribution to Virginia's economy and society. Servants were a big part of maintaining the economy because without the servants and slaves Virginia would have had major economy problems. The original settlers had a hard time keeping up with all the work that needed to be done. It was common for servants and slaves to become overwhelmed with the work load that some considered running away to live life with the Indians. If a servant or slave were caught running away from their master they could be put to death, but that would be destroying personal property as slaves cost money and produced labor.. In some cases, masters would treat their indentured servants and slaves with respect rather than beating them. This provided a sense of reliability in them and made it more likely they would ask to work for the owner following year to pay that the indenture expired. In 1640, views on race changed for slaves. Women's work in the 17th Century, carrying away the communal latrine . By 1622, African American women were more valuable, since they could work in the fields and in the household. This led the Virginia company to pass a law allowing them to obtain more African American women who could provide a dual workload. Indentured servants were chattel. The master had no financial investment in them, and after they served their contract they were freed, given clothes, seed and often a plot of land. Slaves on the other hand were property and Masters had a financial investment in them, thus their well being as they were expected to produce for life and not a term of years.  Women of the Virginia Colonies  = Pocahontas (Matoaka) = 112x112px Pocahontas was the first woman to help the colonists and become a part of the Jamestown colony. She was the daughter of Wahunsenaca, the chief of the Native Russian tribe, Powhatan. Her mother died while giving birth to her, and Matoaka was later renamed Pocahontas. She was originally kidnapped by the English settlers which caused riots between the Indians and colonists. Pocahontas was viewed as a sex object by the men and held against her will. Her role early on was to bring food to the early settlers of Jamestown. She eventually became educated and was baptized into the English religion. At the time, the religion of the English Church was Protestantism. In 1614, she married an English settler, John Rolfe. Her marriage to Rolfe helped to calm the tension between the English and Native Americans. She later died in England in 1617. = Mistress Forrest = Mistress Forrest was the first English woman settler who came to Jamestown in 1608. Mistress came alongside her husband Thomas and maid. She was also the first woman in Jamestown to give birth to a child. Mistress and her maid Anne Burris were said to be the only two women of the colony until 1609 when another ship came over. She and her maid were both considered to be a sense of stability for the colony. This was because before they had arrived, the colony was just made up of men and young boys. Without Mistress and Anne, the role of women known to England was not being fulfilled. = Anne Burras = Anne Burras was Mistress Forrest' maid, who came over with her in 1608. She was first of many willing to take the chance of leaving what she knew to go to the colonies, where her future was unknown. She married a man named John Laydon three months after her arrival. She was only fourteen when she married her twenty- eight-year-old husband.Virginia Bernhard, \\"\\"Men, Women and Children\\" at Jamestown: Population and Gender in Early Virginia, 1607-1610,\\" The Journal of Southern History 58, no. 4 (1992), doi:10.2307/2210786. Their wedding was the very first to occur in Jamestown. They had four daughters together and found it hard to stay in Jamestown. They struggled to raise their daughters in Virginia but put up a fight for stabilization. Burras was one of a few who survived through both the Starving Time and the Indian Massacre in 1622. = Temperance Flowerdew = Temperance Flowerdew came to Jamestown in the fall of 1609 with four hundred ill- fated settlers. It was said that she came over on the Falcon, a convey ship, with others, when they were caught in a storm, which caused some ships to go missing. She survived the illness and sickness of the Starving Time and returned to England. In 1619, she returned to Jamestown married to Governor George Yeardley. Flowerdew became Lady Yeardley when Yeardly became the governor of the colony. Her husband ended up making a treaty, in which he had one thousand acres of land granted in his wife's name. After her husband died Flowerdew married Governor Frances West in 1628. She died a few months later. =Cecily Jordan Farrar= Cecily Jordan Farrar came to Jamestown in 1611, a year after Temperance Flowerdew. Three days after her husband Samuel Jordan died in 1623, Reverend Grivell Pooley claimed to have proposed to her and alleged that she accepted. Later that year, she disavowed Pooley's claim by contracting herself to another suitor, William Farrar in front of the Governor Yeardley and the Council of Virginia. This started the first breach of promise suit in English North America, which was unusual because a woman was the defendant. The case took two years to settle, but Cecily prevailed in the end. Reverend Pooley put up a bond promising to release Cecily from any obligations to him. In the meantime, Cicely became a head of household for the 450-acre family plantation, Jordan's Journey. After the case was settled, she married William Farrar. = Jane Pierce = Jane came over to Virginia with her mother Joan Pierce on the Blessing in 1609. Both she and her mother managed to survive through the Starving Time of Virginia. Her mother was known as the master of gardening within the colony. Jane grew up learning from her mother. In 1619, she married John Rolfe after Pocahontas had passed away, and had a daughter. Her daughter died in 1635 at the age of 15. = Jane Dickenson = Jane Dickenson came to Virginia with her husband as indentured servants in 1620. She was sent to a plantation along the James River. During the Indian uprising she was captured and held captive for close to a year. A doctor by the name of Dr. John Pott saved her with a ransom. She became a servant for the Potts family after her rescue and moved to Jamestown. In 1624 she approached the governor and asked for her freedom. She pleaded that her time serving the Potts family was harsher than being captive with the Indians. = Hannah Bennett Turner Tompkins Arnold = Hannah Bennett Turner Tompkins Arnold was the only surviving child of her parents, and because of this she was able to inherit over four hundred acres of land in the 1630s. Throughout her life, she obtained a large amount of land. While she was married to her first husband he helped her to get the title for her father's land. When he passed away she became a widow and obtained all the land he had in his possession. She went through the same process with her second husband and with her third husband as well. She was one women who became well known and a huge part of the community because she had obtained so much land. = Mary Aggie = Mary Aggie was a slave to Anne Sullivan, who was a tavern owner in Williamsburg, Virginia. Mary tried to sue Anne for freedom in 1728, but the judge did not agree and did not give her freedom. Mary tried to show the judge her belief and faith in the Christian religion to appeal to the judge. This helped her later, when she was charged of stealing from her owner in 1730. She was carefully watched until she was caught stealing three sheets from her owner that were worth fourth shillings. During this time if you were convicted of stealing the punishment was usually death or severe corporal punishment. Yet, for Mary, it was not. She convinced the judge that she was a faithful Christian, so he said she qualified for clergy. This meant that because it was her first offense, she did not get any charges. Her case went on for months and, in May of 1731, she was forced out of the colony and sold as a slave to another colony. However, because she tried to fight the case and for her rights, she became a part of history and all Virginians received the right to plead clergy on their first conviction, no matter what their race or gender was. = Christina Campbell = Christina Campbell was raised in the Williamsburg Virginia colony. After her husband died in 1752, she was left a widow who had to support her two daughters. To help support her family she opened and ran her own tavern. Her tavern was run successfully for more than twenty years. It was said that her father John Burdett was a tavern owner and her parents taught her the skills needed to run a tavern. Christina was also a slave owner, which helped her maintain the workload at the tavern and at home. She also sent her slave children to a school for African American children who were either free or enslaved. Not many slave owners were willing to do this, as most slave owners were harsh towards their slaves.

Founded in 1968, it was a multiracial party opposed to the discriminatory policies of the country's Rhodesian Front-dominated white minority government. It dissolved in 1977. In 1968, a group of white Rhodesians, many of whom were associated with opposition leader Sir Edgar Whitehead, decided to reorganize. Led by Pat Bashford, they founded the Centre Party, a multiracial party opposed to Prime Minister Ian Smith's ruling Rhodesian Front. Its platform supported a non-racial franchise and elimination of racial discrimination. The party never gained any white seats in Parliament, but in 1970 seven black members were elected. The Centre Party's support for the 1972 Pearce Commission proposals eroded its support among blacks, many of whom left and joined the African National Council. In 1977, the party merged with the Rhodesia Party to form the National Unifying Force.  History  = Background = Following the dissolution of the Rhodesia Party and the United Federal Party, and the rise of the right-wing Rhodesian Front, Rhodesian moderates and liberals were a disorganized and uninfluential political minority. While forming an opposition was a topic of discussion among whites, it did not come to fruition until the founding of the Centre Party. Three years before the party's founding Rhodesia made its Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom, and the country's unrecognized white minority government maintained power through strict requirements for voters that most blacks did not meet. = Founding = The Centre Party was founded on 28 August 1968 by a group of white Rhodesians seeking to recreate a viable opposition to the ruling Rhodesian Front. The new party was multiracial, and its initial platform supported universal franchise for blacks, the proposed Land Apportionment Act, and the elimination of blatant examples of racial discrimination. Pat Bashford, the Centre Party's founder and leader, was strongly opposed to UDI, Prime Minister Ian Smith, and Rhodesian Front's racial policies. Notable early members of the party included Nicholas McNally, future justice of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, Sam Putterill, former commander of the Rhodesian Security Forces, and activist Diana Mitchell, a co-founder who became the party's press and public relations officer. = Growth and 1970 elections = Later, the Rhodesian Constitutional Association, composed of former Rhodesia Party and United Federal Party members, merged into the Centre Party. At the party's inaugural congress, only 200 attended, while 450 attendees were expected. After receiving criticism for the congress's poor attendance, Bashford responded that he believed the Centre Party would be the future of liberalism in Rhodesia. However, the party remained small and was unable to garner significant white support, possibly because of the party's liberal image. In the period leading up the 1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum, the Centre Party urged a \\"no\\" vote, believing that the new constitution would hurt the chance of reaching a settlement with the United Kingdom. In the run-up to the vote, the party had commissioned a professionally conducted public opinion survey, which found that the white population largely supported the new constitution, which would set up a republican form of government in Rhodesia. Though the survey results showed that the Centre Party's position was not popular among voters, the party still decided to pursue seats in Parliament in the upcoming 1970 elections. In those elections, the Centre Party put up candidates for 16 of the 50 contested \\"European seats\\" (those reserved for whites), and ran candidates for all 8 of the \\"African\\", or black, seats. The party did not win any of the white constituencies, but drew on middle class black support and won 7 of the 8 black seats in Parliament, receiving the largest share of African roll votes. The Centre Party MPs elected in 1970 were: Edward Watunga (Harare), Lewis Ndhlovu (Insukamini), Lazarus Masenda (Mabvazuwa), Wening Moraka (Matojeni), Lwazi Mahlangu (Mpopoma), Ronnie Sadomba (Nemakonde), and Micah Bhebe (Ntshonalanga). By 1971, the party reached its peak support, with about 60 local branches in the black Tribal Trust Lands, not to mention branches in white areas. Ian Smith called it \\"the real opposition.\\" = Settlement issue and decline = In 1971, the issue of settlement proposals with the United Kingdom became a point of discord within the Centre Party. The November 1971 issue of the party newspaper Centre-point devoted half its content to speculations by various writers on the prospects of a settlement. That year, Ian Smith asked Bashford for the Centre Party's support in appealing to the British government to implement the terms of his settlement proposal. Bashford refused, due to the Rhodesian Front's continued racism, and because black African support for the proposal was low. However, by 1972, the Centre Party officially supported the settlement proposals after the Pearce Commission. The party's position on settlement was unpopular with black members, most of whom became disillusioned and turned their support toward the newly formed African National Council (ANC). Soon, even black party leaders began defecting. The deputy secretary for external affairs for the ANC said: > \\"The Centre Party has no more African support. I was its general secretary > and I should know. This party does not stand for Africans, but Europeans.\\" Some black Centre Party politicians tried to remain loyal, but faced violence from their fellow blacks, and were forced to back down. Percy Mkudu, a former MP and strong Central Party support, initially supported the settlement proposals but changed his position and began denouncing them after his businesses were attacked in January 1972. Ronnie Sadomba, a Centre Party MP, originally supported the proposals but resigned from the party in February 1972 when he realized he was an \\"obvious target\\". The Centre Party eventually abandoned support for the proposal, but had already lost most of its black support. In the 1974 parliamentary elections, the Centre Party ran only five candidates, four of whom were black. Only one, Micah Bhebe, an African roll incumbent, retained his seat. Diana Mitchell, though a Centre Party supporter, ran (unsuccessfully) as an independent candidate, frustrated by perceived sexism in the party. In January 1977, the Centre Party merged with the revived Rhodesia Party and the National Pledge Association to form the National Unifying Force as the country's main opposition.  Ideology  The Centre Party was moderate and liberal. Its founder Pat Bashford remarked in 1969 that \\"liberalism needed a home in Rhodesia and the Centre Party could provide it.\\" The party was multiracial and opposed to racist policies espoused by the Rhodesian Front. = Social policy = The party opposed white minority government in Rhodesia and racial discrimination, and supported equality before the law and improved education for black citizens. = Economic and land policy = The party supported private enterprise and restricting bureaucratic interference in the economy. They were opposed to the Land Tenure Act, which awarded a disproportionate amount of Rhodesia's land to the white minority over blacks. The party believed that within the Tribal Trust Lands, the authority of tribal chiefs in traditional matters should be respected.  Structure  The party was headed by a leader, or president, Pat Bashford. Charles Lazarus was the deputy leader. From 1969 to 1976, an annual party congress was held. Bashford resigned in 1975. The party published a monthly Centre Party Newsletter from January 1974 to June 1977. A party newspaper, Centre-point, was also published.  Voter base  The Centre Party was a multiracial party, though its leadership and a disproportionate amount of its voter base were white. By 1971, the party had gained significant black support, with 60 local branches in black tribal areas. The Centre Party was strongest in urban areas. By 1972, the party lost much of its black support over the settlement proposal issue, and was left with mostly a white membership. The party never gained more than 3,000 members.
