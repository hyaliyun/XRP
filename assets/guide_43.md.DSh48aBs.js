Biography Mikhail Odintsov was born on 18 November 1921 in a Russian family with peasantry roots in the village of Polozovo in Sarapulsky Uyezd in Perm Governorate. His father worked as an investigating officer of the OGPU and the NKVD, and his mother was a laboratory worker. In the town of Sverdlovsk, today Yekaterinburg, he graduated from School No. 36 and studied at the local construction institute. Due to the financial difficulties of his family, he soon gave up studying and found work at the Uralobuv shoe factory in Sverdlovsk between 1937 and 1938. Simultaneously, he became a member of the local flying club and passed the pilot examination with distinction in 1938. = Early Military career = At the age of 17, in November 1938, he volunteered for the Red Army and became a soldier. After basic training and swearing-in, he applied for the military pilot school in Perm. After the one- year training course he graduated with distinction, became an interim flight instructor and was finally assigned as Kursant to the Engels Air Force Officer School. In May 1940 he passed the examination and was promoted to junior lieutenant (Russian: –º–ª–∞–¥—à–∏–π –ª–µ–π—Ç–µ–Ω–∞–Ω—Ç; translit.: mlatshij lejtenant). In 1943, he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. = First assignments and war duty = Odintsov's first military pilot assignment was to the 62nd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment as member of a Tupolev SB crew. Due to Odintsov's excellent performance, he soon became pilot of an Su-2 bomber aircraft of the 226th High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment. From 23 June 1941, Odintsov fought in combat against the Nazi German Wehrmacht. During an air attack his aircraft was shot down. Odintsov and Chervinsky, his flight navigator, survived and were seriously wounded. After a seven-month convalescence, Odintsov was diagnosed by a medical commission as unfit for active service and flying. Nevertheless, Oditsov went to his bomber regiment and started headstrong to fly with handicap. At his own responsibility and with physical limitation he was ranted the particular flight license to the bomber aircraft Il-2. On this type of aircraft he flew until the end of the war. Due to his individual combat experience and his wounds, Odintsov strongly demanded the additional armor plating in order to protect the air-gunner's stand of combat aircraft. The success his air-gunner staff-sergeant Dmitry Nikonov, confirmed his confidence. During numerous air combats, Nikonov shot down eight enemy aircraft without sustaining injuries. During the war, Odintsov was appointed as pilot-in-command of several different types of tactical aircraft, squadron commander in the 820th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, and second in command of the 155th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment. Throughout the war Odintsov showed personally bravery during ground-attack operations, and performed as commanding officer of large flight formations, including serving as the tactical commander of the 292nd Ground Attack Aviation Division and as second in command of the 9th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Division. Odintsov finished the war with the rank of Major (OF-3) and completed a total of 215 sorties. During those missions, he gained 14 shared shootdowns of enemy aircraft, which was unusual for a bomber pilot in the Soviet Air Force. For this, he was honored with the USSR's highest title Hero of the Soviet Union twice. = Postwar activities= As the result of Nephritis, not completely cured in the years of war, Odintsov was banned from flying, including suspension of field service, from 1948 to 1950. However, he was assigned as student to the Air Force Military Academy. Afterwards he attended the Lenin Academy for Military Pilots, and graduated in 1952 with distinction. Subsequent to study, he continued to perform as military pilot. Therefore, he personally evaluated a large number of Soviet military airplanes. Types concerned were as follows: Pe-2, Tu-2, Tu-4, IL-28, Su-7, MiG-15, Mig-17, MiG-21, MiG-23, Tu-16, Tu-22, Su-24, Mi-2, Mi-4, Mi-8 and Mi-24. His evaluation reports influenced directly constructive changes, operational improvements, under maintenance of flying characteristics, proved successful. From 1958 to 1959, he was assigned to the command and general staff officers course to the General Staff Academy (Russia), and graduated again with ¬´distinction¬ª. Among top assignments, e.g. division commander, and Air Force commanding general of the Moscow military district, he became in 1963 one of the first commanding officers of the Soviet Cosmonaut Training Centre. It was followed by other essential appointment as follows: *Supervisor to the Polish Armed Forces (1976‚Äì1981) *Air Force Inspector general in the main inspectorate of MOD USSR (1981‚Äì1987) *Assistant to the Polish representative in the Supreme command of the WP-armed forces (1981‚Äì1987) *Delegate to the XXIV and XXV Convention of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union = Retirement = During his active service, but also after retirement, Odintsov published frequently articles and books; e.g. ¬´Then in the year 1942 ‚Ä¶ (–¢–æ–≥–¥–∞, –≤ 1942-–º), ¬´Examination in fire (–ò—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ–≥–Ω—ë–º)¬ª, ¬´Notes of a pilot (–ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –ª—ë—Ç—á–∏–∫–∞)¬ª and ¬´Conquest (–ü—Ä–µ–æ–¥–æ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ)¬ª.

Meteorological history The meiyu front persisted over the region between Huai River and Yangtze during mid-July 2016 since the dissipation of Typhoon Nepartak. Meanwhile, the subtropical ridge over the northwest Pacific Ocean was located unusually southward and westward, which blocked the Southwest Monsoon and made it completely flow into mainland China. On July 19, as the westerlies collided with the strong Southwest Monsoon, cyclogenesis began within the front and formed an extratropical cyclone over Henan, China at around 20:00 CST (12:00 UTC). The cyclone quickly reached peak intensity at around 02:00 CST (18:00 UTC) on July 20, with the central pressure at . Drifting north-northeastward with surface sustained winds below gale-force, the system started to weaken slowly in the province of Hebei after 14:00 CST (06:00 UTC) and occluded right before 02:00 CST (18:00 UTC) on July 21, owing to the disconnection from the Southwest Monsoon. It became almost stationary near Beijing until it dissipated after 20:00 CST (12:00 UTC) on July 21.

Plot In 1949, while returning to his home in Shantung, Houcheng (Wu Hsing-kuo) was forcefully conscripted by the Republic of China Army under shackle, leaving behind his younger brother, his wife, and the whole family. Soon after, his wife gives birth to a boy Jiawang (Geng Le). Fifty years later, Houcheng now lives in a military dependents' village in Taipei, having re-married a local Taiwanese woman and fathering a daughter (Yeh Chuan-Chen) and a grandson. He wakes up every morning to make mantou, per his family tradition since when he was in Mainland China. In his old age and after the death of his second wife, Houcheng returns to visit his hometown in Shandong, only to discover that his first wife had died. He was met with a hostile son who resented him for not having been present in his life. He returns to Taiwan without having resolved the conflict with his son. Ten years later in Taiwan in 2009, Houcheng suffers a stroke. At the urging of his family, Jiawang goes to Taiwan, perhaps to see his father for the last time. While in his father's home in Taiwan, Jiawang discovers forty years worth of unsent letters (due to the ongoing Civil War) written to his mother, expressing his futile desire to return home. Jiawang realizes that, unlike what he thought, his father had never forgotten about them. With the new discovery, the misunderstanding was resolved. The film ends with Houcheng passing away peacefully in his sick bed, imagining his return to his hometown of 1949, reuniting with his first wife.

He was a student and friend of the bishop Saint Rafael Gu√≠zar Valencia and studied for the priesthood in secret during the Cristero War that plagued Mexico during the thirties. He was even dubbed as \\"the new Padre Pio\\" due to his similarities to the Italian Capuchin. He became titled as a Servant of God under Pope Benedict XVI on 27 November 2008 once the canonization cause commenced and he was titled as Venerable on 30 September 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest led a life of heroic virtue. Life Juan Manuel Mart√≠n del Campo was born on 14 December 1917 to Ana Mart√≠n del Campo. His parents would lead their children in rosaries on a frequent basis and his mother would bless him before he went to sleep. His elder brother Fernando became a priest. He studied for the priesthood in Veracruz during a period of religious persecution of the Cristero War and so attended underground classes that were conducted in secret and spent most of his time off administering to the poor and to the ill while also helping to conduct covert Masses to avoid detection. He came to the attention of the Bishop Saint Rafael Gu√≠zar Valencia who started mentoring the seminarian and also becoming a close friend. Valencia's successor - Manuel P√≠o L√≥pez - appointed him as an acolyte (one who prepares liturgical celebrations) on 16 July 1939. He was ordained as a priest on 21 December 1940 and became both a teacher and a spiritual director while being appointed as the prefect of theologians from 1940 to April 1947 when he was made the confessor to the Sisters of Banderilla. As a popular confessor he often spent six to eight hours in the confessional with people even waiting until midnight to see him. In 1954 he became the diocesan director of the work of the Propagation of the Faith and in 1956 became both the chaplain and the spiritual director of the Motolin√≠a College in 1956. From 1960 until 1970 he served as the parish pastor of Saint Jerome in Coatepec and founded the \\"Colegio Mexico\\" there in Coatepec. In 1961 he served as the confessor to the Sisters of the Holy Trinity in the same town and was also the penitentiary canon of the Xalapa Cathedral from 1970 until 1985. He served as the interim rector of the Church of the Sacred Heart in Xalapa in 1985 and served as the rector of the Church of San Isidro in Xalapa also in 1987. He became the archdiocesan exorcist in 1987 at the behest of Bishop Sergio Obeso Rivera and remained in that position until 1995 when he retired from his position. He died on 13 August 1996 due to prostate cancer and his remains were later housed in the Church of Saint Jerome in Coatepec in 2010. Beatification process The beatification process commenced under Pope Benedict XVI on 27 November 2008 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God. The diocesan process opened in the Archdiocese of Xalapa on 5 February 2009 and concluded its work not long after on 23 April 2010. The C.C.S. validated the process on 7 July 2011 in Rome. In 2013 the postulation submitted the Positio which allowed for a group of theologians to approve its contents on 25 November 2014. The members of the C.C.S. also voted in favor of the cause on 22 September 2015. He became titled as Venerable on 30 September 2015 after Pope Francis approved his life of heroic virtue. The current postulator assigned to this cause is Rev. Rafael Gonz√°lez Hern√°ndez.

[...] He married three times and fathered eight children, six of them sons, laying the foundations of one of the most ramified among Czech aristocratic families.\\" that had a prominent role in the history and administration of their native Kingdom of Bohemia as well as the Holy Roman Empire and later the Habsburg Monarchy as high-ranking officials and supporters of the Czech National Revival. The family origins are so far back in time that they are not recorded in any extant Bohemian historical documents. Only a few legends, such as those recounted by historians Bohuslav Balb√≠n and Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, give an account of those origins. The first historically documented Kolowrat is Albrecht of Kolowrat the Elder (cs). The family rose to prominence during the Habsburg Monarchy, during which its members held some of the highest political, military, and clerical offices, including serving as Minister-Presidents, Supreme Chancellors, field marshals, archbishops, and knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece.  History  = The Founder of the House = Albrecht the Elder of Kolowrat, whose ancestors came from the village of Kolovraty, is considered to be the founder of the dynasty. Being a hetman and the court marshal of Anna of Schweidnitz (wife of Charles IV), and an assessor of the provincial and royal feudal court, he entered historical documents in 1347 when Ro≈æmit√°l castle was sold and he was mentioned as an assessing witness. He married three times and had eight children, six of which were sons who later laid the foundations of the House of Kolowrat. In 1373, Albrecht of Kolowrat established an Augustinian monastery of the Assumption in Roƒçov, where he was later buried. = 14th century = The founder of the family and the first documented member of the Kolowrat family was Lord Albrecht the Elder (‚Ä†1391). He was first mentioned as a witness in the sale of Ro≈æmit√°l Castle in 1347. He is known primarily because he became the marshal of Empress Anna of Schweidnitz (wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor), and Governor of Vogtland. Together with his sons, he founded the Augustinian monastery of the Virgin Mary in Dolni Roƒçov. Here, Lord Albrecht the Elder is also buried, and his gravestone is tied to a family legend that has persisted for centuries. Lord Albrecht's sons and grandchildren laid the foundations of eight noble branches of the Kolowrat family. His oldest son, Lord Albrecht the Younger (1369-1416), founded a branch of Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky and perhaps Kolowrat- Krakowsky, whose descendants still live today. Following his father's example, he financially supported the monastery in Dolni Roƒçov. = 15th century = Hanu≈° I. (1390-1450) became one of the most powerful people in the country, as in 1437 he became one of six interim administrators of the Czech Kingdom (together with Oldrich II. of Rosenberg, Meinhard of Neuhaus, Ales of Sternberg, Nicholas of Hazmburg, and Zikmund of Warttenberg) before the new King took over the government. Later he became the Governor of the Prague cities and was a well known adversary of George of Podƒõbrady, King of Bohemia . He was also involved in the Hussite Wars. His son, Hanu≈° II. (1430-1483), unlike his grandfather and father, did not enter politics as was expected of him, but instead turned to the church and became the administrator of the Prague Archbishopric. He became famous as the patron of the Catholic Church, when in 1465, he donated the golden, precious-jewel inlaid Kolowrat prayer book with relics of Czech saints to the Saint Vitus Cathedral Treasure (the largest and most important Treasure in Czech Republic, and one of the most extensive in Europe). To the Chapter Library, he bequeathed the rare, illuminated manuscript of his travel breviary among others. Of the ≈Ωehrovsk√Ω family, we can mention Jan (1434‚Äì1473), who, unlike other members of his extended family, became an ally of King George of Podƒõbrady, and took part in his mission of peace in Central and Western Europe between 1465‚Äì1467. = 16th century = Of the Nowohradsk√Ω family, the best-known is J√°chym (2nd half of the 16th century), who built a political career as a vice-governor in the court of Emperor Rudolf II. He also became burgrave of Karl≈°tejn, and while holding this position, he had Karl≈°tejn castle markedly repaired and enlarged. Thus, he held both provincial and the court offices, which was not very common. Further, we can also name Ign√°c Jind≈ôich (1575 / 77-1628), who became famous for his ecclesiastical career as a representative of Olomouc Bishop Franti≈°ek cardinal Dietrichstein, and subsequently was even elected as provost of the Olomouc chapter. Of the members of the Bezdru≈æick√Ω family we'll mention George (1481-1526), who was the supreme judge and who witnessed the rivalry of the nobles and the royal cities over power in the land. Another important member of the family was V√°clav (‚Ä† pre-1539), who was the supreme feudal judge and burgrave at Vy≈°ehrad. He continued with the tradition of supporting of the monastery in Doln√≠ Roƒçov, thus becoming responsible for extensive reconstruction of the entire building. = 17th century = left During the 17th century, many major changes took place. For the Kolowrat family, among the most important of events was the promotion of the family to Counts of the Holy Roman Empire and Counts of Bohemia. In 1629, a family agreement was concluded between the male members of all branches of the family, in which the indivisibility of the property, the maintenance of the monastery in Doln√≠ Roƒçov, preservation of the Coat of arms and the ancestral history, and the non-mixing of ancestral noble blood were negotiated. Many members became major patrons, primarily of the Catholic Church. Count Franz Karel I. (1620-1700), knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, financially supported the construction of many church buildings throughout his life. In 1674, he founded an entailed estate consisting of Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou, Cernikovice, and Borohr√°dek. Count Old≈ôich Franti≈°ek (1607‚Äì1650) was present at the establishment of the Capuchin monastery in Su≈°ice, supported the founding of the Jesuit college in Klatovy, in B≈ôeznice and in Hlohov. Count Kry≈°tof Jaroslav (1604-1659) provided extensive repairs of the Augustinian monastery in Doln√≠ Roƒçov between 1647‚Äì1648. Count V√°clav (1634-1659) is considered the greatest patron of the entire family, because in 1654 he renounced the entire estate and devoted it to the construction of the St. Nicholas cathedral in Mal√° Strana in Prague . After the departure of French troops from the country, Count Maximilian Norbert (1660-1721), provided financial assistance to repair the Jesuit college, grammar school and seminary in Klatovy. Worth noting is also the last wife of Count Wilhelm Albrecht I (1600-1688), Countess Ludmila Eva Franti≈°ka (1616‚Äì1695), who in 1691 donated her diamond-studded wedding dress (6500 diamonds) to the Prague Loreta, from which the Diamond Monstrance, also known as the Prague Sun, was made. Count Jan Wilhelm Vojtƒõch (1627-1668) dedicated his life to his ecclesiastical career, and was a canon several times over and a prelate. In 1668, he even became Archbishop of Prague. = 18th century = Count Filip Nerius (Neri) Krakowsk√Ω of Kolowrat In the 18th century, many Kolowrats become members of prestigious orders. Several of them even received the most prestigious Habsburg order, the Order of the Golden Fleece. One of its recipients was Count Norbert Leopold (1655‚Äì1711),who was a lifelong supporter of the Catholic Church and Empress Eleonor. When the Karl≈°tejn Castle was for sale, Count Norbert Leopold bought it for 150,000 gold and donated it back to the Crown as he believed that Karl≈°tejn Castle should not be in private hands. Another knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece was Count Filip Nerius (1686-1773), the Supreme Burgrave ( equivalent to prime minister) of the Czech kingdom and a provincial judge. He also founded one of the family tombs. Another family member to receive recognition was Count Leopold Wilhelm (1727-1809), who was also awarded the Grand Cross of the Hungarian Order of St. Stephan and the Order of Leopold. He served as the First State and Conference Minister and the highest Czech-Austrian Chancellor, but he was also a capable entrepreneur in the tobacco and needle industries. Field marshal General and Commander of Bohemia , Count Johann Kollowrat (1748-1816), who fought against Napoleon, also achieved recognition when he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold (Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold), the French Legion of Honour and the Military Order of Maria Theresa. He later became a Commander of the Order of the Knights of Malta. Kajet√°n Franti≈°ek (1689-1769), too, became a Field Marshal General and Military Commander of Moravia. Emanuel V√°clav (1700-1769), who, among other things, was Grand Prior of the Order of the Knights of Malta, became a general, lieutenant field marshal, and owner of the \\"Kolowrat\\" Regiment (the Kolowrat family private army). We should also mention Count , The High Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom, who took over the inheritance after the Barons of √öjezd family, which provided him with many estates, including B≈ôeznice na P≈ô√≠bram, which remained in the possession of the Kolowrat family for a long time. = 19th century = Archbishop of Pragueleft The most important politician of the Kolowrat family was Count Franz Anton II. (1778‚Äì1861), who became the first Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, the de facto second in command after Emperor Ferdinand I. He later became one of the founders of the Czech National Gallery, donating his extensive collection of paintings. Together with Josef Maria (1746‚Äì1824) and Jan Nepomuk Karel (1794‚Äì1872), he was also one of the founders of the Czech National Museum, to which he donated, among other things, a library with rare prints and a collection of minerals. Many members of the family played an important role in the Czech National Revival in order to support the unity of the Czech nation. Count Jan Nepomuk Karel (called Hanu≈°), a knight of the Order of the Knights of Malta, also donated his collections and the B≈ôeznice library with many rare incunabula and illuminated manuscripts to the museum. He also did not neglect to support Czech authors, financially supporting Bo≈æena Nƒõmcova and Karel Havl√≠ƒçek Borovsk√Ω. He also contributed one of the largest amounts to the building of the National Theater. Even in this period, there were members of the family who set out on a political or military career path. Vincenc Maria (1749-1824), a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and many other honors, became the Grand Prior of the Knights of Malta, and in his military career he achieved the rank of Commanding General and lieutenant field marshal. It was in this rank that he commanded the 4th Russian-Austrian Infantry Column of 16,000 men at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805, when his army fought against Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Count Franz Xaver II. (1803-1873) also became the Grand Prior of the Order of the Knights of Malta and was awarded the Imperial Order of Leopold. He is known primarily because of his post as ambassador at the Imperial Court. Count Leopold Maria (1804-1863) dedicated his entire life to a military career, becoming a Lieutenant Field Marshal and Commanding General. He later became the governor of Venice. Let us also not forget the clergy, and mention Count Alois Josef (1759-1833), Deputy Bishop of Olomouc, Bishop of Hradec Kr√°lov√© and Archbishop of Prague from 1830. = 20th century = Standing out among others in the 20th century is film producer, founder of the Austrian film industry, automobile and motorcycle racer Count Alexander Joseph (1886-1927), whom everyone simply called Sasha. He was the holder of the Franz Joseph Cross of Merit. During World War I he was the chief of film propaganda for the Austro- Hungarian Empire. After the War, he financially supported Laurin & Klement, even becoming a co-owner of the company, financially backing some of their automotive factories. He also collaborated with Ferdinand Porsche who built him a light-weight sports car called the Sascha Wagen (in honor of Count Alexander). Count Alexander Kolowrat also discovered actress Marlene Dietrich and director Michael Curtiz (famous for Casablanca). His younger brother, Jind≈ôich Josef (1897-1996), was a prominent politician, diplomat, national economist, anti-Nazi fighter and patron in the spirit of the Kolowrat ancestral tradition. He received many honors and awards for both his political activities as well as his lifelong work. Other family holders of state awards include Bohuslav (1876-1934), Jan (1879-1955), and Zde≈àek (1881-1941).  Family Descendants  Count Henry Josef Wilhelm Albrecht Pavel Krakowsk√Ω of Kolowrat After 1989, Count Jind≈ôich Kolowrat (1897-1996) returned from exile in the US to what was then still Czechoslovakia, accompanied by his youngest son Count Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° (1943-2004), so that together they could restitute the family property in Czechoslovakia. After the return of the family property, he leased the Kolowrat Palace to the National Theater for the symbolic price of 1 CZK for the duration of 20 years making him one of the greatest supporters of Czech arts. Also in April 1992, pursuant to the Restitution Act, the castle in Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou, including its collections, the chateau in ƒåern√≠kovice, lands, were returned to Count Kry≈°tof Jaroslav Kolowrat- Krakowsk√Ω-Liebsteinsk√Ω, who managed them until 1999. The properties are now under the administration of his son, Jan Egon. Count Jind≈ôich died in 1996 and appointed Count Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° as the sole heir and administrator of the family property. Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° established a family with JUDr. Dominika Kolowrat-Krakowsky, n√©e Perutkova, and their son, Count Maxmilian Alexander was born in 1996. Two years later, they welcomed their daughter, Francesca Dominika (*1998). After the premature passing of Count Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° in 2004, Dominika Kolowrat-Krakowsk√° took over the administration of the family assets. Together with her children, Count Maximilian and Francesca, on February 26, 2008 (the 65th anniversary of the birth of Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈°), she established the Kolowr√°tek Endowment Fund.

This familial coat of arms is also common to other families, which explains the theory of a common forefather for the Kolowrats, the Janovics, the ƒåejkas, and the Dvo≈ôeck√Ωs. The azure shield features an argent and gules party per pale eagle with arms and a half moon finished with clover trefoils in or. Since the 15th century, the eagle has featured the royal crown in or on the neck. Having acquired the Countship title, the lineage of the Liesbsteinsk√Ωs added a second tail to the eagle along with a small Austrian heart shield (in gules with argent bar). The crest above the helmet, which is decorated with a crown in or and mantlings in argent and gules, is formed by closed eagle wings with a half moon finished in clover trefoils in or, a princely crown in or, and a crowned shield in gules with argent bar.

It has been suggested that Hergot was probably the first to publish the text, as the material seems to come from Nuremberg: its material on tempering and quenching is similar to the short treatise on hardening iron beginning 'Von dem herten. Nu spricht meister Alkaym' in the late fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century Nuremberg manuscript N√ºrnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a. About half the text is on how to harden iron and steel through tempering and quenching, mentioning water, but also a range of recipes of varying degrees of elaborateness. The recipe 'take clarified honey, fresh urine of a he-goat, alum, borax, oliver oil, and salt; mix everything well together and quench therein' might, through the urea content of the urine (H2NCONH2), have helped to produce nitrated, 'case-hardened' iron. Less likely to have been efficacious is: 'take varnish, dragon's blood, horn scrapings, half as much salt, juice made from earthworms, radish juice, tallow, and vervain and quench therein. It is also very advantageous in hardening if a piece that is to be hardened is first thoroughly cleaned and well polished'.Rolf E. Hummel, Understanding Materials Science: History ¬∑ Properties ¬∑ Applications (New York: Springer, 1998), p. 7. A modern commentator on some of the more outlandish techniques in the book noted: \\"There isn't really much to say...except that perhaps it was meant to trip up rivals. However, this may not be the case because similar instructions were circulated in 1708 in Nuremberg.\\" The text also includes techniques for colouring, soldering, and etching. Etching was quite a new technology at the time, and Von Stahel und Eysen provides the first attested recipes.William Eamon, Science and the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 120.

It was released as the lead single off her fifth studio album KIN. The song was released on 15 July 2016, right after the Golden State EP and its promotional single \\"Evil Eye\\". The song was produced by Tony Hoffer.  Composition  \\"Maybe It's a Good Thing\\" was written by Tunstall in Los Angeles, like most of the album. Tunstall stated that the song was about dealing with hard things in the past, and seeing them a positive experience. The song marks a different sound than her previous albums Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon which was folk, and Tiger Suit, which was electronic music. This time, it is a pop song. Tunstall stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly : \\"The truth is, I‚Äôve finally made peace with being a pop songwriter\\".  Promotion  Tunstall played the song, acoustic and live, during her intervention at the Oxford Union on 20 July 2016. She also played it during the Cambridge Folk Festival 2016. Music video The clip of \\"Maybe It's a Good Thing\\" was released on 1 August 2016 through Vevo. Yoni Weisberg directed the video (he has previously worked with Band of Skulls and Courtney Barnett). The website Entertainment Weekly premiered the video along with an article, stating the video is a \\"kaleidoscopic confetti, diving into a psychedelic potpourri of rapid fire visuals\\". In the music video, Tunstall is dancing in different, colorful outfits. She says the music seen is all about dancing; \\"I thought my dancing was really bad, [but] I‚Äôm a big fan of the band Jungle from London, and they always do these awesome choreographed dance videos.

While not respectable as a manual on verse- writing, it was used by leading authors. Life Bysshe's background is unclear. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests that either Henry Bysshe of Buxted or George Bysshe of Burstow might be his father. He worked as a hack writer in London. Works The Art of English Poetry (1702) is dedicated to Edmund Dunch and consists of three sections: * I. Rules for Making Verses. This treats English prosody, showing the influence of John Dryden. * II. A Dictionary of Rhymes. * III. A collection of the most Natural, Agreeable, and Noble Thoughts, viz. Allusions, Similes, Descriptions, and Characters of Persons and Things: that are to be found in the best English Poets. The work was popular: a fifth edition was issued in 1714; a seventh, \\"corrected and enlarged\\", in 1724; an eighth is dated 1737. In 1714 the second and third parts were published separately under the title of The British Parnassus; or a compleat Common Place-book of English Poetry (2 vols.), and this was reissued in 1718 with a new title-page (The Art of English Poetry, vols. the iiid and ivth). Thomas Hood the younger reprinted Bysshe's \\"Rules\\" as an appendix to his Practical Guide to English Versification in 1877. Bysshe also edited in 1712 Sir Richard Bulstrode's Letters, with a biographical introduction and a dedication addressed to George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan. In the same year there appeared a translation by Bysshe of Xenophon's Memorabilia, which was dedicated to John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham, and was reissued in 1758. Bysshe was not involved by name in the 1715 edition of further works by Bulstrode, and that has been taken as an indication that he had died by that date.

He never actually played for them in the domestic league but participated in the Barcelona FC tour of North America later in 1937. When the tour ended he signed for Brooklyn Hispano, a United States team that played in the American Soccer League.

Developed most intensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this area was the center of commerce for Waterville and the surrounding rural communities. It encompasses 25 properties on Main and Common Streets, including the Waterville Opera House and City Hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012, and was slightly enlarged in 2016. Description and history The downtown area of Waterville is located on the west bank of the Kennebec River, about upstream from the city of Augusta, the river's highest point navigable by ocean-going vessels. Waterville developed as an industrial center in the second half of the 19th century, following the arrival of the railroad in 1849. Mills were built south of the downtown area, and residential areas grew to the north and west. The city's most rapid period of growth was between about 1890 and 1920, when many of the brick commercial buildings lining Main Street were built. Castonguay Square, a grassy park on the north side of Common Street and south of City Hall, was laid out in 1796, when the area was still part of Winslow. It is named for a soldier killed during World War I, and features a German cannon from that war, as well as a commemorative marker of Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec, which took place during the American Revolutionary War, when this area was largely undeveloped.Corbett, Matthew; Hanson, Scott (2012). NRHP nomination for Waterville Main Street Historic District; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The district includes two blocks of Main Street, between Temple and Spring Streets, as well as Common Street and Castonguay Square. Most of the buildings in this area are commercial brick buildings, and most have fairly typical Late Victorian commercial styling. The Opera House and City Hall, a single building on the north side of Castonguay Square at the corner of Front Street, is a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture, and continues to serve the community as an entertainment venue and municipal center. The Krutzky Block, located at the southeast corner of Common and Main, is a distinctive small block with Spanish Revival and Arts and Crafts elements. The 1936 Federal Trust Company building (25-33 Main) is the district's only example of Art Deco architecture. The district's oldest building is the 1836 Ticonic Row (8-22 Main), which exhibits Greek Revival features overlaid by alterations made in the 1920s.

He co-founded ‚Äì alongside Saint Jeanne de Valois ‚Äì the Annunciades in 1501. Nicolas met with both Pope Alexander VI and Pope Leo X in relation to the congregation's foundation and rule and was noted for his humble and meek outlook amongst his peers while also being known for his intelligence and diligence in the affairs of the congregation he helped establish. The sainthood process commenced in France and he is titled as a Servant of God. Life Gilbert Nicolas was born in 1462 in the Kingdom of France. In 1478 a sermon that a Franciscan preacher gave on the topic of the Immaculate Conception moved him to consider the prospects of becoming a priest. He joined the Order of Friars Minor in 1475 and entered the convent of Notre-Dame de Lafond to join. Nicolas studied at the convent of Amboise where he was ordained a priest. From 1498 until 1502 he served as the gatekeeper of his convent where he later met Saint Jeanne de Valois and he became her confessor and spiritual director. The former Queen consort was annulled from King Louis XII and went with Nicolas to Bourges to found a religious order. He travelled to Rome where he met with Pope Alexander VI to receive papal approval for the new congregation ‚Äì though the College of Cardinals voiced their disapproval. But the Cardinal Bishop of Modena Giovanni Battista Ferrari had a dream of God who rebuked the college for their refusal of the order and saw Saint Lawrence the Deacon and Saint Francis of Assisi extend their arms over Nicolas in blessing. The cardinal summoned Nicolas to tell him of this and Alexander VI later ratified the rule and establishment of the new order on 12 February 1502. At the same time the pope issued a papal brief that allowed for Nicolas to assume the religious name of \\"Gabriel-Maria\\". He composed the rule of the order and travelled to Rome and presented it to Pope Leo X on 11 June 1517; the pontiff also aggregated the order to the Order of Friars Minor. He never wanted to accept a doctoral degree ‚Äì though the path remained opened to him ‚Äì and he kept on rejecting episcopal appointments. He served as the vicar of the order's Aquitaine branch from 1503 until 1508 when the foundress appointed him as the superior of the convent. Under his guidance new convents were founded in Albi (1507) and Bethune (1516) while other convents were founded across the nation in places such as Bruges (1517) and Bordeaux (1520). Nicolas also provided advice and support for the reform of the Poor Clares and around 1520 visited the congregation's provinces in Ireland and Scotland in addition to the new Anglican England. He also preached for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire and amongst his fellow Franciscans initiated research on the influence and reach of Lutheranism. Nicolas died on 27 August 1532 and was buried in Rodez. Beatification cause The beatification process opened in an informative process that required joint collaboration between the forums of Cr√©teil and Agen in a move that accorded Nicolas the posthumous title of Servant of God. All his spiritual writings were collected and approved in December 1916. An apostolic process later opened a decade later on 20 May 1927 as a means of continuing the work of the informative process. The cause then halted for several decades until 2003 when a decree was issued to resume the process; the transfer of the competent forum from Rodez was issued on 21 July 2009 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2010 granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the continuation of the cause. A diocesan process opened on 28 February 2013 and concluded its work on 2 June 2015. The current postulator assigned to this cause is Giovangiuseppe Califano.

The cookie is a popular dessert in South Africa where it is often eaten with a cup of English tea. In the Cape- Malay community the dessert is often eaten during Eid. It is often baked at home as part of a dessert-baking cottage industry in the country and sold alongside other popular South African desserts such as Koeksisters.  History  The tartlet is named after the early 20th century South African politician, Prime Minister (1924‚Äì1939) and Boer War General J. B. M. Hertzog. The Hertzogkoekies are thought to have been a favourite of his. Hertzog's supporters were known to have baked,served and sold them to show their political support. One story of the origin of the dessert states that it was invented by the Cape-Malay community to demonstrate their support for Hertzog after he promised to give women the vote and equal rights to the coloured community in the 1920s. After fulfilling the first promise to give women the vote in 1930, but not the second, the community began baking the cookies with a brown and pink icing called \\"twee gevreetjie\\" (Afrikaans for \\"hypocrite\\"), showing their dissatisfaction with him. Another possible source of the dessert's origin is the Afrikaans practice following the Second Anglo-Boer War to name confections after national heroes.  Composition  Hertzogkoekies are prepared from a pastry base with an open top that is filled with apricot jam. It is topped with a desiccated or grated coconut meringue topping and baked.

The team was formed in January 2009 in the Japanese DDT Pro-Wrestling promotion, where, over the next five years, they won the KO-D Tag Team Championship on two occasions. The team also made appearances for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where they won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship once. The team disbanded when Omega left DDT in October 2014. Omega and Ibushi reunited at The New Beginning in Sapporo in January 2018. History Kota Ibushi In July 2008, Canadian wrestler Kenny Omega started his first Japanese tour with the DDT Pro-Wrestling promotion, where he quickly became friends with Kota Ibushi, with the two forming a tag team named \\"Golden‚òÜLovers\\" in January 2009. On January 24, Ibushi and Omega defeated Harashima and Toru Owashi to win the KO-D Tag Team Championship for the first time. After one successful defense, they lost the title to Francesco Togo and Piza Michinoku on May 10. Over the following years, Omega and Ibushi established themselves as one of the top tag teams on the Japanese independent circuit. On January 31, 2010, the Golden‚òÜLovers made their debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), defeating Gedo and Jado by referee stoppage, when Jado was legitimately injured. Afterwards, the Golden‚òÜLovers engaged in a rivalry with Apollo 55, a tag team made up of Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi. On October 11 at NJPW's Destruction '10 event, the Golden‚òÜLovers defeated Apollo 55 to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, in a match that was later named the 2010 Match of the Year by Tokyo Sports, becoming the first junior heavyweight tag team match in history to win the award. After making successful title defenses against Apollo 55 and the team of Gedo and Jado, with both matches taking place back in DDT, Ibushi and Omega lost the title back to Apollo 55 on January 23, 2011, during NJPW's Fantastica Mania 2011 weekend. The Golden‚òÜLovers received a rematch for the title on August 14, but were again defeated by Apollo 55. Meanwhile in DDT, Ibushi and Omega came together with Gota Ihashi to form the Golden‚òÜRendezvousÔΩû stable, with the three holding the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship from May 26 to June 23, 2013. On January 26, 2014, the Golden‚òÜLovers won the KO-D Tag Team Championship for the second time by defeating reigning champions Yankii Nichokenju (Isami Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto) and the team of Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo in a three-way match. On April 12, Ibushi and Omega became double champions, when the two, along with the newest member of the Golden‚òÜRendezvousÔΩû stable, Daisuke Sasaki, defeated Team Drift (Keisuke Ishii, Shigehiro Irie and Soma Takao) for the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The trio's reign lasted until May 4, when they were defeated by Shuten-d≈çji (Kudo, Masa Takanashi and Yukio Sakaguchi) in their second defense. Ibushi and Omega continued holding the KO-D Tag Team Championship until September 28, 2014, when they were defeated by Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo. On October 3, 2014, Omega announced he was leaving DDT and signing with NJPW, where Ibushi was already a semi-regular. However, with Ibushi having recently moved to NJPW's heavyweight division, Omega stated that the Golden‚òÜLovers were done as a tag team due to him wanting to remain in the junior heavyweight division. The Golden‚òÜLovers wrestled their final match together on October 26, 2014, when they defeated Danshoku Dino and Konosuke Takeshita in Omega's DDT farewell match. On January 28, 2018, the Golden‚òÜLovers were apparently reformed after Omega was seemingly kicked out of Bullet Club and attacked by fellow member Cody. Ibushi made the save for Omega as Bullet Club fled the scene. At first, Omega refused to shake Ibushi's hand, but moments after, both Omega and Ibushi emotionally embraced as confetti fell to the ring. At Honor Rising: Japan Night 2 on February 24, the Golden‚òÜLovers won their return match as a team against Cody and Marty Scurll. After the match, Omega and Ibushi were confronted by The Young Bucks and challenged to a match at Strong Style Evolved on March 25, which the Golden‚òÜLovers won. At Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall, Omega defeated Kazuchika Okada to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Omega reunited with The Young Bucks, forming the Golden‚òÜElite along with Ibushi. On the finals of the World Tag League, Ibushi defeated Hirooki Goto to win the NEVER Openweight Championship. At Wrestle Kingdom, Ibushi lost the NEVER Openweight Championship to Will Ospreay and Omega lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi. At the end of January, Omega left NJPW to join All Elite Wrestling in the United States meanwhile Ibushi stayed in NJPW full-time, disbanding for the second time.

Anatomy Bacteria of the genus Oscillatoria occur in rows of cells of similar size. They form filaments called trichomes. Many trichomes are enveloped in a firm casing, but in this genus the casing is almost non-existent. This gives the filaments easier mobility in all directions. Nitrogen fixing ability This species of Oscillatoria is able to fix nitrogen, but unlike other bacteria, it is uncertain whether or not it has cells specialized for that particular purpose. Hormogonia Fragments of filaments of Oscillatoria willei are called hormogonia. They consist of dozens of cells, which sometimes break off to reproduce by establishing new colonies. Danger to Humans Like all species of Oscillatoria, this species can cause skin irritation in humans who come in close contact with them in the tropics.Ocean, American Museum of Natural History, 2015 References Oscillatoriales ","title":"Oscillatoria willei"},{"id":"51136320","text":"An intelligence engine is a type of enterprise information management that combines business rule management, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to form a unified information access platform that provides real-time intelligence through search technologies, dashboards and/or existing business infrastructure. Intelligence Engines are process and/or business problem specific, resulting in industry and/or function-specific marketing trademarks associated with them. They can be differentiated from enterprise resource planning (ERP) software in that intelligence engines include organization- level business rules and proactive decision management functionality. History The first intelligence engine application appears to have been introduced in 2001 by Sonus Networks, Inc. in their patent US6961334 B1. Applied to the field of telecommunications systems, the intelligence engine was composed of a database queried by a data distributor layer, received by a telephony management layer and acted upon by a facility management command & control layer. This combined standalone business intelligence tools like a data warehouse, reporting and querying software and a decision support system. The concept was reinforced in 2002 in patent application US20030236689 A1 which applied predictive quantitative models to data and used rules to correlate context data at different stages of the business process with business process outcomes to be presented to end users. LogRhythm Inc. advanced the concept in 2010 by adding event managers to the end of the intelligence engine's process to determine reporting, remediation and other outcomes. In 2016, professional service company KPMG continued to advance the concept by commercializing intelligence engines with the introduction of Third Party Intelligence, which is differentiated from past intelligence engines in its increased use of embedded intellectual property, diversity of global data inputs and focus on predictive analytics to mitigate risk and yield cost savings. Traits As a system that combines human intelligence, data inputs, automated decision-making and unified information access, intelligence engines are an advancement in business intelligence tools because they: * integrate structured data and unstructured content in a single index * provide advanced workflow automation that can trigger multiple business processes * project future impact of data such as supply chain threats * recommend best actions / highlight opportunities for process improvement * leverage business intelligence from a variety of experts * combine human expertise with the power of technology to deliver actionable intelligence * scale data visualization capabilities with the number of users Applications * Attivio Active Intelligence Engine * KPMG Spectrum Intelligence Engine(s) * Salesforce Service Cloud Intelligence Engine * FireEye Threat Intelligence Engine * Factiva Intelligence Engine * Parasoft Process Intelligence Engine See also * Business intelligence (BI) * Business intelligence tools * Business rule management system * Data mining * Data science * Decision management * Enterprise information management * Predictive analytics * Prescriptive analytics References Data management Information management Big data Business terms Business intelligence Information systems ","title":"Intelligence engine"},{"id":"51136334","text":"The Football (Disorder) Act 2000 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom enacted during the premiership of Tony Blair. It served as an amendment to the Football Spectators Act 1989, and strengthened football banning orders (FBOs), a civil order imposed to those convicted of football- related offences. FBOs may be issued by courts in the United Kingdom, or following a complaint from a local police force. The Act was \\"rushed through Parliament\\" by then-Home Secretary Jack Straw following violent clashes during UEFA Euro 2000. It allows police in England and Wales to arrest those suspected of travelling abroad to participate in hooliganism at international games, and to withhold their passports up to five days before an international fixture. Straw stated during an opposition day for his Bill that he was keen to enact the new laws in time for England's next international game against France in September 2000. FBOs, introduced by Football Spectators Act 1989, may ban an individual from football grounds in the United Kingdom for two to ten years, with provisions for individual cases. Supporters may also be barred from using public transport on matchdays, and from town centres and built-up, high-risk areas prior to and following matches. The Act has been criticised by civil liberties campaigners for being \\"draconian\\", fearing it may result in profiling based on fan appearance. More than 450 supporters were prevented from travelling to Greece for a World Cup qualifier in 2001 under the Act.

Plot A couple Nagireddy and Gouamma in Ramapuram village near Srisailam. They are very kind in nature and always helped many poor people. But these couples were very unhappy because they did not have any children. They went to Srisailam Malikarjuna Swamy temple on Sivarathri and worshiped wholeheartedly to fulfill their desire of having a kid. One night, Mallikarjuna Swamy appeared in Nagireddy‚Äôs dream and said that a devoted daughter would be born to them. He shared this great news with his wife and felt very happy. Later, a girl child was born to them. Nagireddy named his daughter as Mallamma because she was a gift of Lord Mallikarjuna. They brought up that girl with all care and love. From childhood, she devoted herself to Lord Shiva which made her parents happy. When Mallamma grew old enough, her parents decided to do her marriage with a guy named Baramareddy. He was a son of a rich man of Siddhapuram called Hemareddy. As Mallamma stepped in her in- laws‚Äô house the wealth and glory at their house also started increasing. She continued her charity and helped the poor and needy in her in-laws‚Äô house also. Mallamma‚Äôs sister-in-law Nagamma was very rude and she was unable to tolerate this good nature of Mallamma. Nagamma complained about Mallamma to her mother and brother. Mallamma‚Äôs mother-in-law started torturing by asking her to do all hard work. Mallamma was bearing all these and she never stopped worshiping Lord Shiva. They started sending her to herd the cows; there also she continued her Siva pooja. Later they told Baramanna about Mallamma‚Äôs character and forced him to kill Mallamma. When Baramanna saw her worshiping Mallikarjuna Swamy, who came to her as sage, he dropped his knife. Finally, Mallamma pleased all her family members with her incomparable devotions to Lord Siva and went about the country preaching Shivatathvam and finally reached the presence of Siva.

History  M…ôrk…ôzi Elmi Kitabxananƒ±n binasƒ± After the biggest Library in Transcaucasia was shut down for some years in 1920, Baku needed a new library. In November 1923, the ANAS Central Library of Science began as the office of bibliography of the Azerbaijan Society of Research and Investigation (Az…ôrbaycanƒ± T…ôdqiq v…ô T…ôt…ôbb√∂ C…ômiyy…ôti) or ATTC. It was supported by individuals including Nariman Narimanov, Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev, Taghi Shahbazi, and Hanafi Zeynalli. The founding director was Alexander Vasilyevich Baqriyin. On opening, the library held 430 books and 1200 manuscripts. In August 1925, in order to prevent duplication, the library and the bibliography office became one, the Library-Bibliography Bureau. Hanafi Zeynalli (1896-1938) became the chairman. In 1945, the library was further developed in association with the Academy of Sciences. From 1963 to 1984, the library was known as the \\"Fundamental Library\\". After 1984, it was called the \\"Central Scientific Library\\". Its directors have included S. M. Yahyazade, Y. ƒ∞. Tahirov, Nazim Akhundov, Rasim Kazimov, Mahbube Hasanova, Amin Efendiyev, Aybeniz Aliyeva-Kengerli and Leyla Bekir Imanova. On January 4, 2003, the president, Heydar Aliyev ratified the 54th item of the Article 5 of the Charter of ANAS, giving the library the status of a scientific institution. On May 5, 2014, a new library building was opened by the president.  International relations  In 1993, the CSL became a member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. In 2012, ANAS SCL became a full member of the Association of Scientific Libraries, Council of Europe. The library provides a service for international book exchange. The library invites international guests and ambassadors to visit the library. The library also sends members abroad to study librarianship and attend conferences and exhibitions in other nations.  Collections  The library's collections include works in Azerbaijani language, works in Russian, and works in eastern languages. Georg Hazai's private collection of works in Turkish is housed in the library. Other private collections at the library include those of Y. E. Bertels, Y. A. Belyayev, B. N. Zaxoder, Zahid Huseynzade and gifts of Niyazi and others. There are also books and journals in Western European languages. The rare book collection is noted for the personal collection of the numismatic scholar, Y. A. Pakhomov and the copies of encyclopaedia sets from many nations. The library holds periodicals and dissertations in hard and electronic copies. Other entities such as the Azerbaijan Society of Petroleum Geologists, the Nakhchivan section of ANAS, and the National History Museum also keep collections in the library.  Library spaces  Conference Hall The library has fourteen reading rooms of various sizes catering for 1,000 visitors, spread through the floors of the library. The Academicians' Hall is a special work area for members of the Academy of Sciences. The Dissertation Hall provides a space for presentation and discussion of papers and proposals, especially those directed to the innovation department of the ANAS. The Z…ôkalƒ± Discussion Room is a space for discussion amongst board members, experts, designers, and working groups with technological fittings to assist them.

Designed by Lev Rudnev as the headquarters of Moscow State University, it is the tallest of seven Moscow skyscrapers in the Stalinist architectural style constructed between 1947 and 1953. It was until 1990 the tallest building in Europe; it remains the tallest educational building in the world. Features The star on top of the building. The skyscraper has 36 levels in its central part and is tall. Its roof () is topped by a 58-metre spire which ends with a 12-ton five-pointed star. Lateral towers are lower than the central one; two 18 and 9 storey dormitory wings define, with the central corpus of the complex, a cour d'honneur courtyard. Among the statues which decorate the building is a sculpture by Vera Muchina representing a couple of students and a statue by N. Tomsky of Mikhail Lomonosov (1711‚Äì1765), the founder of Moscow University. The University premises cover around 1.6 square kilometres. The complex was partially renovated in 2000. The Main Building of Moscow State University is not open to the general public. Visitors from outside the university must be pre-approved by their university host and must submit their domestic passport (Russian) or international passport in order to gain entry. History Main entrance A 1960 soviet stamp features the main building of Moscow State University The leading architect Boris Iofan bid for the skyscraper project in 1947 but the job was assigned to Lev Rudnev, because Iofan made a mistake placing his draft skyscraper right on the edge of Sparrow Hills, a site concerned with a potential landslide hazard. Rudnev had already built important edifices like the M. V. Frunze Military Academy (1932‚Äì1937) and the Marshals' Apartments (Sadovaya-Kudrinskaya, 28, 1947), earning esteem of the Communist Party. He set the building 800 meters away from the cliff. The chief of the engineers' team was Vsevolod Nikolaevich Nasonov. The main tower, which consumed over 40,000 tons of steel for its framework and 130,000 cubic metres of concrete, was inaugurated on September 1, 1953. At 240 metres tall, it was the 7th tallest building of the world as well as the tallest in Europe. Its European height record held until 1990, when surpassed by the Messeturm in Frankfurt, Germany. It was also, and still remains, the tallest educational building in the world. Moscow University is probably the best known of Rudnev's buildings, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949. The University skyline inspired various buildings in the socialist countries, like the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, and also the logo of 1980 Moscow Olympic Games.

It will also serve as a feeder service to Kochi Metro. The project has obtained the final environment clearance on Oct 2019, and its first phase is expected to be complete in a year, by Nov 2020. Overview Two variants of modernised air-conditioned and Wi-Fi enabled catamaran passenger boats are proposed for the project. The boats with passenger capacity of 50 and 100, will operate at an optimal speed of 8 knots, with the potential to increase up to 12 knots. The boats will be equipped with latest safety and communication devices. Small battery operated boats will ply on the narrow lanes. The headways vary between 10 minutes to 20 minutes across various routes. The jetties are proposed to have floating pontoons with automatic docking system technology. The floating pontoons will be covered with retractable sheds to provide comfort during rainy season. 23 transgender people are also employed in the services. As part of the infrastructure, Intelligent Navigation System and Operation Control Centre (OCC) are also proposed and will be integrated with the city‚Äôs intelligent transportation system. The Automatic Fare Collection system being implemented by the Kochi Metro will be extended to water transport system which facilitates travelling the metro train and the boat using the same ticket. Apart from ferry service, the project also contemplate development of the new and existing access roads to jetties and islands. Two boatyards are proposed, at Thevara and Pizhala. The project also seeks to improve livelihoods in the areas along the backwaters and the islands in Kochi. Tourism is also proposed to be promoted as part of the project. =Phase I= During the phase I, it is proposed to operate 7 routes with a fleet requirement of 43 boats. In phase-I, 16 out of the 38 jetties will be developed and was supposed to be completed by 2018. KMRL is yet to share updated timelines on completion of Phase 1 as of August 2019. The 1st Phase to be completed by January 2021. =Phase II= The entire water transport project will be fully operationalised by 2019. In Phase II, it is proposed to operate 9 routes with a total of 16 routes and a fleet requirement of 78 boats. Funding The total cost of the Water Metro project is . The KfW Development Bank will be providing EUR 85 million as long term soft loan and the Government of Kerala will be contributing .

The forest covers areas in Caledonia, Orange, and Washington Counties. Major roads through the forest are U.S. Route 302 and Vermont Route 232. The forest is managed by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation for timber resources, wildlife habitat, and recreational activities. It is home to seven state parks: Big Deer State Park, Boulder Beach State Park, Kettle Pond State Park, New Discovery State Park, Ricker Pond State Park, Seyon Lodge State Park and Stillwater State Park. The state also operates the Groton Nature Center to educate about the natural history of the forest and parks. Activities in the park include camping, hiking, swimming, boating, fishing, hunting, trapping, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing. The Montpelier-Wells River Rail Trail, part of the Cross Vermont Trail, is 12 miles long and bisects the length of Groton State Forest. Snowmobiling is allowed on designated VAST trails. Natural features Groton State Forest features three state-designated natural areas, Peacham Bog Natural Area (748 acres), Tabletop Mountain Natural Area (129 acres) and Lords Hill Natural Area (25 acres). There are eight lakes and ponds: Lake Groton (422 acres), Kettle Pond (109 acres), Martins Pond (82 acres), Turtlehead Pond or Marshfield Pond (69 acres), Noyes Pond (39 acres), Osmore Pond (48 acres), Peacham Pond (340 acres), and Ricker Pond (95 acres). History The state began to acquire parts of the forest in 1919. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) developed many park features including roads, trails, fire lookouts, and picnic shelters. The CCC also planted trees within the forest. The forest used to house twelve sawmills and the state still manages lumbering in the forest. Many trails use old logging roads.

This species is also known as \\"sea sawdust\\". It was originally discovered in 1770 by Captain Cook off the coast of Australia. Anatomy This is a prolific nitrogen-fixing and phosphorus reducing species of bacteria that fixes approximately half of the nitrogen in the food chain of the ocean and contributes to the turn over of phosphorus. Unlike other bacteria, it can also photosynthesize. This is a colonial species that forms long filaments and tends to accumulate with other Trichodesmium. It is gram-negative and motile. Some of the bacteria in the colony fix the nitrogen, and others are specialized for photosynthesis. However, the two processes must be done with two of them, because the oxygen byproduct that results from photosynthesis would interfere with the nitrogen-fixing process. This is done either by, having two separate cells share resources with each other or by separating the processes by time in the same cell. If the cells are physically separated, then one cell specializes as a diazotroph and undergoes nitrogen fixation while other cells undergo photosynthesis. Alternatively, T. erythraeum also has been shown to separate the processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the same cell by separating the time at which these processes occur. When this is done T. erythraeum will stop photosynthesizing at midday or night and begin oxygen scavenging as it begins nitrogen fixation. Additionally, T. erythraeum have gas vesicles that account for 60‚Äì70% of the cell's volume. These vesicles allow T. erythraeum to move in the water coulomb up to 200 m using its buoyancy based on the concentrations of carbohydrates in order to search out nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron.  Genetics  T. erythraeum has one of the largest genomes sequenced so far at 7.75 mbp. It has a GC content of 34% and contains approximately 40% non-coding DNA. There is evidence to suggest that the genome is in an expanding dynamic state due to the expansion of the genome through horizontal gene transfer. T. erythraeum shows a 98% homology with T. thiebautii but only a 75% homology with other cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria.  Environment  T. erythraeum was isolated off the coast of North Carolina. It resides in tropical and subtropical areas of the ocean typically from the surface to 40m however they can travel as deep as 200 m in search of nutrients. They have a pH optima of 7.8‚Äì8.4 and an optimal temperature of 24‚Äì30 degrees Celsius in aerobic conditions. T. erythraeum can, however, survive in lower temperatures and through periods of darkness. Discoloration of the Red Sea This species can also literally turn the Red Sea a red color that can be seen from outer space. The cause of this is unknown, but most scientists believe that a species of bacteria of the Trichodesmium genus, most likely this species, is the cause.

This class is for people with limb deficiencies not covered by other classes. It includes people who are members of the ISOD A1 and A9 classes. Events open to people in this class include the shot put, discus and javelin.  Definition  International Paralympic Committee defined this classification on their website in July 2016, \\" Athletes who meet one or more of the MDC for impaired muscle power, limb deficiency, impaired passive range of movement and leg length difference, who do not fit any of the previously described profiles, fall into this class.\\" The Spectator Guide for the Rio Paralympics defines the class as, \\"wheelchair athletes (effects of polio, spinal cord injuries and amputations)\\" People competing in the seated position in this class have mobility limitations that cannot exceed 70 points.

The nature of a person's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. People in this class use around 120% more oxygen to walk or run the same distance as some one without a lower limb amputation. A study of was done comparing the performance of athletics competitors at the 1984 Summer Paralympics.

From the 2004 Summer Paralympics to the 2012 Summer Paralympics, there was no significant changes in performance times put up by male sprinters in 100 meter, 200 meter and 400 meter events.  Upper and lower limb amputees  Type of amputation for an A9 classified sportsperson. Members of the ISOD A9 class compete in T42, T43, T44, F42, F43, F44, F56, F57, and F58. The nature of an A9 athletes's amputations can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because of the potential for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training, amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than . Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. Because they are missing a limb, amputees are more prone to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems with intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, epicondylitis and peripheral nerve entrapment. = Les Autres = People who are Les Autres compete in this class. This includes LAF3 classified athletes. In general, Les Autres classes cover sportspeople with locomotor disabilities regardless of their diagnosis.Tweedy, S. M. (2003). The ICF and Classification in Disability Athletics. In R. Madden, S. Bricknell, C. Sykes and L. York (Ed.), ICF Australian User Guide, Version 1.0, Disability Series (pp. 82-88)Canberra: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.  LAF3  In athletics, LAF3 competitors compete in F54, F55, F56, F57 and F58 events. These are wheelchair athletics classes. Athletes in this class have normal functioning in their throwing arm. While throwing, they can generally maintain good balance. Competitors in this class may also compete in T44. This is a standing class for people with weakness in one leg muscle or who have joint restrictions. At the 1984 Summer Paralympics, LAF1, LAF2 and LAF3 track athletes had the 60 meters and 400 meter distances on the program. There was a large range of sportspeople with different disabilities in this class at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. LAF3 is an Les Autres sports classification. Sportspeople in this class use wheelchairs on a regular basis as a result of reduced muscle function. They have normal trunk functionality, balance and use of their upper limbs. Medically, this class includes people with hemiparesis, and hip and knee stiffness with deformation in one arm. It means they have limited function in at least two limbs. In terms of functional classification, this means the sportsperson uses a wheelchair, has good sitting balance and has good arm function. For the 1984 Summer Paralympics, LAF3 was defined by the Games organizers as, \\"Wheelchair bound with normal arm function and good sitting balance.\\" = Spinal cord injuries = People with spinal cord injuries compete in this class, including F7 sportspeople.  F7  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F7 class. F7 is wheelchair sport classification, that corresponds to the neurological level S1 - S2. Historically, this class has been called Lower 5. In 2002, USA Track & Field defined this class as, \\"These athletes also have the ability to move side to side, so they can throw across their body. They usually can bend one hip backward to push the thigh into the chair, and can bend one ankle downward to push down with the foot. Neurological level: S1-S2.\\" People with a lesion at S1 have their hamstring and peroneal muscles effected. Functionally, they can bend their knees and lift their feet. They can walk on their own, though they may require ankle braces or orthopedic shoes. They can generally change in any physical activity. People with lesions at the L4 to S2 who are complete paraplegics may have motor function issues in their gluts and hamstrings. Their quadriceps are likely to be unaffected. They may be absent sensation below the knees and in the groin area. Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Have very good sitting balance and movements in the backwards and forwards plane. Usually have very good balance and movements towards one side (side to side movements) due to presence of one functional hip abductor, on the side that movement is towards. Usually can bend one hip backwards; i.e. push the thigh into the chair. Usually can bend one ankle downwards; ie. push the foot onto the foot plate. The side that is strong is important when considering how much it will help functional performance.\\" Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. F7 throwers compete from a seated position. The javelin they throw weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . There are performance differences and similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F7 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F4 to F9 throwers. A 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999).

Performance and rules  Athletes in this class used secure frames for throwing events. The frame can be only one of two shapes: A rectangle or square. The sides must be at least long. The seat needs to be lower at the back or level, and it cannot be taller than . This height includes any cushioning or padding. Throwers can have footplates on their frames, but the footplate can only be used for stability. It cannot be used to push off from. Rests can be used on the frame but they need to be present only for safety reasons and to aide in athlete stability. They need to be manufactured from rigid materials that do not move. These materials may include steel or aluminum. The backrest can have cushioning but it cannot be thicker than . It cannot have any movable parts. The frame can also have a holding bar. The holding bar needs to be round or square, and needs to be a single straight piece. Athletes are not required to use a holding bar during their throw, and they can hold on to any part of the frame during their throw. Throwing frames should be inspected prior to the event. This should be done either in the call room or in the competition area. In general, people in this class should be allocated around 2 minutes to set up their chair. Athletes need to throw from a seated position. They cannot throw from an inclined or other position. Doing so could increase the contribution of their legs and benefit their performance. Their legs must be in contact with the seat during the throw. If an athlete throws from a non-seated position, this is counted as a foul. People in this class cannot put tape on their hands. All straps used to hold the athlete to the frame must be non-elastic. While in the process of throwing, an athlete cannot touch a tie-down for the frame. Because of visibility issues for officials, athletes cannot wear lose clothing and they can ask athletes to tuck in clothing if they feel there is any issue with visibility. In throwing events at the Paralympic Games and World Championships, athletes get three trial throws. After that, the top 8 throwers get an additional three throws. For other events, organizers generally have the option to use that formula to give all throwers six consecutive throws. The total number of warm-up throws is at the discretion of the meet director.  At the Paralympic Games  For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, athletics classification was scheduled for September 4 and September 5 at Olympic Stadium. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.  Events  Competitors in this class compete in shot put, discus and javelin.  Becoming classified  For this class, classification generally has four phase. The first stage of classification is a health examination. For amputees in this class, this is often done on site at a sports training facility or competition. The second stage is observation in practice, the third stage is observation in competition and the last stage is assigning the sportsperson to a relevant class. Sometimes the health examination may not be done on site because the nature of the amputation could cause not physically visible alterations to the body. This is especially true for lower limb amputees as it relates to how their limbs align with their hips and the impact this has on their spine and how their skull sits on their spine. During the observation phase involving training or practice, all athletes in this class may be asked to demonstrate their skills in athletics, such as running, jumping or throwing. A determination is then made as to what classification an athlete should compete in. Classifications may be Confirmed or Review status. For athletes who do not have access to a full classification panel, Provisional classification is available; this is a temporary Review classification, considered an indication of class only, and generally used only in lower levels of competition. While some people in this class may be ambulatory, they generally go through the classification process while using a wheelchair. This is because they often compete from a seated position. Failure to do so could result in them being classified as an ambulatory class competitor. For people in this class with amputations, classification is often based on the anatomical nature of the amputation. The classification system takes several things into account when putting people into this class. These includes which limbs are effected, how many limbs are effected, and how much of a limb is missing.International Sports Organization for the Disabled. (1993). Handbook. Newmarket, ON: Author. Available Federacion Espanola de Deportes de Minusvalidos Fisicos, c/- Ferraz, 16 Bajo, 28008 Madrid, Spain.

It found there was no significant difference in performance in times between men in the A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9 in the discus, men in A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9 in the javelin, and men in A8 and A9 in the shot put. The nature of an A9 athlete's amputations can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because of the potential for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training, amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than . Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. Because they are missing a limb, amputees are more prone to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems with intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, epicondylitis and peripheral nerve entrapment. = Les Autres = People who are Les Autres compete in this class. This includes LAF3 classified athletes. In general, Les Autres classes cover sportspeople with locomotor disabilities regardless of their diagnosis.Tweedy, S. M. (2003). The ICF and Classification in Disability Athletics. In R. Madden, S. Bricknell, C. Sykes and L. York (Ed.), ICF Australian User Guide, Version 1.0, Disability Series (pp. 82-88)Canberra: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.  LAF3  In athletics, LAF3 competitors compete in F54, F55, F56, F57 and F58 events. These are wheelchair athletics classes. Athletes in this class have normal functioning in their throwing arm. While throwing, they can generally maintain good balance. Competitors in this class may also compete in T44. This is a standing class for people with weakness in one leg muscle or who have joint restrictions. At the 1984 Summer Paralympics, LAF1, LAF2 and LAF3 track athletes had the 60 meters and 400 meter distances on the program. There was a large range of sportspeople with different disabilities in this class at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. LAF3 is an Les Autres sports classification. Sportspeople in this class use wheelchairs on a regular basis as a result of reduced muscle function. They have normal trunk functionality, balance and use of their upper limbs. Medically, this class includes people with hemiparsis, and hip and knee stiffness with deformation in one arm. It means they have limited function in at least two limbs. In terms of functional classification, this means the sportsperson uses a wheelchair, has good sitting balance and has good arm function. For the 1984 Summer Paralympics, LAF3 was defined by the Games organizers as, \\"Wheelchair bound with normal arm function and good sitting balance.\\" = Spinal cord injuries = People with spinal cord injuries compete in this class, including F5 sportspeople.  F5  Functional profile of a wheelchair sportsperson in the F5 class. Comparing key muscle innervations for spinal cord levels compared to cycling and athletics classifications. This is wheelchair sport classification that corresponds to the neurological level T8 - L1. In the past, this class was known as Lower 3, or Upper 4. Disabled Sports USA defined the anatomical definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Normal upper limb function. Have abdominal muscles and spinal extensors (upper or more commonly upper and lower). May have non- functional hip flexors (grade 1). Have no abductor function.\\" People in this class have good sitting balance. People with lesions located between T9 and T12 have some loss of abdominal muscle control. Disabled Sports USA defined the functional definition of this class in 2003 as, \\"Three trunk movements may be seen in this class: 1) Off the back of a chair (in an upwards direction). 2) Movement in the backwards and forwards plane. 3) Some trunk rotation. They have fair to good sitting balance. They cannot have functional hip flexors, i.e. ability to lift the thigh upwards in the sitting position. They may have stiffness of the spine that improves balance but reduces the ability to rotate the spine.\\" Field events open to this class have included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this class have included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m. F5 athletes throw from a seated position, and use a javelin that weighs . The shot put used by women in this class weighs less than the traditional one at . Athletes in this class who good trunk control and mobility have an advantage over athletes in the same class who have less functional trunk control and mobility. This functional difference can cause different performance results within the same class, with discus throwers with more control in a class able to throw the discus further.Chow, J. W., & Mindock, L. A. (1999). Discus throwing performances and medical classification of wheelchair athletes. Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise,31(9), 1272-1279. doi:10.1097/00005768-199909000-00007 There are performance differences and similarities between this class and other wheelchair classes. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F5 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle similar to that of F3 to F9 throwers. A 1999 study of discus throwers found that for F5 to F8 discus throwers, the upper arm tends to be near horizontal at the moment of release of the discus. F5 to F7 discus throwers have greater angular speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2 to F4. F5 and F8 discus throwers have less average angular forearm speed than F2 and F4 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexion to compensate for the shoulder flexion advantage of F5 to F8 throwers.

The frame can be only one of two shapes: A rectangle or square. The sides must be at least long. The seat needs to be lower at the back or level, and it cannot be taller than . This height includes any cushioning or padding. Throwers can have footplates on their frames, but the footplate can only be used for stability. It cannot be used to push off from. Rests can be used on the frame but they need to be present only for safety reasons and to aide in athlete stability. They need to be manufactured from rigid materials that do not move. These materials may include steel or aluminum. The backrest can have cushioning but it cannot be thicker than . It cannot have any movable parts. The frame can also have a holding bar. The holding bar needs to be round or square, and needs to be a single straight piece. Athletes are not required to use a holding bar during their throw, and they can hold on to any part of the frame during their throw. Throwing frames should be inspected prior to the event. This should be done either in the call room or in the competition area. In general, people in this class should be allocated around 2 minutes to set up their chair. Athletes need to throw from a seated position. They cannot throw from an inclined or other position. Doing so could increase the contribution of their legs and benefit their performance. Their legs must be in contact with the seat during the throw. If an athlete throws from a non-seated position, this is counted as a foul. People in this class cannot put tape on their hands. All straps used to hold the athlete to the frame must be non- elastic. While in the process of throwing, an athlete cannot touch a tie-down for the frame. Because of visibility issues for officials, athletes cannot wear lose clothing and they can ask athletes to tuck in clothing if they feel there is any issue with visibility. In throwing events at the Paralympic Games and World Championships, athletes get three trial throws. After that, the top 8 throwers get an additional three throws. For other events, organizers generally have the option to use that formula to give all throwers six consecutive throws. The total number of warm-up throws is at the discretion of the meet director.  Events  Competitors in this class participate in javelin, shot put and discus. Because of functionality issues, in the shot put, athletes tend to use rotary movements. In the javelin and discus, they tend to use backwards and forwards movement.  History  In older classification systems that predated the current system, F56 competitors were classified as lower 3, upper 4. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, athletics classification was scheduled for September 4 and September 5 at Olympic Stadium. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.  Becoming classified  For this class, classification generally has four phase. The first stage of classification is a health examination. For amputees in this class, this is often done on site at a sports training facility or competition. The second stage is observation in practice, the third stage is observation in competition and the last stage is assigning the sportsperson to a relevant class. Sometimes the health examination may not be done on site because the nature of the amputation could cause not physically visible alterations to the body. This is especially true for lower limb amputees as it relates to how their limbs align with their hips and the impact this has on their spine and how their skull sits on their spine. During the observation phase involving training or practice, all athletes in this class may be asked to demonstrate their skills in athletics, such as running, jumping or throwing. A determination is then made as to what classification an athlete should compete in. Classifications may be Confirmed or Review status. For athletes who do not have access to a full classification panel, Provisional classification is available; this is a temporary Review classification, considered an indication of class only, and generally used only in lower levels of competition. While some people in this class may be ambulatory, they generally go through the classification process while using a wheelchair. This is because they often compete from a seated position. Failure to do so could result in them being classified as an ambulatory class competitor. For people in this class with amputations, classification is often based on the anatomical nature of the amputation. The classification system takes several things into account when putting people into this class. These includes which limbs are effected, how many limbs are effected, and how much of a limb is missing.International Sports Organization for the Disabled. (1993). Handbook. Newmarket, ON: Author.

It was written by Philippe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick, and published by the Cambridge University Press in 2009. It won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 2019. Topics The main part of the book is organized into three parts. The first part, covering three chapters and roughly the first quarter of the book, concerns the symbolic method in combinatorics, in which classes of combinatorial objects are associated with formulas that describe their structures, and then those formulas are reinterpreted to produce the generating functions or exponential generating functions of the classes, in some cases using tools such as the Lagrange inversion theorem as part of the reinterpretation process. The chapters in this part divide the material into the enumeration of unlabeled objects, the enumeration of labeled objects, and multivariate generating functions. The five chapters of the second part of the book, roughly half of the text and \\"the heart of the book\\", concern the application of tools from complex analysis to the generating function, in order to understand the asymptotics of the numbers of objects in a combinatorial class. In particular, for sufficiently well-behaved generating functions, Cauchy's integral formula can be used to recover the power series coefficients (the real object of study) from the generating function, and knowledge of the singularities of the function can be used to derive accurate estimates of the resulting integrals. After an introductory chapter and a chapter giving examples of the possible behaviors of rational functions and meromorphic functions, the remaining chapters of this part discuss the way the singularities of a function can be used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of its power series, apply this method to a large number of combinatorial examples, and study the saddle-point method of contour integration for handling some trickier examples. The final part investigates the behavior of random combinatorial structures, rather than the total number of structures, using the same toolbox. Beyond expected values for combinatorial quantities of interest, it also studies limit theorems and large deviations theory for these quantities. Three appendices provide background on combinatorics and asymptotics, in complex analysis, and in probability theory. The combinatorial structures that are investigate throughout the book range widely over sequences, formal languages, partitions and compositions, permutations, graphs and paths in graphs, and lattice paths. With these topics, the analysis in the book connects to applications in other areas including abstract algebra, number theory, and the analysis of algorithms. Audience and reception Analytic Combinatorics is not primarily a textbook; for instance, it has no exercises. Nevertheless, it can be used as the textbook for an upper-level undergraduate elective, graduate course, or seminar, although reviewer Mikl√≥s B√≥na writes that some selection is needed, as it \\"has enough material for three or more semesters\\". It can also be a reference for researchers in this subject. Reviewer Toufik Mansour calls it not only \\"a comprehensive theoretical treatment\\" but \\"an interesting read\\". Reviewer Christopher Hanusa writes that \\"the writing style is inviting, the subject material is contemporary and riveting\\", and he recommends the book to anyone \\"learning or working in combinatorics\\". Analytic Combinatorics won the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition of the American Mathematical Society in 2019 (posthumously for Flajolet). The award citation called the book \\"an authoritative and highly accessible compendium of its subject, which demonstrates the deep interface between combinatorial mathematics and classical analysis\\". Although the application of analytic methods in combinatorics goes back at least to the work of G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan on the partition function, the citation also quoted a review by Robin Pemantle stating that \\"This is one of those books that marks the emergence of a subfield,\\" the subfield of analytic combinatorics. Similarly, B√≥na concludes, \\"Analytic Combinatorics is now defined. The authors wrote the book on it.\\" References External links *Analytic Combinatorics author web site, including a full-text downloadable copy of the book Enumerative combinatorics Mathematics books 2009 non-fiction books ","title":"Analytic Combinatorics"},{"id":"51136654","text":"Display of nutcracker dolls Collection of fairy tale nutcrackers Nutcracker dolls, also known as Christmas nutcrackers, are decorative nutcracker figurines most commonly made to resemble a toy soldier. In German tradition, the dolls are symbols of good luck, frightening away malevolent spirits. While nearly all nutcrackers from before the first half of the 20th century are functional, a significant proportion of modern nutcrackers are primarily decorative, and not able to crack nuts. Nutcrackers are also a part of German folklore, serving as protectors of a house. History Original nutcracker dolls from Nussknacker Museum in Neuhausen, Saxony Nutcracker dolls originate from late-17th century Germany, particularly the Ore Mountains (German: Erzgebirge) region. One origin story attributes the creation of the first nutcracker doll to a craftsman from Seiffen. They were often given as gifts, and at some point they became associated with Christmas season. They grew in popularity around the 19th century and spread to nearby European countries. As the demand grew, nutcracker doll production also began on a mass scale in factories. (1844‚Äì1923), commonly known in Germany as \\"father of the nutcracker\\", began the first mass production of the design (using a lathe) at his workshop in Seiffen in Saxony during 1872. Decorative nutcracker dolls began being popularized outside of Europe after the Second World War, when numerous American soldiers stationed in Germany came home to the United States with German nutcrackers as souvenirs. Further popularization came from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, a ballet adaptation of E. T. A. Hoffmann's story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, which featured a toy soldier nutcracker. The ballet, introduced to America during the mid-20th century, became a favorite holiday tradition across the United States and helped make nutcracker dolls a Christmas decoration and a seasonal icon across Western culture. Design An average handcrafted nutcracker doll is made out of about 60 separate pieces. Nutcracker dolls traditionally resemble toy soldiers, and are often painted in bright colors. Different designs proliferated early; by the early 19th century there were ones dressed as miners, policemen, royalty or soldiers from different armies. More recent variations have been made to resemble various pop-culture or historical figurines, from Benjamin Franklin to Operation Desert Storm-uniform American soldiers.

Background  The Spanish captured the city of Mers-El-K√©bir after a successful expedition against the local Algerian dynasty, the Zayyanids. In 1507, the Zayyanids ambushed the city of Mers-el-K√©bir, with about 11,000 cavalry, gaining a decisive victory against the Spanish forces. In 1508 Cardinal Cisneros proposed to Ferdinand II, an expedition to capture the North African city of Oran.The monarch agreed, facilitating the levying of the troops and the formation of the navy, and granting Cisneros the title of captain general of Africa on August 20, 1508.  The siege  Preparations for the expedition began in September 1508. The Crown invested 39.6 million maravedis in the expedition. In comparison, the armada to Castilla del Oro in 1514 would cost 14 million and the armada of Maluco led by Hernando de Magallanes cost 8.35 million. A fleet left port from Cartagena on 16 May and sailed towards Mers el-Kebir, a city located near Oran and already (since 1505) under Spanish control. The fleet had 80 naos and 10 galleys, plus additional small boats. They carried around 8000-12,000 infantry-men and 3000-4000 cavalry-men. The army spent the night of 17 May in Mers el Kebir. The Christians stormed the city of Oran, then part of the Kingdom of Tlemcen, combining the use of the fleet with a ground assault on 18 May. After breaking through the walls of the city the casualties numbered less than 30 on the assaulting side, while the 12,000 defenders suffered 4,000 casualties. On 20 May, Cisneros entered the city, already conquered. The city remained a part of the Spanish Empire until 1708, when it was seized by the Ottoman Dey of Algiers taking advantage of the War of the Spanish Succession. The city was conquered again by the Spanish in 1732. After the 1790 earthquake, they abandoned Oran and Mers el-Kebir in 1792.

Location The Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station (ESEC) covers an area of of mangrove swamp in southern S√£o Paulo Visits are only allowed for environmental education and for scientific research. The ESEC consists of the Banhado Grande and Banhado Pequeno areas, which contain several endangered and endemic species. The two areas are important parts of the region of the Serra do Bananal, Serra dos Itatins and Jur√©ia Massif. These contain an extensive area of Atlantic Forest and associated ecosystems in the south-central coast of SP. History The Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station has its origins in the Itatins State Reserve (Reserva Estadual dos Itatins) created in 1958. In 1984 the area was included in the Canan√©ia-Iguape-Peru√≠be Environmental Protection Area. In 1986 the biota of the Atlantic slope of the Serra do Mar was declared an area under special state protection. The ESEC was created by decree 50.664 of 30 March 2006 of the governor of the state to ensure full protection of flora, fauna, scenic beauty and marine and land ecosystems. It consisted of three sections contiguous to the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station. On 12 December 2006 the law defining the Jur√©ia-Itatins ESEC was altered to exclude and reclassify some areas. The Jur√©ia-Itatins Mosaic was formed, and in the new configuration the Banhados do Iguape ESEC was integrated with the Jur√©ia-Itatins ESEC. The mosaic, with about , also included the Itingu√ßu State Park, Prelado State Park, Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge, Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve and Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve. In 2009 the activities of the mosaic were suspended and the area was again managed as the Esta√ß√£o Ecol√≥gica dos Banhados de Iguape. Law 14982 of 8 April 2013 again redefined the area of the Jureia Itatins Ecological Station, recreating the other conservation units as before, recreating the Jureia Itatins Mosaic, and again incorporating the Banhado Pequeno and Banhado Grande into the Jureia Itatins Ecological Station.

History Mabel Phyllis Hardy (1890‚Äì1977) was born in Malvern, South Australia, a member of the once wealthy Hardy family.Barbara Wall A Short History of Stawell School: The forgotten school on Mount Lofty published for Mount Lofty Districts Historical Society by Peacock Publications 2012 She was educated at several State schools and taught at Tormore House School and Unley Park School to fund part-time studies at Adelaide University, completing her BA in 1914. She then taught at elite girls' grammar schools in North Adelaide and Sydney, and in 1923 was appointed senior mistress of the newly founded Woodlands Girls Grammar School in Glenelg, South Australia. In 1925 she met a new member of staff, Patience Hawker (1900‚Äì1994), who had ideas about forming a school of her own. The following year while on holidays in England and on the Continent, Mabel decided the time had come, and instructed Patience to secure a suitable premises in the Adelaide Hills. Patience, whose grandfather was George Charles Hawker (1818‚Äì1895), and whose family were in comfortable circumstances, purchased \\"Arthur's Seat\\", a large bungalow on near the summit of Mount Lofty and overlooking the Adelaide Plains. It was largely financed with a loan from her mother, and the school was named in her honour, she having been born Mary Stawell. :The land was for some time owned by Mabel's grandfather Arthur Hardy (1817‚Äì1909) and leased to George Tinline, who started on the building before he abruptly left South Australia in 1863, and was completed by the next tenant, Gavin Young, who named it \\"Arthur's Seat\\", for a hill overlooking Edinburgh. The next owner was Henry Teesdale Smith, followed by Arthur Hugh Poole. It was decided to run the School as a company Stawell School Ltd., which was incorporated on 21 December 1926 with Patience Hawker as managing director. The two women made the house their residence, with rooms for boarders, and had classrooms built away from the residence. Mabel had considerable experience with a variety of institutions, but modelled Stawell on what she knew of Frensham, one of many schools at which Patience had studied, and one which had inspired her with the care and kindness given the students. Part of their philosophy of teaching was Helen Parkhurst's Dalton system which gives the student a great deal of control over her own work, where the teacher is a resource and adviser rather than a lecturer, and students are encouraged to aid one another's learning at large round tables. She believed students should feel safe, free, comfortable and well fed, in pleasant surroundings with access to good books, bright pictures and open air. Mabel went to some pains to assert the social acceptability of her school. The girls, almost without exception would have come from privileged backgrounds, and would be expected to enter into a comfortable marriage or through university into a profession, perhaps both. Habits of self-reliance, co- operation and consideration for others were inculcated. Domestic arts such as cooking and management of servants were part of life for the boarders. Stawell's curriculum was strong on social skills: dancing, music, drawing, needlework, public speaking, drama, sports, current events, domestic science, languages, Scripture but above all, English literature. Mabel had no love for public examinations, though many of her students performed well in English and History, but with Stawell offering only General Science and basic mathematics, many university courses were out of reach for the Stawell alumnus. Patience married in 1928 and henceforth had little to do with teaching or day-to-day decisions, though she retained the title and responsibilities of managing director. The school was highly successful for its first ten years, but in the early 1930s the Great Depression brought economic hardship to farmers, whose daughters made up a good percentage of students, and development of social graces for daughters was seen as an expendable luxury. Later in the decade fear of war and petrol rationing were disincentives to families having their daughters too far away from home. Enrolments declined and with declaration of war in 1939 the school shifted to 84 Mills Terrace, North Adelaide and closed in December 1940. Postscript Following closure of school on Mount Lofty, the property was leased to the Australian Army and used by the Australian Women's Army Service then in 1943 sold by Patience Howard and Mabel Hardy to Basil Harford. The National Broadcasting Service purchased a substantial section for the ABC-TV transmitter building and mast. Nancy Harford still owned the place on 16 February 1983 when it was destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires. \\"Arthur's Seat\\" and \\"St. Michael's House\\", the Anglican Church retreat, were the only two significant buildings which were never rebuilt. The property is now part of Cleland Conservation Park, owned by the South Australian Government. Patience Hawker married (Charles) Roy Howard (1891 ‚Äì 17 August 1935), a grandson of W. R. Cave, at Bungaree on 19 September 1928. They had two daughters, Lucinda (1929‚Äì ) and Virginia (1 October 1931 ‚Äì ). With the death of her husband in 1935, Patience sold their Crafers property and returned with her two children to East Bungaree, where she lived with her father and brother until 1940. Her daughters attended Stawell School until it closed. She joined the Labor Party and stood unsuccessfully for blue-ribbon Liberal seats in the Assembly in 1946 and the Legislative Council (the first woman contender) in 1953. Mabel retired, though taking the occasional teaching job. She changed residences several times, finally to Fullarton, where she died.

Built in 1877, it is one of the only known examples of a wooden Pratt truss bridge in the United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Lincoln Covered Bridge spans the Ottauquechee River, a short way west of the village of West Woodstock. It is just south of US 4, connecting that road to Bridges Road and Fletcher Hill Road on the south side of the river. It is a single span, in length, resting on concrete and stone abutments, and is wide with a roadway width of (one lane). The bridge is supported by two arch trusses, which are sheltered by a post-and-beam structure finished with a metal standing seam roof and vertical board siding. The trusses are a variant of the Pratt truss, with laminated arches supporting the deck by a combination of wooden and iron verticals, with iron cross bracing. In 1989, the bridge was rehabilitated and strengthened by the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The purpose of the project was to restore the structure to its original condition and increase its load carrying capacity to safely carry emergency vehicles. Restoration focused primarily on rebuilding the ends of the top and bottom chords of the trusses that had deteriorated over the previous century. All of the restoration work was performed using materials and details as close to original as possible. The increase in strength was accomplished by post tensioning the two trusses below the bottom wooden chords with high strength coated steel rods. These rods, as well as other structural steel upgrades required to increase the strength are hidden from view by the wooden siding in order to maintain the historic look of the bridge. The two Pratt trusses are still the fully functioning main structural supports for the bridge. In addition, skylights were added to the metal roof to allow natural light into the structure due to its long span. These skylights are made from translucent corrugated (to match the contour of the existing roofing)polyvinyl material. Existing braided steel cables anchoring the upstream ends of the bridge to the shore were also removed at this time. The cables were previously installed to protect the bridge from washing away in a flood or ice flow. However, this method proved to cause the destruction of these covered wooden bridges at other locations in the country during one of these events. It was determined at the time that letting the structure move and float with the flowing water/ice would cause the least amount of damage. After one of these events the structure could then be reset with heavy equipment and/or cranes, repaired, and put back in service in a much shorter timespan and significantly lower cost.VAOT Contract TH3415 with The bridge was built in 1877 by R.W. Pinney and B.H. Pinney (of Bridgewater and Woodstock, respectively), about thirty years after the Pratt truss was patented. According to covered bridge history Richard S. Allen, it is the only known surviving use of the Pratt truss in wood; this form is seen much more widely in metal bridges built later.

She was a leading figure in the drive for better nursing education and a better-organised nursing profession, especially for fever nurses. As well as being matron of various fever hospitals, she was on the council of the Fever Nurses Association from its beginning in 1908, and she played important roles in various other organisations working towards registration of qualified nurses, better training and other improvements for the profession.  Family and training  Susan Alice Villiers, born on 6 September 1863 in Edmonton, Middlesex, was the daughter of Mary Ann (n√©e Sharp) and John Fitzpatrick Villiers, a barrister, and had a private education. Her middle-class family with nine children was not wealthy, especially after her father died when she was eleven years old. In 1892 she began three years of training at St Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts), London, and worked there as a staff nurse for a year after she qualified, until March 1896.Margaret R. Currie, ‚ÄòVilliers, Susan Alice (1863‚Äì1945)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 The matron at Barts was Isla Stewart who was known to believe that the best possible post-qualification training for matrons was working with the Metropolitan Asylums Board (MAB), which ran institutions catering for the sick poor of London, including isolation hospitals. This may have encouraged Villiers to embark on a career with a series of MAB fever hospitals. She was one of the first generation of nurses to have the opportunity to train under a matron who was fully trained herself.  Career  The Park Fever Hospital where Susan Villiers was matron between 1910 and 1913. After leaving Barts, Villiers spent the rest of her career specialising in fever nursing, although she took on other commitments too. = Fever hospitals in London = In 1896 she took a post as night superintendent at the South Eastern Fever Hospital in Deptford, and shortly after was made assistant matron at the Brook Hospital, Shooter's Hill. By 1901 Villiers was matron of the Fountain Fever Hospital in Tooting. After that she moved to the Park Hospital, Hither Green before becoming matron of the South Western Hospital, Stockwell in 1913. Margaret Currie, Fever Hospitals and Fever Nurses: A British Social History of Fever Nurses, Routledge, 2013 During the nineteenth century the Metropolitan Asylums Board (MAB) built a number of fever hospitals around London.MAB fever hospitals and other institutions While patients received medical care they were removed from crowded neighbourhoods and isolated to help prevent epidemics. These hospitals were for working-class people from poor quality urban housing. More prosperous patients would generally be nursed at home. Hospital buildings had separate wards, which were often separate blocks, for different illnesses, and they were designed to provide plenty of fresh air with lofty ceilings and \\"airing courts\\" where patients could spend time outside, in sunshine as far as possible.L. W. Aldwinckle, Fever Hospitals, 1895, pp 282, 300 = The Fever Nurses Association = The Fever Nurses Association (FNA) was established early in 1908 and later that year Villiers was elected to be on its first Council. The MAB decided to give the organisation its approval in 1909. One of the FNA's main aims was to create a universal standard of training for fever nurses in suitable, approved UK hospitals.THE PASSING OF THE FEVER NURSES‚Äô ASSOCIATION British Journal of Nursing, January 1934 The FNA wanted these to be large hospitals with a medical officer in residence. For trainees with no previous experience they planned a two-year training course and, for general nurses who had already trained at an approved hospital, a one-year training in fever nursing. Villiers was directly involved in these proposals, which led to an FNA-approved syllabus being drawn up in July 1909. Villiers also wanted the Association to ensure there was formal recognition for nurses who had both general and fever training when state registration of nurses was eventually established (1919). Once this happened and the General Nursing Council (GNC) was set up, Villiers was the fever nurse representative on it from 1920 to 1937. During this time her work on GNC committees helped lead it to adopt the educational curricula and other schemes drawn up by the FNA. = Other organisations and retirement= When state registration of nurses was introduced Villiers was the seventh name in the new register. She was on the Matrons' Council of Great Britain and Ireland and represented it on the public health committee of the National Council of Women of Great Britain in 1926-1927. She was also a Fellow of the British College of Nurses, was on their Council, and was their delegate supporting equal suffrage at the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (previously called the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies). She worked for the right of nurses to manage their own professional bodies, and said, \\"People [are] very fond of managing women's affairs, especially those of nurses.\\" Miss S.A. Villiers at a meeting in support of independent candidates for the GNC, British Journal of Nursing, 11 Nov 1922 She retired in 1927 at the age of sixty-three after two troublesome episodes with her health in 1922 and 1924. This meant moving out of hospital quarters and she went to live near some of her siblings in Hertfordshire where she served as a magistrate in Stevenage, as did two of her sisters and a brother. Villiers belonged to the Guild of St Barnabas, an Anglican society offering spiritual support to nurses, and became its Superior in 1935. During the second world war she was the Hon. Treasurer of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain. Late in life she moved to Hindhead, Surrey where she died on 29 March 1945. Two weeks later the Guild of St Barnabas arranged a requiem mass for her at the church of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn.

Along with Canaan, Egypt is one of the most commonly mentioned locations in the Bible, and its people, the Egyptians (or Mitsri), play important roles in the story of the Israelites. Although interaction between Egypt and nearby Semitic-speaking peoples is attested in archaeological sources, they do not otherwise corroborate the biblical account. The Book of Genesis and Book of Exodus describe a period of Hebrew slavery in Egypt, from their settlement in the Land of Goshen until their escape and the journey through the wilderness to Sinai.James Weinstein, \\"Exodus and the Archaeological Reality\\", in Exodus: The Egyptian Evidence, ed. Ernest S. Frerichs and Leonard H. Lesko (Eisenbrauns, 1997), p.87 Based on the internal chronology of the Hebrew Bible, this would correspond roughly to the New Kingdom of Egypt during the Late Bronze Age. In the Bible, a number of Jews took refuge in Egypt after the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah in 597 BC, and the subsequent assassination of the Jewish governor, Gedaliah (2 Kings , Book of Jeremiah ). On hearing of the appointment, the Jewish population fled to Moab, Ammon, Edom and in other countries returned to Judah (). In Egypt, they settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros (Jeremiah 44:1).  Overview  = The Egyptian race = The Egyptian race, or Mitsri (), are among the major ethnic groups mentioned in the Bible. They are considered a distinct race from their neighbors, the Amazigh (), the Sudanese (), and the Ethiopians (). While ancient Egyptians, in both Biblical and historical narratives, considered themselves to be a distinct people, there was nothing taboo about a relationship between an Egyptian and a member of another race or faith, and they were open to the idea of accepting a foreigner as an Egyptian, even allowing them to hold leadership roles within their nation. Notable Biblical and historical examples of such are Joseph, an Israelite vizier second only to the Pharaoh himself, and Shoshenq I, a Libyan Pharaoh who is believed to be the historical counterpart of the Biblical Shishak. As to their physical appearance, historians believe Egyptians, both ancient and modern, to be genetically similar to other Levantine peoples, such as Palestinians and Syrians. DNA analysis of mummies show that present day Egyptians possess a slightly higher incidence of sub-Saharan African DNA than they did in Biblical times. Also, while hieroglyphics and artwork frequently portray them as bald or their heads covered by wigs or ornate headpieces, DNA analysis of mummies show that, in addition to brown and black hair, some Egyptians possessed blonde and red hair, and that henna was used as a hair dye, though blonde hair may have only surfaced after Greeks and Romans established themselves as a sizable minority in Egypt. It is presumed that black and brown were the dominant eye colors, though some artwork depicts individuals with blue eyes, and, possessing an olive skin tone. A mural found in the tomb of Seti I, the Book of Gates, shows that Egyptians saw the Libyans (themesu) as having beige skin, the Nubians as having black skin (nehesu), and the Mesopotamians (aamu), who would've been related to the Israelites as Abraham is said to have been from Mesopotamia, also called Shinar in the Bible, as being of similar color to them, though with significantly more facial hair. Historical evidence also supports the Egyptians practiced skin whitening, though the reasons for it are uncertain. There is additional support for being of similar appearance to the Israelites could be implied in the story of Joseph, when it is said his brothers do not recognize him when they visit Egypt, which could be taken to mean he easily passed for Egyptian.  In Jewish law  In the Book of Leviticus, it is said by the Lord to the Israelites that they are not to follow the ways of Egypt, especially in concern to forbidden relationships. Wording is vague in some areas, and aimed at male Israelites as opposed to female ones, and so, there is some room for interpretation as it would appear men are held to different standards than women are. Most take the scriptures as opposing incest and homosexuality. While historians have plenty of evidence that incest was widely practiced among Egyptians, at least among the ruling class, there is limited evidence to support the acceptance, or widespread acceptance, of homosexual relationships, whether sexual or romantic in nature.  Portrayal  = In the Book of Genesis = In the Book of Genesis, Abraham and Sarah, along with their nephew Lot, are living in Canaan when a famine strikes the area and so, the group travels to Egypt, where Pharaoh, betaken by Sarah's beauty, makes her his concubine, unaware that she is married because Abraham introduces himself as her brother, not her husband. Pharaoh gives number of gifts to Abraham in exchange for Sarah, in the form of livestock and slaves, one of whom is Hagar, who would later become Abraham's concubine and the mother of his firstborn son, Ishmael. For how long Sarah lives in Pharaoh's palace isn't clear, though it is known that the strikes Pharaoh and members of his household, save for Sarah, with plague, and Pharaoh deduces that Sarah is somehow the cause. Once learning that Sarah is Abraham's wife, not only his sister, he releases her to him and does not ask that Abraham return to him any of the livestock or slaves, and they leave Egypt without interruption, with significant wealth. Later in the Book of Genesis is the story of Abraham and Sarah's great-grandson, Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob and his first son with his second wife, Rachel. It is said that Jacob prefers Joseph over all of his other sons, causing tension between Joseph and his brothers, and so, they sell him into slavery, to a group of traveling Midianites headed for Egypt, where he's purchased by Potiphar, the captain of the guard. Joseph does well as a member of Potiphar's household, highly respected by his master, until Potipher's wife, scorned by Joseph, falsely accuses him of attempting to rape her and Joseph is imprisoned as a result. During his imprisonment, Joseph successfully interprets the dreams of two fellow prisoners, both servants of Pharaoh, one of whom is sentenced to death and the other who returns to Pharaoh's graces. Joseph begs of Pharaoh's cup- bearer, the prisoner who returns to Pharaoh's graces, to tell Pharaoh of him but he doesn't for some time, not until Pharaoh is troubled by dreams as the cup-bearer once was. Joseph reveals to Pharaoh that his dreams are signs of a great famine to come, and for his service, Pharaoh makes Joseph the vizier of Egypt and gives to him an Egyptian wife, Asenath. When famine strikes much of the region, not only Egypt, the Egyptians are so well prepared for it that they have a surplus of grain, which foreigners come to buy, among them, Joseph's brothers, who do not recognize him. Later, Joseph calls for all of Jacob's household, numbering seventy individuals, to come and live in Egypt with him, in the land of Goshen. = In the Book of Exodus = In the Book of Exodus, the Israelites, descendants of Joseph and his brothers, are still living in the land of Goshen, and are now slaves, beaten, raped, and overworked by the Egyptian overlords under the reign of a new, tyrannical pharaoh. A great-great grandson of Joseph's brother Levi, Moses, is born in a time when Pharaoh has decreed all newborn Hebrew males be slain and he is saved from Pharaoh's orders by Pharaoh's daughter, who rescues him from the Nile River and raises him as her own son. For a time, Moses leaves Egypt, to escape punishment in the death of an Egyptian man who'd beaten an Israelite man, and goes into Midian, and makes a new life there, but returns to Egypt to free his brethren, chosen by the to do so. There, with his brother, Aaron, and sister, Miriam, Moses demands the release of his people but Pharaoh refuses and for his stubbornness, he and his people suffer the Plagues of Egypt, famine, insect swarms, and notably, the deaths of the all the firstborn Egyptians, save for the firstborn of Pharaoh's daughter, by then called Bat- Yah, or the daughter of Yahweh, who had joined the Israelites by then. Pharaoh is ultimately defeated by the and the Israelites, along with liberated slaves of other nations kept by Pharaoh, cross the Red Sea, to go into the Promised Land. = In the Books of Kings = In the Books of Kings, Solomon, the king of Israel and the son of David, is said to have married Pharaoh's daughter, whose name is not provided, and received the city of Gezer as part of her dowry. Nothing else is written as to the personal nature of Pharaoh's daughter or about her relationship with Solomon. However, their relationship, and Solomon's willingness to take wives from other nations, in violation of laws against intermarriage in the Book of Deuteronomy, is thought to contributed to his downfall. Solomon is said to have obliged his foreign wives and built temples for their gods in the land of Israel, and after his death at age sixty, relatively young for a Biblical character, the tribes of Israel would not accept his heir, Rehoboam, son of the Ammonite woman Naamah, as ruler and so, the united monarchy of Israel failed. Also in the Books of Kings is the story of Jeroboam, a former servant of Solomon who later conspired against him and, when his plotting was revealed, fled to Egypt, where Pharaoh Shishak protected him until Solomon's death. Though he is not identified in the Hebrew Bible, in the Septuagint, Jeroboam is said to have married a close female relative of Shishak, named Ano, who was the older sister of Tahpenes. = In the Books of Chronicles = In the Books of Chronicles, Rehoboam, son of Solomon and the first king of Judah, is attacked in the fifth year of his reign by an Egyptian pharaoh, whose personal name is given as Shishak, whom some historians have identified with Shoshenq I. It written that Rehoboam may have expected an attack, as he fortified fifteen major cities, among them Bethlehem and Hebron, but his efforts were not enough, as Shishak came with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 soldiers, not only Egyptians but also Lubims, Sukkites, and Kushites. As a result of his defeat, Judah became a vassal state, subordinate to Egypt. Shishak's invasion of Judah is portrayed as the wrath of the , for the Israelites had forsaken the and so, the left them to the hands of Shishak. The Israelites humble themselves and the prevents further destruction of their people but still orders that the Israelites become servants of Shishak. = In the Gospel of Matthew = In the Gospel of Matthew, part of the New Testament, it is said in Matthew 2:13-23 that Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus of Nazareth, is visited by an angel in a dream, who tells him to take Mary and Jesus and go to Egypt, to avoid Jesus being slain by King Herod I, called the Flight into Egypt. After Herod's death, they return to Nazareth.

It is placed in the context of early Lengyel culture.  Discovery  View from Leopoldsberg over the Danube river at the Bisamberg mountain The figurine was uncovered during excavation commissioned by Federal Monuments Office, with an assistance of the Museum Langenzersdorf. The Venus figurine was found in four fragments near a hearth, within the context of a settlement remains from the time of the Lengyel culture, on the southern slope of the mountain Bisamberg in the Korneuburg District, Lower Austria. The first fragment, the right thigh, was discovered on December 21, 1955.  Description The statuette is dated to about 5000 BC. It has an elongated upper body, whereas the lower body is relatively shortened and with prominent hips (speculated to be a symbol and fertility and fecundity). The arms are stretched in the lateral direction and only hinted at. The breasts are not as stressed or big as Upper-Palaeolithic figurines of that kind. The head is positioned on a long neck and completely abstracted, without recognizable face.

She participated in four public projects including three United States post office murals and five murals completed for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. She has works in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Western Colorado Center for the Arts. As of 2015, her murals completed for the post offices of Powell, Wyoming; Deer Lodge, Montana; and Kings Mountain, North Carolina are still hanging in the buildings which were the original post offices. In addition to her public artworks, Burkhard received the 1943 Alger Award from the National Association of Women Artists and was one of the first honorees of the \\"Colorado Women of Achievement\\" program in 1966. Early life Verona Lorraine Burkhard was born on June 8, 1910 in Paris, France to Verona P. (n√©e Turini) and Henri Burkhard. Her parents were both American artists, studying in Paris. Her mother, who used the professional name Vee Burkhard, was a fashion artist, while her father was a noted painter. Her grandfather, Giovanni Turini was a sculptor, who sculpted Washington Square Park's statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi called the \\"Sword of Italian Unification\\" and also Central Park's bronze bust of Giuseppe Mazzini. While she was still an infant, Burkhard's parents returned to the United States and settled in New York City. Under the tutelage of Boardman Robinson, she studied art at the Art Students League of New York, and then later at the Cooper Union. Career During the 1930s, Burkhard resided and maintained studios in Leonia, New Jersey and nearby Tenafly.Kovinick, Phil; and Yoshiki-Kovinick, Marian. An encyclopedia of women artists of the American West, p. 35. University of Texas Press, 1998. Accessed May 11, 2017. \\"Later, during the depression of the 1930s and after, while living in Leonia, NJ (c. 1930 - c. 1936), Tenafly, NJ (c. 1936 - c. 1938), and New York (c. 1938 - 1949), she made great strides as an artist.\\" Burkhard began working for the New Deal's Treasury Relief Art Project during the Great Depression. She was awarded the Powell, Wyoming post office mural in 1938 based upon drawing submitted for the post office in Dallas, Texas. When she received the commission to complete the Powell mural, Burkhard was living near Buffalo, Wyoming on the Klondike Ranch. Her mural, Powell‚Äôs Agriculture Resulting from the Shoshone Irrigation Project featured the positive outcomes for agriculture from federal development projects like the Shoshone Project. That same year, she was selected to complete the post office mural for Deer Lodge, Montana. Burkhard's submission, James and Granville Stuart Prospecting in Deer Lodge Valley‚Äî1858, featured Deer Lodge Valley from an 1860 sketch of the region. Townspeople were concerned that the large mountain behind the Stuarts should have depicted Mount Powell, a well-known local landmark. Though Burkhard felt that the composition was not as good with the landmark, she made the requested changes to prevent displeasing the citizens and jeopardizing her chances for other government commissions. When she had finished the murals in Deer Lodge and Powell, Burkhard returned to New York, where she studied with Frank Mechau at Columbia University. She had a studio in Tenafly and submitted an entry for the Greybull, Wyoming post office, but didn't place in the running. In 1940, Burkhard submitted designs for the federal project to decorate the Los Angeles Terminal Annex, but the work was awarded to Boris Deutsch. Burkhard finished second in the competition, which meant that her designs were sent to the jury for the Immigration and Naturalization Service Building in Los Angeles, California project. She was selected to complete the series of murals, which depicted Mayan and Aztec civilization for immigration in 1941. The studies for six of the Immigration Building murals are housed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. In a 1986 interview for the Mesa County Public Library, Burkhard told how she completed five large canvasses and went out to California to deliver them. When she arrived, the immigration building was cordoned off and guards prohibited anyone entering due to World War II. She contacted her boss, and he had her bring them to Washington, D.C. to hang in the WAVES Administration Buildings, though she did not know what happened to them at the end of the war when the temporary site was closed. Burkhard also won the commission in 1941 to complete the post office mural for Kings Mountain, North Carolina. The mural, The Battle of Kings Mountain, depicts scenes of the historic local battle during the American Revolution. In the 1980s, the mural was moved to City Hall after a new post office was built, but the painting was restored to the original building, which is now the Kings Mountain Historical Museum, in 2015. At the end of the year, she was also in the group of finalists for the Provo, Utah post office murals, though it would eventually go to another artist. In 1943, Burkhard won the Alger Award for her painting Horse Fair at Mt. Timpanogos from the National Association of Women Artists. Between 1945 and 1946, she was in charge of the art program at Potomac School in Washington, D. C.. In 1949, Burkhard moved to Grand Junction, Colorado and soon began working with other local artists to develop an art center for the area. In 1953, they began a funding drive for the Mesa County Fine Arts Center, hosting balls, art shows and a drive through local schools to raise money for the project. In 1960, they purchased and renovated an old home to house the center. In 1966, Burkhard's work to build the center and promote the arts was recognized, when she along with Jo Elliott and Sister Frances Marie Walsh were named as \\"Colorado Women of Achievement\\" in the first awards recognition for the program. The award, judged by five members from throughout the state, selected the three women from 102 nominees and presented their awards at a banquet held in Denver. Burkhard built a studio from a barn behind her house for completing ceramics, metal sculpture and paintings and taught art in a school she opened in downtown Grand Junction. She worked with the public school system as well on various art projects and continued exhibiting into the 1970s throughout the western states. Burkhard died July 16, 2004 in Grand Junction.

Before he became Serbian Patriarch, he was Metropolitan of Ni≈°, under Serbian patriarch Atanasije II. When Atanasije died in 1752, Serbian patriarchal throne was taken by Metropolitan of Dabar-Bosnia Gavrilo Mihailoviƒá who also died soon after returning from Constantinople in the autumn of the same year, struck by sudden illness. Before death, he made succession arrangements with metropolitan Gavrilo Nikoliƒá, who was elected new Serbian Patriarch as Gavrilo III. In following years, Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá was in constant internal turmoil, accompanied by worsening financial crisis and huge debts. Between 1755 and 1758, Gavrilo III was challenged by rivals and finally lost the patriarchal throne, but in 1761, a group of Serbian bishops and other ecclesiastical leaders who met in Ni≈° tried to bring him back, without final success.

Anatomy This chromist is easy to recognize and identify among all the phytoplankton, because of its three horns in a pitchfork arrangement. The horn in the middle is called the apical horn, and it is used as a flagellum. The other two horns are called lateral horns, and they are solely used as an aid for flotation. Habitat This species lives along all the phytoplankton on the ocean surface worldwide, where it is one of the dominant species. Despite this, it is usually solitary, although during reproduction season, several individuals may congregate, all of their apical horns join. This occurs when a cell divides, so that the daughter cells remain together, linked in short chains. This particular species may sometimes be parasitized by other chromists or protists.

An 18-year-old Iranian-German, David Ali Sonboly, opened fire on fellow teenagers at a McDonald's restaurant before shooting at bystanders in the street outside and then in the mall itself. Nine people were killed and thirty-six others were injured, four of them by gunfire. Sonboly then hid nearby for more than two hours, and killed himself by a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was stopped by police. Two reports by the Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation and public prosecutor's office concluded that the shooting was not political, saying Sonboly's main motive was \\"revenge\\". Police later opened an investigation into his contact with the perpetrator of the Aztec High School shooting. In 2019, the Bavarian Police declared that the shooting was now being classified as a \\"politically motivated crime\\" and that \\"the radical right-wing and racist views of the perpetrator should not be ignored.\\"\\"Germany: 2016 Munich attack had 'radical right-wing' motives, say police\\". Deutsche Welle, 25 October 2019.  Shooting On the evening of 22 July 2016, David Ali Sonboly opened fire at a McDonald's restaurant near the Olympia shopping mall in the Moosach district of Munich, Germany. Despite initial reports of multiple attack sites, police could not confirm attacks in any locations other than the shopping area. Sonboly had made a fake Facebook account and sent four invitations to people, asking them to come to the restaurant, but none answered.Investigations to the Munich killing spree completed. Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation. 17 March 2017. He stayed in the restaurant from about 5pm. At about 5:50pm, he went to the toilets on the first floor and took a handgun from his backpack. He then opened fire on a group of six teenagers sitting at a table, killing five and wounding another. Eighteen bullets were fired. He immediately left the restaurant, turned to the right and began shooting at people fleeing towards an electronics shop and at two vehicles parked there. He fired sixteen bullets in this area, killing three people and wounding three others. Sonboly then crossed Hanauer Strasse and slowly walked into the shopping mall, where he fatally shot another teenager near the lifts. At about 6pm, Sonboly walked from the shopping mall, over a covered footbridge to the adjoining multistorey car park. While on this bridge, he fired shots towards the parking deck and a passer-by, but hurt no one. He fired thirteen rounds at two unoccupied parked vehicles and walked onto the top parking deck. There, Sonboly had an argument with a man who shouted at him from the balcony of his flat. During this argument, Sonboly fired two shots at the man. Another man, who was also on his balcony, was wounded by a rebounding bullet. Sonboly fired three more times towards the mall and towards an employee, without hurting anyone. Police officers spotted the gunman from an outdoor balcony of the mall, and one officer fired a shot from a submachine gun at him, but missed. Sonboly ran across Riesstra√üe and hid in a residential area. He tried to get into a house, and lingered in a stairwell, where he had contact with residents. He then hid in a bicycle storage room. At 8:26pm he went outside and was confronted by police officers, whereupon he shot himself in the head. =Early reports and videos= Map of shooting: (1) McDonald's, where the shooting started (2) Olympia shopping mall An early witness, identified only by her first name Lauretta, in talking to CNN correspondent Doug McConnell on the phone claimed that the gunman had shouted \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" The woman's account has not been verified by other witnesses or the police, though it was widely disseminated in the media. A video distributed online showed a gunman firing at pedestrians outside McDonald's. He then moved on to the shopping mall itself. Another video showed the gunman walking alone on the roof of a nearby car park before opening fire again. He was heard shouting \\"I am German\\" (') and \\"I was born here\\" (') after an onlooker shouted anti-Turkish statements and other abuse at him. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the gunman also shouted back \\"Shit Turks\\". However, it is still not clear who started the anti-Turkish insults. =Authorities' response= An urgent warning was issued to avoid the Karlsplatz (\\"Stachus\\"), due to reports of multiple shootings occurring there. Munich police had received information about an attack at Karlsplatz, but after arriving there, announced that the information was false. Drivers were advised not to pick up any passengers. People in Munich were warned by the police to stay at home and avoid crowds and public squares. Following initial reports of shots being fired, some 2,300 officers were deployed throughout Munich from the greater area and surrounding states. A manhunt was soon initiated. Munich police urged residents not to leave their homes until further notice. The special operations police unit GSG 9 was deployed. Other regions of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were asked to assist in the investigation. A backpack was found apparently matching the one carried by the gunman at McDonald's. Police reportedly used a robot to examine it, and a total of 300 rounds of ammunition were found inside. Police officials warned of \\"an acute terror situation\\" and initially thought that there were up to three attackers, but later confirmed that there was only one gunman. The Munich U-Bahn, tram service, bus service, and services on the central portion of the S-Bahn in Munich were stopped. Munich main station was evacuated and all trains were cancelled in and out of Munich. Regional and inter-city trains ceased their service to and from the region of the shooting. Deutsche Bahn provided accommodation trains for stranded commuters and tourists where they could seek refuge. These were located at Mammendorf, Starnberg, Geltendorf, Dachau, and Freising. Casualties Nine victims and the perpetrator died in the incident; 16 others were injured, four by gunshot. Three of the dead were female, and six were male. Seven of the dead were Muslims.Nina Job (Juli 26, 2016). \\"Hier trauern die Angeh√∂rigen um die OEZ-Opfer\\" [Here the relatives mourn the OEZ victims]. Abendzeitung. Two of the victims were of Turkish origin, one was Greek, two victims were from German Sinti families and one was from a Kosovan Roma family. * Sevda Daƒü, 45, Turkish * H√ºseyin Dayƒ±cƒ±k, 19, Greek * Sel√ßuk Kili√ß, 15, Turkish * Giuliano Kollmann, 18, German of Romanian origin * Can Leyla, 14, Turkish * Roberto Rafael, 15, Hungarian * Armela Segashi, 14, Kosovan * Sabina Sulaj, 14, Kosovan * Dijamant Zabergja, 21, German There have been claims that Sonboly deliberately targeted people of Turkish or Arab origin, groups he apparently felt had picked on him at school. The state government said that the victims were not chosen in any particular way and that Sonboly did not know any of them. Police consider it a coincidence that all of the fatalities were of immigrant backgrounds; they suggest that this may be because the McDonald's near the shopping mall was frequently patronised by the children of migrants. In preparation for admitting the injured, multiple hospitals called their medical staff in to work outside normal working hours. A state of emergency was declared at the Rechts der Isar Hospital, where one of the injured victims died.  Investigation  Munich police chief Hubertus Andr√§ said that the shooting appeared to be a \\"classic shooting rampage\\" and not terrorism. Police said that the gunman was obsessed with mass shootings and that written material on such attacks was found in his room. Prosecutor Steinkraus Koch said that the gunman had a book about school shootings called Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters by Peter Langman. No references to religion were found in documents in his home. Andr√§ said that there was an \\"obvious\\" link between the shooting and the fifth anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks committed by Anders Behring Breivik. However, a police search of the shooter's residence did not find the manifesto written and distributed by Breivik. According to Abendzeitung, the shooter's own manifesto was found on his computer's hard disk. Police investigator Robert Heimberger said that the shooter appeared to have hacked a girl's Facebook account in an attempt to lure people to McDonald's with an offer of free food. Authorities said that the gunman had been planning the shooting for a year and probably purchased his gun illegally on the darknet. It was said to be a \\"reactivated\\" Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol that previously had been used as a theatre prop. German police believe that the gun may have originated in Slovakia, and said that its serial number had been removed. On 25 July 2016, Munich police announced the arrest of a 16-year-old Afghan friend of the perpetrator who was being investigated on suspicion of failing to report the gunman's plans. Nearly two years after the shooting, police opened an investigation into Sonboly's contact with William Atchison, perpetrator of the 2017 Aztec High School shooting,\\"Verbindungen des OEZ-Attent√§ters David S. in die USA\\" [Connections of the OEZ assassin David S. in the USA].

Perpetrator David Sonboly (born Ali Sonboly; 20 April 1998 ‚Äì 22 July 2016) was an 18-year-old Iranian-German with dual nationality. The Munich Police Department said Sonboly was born and raised in Munich and had no criminal record. He lived in an apartment in the neighbourhood of Maxvorstadt with his parents and younger brother. He grew up in a secular household, according to his neighbours. He had a part-time job distributing a local free newspaper. Neighbours described him as a \\"polite boy\\". German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re said that he was the son of Shiite Muslims from Iran who came to Germany as asylum seekers in the 1990s. Sonboly's parents told police that their son had possibly converted to Christianity, but that he was not religious. In May 2016, Sonboly had his first name changed in all official documents from Ali to David. =Possible motives= The report by the Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation and public prosecutor's office in March 2017 concluded that the shooting was not political,\\"Revenge or racism? Report raises questions about Munich shooter's motives\\". The Local. 9 June 2017. saying that Sonboly's main motive was \\"revenge\\" for bullying, and that his mental illness and obsession with other shooting rampages were also a factor. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's security agency, also believed he was a \\"psychologically ill avenger\\" rather than a terrorist.\\"Munich shooting: Gunman had ideological motivations, say experts\\". Deutsche Welle, 4 October 2017. Sonboly had undergone psychiatric treatment for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2015, he had been treated for two months as an inpatient in a mental care facility. He was largely isolated from his peers and suffered years of bullying by classmates, which included physical abuse. A former classmate recalled, \\"We always him in school, and he always told us that he would kill us\\". He developed a hatred for those of a similar age and background as those who bullied him, mainly Turks and Albanians. He developed an \\"irrational worldview\\" in which he believed that the people he hated were infected with a virus and must be exterminated. On the day of the shooting, Sonboly saved a document on his computer in which he wrote \\"The bullying will be paid back today\\". During the shooting itself, he shouted that he had been bullied for seven years. Sonboly had an obsession with mass shootings and rampage killers; he compiled a scrapbook of news clippings on mass shootings and owned several books on the matter. During his psychiatric treatment he repeatedly told fellow patients to refer to him as the 'Spree Killer'.\\"Munich shooter liked Nazis, Breivik, identified as Aryan, says report\\". Deutsche Welle, 22 July 2017. One incident that fascinated him was the Winnenden school shooting, and he visited Winnenden and took pictures there. Sonboly was also fascinated by the 2011 Norway attacks perpetrated by Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, and Sonboly's shooting was on its fifth anniversary. Sonboly also voiced xenophobic views and support for the far-right. Der Spiegel reported that fellow online video gamers said that Sonboly wrote anti-Turkish messages, admired Germany's right-wing AfD party, and was \\"very nationalistic\\". According to media reports, some of those who knew him said he considered himself part of the Aryan race, and boasted about sharing the same birthday as Adolf Hitler. In light of this, several politicians urged the police to focus on his possible political motives. In October 2017, a panel of three political scientists commissioned by Munich City Council concluded that Sonboly's shooting was also driven by xenophobia and far-right ideology.Lena Kampf, Kassian Stroh (Oktober 3, 2017). \\"Ich bin kein Kanake, ich bin Deutscher!\\" [I am not a Kanake, I am German]. S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. Investigators, however, argued that his xenophobia stemmed from being bullied by other immigrants. The Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigation commissioned another report into Sonboly's motives. In 2018 it concluded that the incident was a non- political shooting rampage driven by bullying, romantic rejection, and obsession with other mass shootings.\\"Amoklauf von M√ºnchen: Gutachten zu m√∂glichen Motiven jetzt √∂ffentlich\\".

As of October 2019, it was announced by the Bavarian Police that the shooting was now classified as a \\"politically motivated crime\\" that \\"was at least partly motivated by the right-wing extremist views of the perpetrator.\\".  Reactions  = Domestic = Flowers laid at the mall after the shooting Olympia- Einkaufszentrum or OEZ) as seen in 2007. Bavarian State Police urged the public not to publish online any photos or videos of the shooting. They provided a special upload platform which allowed witnesses to upload photos, audio, or video recordings directly in order to assist the investigation. Munich residents also used the Twitter hashtag #offeneT√ºr (open door) to tell people in need of shelter where they could go. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the victims' families in a press conference on 23 July by saying, \\"We suffer with you.\\" She thanked the Munich residents who opened their doors for stranded people. The Minister-President of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer, urged extreme caution against drawing premature conclusions and noted that optimisation of the security forces had to be considered. He said that he had spent more than four hours in the operations centre on 22 July, and thanked the forces for acting with professionalism and calm. The Interior Minister of Bavaria, Joachim Herrmann, announced an investigation into why there had been numerous false alarms. The German Depression-Help Trust (Stiftung Deutsche Depressionshilfe) warned of stigmatizing mentally ill people in reaction to the shooting. After the shooter was revealed to have been born in Germany, the right-wing politician Andr√© Poggenburg was condemned and mocked in German media for having previously blamed Merkel's open refugee policy for the shooting. = International = The U.S. Department of State warned Americans in Munich to \\"shelter in place\\". President Barack Obama said in a statement that he pledged support for those affected by the shooting. Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said his country would reinforce its borders to prevent the perpetrator(s) from fleeing into that country, according to German television station n-tv. The Czech Foreign Ministry set up an emergency hotline and urged Czechs to avoid public places. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack. The Ministry's spokesperson, Bahram Ghassemi, expressed condolences to the German government and nation, saying, \\"The killing of innocent and defenseless civilians has marked another blot on the human history\\". Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said that having a Greek citizen among the dead \\"binds us even more to the fight to eradicate hatred and terrorism in Europe\\".

Members of this gens are first mentioned soon after the establishment of the Republic, and occur in history down to the second century BC. Several of them held the position of tribune of the plebs, from which they strenuously advocated on behalf of their order. The most illustrious of the family was Gaius Maenius, consul in 338 BC, and dictator in both 320 and 314.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 896 (\\"Maenia Gens\\"). In some manuscripts, the nomen Maenius appears to have been erroneously substituted for Menenius or Manlius; there are also instances of confusion with Manilius, Maelius, and Maevius. Praenomina The Maenii of the Republic definitely used the praenomina Gaius, Publius, Titus, and Quintus, all of which were very common names throughout Roman history. Individuals named Marcus and Lucius probably belonged to other gentes, whose nomina have been confused with Maenius. Branches and cognomina No surnames of the Maenii occur in ancient historians, but from the coins of the gens, we know that some of them bore the cognomen Antiaticus, in honour of the victory of the consul Gaius Maenius over the Latins in 338 BC, leading to the capture of Antium. Members * Maenius, said to have proposed the addition of instauratitius to the Circensian games, which occurred in 489 BC; this suggests that Maenius was tribune of the plebs in that year, although no ancient historian so describes him. In some manuscripts, his name is Maevius.Macrobius, i. 11.Livy, ii. 36.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 896 (\\"Maenius\\", no. 1). * Gaius Maenius, tribune of the plebs in 483 BC, attempted to veto a levy of soldiers by the consuls until they agreed to allot some of the public land to the plebeians. The consuls avoided his veto by holding the levy outside the boundary of the city, where the tribunes were powerless, and punishing those who failed to appear.Dionysius, viii. 87.Broughton, vol. I, p. 23. * Marcus Maenius, according to some manuscripts of Livy, tribune of the plebs in 410 BC, proposed an agrarian law, and like Gaius Maenius attempted to carry it into effect by preventing a levy of troops by the consuls. Maenius' colleagues opposed his action, and the levy went forward. Maenius became so popular that the Roman Senate, fearing that he would be elected consular tribune, determined that consuls should be elected for the following year instead. He and two Maenii who appear as tribunes of the plebs in 384 and 357 appear to be erroneous emendations for the original Menenius.Livy, iv. 53.Broughton, vol. I, p. 77. * Publius Maenius, said by Livy to have been consular tribune in 400 BC, and again in 396, is probably a mistake for Manlius; Publius Manlius Vulso was consular tribune in 400; Quintus Manlius Vulso was consular tribune in 396.Livy, v. 12, 18.Fasti CapitoliniDiodorus Siculus, xiv. 47, 90. * Marcus Maenius, said to have been tribune of the plebs in 384 BC, appears to be a mistake for Marcus Menenius.Livy, vi. 19.Broughton, vol. I, p. 102. * Lucius Maenius, supposedly tribune of the plebs in 357 BC, appears to be a mistake for Lucius Menenius.Livy, vii. 16.Broughton, vol. I, p. 123. * Publius Menenius P. f., father of the consul Maenius. * Gaius Maenius P. f. P. n. Antiaticus, consul in 338 BC, he and his colleague, Lucius Furius Camillus, triumphed over the Latins; Maenius won the surname of Antiaticus for his defeat of the Latin army on the Astura, near Antium. Maenius was appointed dictator in 320, to investigate a conspiracy. Censor in 318, Maenius received a second dictatorship in 314, again to investigate a conspiracy involving the nobles of Capua. He was honoured with a statue on a column, later known as the Columna Maenia, which stood on the Capitoline Hill near one end of the forum.Livy, viii. 13, ix. 26.Florus, i. 11.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, xxxiv. 5. s. 11, vii. 60.Cicero, Pro Sestio, 58.Becker, R√∂mischen Alterh√ºmer, vol. i, p. 322.Osann, De Columna Maenia. * Maenius, proposed a law requiring the patricians to give their assent to the imperium of elected magistrates, about 286 BC. Some scholars suppose that he might have been tribune of the plebs, but Niebuhr proposes that it might have been the consul Maenius, whose high reputation might have secured the passage of such a law in his old age.Cicero, Brutus, 74.Niebuhr, vol. iii, p. 421. * Marcus Maenius, a military tribune, who fell in battle against Mago in 203 BC, during the Second Punic War; possibly should be Maevius.Livy, xxx. 18.Broughton, vol.

It is headquartered onboard Naval Air Station Jacksonville, in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida. CNRSE's motto is \\"Where the Atlantic Fleet and the Navy's Air Training Command come to train\\", It gets this motto from the fact that its installations are home to both the Naval Air Training Command located at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and Naval Education and Training Command, which has its headquarters at Naval Air Station Pensacola. The region's installations also host the United States Navy Flight Exhibition Team, more commonly known as the Blue Angels, which for a brief stint in the late 1940s were under what was then the Naval Air Advanced Training Command.  History  Most of the current day boundaries of NAVREGSE encompass the former 1903 naval districts of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Naval Districts. The Sixth District was headquartered at the Charleston Navy YardHback in the 1900s, while the Seventh District was headquartered at the Naval Air Station Key West (then just a Naval Station) and the Eighth District was located at the Pensacola Navy Yard (now NAS Pensacola). All of these districts were formed in 1903 by then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. However, the linear history of the flag command that is now Commander, Navy Region Southeast are traced through its roots as an aviation- based command, starting as Naval Air Operational Training Command in 1942. The command was then was responsible for all aviation-related training in the southeast during World War II. The name then changed to Naval Air Advanced Training Command in the mid-1940s with fighter pilot training as the primary focus, followed by a merger in 1948 with Commander, Fleet Air Jacksonville. The command then went through a number of name changes between 1974 and 1992, where the flag and mission was changed three times in that span. In 1994, the command became Commander, Naval Base Jacksonville and then finally, on Feb. 2, 1999, became Commander, Navy Region Southeast as part of the navy's eventual formation of its parent command, Navy Installations Command.

Accessed 18 January 2017. History Julie Hamos was instrumental in organizing the meetings that led to the creation of ICADV. As a young attorney in Chicago, she found that Illinois was eligible for more funds under Title XX. She contacted women in the region who were interested in expanding services for women experiencing domestic violence. From one initial meeting, conducted by Hamos, a series of \\"weekend gatherings\\" began. In attendance were the directors of the nine agencies that formed ICADV. ICADV was formally founded in September 1978. In October, the group received commendation from Illinois Governor James R. Thompson, and Thompson pushed for the funding for domestic violence services in Illinois. From its beginning in 1978, ICADV and its member programs committed to the following goals: * Expand and increase services for women in all parts of the state; * Give domestic violence victims a statewide voice; * Advocate for public policy changes on these victims' behalf; * Educate the public about domestic violence and to expand the responses of local communities to their victims. ICADV continued to grow throughout the 1980s, expanding its membership and services. In the first five years alone, ICADV grew to include forty-four member organizations. Florence Forshey, a founder, called ICADV \\"the oldest and one of the largest organizations in the US dedicated to eliminating domestic violence\\". In 1985, ICADV and its sister organization, the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, worked together to advocate for the passage of the Illinois Sexual Assault Act in 1985, which broadened the definition of sexual assault, made it gender neutral, and imposed harsher punishments for offenders.Beiriger, Alexandra. \\"Looking Back and Moving Forward: A Study of the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\" Via The Beck Research Institute for Women, Gender, and Community. Accessed 18 January 2017.  Operation  Today, the coalition continues to operate via a network of shelters, counseling programs, and community agencies. ICADV is governed by a board of directors, and membership includes over fifty organizations. The central administrative office in Springfield, Illinois oversees the services provided by its local member agencies. ICADV publishes a newsletter, For Better Times, detailing current actions, new services for victims and survivors of domestic violence, and other issues of interest to the newsletter's audience of social service professionals and corporate supporters throughout the state.

Since, the club mostly played in the lower divisions of Danish football. In 1993, club chairman Bent Villumsen laid out plans for securing the future success of Odder IGF.

The historical promotion occurred under Villumsen's successor as chairman, Peter Lindberg Christensen, who had laid out the future plans for the club together alongside Villumsen in 1993. One of the more remarkable events in club history occurred before the famed promotion. More specifically on 25 August 2010, as Odder IGF reached the second round of the Danish Cup and drew AGF, the largest team in the region.

Mexico has limited protections for animals by international standards.  Legislation  Most of Mexico's states and the Federal District have prohibitions against animal cruelty. In Michoacan, Quintana Roo, and the Federal District, cruelty by negligence is included. This is not the case in Tlaxcala, and in Baja California applies only to certain kinds of animal. Chiapas and Baja California Sur did not have animal welfare protections as of November 2014. The Federal Animal Health Act 2007 contains a number of provisions concerning the welfare of farm animals (not including aquatic animals). The main purpose of the Act is to diagnose, prevent, and control diseases in animals, but welfare is also addressed. Owners or keepers of domestic animals must provide adequate food and water, veterinarian supervision and immediate attention in case of injury. The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food is responsible for protecting the health and welfare of animals in \\"primary production\\", determining rules on animal welfare, transport and slaughter. State-level anti-cruelty provisions also apply to farm animals. In 2014, Mexico received a D out of possible grades A,B,C,D,E,F,G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index. In 2020, Mexico received a C grade.

In 2009, Mexico had the seventh-largest number of chickens at approximately 500 million. De-beaking, de-toeing, tail-docking, tooth pulling, castration, and dehorning of livestock without anaesthetic are legal in Mexico, as is confinement in gestation crates and battery cages.

C. Steele State Historic Site (also called the Theodore Clement Steele House and Studio, and named the House of the Singing Winds by its original owners) is located in rural Brown County, Indiana, one and a half miles south of Belmont, between Bloomington and Nashville, Indiana. The property was the studio and home of Hoosier Group landscape and portrait artist Theodore Clement Steele (1847‚Äì1926) and Selma Neubacher Steele (1870‚Äì1945), the artist's second wife. Shortly before her death in 1945, Selma donated the property on of land to the Indiana Department of Conservation (the present-day Indiana Department of Natural Resources) to establish a state historic site in memory of her husband. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Theodore Clement Steele House and Studio. The Indiana State Museum operates the historic site, which is open to the public and offers guided tours of the home and studio. History =The artist= Theodore Clement Steele (1847‚Äì1926) was a member of the famous Hoosier Group of American regional impressionist painters that also included William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Richard B. Gruelle, and Otto Stark. Born in Owen County, Indiana, Steele began studying art at an early age. He attended Waveland Collegiate Institute in Montgomery County, Indiana, and briefly studied painting in Chicago and Cincinnati before moving to Indianapolis to become a portrait painter. Steele spent five years (1880‚Äì85) studying art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, before returning to Indianapolis to resume his career. Although Steele made his living painting portraits, he is best known for his landscapes. Steele was elected an Associate Artist to the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1913, confirming his standing as the most famous Hoosier artist of his time. Steele was also a former president of the Society of Western Artists.Boomhower, p. 178. Steele's work has been exhibited across the United States. Three of his paintings were accepted into the prestigious Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, in 1915. In 1916 Steele was awarded an honorary doctorate from Indiana University.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 115. =Studio and home= Around 1905‚Äì06, while Steele was exploring new landscapes to paint, he discovered a scenic and isolated area of Brown County, Indiana. In 1907 he purchased of land approximately one and a half miles south of Belmont, between Bloomington and Nashville, Indiana, and had a hilltop studio and home built on the property. Steele moved into the new summer residence with Selma Neubacher Steele, his second wife, in August 1907. From: Steele and his wife developed the property slowly, over time. In 1911 they purchased additional acreage to increase their property to of land, and made further improvements that included an enlarged home surrounded by beautiful gardens, a barn-sized studio and art gallery, and several other outbuildings. The site became their year-round residence in 1912.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 105. Although the property in rural Brown County remained Steele's primary residence, he maintained a studio in Indianapolis. Beginning in 1922, when Steele was named IU's artist-in-residence, he also maintained a winter home in Bloomington and a studio on the school's campus. Following Steele's death in 1926, Selma and her sister, Edith Newbacher, continued to reside on the Brown County property, but they struggled financially. Selma managed the artist's studio, rented out cabins on the property, and sold farm produce and her husband's paintings to earn cash. Selma also established a small museum in a log cabin that she had moved to the property and charged admission for studio tours. In July 1945 Selma donated the Brown County property of more than to the Indiana Department of Conservation (the present-day Indiana Department of Natural Resources) to establish the historic site in her husband's honor. The property included the house, its furnishings and decorative arts, a large studio, other outbuildings and structures, and more than 300 of her husband's paintings. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Theodore Clement Steele House and Studio. =State historic site= The T. C. Steele State Historic Site, the property's present-day name, offers visitors guided tours of the home and large studio. It is open to the public, Tuesday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.Boomhower, p 185. See also: The 211-acre property includes several structures, landscaped grounds and gardens, five hiking trails, and a nature preserve. Description =Home= Inspired by the breezes blowing through the cottage's screened porches, T. C. and Selma Steele named their Brown County home the House of the Singing Winds.Perry, Paint and Canvas, pp. 85, 91‚Äì92. The home originates from 1907, but it was enlarged in 1908 to include a west wing that served as an art studio. (Steele's first studio on the site was established in the home's present-day living room.) Steele used the studio in the west wing for seven years. Before the large, barn-like studio was built in 1916, he also worked in another outbuilding on the property. The vernacular- style home has high ceilings, screened porches, a pyramid-shaped roof, and a central fireplace. Selma Steele decorated the home's interior in an eclectic mix of styles that included Arts and Crafts and Rococo Revival. Gustave Baumann, an artist friend, carved an old Gaelic saying below the fireplace mantle: \\"Every morning I take off my hat to the beauty of the world.\\" =Large studio= The large, barn-like studio was built in 1916. Because Steele was primarily a plein-air painter, it served as a gallery to exhibit and sell Steele's works of art. Painted a dark red color, the building measures by and contains a wall of windows on its north side. The studio continues to display examples of Steele's art. =Dewar log cabin= Peter Dewar, a Scottish immigrant who settled in Brown County, built the two-story log cabin around 1875 at another location as a wedding gift to his son. In order to save the historic cabin from demolition, Selma had it relocated to the Steele property in the early 1930s, where it became known as the Trailside Museum. She dedicated the small museum in 1934 to the memory of Walter Neubacher, one of her brothers. =Other structures= One of two temporary studios that T. C. Steele had erected on the property in 1911, has been reconstructed. The Steeles also had guest houses erected on the property to house visitors. =Gravesites= The remains of T. C. Steele, his wife, Selma, and members of her family are buried in a family cemetery, known as the T. C. Steele Memorial Cemetery, on the property near Belmont. =Grounds and gardens= The land, while not suitable for agricultural purpose, provided Steele with \\"beautiful picturesque woods and hills and valleys.\\" Selma Steele managed the property while her husband focused on painting. She also supervised the gradual development of its landscaped grounds, which included the introduction of new trees, shrubs, and masses of flowers to the hilltop property. It was especially known for the daffodils that covered the hillsides in the spring.Perry, \\"Selma Neubacher Steele\\", p. 10. The present-day grounds feature lily ponds, hillside and perennial gardens, and a formal garden. The site also has five hiking trails: the Trail of Silences, Wildflower Trail, Whippoorwill Haunt Trail, Peckerwood Trail, and Inspiration Ridge Trail. The Selma Steele Nature Preserve on of land within the grounds of the state historic site was dedicated in 1990.

Sexual initiation rites of girls  Sexual cleansing is sometimes performed by a selected future husband for a girl or otherwise by a paid sex worker. A hyena is a traditional position in some parts of southern Malawi, held by a man who initiates young women into adulthood through sex. A hyena is a man paid to have sex with children between the ages of 12‚Äì17, as a part of a rite of passage called kusasa fumbi (\\"brushing off the dust\\", sexual cleansing). The rite lasts for three days. Hyenas are paid from $4 to $7 each time. The rite is believed to prevent disease. Hyenas are chosen for their moral character and are believed to be incapable of catching diseases such as HIV/AIDS, although some have it. The practice can place young girls at risk of HIV infection because the hyena has sexual intercourse with all the girls and the ritual requires the exchange of sexual fluids so condoms are not used.  Widow cleansing  In parts of Kenya, widows are viewed as impure. A tradition to be cleansed to chase away demons involves having sex. It is often forced upon the woman by the deceased husband's family. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman's children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him. Cleansing can be done by the deceased husband's brother or other relative or otherwise by a paid sex worker. Typically, after sex, the widow burns her clothes, and the man shaves the widow‚Äôs hair, often outside so that the neighborhood can witness that the widow is now cleansed. A chicken is slaughtered at the end of the ceremony, which usually lasts from three to seven days. Widow cleansing was outlawed in Kenya in a 2015 domestic offences bill.  Locations  In Malawi, the practice of sexual cleansing is largely confined to Salima, Chikwawa, and Nsanje District. It is practiced in parts of Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, Ivory Coast, and Congo.

Their son-in-law Rafael Escobedo was convicted of the crime, and later committed suicide in prison. Escobedo's friend Javier Anastasio de Espona fled before being brought to trial, but much later asserted his innocence. Events The main suspect, and the only person convicted for the crime, was Rafael Escobedo (1955‚Äì1988). He had married Miriam de la Sierra y Urquijo, daughter of the Marquesses, on 21 June 1978. The relationship deteriorated and in 1979 Miriam formed a relationship with Richard Dennis Rew, known as \\"Dick the American\\". The Marquess was owner of Banco Urquijo, whose shares were plummeting at the time. During the night of 1 August 1980, the Marquesses of Urquijo were shot to death, while they slept at their palace in Somosaguas near Madrid. On 8 April 1981, Escobedo was arrested and confessed to police, after some pistol cartridges were discovered at a property belonging to his father and appeared identical with those used to kill the Marquesses. The next day, Javier Anastasio de Espona, a friend of Escobedo, and Diego Mart√≠nez Herrera, butler to the Urquijos, separately travelled in haste to London, where Juan, the son of the Marquesses and Miriam's younger brother, was living. The disappearance of the cartridges complicated the progress of Escobedo's trial. In July 1983, however, Escobedo was found guilty and sentenced to 53 years in prison, and the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Spain in 1985. Escobedo maintained his innocence, accusing Anastasio of the crime, until his death in the prison of El Dueso on 27 July 1988. The proceedings arising from this event fell to the then Judge of Santo√±a, Fernando Grande Marlaska. The gun was not found by the authorities, although it is believed to have been a .22 caliber model made by Star Bonifacio Echeverria in √âibar. This type of weapon is a collectors' item, since only a small number (estimated as 22-24) were manufactured. Javier Anastasio had been detained in January 1983 and his trial as participant in the murder was set for 21 January 1988. However, a month before the trial he escaped to Brazil via Portugal, and since then his whereabouts have been unknown. The only sighting of him was seven years afterwards, when he was interviewed for television by Jes√∫s Quintero in Brazil. In May 2010 the charges against him were withdrawn and the case was closed under the statute of limitations, 30 years having passed since the crime. In February 1990, Mauricio L√≥pez-Roberts y Melgar, Marquess of Torrehermosa, was sentenced to ten years in prison for obstruction of justice. In 2010 Anastasio was interviewed for the first time for the magazine Vanity Fair in Buenos Aires. He denied having committed the crime. Repercussions The Spanish media have accorded this murder more coverage than most other crime stories of any period. Hundreds of pages of press coverage appeared after the murder, during the trial, and after the suicide of the convict. Several books have been published about the case, among them Con un crimen al hombro. Yo mat√© a los marqueses de Urquijo (\\"With a crime on my shoulder: I killed the Marquesses of Urquijo\\": 1994), a biography of Escobedo by Mat√≠as Antol√≠n, a personal friend. The case also inspired the film Solo o en compa√±√≠a de otros (\\"Alone or in company\\": 1991), with Juan Rib√≥ and Ana √Ålvarez, and an episode The crime of the Marquesses of Urquijo (2010) in the television series The footprint of the crime, on Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola.

Urban is a biologist and associate professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. His work focuses on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape natural communities across multiple spatial scales. Education Mark C. Urban received his B.S. in Environmental Science and Political Science at Muhlenberg College in 1998 (summa cum laude). He received his M.E.Sc. from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 2001 and his Ph.D. in 2006 from Yale University. Career Urban was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, California from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, Urban joined the faculty of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Connecticut as Assistant Professor and became Associate Professor in 2014. Work Mark Urban has contributed to biology by advocating for tighter linkages between ecology and evolutionary biology, suggesting the prevalence of fine-scaled microgeographic adaptation in nature, and highlighting the accelerating extinction risk from global warming. =Eco-evolutionary dynamics= As a contributor to the subfield of Eco-evolution, he is one of the founders of the evolving metacommunity framework, which emphasizes the joint interaction between species-sorting and local adaptation across environmental patches linked by dispersal in determining patterns of diversity across natural landscapes. He has also contributed to the community monopolization hypothesis which states that evolution alters the assembly and eventual configuration of communities because initial colonists adapt to local conditions and affect the ability of future species to establish. =Microgeographic adaptation= He and his colleagues defined and provided evidence for so-called microgeographic adaptation, the adaptation of populations at scales finer than expected based on their dispersal ability. He suggests that adaptation might occur much more often at fine scales because migrants often do poorly outside of their local environment, thus affecting the realized gene flow. Microgeographic adaptation might therefore often affect local patterns of biodiversity than commonly expected. =Climate change biology= Mark Urban has contributed to our understanding of climate change effects on species and communities. He described the biotic multipliers of climate change, which are species both sensitive to climate change and with disproportionate effects on communities and ecosystems. These species are often top predators, and should be the ones to study first because they might have the greatest effects on other species. He also helped develop the boxcar effect, whereby species in cooler regions prevent species in warmer regions from tracking their preferred thermal environment through competition. Urban also showed that only evolution might be able to protect all diversity from climate change effects. He recently found that the extinction risk from global warming not only increases with warmer temperatures, but actually accelerates. His work suggests that if we follow a business-as-usual emissions climate change scenario, then 1 in 6 species could become threatened with extinction from climate change. He has suggested that we still know too little about how climate change is affecting nature and need renewed efforts to predict and mediate its effects.

OmegA was intended for launching U.S. national security satellites, as part of the U.S. Department of the Air Force National Security Space Launch (NSSL) replacement program. In August 2020, the design was not selected by the Air Force in the competitive process, and Northrop Grumman Space Systems (NGSS), in September 2020, has decided not to continue the development as a commercial competitive offering with further development funded by NGSS. The OmegA design consisted of new composite solid rocket stages with a cryogenic upper stage provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne, replacing earlier plans to use an upper stage engine provided by Blue Origin. The OmegA design was similar to the defunct Ares I and Liberty projects, both of which consisted of a five segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a cryogenic second stage. It was intended to be launched from Kennedy Space Center LC-39B or Vandenberg Air Force Base SLC-6. OmegA was proposed as a vehicle to launch national security satellites for the United States Space Force and other government agencies, including to geostationary transfer orbit. The launch vehicle could theoretically launch commercial payloads as well, but was not designed at a price point to make private competitive launches likely. Orbital ATK claimed in 2016 that crewed spacecraft could also be launched, just as the predecessor Ares I and Liberty rockets, which were designed to be able to also launch the Orion space capsule. By 2016, actual development was to get underway only once the Air Force reached a funding decision. In October 2018, the Air Force announced that Northrop Grumman was awarded $792 million for initial development of the OmegA launch vehicle. In August 2020, the Department of the Air Force announced the results of the approximately US3.5 billion National Security Space Launch Phase 2, Launch Service Procurement for launches in the 2022‚Äì2027 timeframe and OmegA was not selected. The USAF announced that it would wind down any remaining OmegA development contracts from phase 1, and may not pay out the entire maximum amount of the earlier 2019 contract to NGIS. On 9 September 2020, Northrop Grumman Space Systems released a statement announcing the cancellation of the OmegA launch vehicle program.  History  Orbital ATK's Logo The company that was to propose the OmegA launch vehicle in 2016 (Orbital ATK, which was subsequently acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2018), through its predecessor company Alliant Techsystems (ATK), had developed the solid rocket boosters for the Space Shuttle in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, and military Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) prior to that. With the 2004 announcement of the retirement of the Space Shuttle, the company was active in trying to find government purchasers of its, now, 30+ year old solid- propellant rocket technology to continue using the technology for orbital launch vehicles. Since then, they have approached both the US government's civil space branch, NASA, and also the miltary branch, U.S. DoD, with proposals to develop continued government-funded opportunities to design, build and support the orbital space application of solid rocket technology. They were successful, as NASA selected ATK's technology for the Ares I crewed launch vehicle in 2005, with ATK supplying the a five-segment solid rocket booster as the first stage while also being the primary contractor for the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which was to have a more standard liquid-propellant powered upper stage. Following the early cancellation of the Ares I rocket in 2010, ATK proposed the Liberty (rocket) to NASA in 2011, which was subsequently not selected for full development funding in 2012. ATK then pursued options with the U.S. DoD. In January 2016, Orbital ATK was one of two companies awarded funds by the United States Air Force to develop technologies to eliminate dependency on the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine for U.S. national security payloads. The award was worth an initial US$46.9 million, with an option for up to US$180.2 million total. This was to be matched by US$31.1 million initially, and up to US$124.8 million in company funds if all options of the contract are exercised. The contract would fund the development of three technologies in support of the OmegA rocket, then called Next Generation Launcher: the GEM-63XL strap-on booster, a Common Booster Core and an extendable nozzle for the BE-3U upper stage engine. A previous effort, funded by NASA, demonstrated the technology for a composite motor case to replace the metal motor cases used for Space Shuttle SRBs. In May 2016, Orbital ATK revealed their plans for the Next Generation Launcher, including the configuration and the intended business case. The Next Generation Launcher intends to make use of existing launch infrastructure at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), including the Vehicle Assembly Building used by the Space Shuttle, with the possibility of polar orbit launches occurring from Vandenberg Air Force Base. NASA began looking for commercial users to operate unused space within the Vehicle Assembly Building in June 2015, and by April 2016, it was announced that Orbital ATK was in negotiations to lease High Bay 2. Orbital ATK claimed that a minimum of 5‚Äì6 launches per year would be required to make the rocket profitable. Full development and introduction will be dependent on both demand and funding from the U.S. Air Force. A final \\"go/no-go decision\\" to proceed with full development and introduction of the Next Generation Launcher took place in early 2018. In April 2017, Orbital ATK revealed that OmegA would be launched from pad 39B at KSC, sharing launch facilities and mobile transporter with the NASA Space Launch System (SLS). The rocket would compete for USAF national security launches and NASA missions. There would be multiple configurations of the launch system, with multiple stages. In April 2018, Orbital ATK announced that Next Generation Launcher would be named OmegA. Additionally, they revealed the selection of the RL-10C engine over Blue Origin's BE-3U competitor. The intermediate configuration, with a Castor 600 first stage, increased payload to GTO from to . The Castor 1200-powered Heavy configuration increased GEO payload from to and has a TLI capability of up to 12,300 kg (27,000 lb). Orbital ATK was purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2018, and OmegA became a Northrop Grumman product. In October 2018, OmegA was awarded a Launch Services Agreement worth US$791,601,015 to design, build and launch the first OmegA rockets. In late May 2019, while conducting a static fire test of the first stage SRB, an anomaly occurred resulting in the destruction of the SRB nozzle (but not the stage itself). A thorough investigation revealed that the differential pressure between the nozzle's internal pressure and surface pressure following the static fire test was greater than expected; when thrust levels dropped below a critical point upon completion of the static fire, the outside air crushed the nozzle \\"in an instant, just like a soda can\\". In 2019, Northrop Grumman bid the OmegA launch vehicle to the US Air Force for the multi-year block buy launch contract that would cover all US national security launches in 2022‚Äì2026. In August 2020, the US Department of the Air Force announced the results of the approximately US3.5 billion National Security Space Launch Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement, selecting only SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA) to supply launches to the US Department of Defense in the 2022‚Äì2027 timeframe. NGIS OmegA was not selected. The contract type for the phase 2 contracts is new for US government launches as it will be a \\"firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery\\" type of launch contract and these contract awards are a part of \\"the transition of the national security launch program to take advantage of commercial innovation and private investments in launch vehicles\\". NGSS indicated they were \\"disappointed by the decision\\". The fate of the OmegA launch vehicle is unclear, as NGSS depended on the funding from the US military to develop the vehicle design to this point. The USAF announced on 7 August 2020, that they would wind down any remaining OmegA development contracts from phase 1, and may not pay out the entire maximum amount of the earlier 2019 contract to NGIS. The Air Force stated that they would work with NGIS \\"to determine the right point to tie off their work under the LSA agreements. ... The goal is not to carry them indefinitely, the point of an LSA was to create a more competitive environment\\". Description The OmegA launch vehicle concept is a three-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle originally proposed by Orbital ATK (subsequently Northrop Grumman after the 2018 acquisition of Orbital ATK) that principally uses three different solid- propellant rockets to get to orbit, along with a hydrolox upper stage. The OmegA design was with a -diameter first and second stages and a -diameter upper stage. There were intended to be two version of the main rocket stack, plus variable 2 to 6 SRBs attached to the first stage to assist with the entire variety of NSSL reference orbits. The design payload for the primary DoD missions that it was being aimed at was to to GTO with the \\"Intermediate\\" version and to to GEO with the \\"Heavy\\" version. It was intended to be launched from either Kennedy LC-39B or Vandenberg SLC-6, the two locations used for all US DoD launches. The full vehicle was never built, nor launched, as NGSS was not selected by the Department of the Air Force to receive more funding to build and test the vehicle. The component details for the OmegA design are: * SRBs: 2 to 6 GEM-63XLT of diameter, attached to the first stage, using HTPB solid propellant, with a specific impulse of * First stage: Castor Solid Rocket Booster using HTPB propellant ** Castor 600 (Intermediate version) ** Castor 1200 (Heavy version) * Second stage: Castor 300 1-segment solid rocket booster, HTPB * Third stage: 2 √ó RL-10C-5-1 LH/LOX rocket engines with thrust and a vacuum-rated Isp of ‚âà450 seconds = Multiple configurations = The rocket was to have had two basic configurations, an intermediate and a heavy launch. Both configurations would have had a minimum of two thrust vectoring GEM-63XLTs for roll control. The intermediate version was to have had a two segment solid rocket booster (SRB) first stage, a single segment SRB second stage, and a liquid hydrogen fueled third stage, while the heavy configuration would have a 4-segment SRB first stage, and the same upper stages. Additional versions could conceiveably have added additional SRBs as side boosters with the SRBs sharing avionics suites with other Orbital ATK rockets to reduce costs.

In the early solar system, energy to melt objects came largely from the decay of radioactive aluminum-26. As planets grew larger, the energy was supplied from large or giant impacts. During its formation, the Earth likely suffered a series of magma oceans resulting from giant impacts, the final one being the Moon-forming impact. Magma oceans are integral parts of planetary formation as they facilitate formation of a core through metal segregation and an atmosphere and hydrosphere through degassing. Magma oceans may survive for millions to tens of millions of years, interspersed by relatively clement conditions. Magma oceans are widely accepted to have existed on Earth, and the best chemical evidence for them is the abundance of certain siderophile elements in the mantle that record magma ocean depths of approximately 1000 km during accretion. A magma ocean also occurred on the Moon during and following its formation.

The bank does not have branches and is considered a neobank. , Tinkoff Bank has a credit rating of B+ on the Fitch Ratings and B2 on the Moody's Rating, and is the second largest provider of credit cards in Russia. Tinkoff is the world's largest digital bank, as measured by number of customers. History Entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov founded Tinkoff Credit Systems in 2006, after working with consultants from Boston Consulting Group to see if a bank without branches could work in Russia. Tinkov invested around $70 million in the bank, and based the bank on the American Capital One bank; Tinkov took over the Khimmashbank corporate bank in Moscow. In 2007, the bank received investment from Goldman Sachs. In 2013, Tinkoff was listed on the London Stock Exchange, raising $1.1 billion, and in the same year, the bank was named the Bank of the Year by the Financial Times' Banker magazine. In 2013, a Russian named Dmitry Agarkov attempted to sue the bank for 24 million rubles ($724,000); Agarkov had edited a 2008 credit card agreement with the bank, and his edits had been accepted by the bank. The legal action was later withdrawn by both the parties after an undisclosed settlement was reached. In 2015, the bank was officially renamed Tinkoff Bank, and was also named the Best Internet Retail Bank in Russia by the Global Finance magazine. In December 2019, Tinkoff launched Russia's first fully digital ATM, without keyboard or the ability to print receipts. In the 2019 financial year, Tinkoff announced revenue increases of 33%. Tinkoff Bank has updated its app to include cinema and hotel tickets, as well as booking holidays through the bank's subsidiary, Tinkoff Travel. In March 2020, shares in the bank fell after Oleg Tinkov, who owns a 40% share in the bank, was indicted by the US Department of Justice. Also in 2020, the bank helped fund German mobile banking startup Vivid Money, which is supported by solarisBank and Visa. Sponsorships From 2006‚Äì2008, Tinkoff were the sponsors of the Tinkoff Credit Systems UCI Professional Continental cycling team. In June 2012, Tinkoff became the co-sponsors of the Team Saxo Bank, with the team being renamed Saxo Bank‚ÄìTinkoff Bank (later Saxo-Tinkoff, Tinkoff-Saxo and Tinkoff). For the 2016 cycling season, Tinkoff Bank became the sole sponsors of the cycling team. In 2018, Tinkoff became the sponsor of the Russian comedy TV competition KVN with a contract for three years. The same year, Tinkoff sponsored a Depeche Mode concert in Moscow. Since February 2020, Tinkoff is the title sponsor of the Russian Premier League.

In many sports, it is grouped inside other classifications to allow people with cerebral palsy to compete against people with other different disabilities but the same level of functionality. CP1 classified competitors are the group who are most physically affected by their cerebral palsy. They are quadriplegics. The most popular sport for people in this class is boccia, where they are classified as either BC1 or BC3. Other sports open to competitors in this class include athletics, cycling, race running, slalom, and swimming. In some of these sports, different classification systems or names for CP1 are used.  Definition and participation  The spasticity athetosis level and location of a CP1 sportsperson. CP1 classified competitors are the group who are most physically affected by their cerebral palsy. They are most likely to participate in boccia. Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) defined this class in January 2005 as, \\"Quadriplegic (Tetraplegic)-Severe involvement. Spasticity Grade 4 to 3+, with or without athetosis or with poor functional range of movement and poor functional strength in all extremities and trunk OR the severe athetoid with or without spasticity with poor functional strength and control. Dependent on a power wheelchair or assistance for mobility. Unable to functionally propel a wheelchair. Lower Extremities-Considered non-functional in relation to any sport due to limitation in range of movement strength and/or control. Minimal or involuntary movement would not change this person's class. Trunk Control- Static and dynamic trunk control very poor or non-existent. Severe difficulty adjusting back to mid-line or upright position when performing sports movements. Upper Extremities-Severe limitation in functional range of movement or severe athetosis are the major factors in all sports, and reduced throwing motion with poor follow through is evident. Opposition of thumb and one finger may be possible allowing athlete to grip.\\"  Performance  CP1 sportspeople tend to use electric wheelchairs. They may have controlled shakes and twitches. They have severely limited of their trunk and limbs. When participating in sport, CP1 competitors tend to have low energy expenditure. This bodily activity can spike their metabolic rate. CP1 competitors have worse upper body control when compared to CP2.  Sports  = Athletics = The IPC equivalent for this class is F31, and they compete mostly in field events. Historically, CP1 athletes were more active in track events. Changes in the classification during the 1980s and 1990s led to most track events for CP1 racers being dropped and replaced exclusively with field events. This has been criticized, because with the rise of commercialization of the Paralympic movement, there has been a reduction of classes in more popular sports for people with the most severe disabilities as these classes often have much higher support costs associated with them. = Boccia = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in boccia at the Paralympic Games. Boccia made its debut on the Paralympic program at the 1984 Games. Boccia began to develop as an important sport for people in this class as track events began to disappear. The timing of this matched with a push by the CP-ISRA to promote the sport. CP1 competitors are classified as either BC1 or BC3. In BC1, they can generally throw the ball past the V Line. They are allowed to have assistants. BC3 players cannot throw the ball themselves, require the use of an electric wheelchair and use a ramp to propel the ball. = Cycling = CP1 to CP4 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T1 class. Tricycles are only eligible to compete in road events, not track ones. Cyclists in this class are required to wear a helmet, with a special color used to designate their class. CP1 cyclists wear a green helmet. = Race Running = CP1 sportspeople can compete in race running. CP1 race runners are classified as RR1. The classes events include the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. They often require that their arms or legs be strapped in order for them to run. When they do run, their legs to butterfly out and can inadvertently cross. Compared to other CP race running classes, CP1 and CP2 have a low economy of movement. = Slalom = One of the sports available for CP1 sportspeople is slalom. Slalom involves an obstacle course for people using carts. CP1 competitors can use motorized carts unlike competitors in other CP wheelchair classes. = Swimming = S1 swimmer functionality People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in swimming at the Paralympic Games. CP1 swimmers may be found in several classes. These include S1, and S2. Some swimmers in this class require floaters to race. The use of such devices is not allowed in IPC sanctioned events, but is allowed in CP-ISRA sanctioned ones. CP1 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 1.3 to 1.7. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB1, and PDB3.  Classification process  The process for being classified is often sports specific. As a general rule, CP1 need to attend classification in a wheelchair. Failure to do so could result in them being classified as an ambulatory CP class competitor such as CP5 or CP6, or a related sport specific class. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test, which is used in swimming, lawn bowls and wheelchair fencing. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of disabilities a muscle being assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 for people with cerebral palsy and other issues with muscle spasticity. A 1 is for no functional movement of the muscle or where there is no motor coordination. A 2 is for normal muscle movement range not exceeding 25% or where the movement can only take place with great difficult and, even then, very slowly. A 3 is where normal muscle movement range does not exceed 50%. A 4 is when normal muscle movement range does not exceed 75% and or there is slight in-coordination of muscle movement. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. Swimming classification generally has three components. The first is a bench press. The second is water test. The third is in competition observation. As part of the water test, swimmers are often required to demonstrate their swimming technique for all four strokes. They usually swim a distance of 25 meters for each stroke. They are also generally required to demonstrate how they enter the water and how they turn in the pool.

Lower Extremities-A demonstrable degree of function in one or both lower limbs allowing propulsion of the wheelchair automatically qualifies individual as a Class 2 lower. If the classification team determines that the upper limb function is more appropriate for a higher 23 class then the athlete does not qualify as Class 2. Class 2 athletes (upper or lower) can sometimes ambulate but never run functionally. Trunk Control-Static control is fair. Dynamic trunk control is poor as demonstrated by the obligatory use of upper extremities and/or head to assist in returning to the mid-line (upright position). Upper Extremities-Hand-Severe to moderate involvement. Spasticity Grade 3.\\"  Performance  People in this class tend to use electric wheelchairs. They may have controlled shakes and twitches. This bodily activity can spike their metabolic rate. They can operate a manual wheelchair but this is restricted because of motor control issues. Functional control issues effect all or most of their limbs. When participating in sport, CP2 competitors tend to have low energy expenditure. While CP2, CP3 and CP6 have similar issues with Athetoid or Ataxic, CP6 competitors have \\"flight\\" while they are ambulant in that it is possible for both feet to not be touching the ground while walking. CP2 and CP3 are unable to do this. CP2 competitors have better upper body control when compared to CP1.  Sports  = Athletics = T52 function level. In IPC sanctioned competitions, CP2 players are classified as T32/F32. Events that may be on the program for CP2 competitors include the club, discus throw, shot put and javelin. In track events, they have poor wheelchair control and may only be able to push their chair forwards using one arm. In field throwing events, CP2 competitors may have poor device release because of spasticity in their hands but still have good upper body rotation. Their throwing motion generally is not a typical one owing to the lack of motion control. In some cases, CP2 athletes be grouped in with F51, F52 or F53 classes. Prior to a classification rule change made in 2009, CP2 Lower athletes often compete in T31 for track events. Historically, CP2 athletes were more active in track events.

People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in boccia at the Paralympic Games. CP2 competitors compete in the BC1 or BC2 class in BisFed events. BC1 CP2 boccia players may push the ball with their feet instead of their arms or using a ramp like CP1 players in the same class. They are allowed to have assistants. BC2 classified players are not allowed to have assistants. = Cycling = CP1 to CP4 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T1 class. Tricycles are only eligible to compete in road events, not track ones. Tricycles are often required because their level of CP effects their balance and they are unable to use a standard bicycle. CP2 cyclists may also use a handcycle in the H1 class. All CP2 cyclists are required to wear a helmet, with a special color used to designate their class. Their helmet color is red. = Race running = CP2 race runners are classified as RR2. The classes events include the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. The running style of CP2 competitors differs a lot within the class. They may run using a standard form but with much shorter slides. They may also run with their legs butterflying. They generally do not require their arms be strapped to race runner. They will still have difficulty grasping the handles and steering. Compared to other CP race running classes, CP1 and CP2 have a low economy of movement. = Slalom = One of the available sports for CP2 competitors is slalom. Slalom involves an obstacle course for people using carts. CP2 competitors use self-propelled carts to navigate the course. = Swimming = S2 functionality. CP2 sports people are eligible to compete in swimming at the Paralympic Games. CP2 tend to be classified as S2. CP2 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 1.0 to 1.1. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB4. = Other sports = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete at the elite level in a number of other sports including lawn bowls and archery.

In many sports, it is grouped inside other classifications to allow people with cerebral palsy to compete against people with other different disabilities but the same level of functionality. Compared higher number CP classes, they have increased issues with head movement and trunk function. They tend to use wheelchairs on a daily basis though they may be ambulant with the use of assistive devices. Sportspeople in this class are eligible to participate in a number of sports on the elite level. They include athletics, cycling, skiing, swimming, wheelchair tennis, archery, wheelchair fencing, wheelchair curling, table tennis, shooting, sailing, powerlifting, para-equestrian, rowing and archery. In some of these sports, different classification systems or names for CP3 are used.

While CP2, CP3 and CP6 have similar issues with Athetoid or Ataxic, CP6 competitors have \\"flight\\" while they are ambulant in that it is possible for both feet to not be touching the ground while walking. CP2 and CP3 are unable to do this. Head movement and trunk function differentiate this class from CP4. Lack of symmetry in arm movement are another major difference between the two classes, with CP3 competitors having less symmetry.  Sports  = Athletics = CP3 competitors compete in athletic events in the T33/F33 classes. In some cases, CP3 athletes may be classified as F53, F54, or F55. Events that may be on the program for CP3 competitors include the club, discus throw, shot put and javelin. While F33/F53/F54/F55 throwers may be able to walk with assistance, competitors throw from a fixed seated position. Historically, CP3 athletes were more active in track events. Changes in the classification during the 1980s and 1990s led to most track events for CP3 racers being dropped and replaced exclusively with field events. This has been criticized, because with the rise of commercialization of the Paralympic movement, there has been a reduction of classes in more popular sports for people with the most severe disabilities as these classes often have much higher support costs associated with them. = Cycling = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in cycling at the elite level and at the Paralympic Games. CP1 to CP4 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T1 class. Tricycles are only eligible to compete in road events, not track ones. Tricycles are required because their level of CP effects their balance and they are unable to use a standard bicycle. CP3 cyclists may also use a handcycle in the H1 class.

CP1 to CP4 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T1 class. Tricycles are only eligible to compete in road events, not track ones. Tricycles are required because cyclists at this left have their balance effected by their cerebral palsy and they are unable to use a standard bicycle.

Hand Function-Normal cylindrical/spherical, opposition and prehensive grasp and release in the dominant hand is seen in all sports.\\"  Performance  CP5 sportspeople in this class have greater functional control of their upper body. They may require the use of an assistive device when walking but they do not require use of a wheelchair. They often have problems with their dynamic equilibrium but not their static equilibrium. Quick movements can upset their balance.  Sports  = Athletics = In athletics events, CP5 competitors participate in T35/F35 classes. In some cases, CP5 athletes may be classified as F56. Events that may be on the program for CP5 competitors include the club, discus throw, shot put and javelin. In athletics, they have some balance issues in track events and field events that require either running or throwing. = Cycling = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in cycling at the Paralympic Games. CP5 and CP6 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T2 class. Cyclists opting to compete in the T2 class often do so as a result of balance issues, which make riding a standard bicycle or handcycle difficult. Tricyclists are not eligible to compete in track events, only in road events. CP5 and CP6 may also chose to compete on a bicycle in the C3 class. = Football = CP5 sportspeople are eligible to compete in association football in the sport of CP football. CP5 players are classified as FT5. The rules of the sport are such that there must be at least on FT5 or FT6 player on the field at all times. If it is not possible to field an FT5 or FT6 player, the team plays with six players on the field instead of seven. Players in this class may have problems running or walking. They do not have problems though standing in a stationary position or with kicking a ball. The extent of their disability is such that CP5 players would unlikely to ever be competitive against able-bodied players. During play, the more FT5 players exert themselves, the more their form deteriorates. Coordination issues make it difficult for them to trap the ball. They may be unable to do throw-ins because of balance issues. CP footballers are first required to go through national level classification before being eligible for international classification. The first stage of international classification involves a physical assessment. This may involve classifiers who are medical experts. The second stage involves observing the footballer practicing their sport specific skills in a non-competitive setting. The third stage involves classifiers observing the player in competition for at least 30 minutes. Following that, the classification panel then assigns the footballer to a class, which may also include \\"Not Eligible.\\" The Canadian development pathways for CP footballers trains FT5 players to become goalkeepers. = Skiing = CP5 athletes are eligible to compete in skiing competitions at the elite level and the Paralympic Games. CP5 Nordic skiers compete in LW3, LW4 and LW9. CP5 alpine skiers compete in LW1 and LW3/2. In teaching skiers with cerebral palsy, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and how to put it on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns. While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant boards or toe boards. CP5 LW4 skiers may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly. = Swimming = CP5 swimmers are eligible to compete at the Paralympic Games. These swimmers may be found in several classes including S5, and S6. CP5 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 0.6 to 1.0. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB5, PDB6, PDB7, PDB8, and PDB9. Because of their balance issues, swimmers in this class can find the starting block problematic and often have slower times entering the water than other competitors in their class. Because the disability of swimmers in this class involves in a loss of function in specific parts of their body, they are more prone to injury than their able- bodied counterparts as a result of overcompensation in other parts of their body. When fatigued, CP5 asymmetry in their stroke becomes a problem for swimmers in this class, more so than others in their class. The integrated classification system used for swimming, where swimmers with CP compete against those with other disabilities, is subject to criticisms has been that the nature of CP is that greater exertion leads to decreased dexterity and fine motor movements. This puts competitors with CP at a disadvantage when competing against people with amputations who do not lose coordination as a result of exertion. = Other sports = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete at the elite level in a number of other sports including wheelchair tennis, archery, para-equestrian, powerlifting, rowing, shooting, sledge hockey, sailing, table tennis, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair curling, and wheelchair fencing. Race running is another sport open to this class. CP5 race runners may be classified as RR3. Para-Taekwondo is open people in this class. Early on, the CP5 classification competed as CP5 before a different sport specific classification system was developed.

In many sports, it is grouped inside other classifications to allow people with cerebral palsy to compete against people with other different disabilities but the same level of functionality. Sportspeople in this class are ambulatory, and able to walk without the use of an assistive device. Their bodies are constantly in motion. The running form of people in this class is often better than their form while walking. Some of the sports that CP6 sportspeople are eligible to participate in at the elite level include athletics, cycling, football, skiing, swimming, race running, para-taekwondo, wheelchair tennis, archery, para-equestrian, powerlifting, rowing, sailing, shooting, sledge hockey, table tennis, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair fencing, and table tennis In some of these sports, different classification systems or names for CP6 are used.  Definition and participation  The spasticity athetosis level and location of a CP6 sportsperson. Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association defined this class in January 2005 as, \\"Athetoid or Ataxic - Moderate involvement The athlete ambulates without assistive devices. Athetosis is the most prevalent factor, although some ambulant spastic quadriplegics (i.e. more arm involvement than in ambulant diplegics), may fit this Class. Athetosis means unsteady (writhing), not having the capability to remain still. All four limbs will usually show functional involvement in sports movements. Class 6 athletes have more control problems in upper limbs than Class 5 athletes, although the former usually have better function in lower limbs particularly when running. Lower Extremities-Function can vary considerably depending on the sports skill involved, from poor, laboured, slow walking to a running gait, which often shows better mechanics. There can be a marked contrast between the walking athetoid with inco-ordinated gait and the smooth even paced co-ordinated running/cycling action. Cyclical movements however are much better performed like cycling, running and free-style swimming Balance-May have good dynamic balance compared with static balance. Spasticity is common in Class 6 athletes and should not be a reason for placement in Class 5. Upper Extremities and Hand Control-Grasp and release can be significantly affected when throwing in the moderate to severe athetoid athlete. The more spasticity present the greater the limits on follow through and maintenance of balance after throwing. \\"  Performance  CP6 sportspeople are able to walk without the need for an assistive device. They lack coordination in all their limbs, with the greater lack of coordination involving their upper body. Their bodies are often in motion, and they cannot maintain a still state. While CP2, CP3 and CP6 have similar issues with Athetoid or Ataxic, CP6 competitors have \\"flight\\" while they are ambulant in that it is possible for both feet to not be touching the ground while walking. CP2 and CP3 are unable to do this.  Sports  = Athletics = In athletics events, CP6 competitors participate in T36/F36 classes. In athletics, CP6 competitors have some balance issues in track events and field events that require either running or throwing. Their form in running is often better than their form while walking. = Cycling = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in cycling at the Paralympic Games. CP5 and CP6 competitors may compete using tricycles in the T2 class. Cyclists opting to compete in the T2 class often do so as a result of balance issues, which make riding a standard bicycle or handcycle difficult. Tricyclists are not eligible to compete in track events, only in road events. CP5 and CP6 may also chose to compete on a bicycle in the C3 class. = Football = CP6 sportspeople are eligible to compete in association football in the sport of CP football. CP6 players are classified as FT6. The rules of the sport are such that there must be at least on FT5 or FT6 player on the field at all times. If it is not possible to field an FT5 or FT6 player, the team plays with six players on the field instead of seven. The extent of their disability is such that CP5 players would unlikely to ever be competitive against able-bodied players. When they do not have the ball, CP6 class players may have problems stopping and changing directions when running. When kicking from a non-stationary position, their accuracy is severely reduced. They may have difficulty when dribbling the ball. CP footballers are first required to go through national level classification before being eligible for international classification. The first stage of international classification involves a physical assessment. This may involve classifiers who are medical experts. The second stage involves observing the footballer practising their sport specific skills in a non-competitive setting. The third stage involves classifiers observing the player in competition for at least 30 minutes. Following that, the classification panel then assigns the footballer to a class, which may also include \\"Not Eligible.\\" = Skiing = CP6 are able to compete at the elite Paralympic level. CP6 Nordic skiers compete in LW3 and LW9, while CP6 alpine skiers compete in LW 1 and LW3/2.

They are often classified as S7. CP6 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB6, PDB7, PDB8, PDB9, and PDB10. Because of their balance issues, swimmers in this class can find the starting block problematic and often have slower times entering the water than other competitors in their class. CP6 swimmers experience swimmers shoulder, a swimming related injury, at rates similar to their able- bodied counterparts. When fatigued, asymmetry in their stroke becomes a problem for swimmers in this class.

Performance  CP7 sportspeople are able to walk, but appear to do so while having a limp as one side of their body is more effected than the other. They may have involuntary muscles spasms on one side of their body. They have fine motor control on their dominant side of the body, which can present as asymmetry when they are in motion. People in this class tend to have energy expenditure similar to people without cerebral palsy.  Sports  = Athletics = Lisa McIntosh is a T37 athlete. In athletics events, CP7 competitors participate in T37/F37 classes. Their running form manifests as if they have a limp. Their disability manifests itself less when they are running as opposed to walking. = Cycling = People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in cycling at the Paralympic Games. CP7 and CP8 may compete on a bicycle in the C4 class. = Football = CP7 sportspeople are eligible to compete in association football in the sport of CP football. CP7 players are classified as FT7. When running, CP7 soccer players knee pickup is not as high as able-bodied players and their stride may be shorter as a result of spasticity.

CP7 and CP8 sportspeople are eligible to participate in Grade A. This grade includes people who have finger amputations. = Swimming = CP7 swimmers are often classified in S7, S8, S9 or S10 because of their hemiplegia and spasicity. The less severe, the closer they are to S10. Because of the neuromuscular nature of their disability, they have slower start times than other people in their classes. They are also more likely to interlock their hands when underwater in some strokes to prevent hand drift, which increases drag while swimming. For S8 classified swimmers with CP, they are able to record long distances underwater. The longest distances Paralympic S8 swimmers can measure are often half that of comparable Olympic counters. This is attributed to neuromuscular related drag issues. CP swimmers are more efficient at above water swimming than underwater swimming. CP7 swimmers tend to have a passive normalized drag in the range of 0.6 to 0.8. This puts them into the passive drag band of PDB6, PDB8, and PDB9.

Athletics career Niewiedzia≈Ç first came to note as an athlete when in 1999 she set a world record mark of 57.48 in the 400 metres at a meet in Seville. She followed this with a gold medal in the 800 metres at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, beating her team-mate and long-time rival Arleta Meloch into second place. After Sydney Niewidzial's career as an athlete was halted due to her classification being suspended by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) following the cheating scandal at the 2000 Games. In 2009, the IPC decided to reinstate athletes with intellectual disabilities in readiness for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Niewiedzia≈Ç's return to major international athletics came when she was selected for the Poland team at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch. There she competed in the 1,500 metres race, coming second to Meloch. Niewidzial followed this with a gold medal in the 1,500 metres at the 2012 IPC Athletics European Championships in Stadskanaal before winning her second Paralympic gold in the same event in London. Niewiedzia≈Ç had planned to retire after the London Paralympics, but the experience of competing in front of a cheering capacity crowd that the 2012 Games provided changed her decision. Further success followed at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon where she took gold in her favoured 1,500m. She furthered this success two years later at the World Championships in Doha, taking three gold medals in the 400m, 800m and the 1,500m races. In the build up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Niewiedzia≈Ç travelled to Italy to take part in the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships in Grosseto. She won both of her races to take the 400m and 1,500m titles.

It has been considered the work of a highly skilled (though unknown) ancient Egyptian sculptor, as well as one of the most famous and credited pieces of art from the Late and Ptolemaic periods of ancient Egypt. Description The face of the statue is calm and emotionless and, unusually for contemporary works of art, also perfectly symmetric, and it is that of an intelligent-looking, middle-aged man with many well-rendered wrinkles and lines. The statue's shaved, oval-shaped skull is so realistic that it was once believed that the sculptor could not have made it without ancient Greek knowledge of anatomy, a claim subsequently disproved by the analysis of similar, earlier Egyptian artworks. On the back of the head, the top portion of a conventional back pillar is still visible. The whole artefact is uninscribed, thus the owner's name and titles are unknown. For the same reason, the statue could only be dated on stylistic grounds. Once regarded as art of the Saite Period, it was later attributed to the Ptolemaic Period by Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing. In 1960, Bernard von Bothmer further reduced the time range between 100 and 50 BCE, arguing that the head reveals a maturity not compatible with the earlier Ptolemaic art, as well as a similarity with some upcoming Roman Republic-era Egyptian works. Its provenance is also unknown, as well as its trace before 1895, when it was acquired from the collections of prince Ibrahim Hilmy and Henry Wallis. The Berlin Green Head has been compared to the similar, yet earlier Boston Green Head, with the former one having lost part of the \\"verism\\" (among that, the asymmetry) which is more prominent in the latter one, yet without compromising the characterization of the individual represented on it.

In the late 1970s, he was implicated in a high-profile case of scientific misconduct.  Early life  = Family = Straus is the son of Samuel Straus (1914‚Äì1985) an Ashkenazi Jewish Polish immigrant from Sambir (now in the Ukraine), who came to New York impoverished at age 15. Samuel's mother had died when he was three months old. Straus's mother, Dora Straus (1918‚Äì2008) was a daughter of immigrants from Austria-Hungary. Her father worked as a tailor in Brooklyn, New York. In 1943, Straus's father Samuel opened Roman Cotton Goods, a wholesale textile store, in Manhattan's Lower Eastside. In 1946, the family moved to West Hempstead, Long Island, where he attended public school. At age 10 he a began commuting to Yeshiva Central Queens, an orthodox Jewish school, and at the age of 14 to Yeshiva of Flatbush in Brooklyn. On his first day of high school, he met Livia Selmanowitz, granddaughter of a scholar rabbi who headed a Ger Hassidic group in Brooklyn. In their senior year they began to date and were married in 1964. =Academic and medical career= Straus earned a BA in history in 1964 from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and an MD in 1968 from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. He was a medical intern from 1968 to 1969 at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, and from 1969 to 1971 was a research fellow in drug research and development at the National Cancer Institute. At the National Cancer Institute he worked on cancer drug studies in mice which established optimal ways of combining different drugs, and he had a number of publications in cancer research journals. From 1971 to 1972 he was a medical resident at Barnes Hospital, Washington University, St. Louis. There he devised a combination chemotherapy trial for patients with small-cell lung cancer, an approach that became the basis for many other trials. Between 1972 and 1974, he was a clinical oncology fellow at the National Cancer Institute and head of its Laboratory of Cell Kinetics from which he published numerous papers on the growth and treatment of human cancers. In 1971, he edited the first of three textbooks on lung cancer which for many years were the standard texts. In 1973 he was recruited as Chief of Oncology and Associate Professor of Medicine at Boston University Medical Center where his clinical and research work focused primarily on breast and lung cancers. From 1978 to 1982 he was Professor of Medicine and Chief of Oncology at New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center where he continued his clinical and laboratory research work. In all, he published some 100 scientific papers in journals. From 1982 to 2008, he headed Access Medical Group, a multi-specialty group in the Hudson Valley, New York, which had 36 doctors, and headed the oncology program at a number of suburban hospitals in the area. In 1997 he founded a medical management company which managed 300 doctors in New York state. He is a fellow of the American College of Physicians. =Allegations in a medical controversy= In June 1978, two nurses and other researchers who worked with him at the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) alleged that Straus had ordered them to falsify patients' records, had failed (in violation of law) to get proper consent from patients, and had improperly administered drugs. According to one narrative, the allegations included changing a patient's birth date to make them eligible for inclusion in a study, reporting treatments and laboratory tests that had never been carried out, and Dr. Judith P. Swazey alleged the existence of a tumor in a patient who never had one but she left Boston University because she said school officials were reluctant to investigate the incident and even suggested that support for her department's work might be reduced. The work in question had been carried out as part of a collaborative study with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) within a project funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Boston University's (BU's) investigation showed that almost 15% of the results were flawed. ECOG erased from their records all data supplied by BUSM, and expelled that research unit from the study. Straus has denied personal involvement in wrongdoing asserting his innocence and maintains that he has been framed by disgruntled subordinates. Dr Straus said that he had settled with the Government, acknowledging in an agreement to ECOG that false reports were submitted, only after becoming convinced that this legal outcome was unavoidable since the Government's regulations impose these penalties on a principal investigator even when he did not know of any wrongdoing. On June 30, 1978, Straus resigned from his posts at Boston University Medical Center Hospital (since 1996 part of Boston Medical Center) and BUSM. He subsequently took up posts at the Westchester County Medical Center as Chief of Neoplastic Diseases and the New York Medical College as Professor of Medicine. = Fighting the allegations = On September 15, 1978, Straus requested that BUMC establish a peer review by experts in the area of cooperative cancer data, but BUMC declined. Straus at his request met with the Executive Committee of ECOG April 23, 1979 and requested a full peer review investigation of the records. ECOG rejected the request. In 1980, NCI awarded Straus a three-year grant of some $910,000 to conduct research into cancer. Hatch Senate Committee, Vincent T. DeVita Jr., Director of the NCI testified on June 2, 1981, \\"his agencies award last year of a $910,000 research grant to a scientist (Straus) ‚Ä¶on the ground that the charges ‚Ä¶had not yet been proven. In 1981, Straus filed a $33 million lawsuit today against five of his former co-workers, charging they had conspired to discredit his work. Straus spoke publicly for the first time before the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and strongly denied he had engaged in any wrongdoing. Straus alleged forgeries of his signature. Ruth Moran, Straus‚Äô lab chief from 1972 testified, \\"Having worked side by side with Dr. Straus for 8 years ... the allegations to be totally inconsistent with what I know his scientific standards to be... The (BUMC) committee refused to see me. Dr. Straus‚Äô chief data manager (Mary Jane Rimmer, R.N.) reported to me ... that she had always been instructed by Dr. Straus to record data accurately.\\" \\"Scientists Supporting the Rights of Marc J. Straus, M.D.\\" comprised 78 cancer doctors and researchers in 1981, chaired by Mendel Krim, M.D. and Ruth Moran, Ph.D. They petitioned DeVita, Director NCI and Arthur Hayes, Commissioner, FDA, for a unitary blue ribbon review with full disclosure of relevant documents. In 1982, two years after the grant was awarded the propriety of that award was called into question by two committees of the U.S. Congress: the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee (chaired by Representative Al Gore (D-Tennessee)), and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources (chaired by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)). The United States Department of Health and Human Services terminated the grant under Federal regulations passed in 1980, the first time that power had been used. It has been alleged that the committees did not review the records in question. In 1982 Straus obtained medical privileges at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains, NY. As a result of the preceding allegations the Board empaneled a review committee chaired by Terence W. Murphy, M.D., J.D. to make a recommendation regarding privileges. Strauss was appointed Chief of Oncology at Yonkers General Hospital and head of a 22 patient cancer unit. In 1985 he was appointed head of oncology at Putnam Hospital Center and head of a cancer unit. In October 1982, Straus published a paper in Cancer Treatment Reports, a journal funded by the National Cancer Institute. The propriety of that publication was questioned in the journal Science. Dr. Straus continued to publish scientific clinical studies through 1998. In June 2005 Dr. Straus was invited as a Visiting Lecturer at the National Institutes of Health. Business In 1982, Straus started CarePlus, a public company, a home nutrition companies in the United States. In 1983 he founded Medical Registry Services, a software company providing cancer registry software support for hospitals. In 2008 he and his son, Ari, founded MDINR, a software company which supported doctors treating patients with the anti-coagulant,Coumadin, also sold under the brand name Warfarin. It has been alleged that Nikita Khrushchev, Lavrenty Beria and others, engaged in a plot to use Warfarin to poison the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin. Warfarin is colorless and tasteless, and does often produce symptoms characteristic to those that Stalin is said to have exhibited prior to this death.

It is known from a single specimen that consists of a partial skull, ribs, partial pelvis, leg and other assorted skeletal elements.  Description  Restoration The holotype of Murusraptor is estimated to be , but is considered to be an immature specimen, as the cranial sutures in its braincase have not yet disappeared; this indicates it would have been potentially larger. Analysis of the skeleton further revealed anatomical features as-yet unseen in Megaraptora, particularly in the skull and hips. Analysis of the posterior of the skull indicates that, possibly like the related Megaraptor, Murusraptor likely had an elongated and narrow snout. The sacral ribs are hollow.New dinosaur species may give clues to evolutionary origin of megaraptorid clade ScienceDaily July 20, 2016 Coria & Currie established some distinguishing traits of Murusraptor. The front branch of the lacrimal is longer than the descending branch is high. In the lower jaw, the surangular shows a bone shelf at its outer side, under the groove between the front surangular opening and the notch for the upper rear branch of the dentary, contributing to the side joint. The sacral ribs are hollow and tube- like. The ischia are short, transversely flattened and vertically slightly widened. These last two traits are unequivocal autapomorphies, unique derived qualities, as they are unique within the entire Theropoda. Illustration and photos of the braincase; at E it is clearly visible that the left half is deformed Furthermore, a unique combination of traits is present that are in themselves not unique. In the braincase, the processus basipterygoidei are situated at the front underside of the basisphenoid while the entrance of the deep depression of the recessus basisphenoideus is directed obliquely upwards and to the rear. The basisphenoid shows a shallow wide notch between the tubera basilaria and the processus basipterygoidei. The chevron bones are rather straight. The braincase of Murusraptor shows more similarities to non- maniraptoran coelurosaurs, particularly tyrannosaurids, than to non- coelurosaurs such as allosaurids or ceratosaurids, although its Reptile Encephalization Quotient was nonetheless within the range of allosauroids such as Allosaurus, Giganotosaurus, and Sinraptor and its neurosensorial capabilities were thus most likely inferior to those of tyrannosaurids.  Discovery and naming  Location where the holotype was found and geological context In 2001, Sergio Saldivia, preparator at the Museo Carmen Funes, thirty kilometres northeast of Plaza Huincul in a canyon wall discovered the skeleton of a theropod dinosaur new to science. During that year and 2002 the remains were secured. In 2016, the type species Murusraptor barrosaensis was named and described by Rodolfo Anibal Coria and Philip John Currie. The generic name is a combination of the Latin murus, \\"wall\\", a reference to the canyon wall, and raptor, \\"seizer\\". The specific name refers to the provenance from the Sierra Barrosa Formation. The holotype, MCF-PVPH-411, was found in a layer of the Sierra Barrosa Formation dating from the Coniacian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull, of an immature individual. The skeletal elements recovered for this type specimen of Murusraptor include a partial skull consisting of a complete braincase with frontals and parietals, right lacrimal, prefrontal, postorbital, quadrate, pterygoid, epipterygoid and ectopterygoid, thirty-one teeth, the rear elements of the right lower jaw, twelve vertebrae from the back, sacrum and tail, eleven thoracic ribs, a single haemal arch or chevron bone, several gastralia, a third manual ungual, complete left ilium, part of a right ilium, proximal ends of both pubic bones, distal ends of the ischia, the right tibia, and a calcaneum.  Classification  Hind part of the lower jaw Murusraptor is a megaraptoran, one of a group of large predatory dinosaurs whose exact classification remains disputed. Once believed to be dromaeosaurids, they have since been classified as either allosauroid carnosaurs or as tyrannosauroid coelurosaurs. While the discovery of Murusraptor does not clarify as of yet the placement of this group of theropods, the specimen does add further clarity to some aspects of megaraptoran anatomy and potentially, eventual classification of the Megaraptora within the theropod evolutionary tree.  Paleobiology  = Pathologies = The type specimen of Murusraptor shows signs of severe infections around the left side of its braincase. Two tooth marks, likely inflicted by another theropod, are visible in front of and below the nuchal crest on the skull. Due to the infections, the entire left side of the occiput, the back of the head, was deformed. Some of the ribs were also infected. Whether or not this contributed to the theropod's death remains unknown.

He later seized control of Mecca in ca. 817, and was subsequently recognized as legal governor of the city by the caliph al-Ma'mun. Background An Alid by birth, Ibrahim was one of the eighteen or nineteen sons of the seventh Shi'ite imam Musa al-Kazim (d. 799), and a great- great-great-great-grandson of Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was a brother of the eighth imam Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (d. 818), who was briefly the designated heir of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833).; . Revolt in the Yemen Ibrahim became active as a rebel following the damaging civil war of 811‚Äì813 between the rival caliphs al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, which had greatly weakened the ability of the Abbasid government to maintain its authority in Baghdad and the provinces of the empire. While in Mecca in 815, he was appointed by Abu al-Saraya al-Sari ibn Mansur, who had launched a pro-Alid revolt in southern Iraq and seized the cities of al-Kufah, al-Basrah, Mecca, and Medina, to conquer the Yemen on his behalf, and he accordingly marched south toward the province with a large force. Upon learning of his advance, the governor of the Yemen, Ishaq ibn Musa ibn 'Isa al-Hashimi, decided against putting up any resistance and instead withdrew with his troops for the Hijaz, in effect surrendering the province to Ibrahim. The latter was consequently able to enter the Yemen without facing any significant resistance, and he proceeded to occupy Sana'a in September 815 and take control of the country.; ; ; ; . Ibrahim was able to maintain his hold over the Yemen for approximately a year, during which time he minted coins in his own name. His severe administration of the province, which was characterized by frequent killings, acts of enslavement, and confiscations of private property, soon caused him to develop a reputation for brutality, and he became known by the title of al-Jazzar (\\"the Butcher\\"). Especially harsh measures were taken on behalf of his tribal allies, who assisted him in his rule of the country, and at their request he arrested several chiefs of their rivals, killing several of them and forcing others into exile.; ; ; . After spending several months in the Yemen, Ibrahim attempted to assert his authority over Mecca as well, and dispatched an army to the city to lead the pilgrimage of 816 in the name of the Alids. Upon their arrival at Mecca, however, his forces were unable to enter the city due to the presence of Abbasid reinforcements, and instead took to conducting raiding activities in the neighboring area until they were defeated and dispersed. Soon afterwards, Ibrahim learned that another army under the command of Hamdawayh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan was marching toward the Yemen in order to reassert government control over the province, and he set out with his own men to halt Hamdawayh's advance. In the resulting engagement, Ibrahim was defeated and put to flight, and Hamdawayh was able to enter Sana'a and establish himself as governor, putting an end to Alid rule of the province.; ; ; ; . Seizure of Mecca Ibrahim's movements in the aftermath of his defeat against Hamdawayh are reported differently by various sources; al-Yaq'ubi states that he went straight to Mecca, while Yemeni writers claim that he remained in the province until 818, during which period he undertook punitive actions against a number of tribes that opposed him. It may have been around this time that he destroyed al-Khaniq, a sixth-century dam near Sa'dah built by a mawla of Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan, and devastated the old town of Sa'dah as well.; ; . At some point, however, he decided to depart from the Yemen and set out with his supporters, traveling north until he reached the outskirts of Mecca. In response to his approach, the officer in command of the city, Yazid ibn Muhammad al-Makhzumi, came out to face him, but the rebels defeated him in battle, killing him and routing his forces. With the defeat of Yazid, Ibrahim was free to enter Mecca and occupy it, and he established himself as master of the city and surrounding territory.; ; . Rapprochement with al-Ma'mun A change in Ibrahim's relationship with the Abbasid government occurred in 817, when the caliph al-Ma'mun decided to show favoritism to the Alids and designated Ibrahim's brother Ali ibn Musa al-Rida as his heir to the caliphate, while at the same time pardoning several Alids who had rebelled against him. Toward this end, the central government reconciled with Ibrahim, who was still in Mecca, and formally gave him control of the city by recognizing him as its governor. With his rule over Mecca now legitimized, Ibrahim implemented the caliph's pro-Alid policy in the city and rendered the oath of allegiance to Ali. A short time later he headed the pilgrimage of 818 and invoked his brother in the prayers as heir to al-Ma'mun, making him, according to al-Mas'udi, the first descendant of Abu Talib to lead the pilgrimage since the coming of Islam.; ; ; ; ; . , also states that Ibrahim's leadership of the pilgrimage was undertaken without caliphal authorization. In addition to receiving legal control over Mecca, Ibrahim was granted the governorship of the Yemen, which was still in the hands of Hamdawayh ibn Ali. When Hamdawayh refused to yield the province, however, Ibrahim decided to dislodge him by force and organized an expedition against him. He soon reached the Yemen in mid-818 and made his way toward Sana'a, but he was met by Hamdawayh and his forces as he approached the town. The battle that followed went badly for Ibrahim, whose army was routed by Hamdawayh's, and he was forced to retreat back to the Hijaz, abandoning his hopes to recover the province.; ; ; . , provides a different account of these events. Following his defeat in the Yemen, Ibrahim returned to Mecca, where he remained until 820. In that year he was dispatched to Baghdad by the military commander Isa ibn Yazid al-Juludi, and Ubaydallah ibn al-Hasan al-Talibi was appointed as governor of the city in his place.; ; .

Biography  Claude S√©rillon was a student at the school of Breil-Malville and then at Jules Verne high school ; he did his graduate studies in letters at the University of Nantes, obtaining a Bachelor's degree. While still a student, he started working in journalism in 1970 as a freelancer for the newspaper Presse-Oc√©an. His work for this newspaper started on the occasion of a trip to Norway where he proposed a story about the football club Str√∏msgodset IF, champions of Norway in 1970, that the FCN (FC Nantes) was scheduled to meet later in the European Cup.

He started editing again in July 1981, as editor of the society department, and he also started presenting Journal de 20 heures in summer 1982. In February 1984 he left Antenne 2 for TF1 where he presented their Journal de 20 heures. His work there then stalled against the tandem of rival TV presenter team Christine Ockrent / Bernard Rapp. Uncomfortable with the editing of TF1 and opposed to the style of the news show they put on the air in January 1985, which was dramatized and sensationalized, he remained nostalgic for channel A2 and eventually returned to his earlier employ in January 1986 to present the 20 hours alternating with Bernard Rapp He was dropped from the 20 heures news show in July 1987 for having \\"abused\\" the chief of police of Paris in the Malik Oussekine case.

She was the second woman to work for the British Foreign Office, and its first female diplomat. Early life She was born on 16 February 1924, the daughter of a metallurgist father who made his fortune in copper in Rhodesia. She grew up in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa. She attended Loreto Convent School, Pretoria until 1932. At age 10 she returned to Britain to be educated and did not see her mother again until her twenties. She attended Sheffield High School and then won a scholarship to Cheltenham Ladies College and went on to read French and German at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, graduating after only two years in 1944 with a First. Career In 1944, near the end of World War II, she was recruited by British naval intelligence and worked at Bletchley Park, in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals. After the war she was appointed as the UK's first woman diplomat. Her first posting was to Yugoslavia. On her marriage in 1949 she was required to leave the service and her pension was converted to a dowry under rules which the Foreign Office maintained until 1973. Mayhew created a crucial pathway for women by becoming ‚Äúthe kings first female emissary\\" in 1947. Mayhew came up against previous barriers during her time spent at Bletchley Park decoding crucial messages, encountering issues which women faced during the wartime, which were hard to overcome. One of the main issues Mayhew encountered was in regards to ‚Äúbeing paid significantly lower and being ranked beneath men,‚Äù who as Mayhew stated ‚Äúcould not boast a First from Oxford.‚Äù Personal life In 1949 she married Christopher Mayhew, the politician, broadcaster and writer, whom she met when they were both in the diplomatic service, and they had two sons and two daughters. He died in 1997. She spent her later years in a care home in Wimbledon, and died on 8 July 2016. Legacy In March 2019, the Mayhew Theatre at the Foreign Office's Diplomatic Academy was opened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. The theatre was named after Mayhew following a vote amongst Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff in which she was the runaway winner.

She was one of the first women psychiatrists commissioned in the Navy, and she was one of seven female Navy psychiatrists who served during World War II. Early years and education Ozarin was born in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, on August 18, 1914, the youngest of four children.Lo Chin, Eliza. \\"AMWA's Oldest Member Dr. Lucy Ozarin\\".

Her parents were Russian immigrants who had met and married in the United States. When she was seven years old, her family moved to Inwood on Long Island, New York. Her family was the only Jewish family in the town. While attending school, she and her siblings all worked at their father's general store in Inwood. She excelled throughout school, graduating from Lawrence High School at the age of sixteen.Sobocinski, Andr√© Baden. \\"Commander, Medical Corps, U.S. Navy Reserve) Oral History Interview\\". Office of Medical History. Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. United States Navy. September 4, 2012. Ozarin attended New York University, just as each of her siblings had. During her first year of college, Ozarin played for the school's women's varsity basketball team and worked as an umbrella salesperson at Macy's on Saturdays.\\"N.Y.U. Dates Are Listed: Girls' Basketball Team to Play Nine Games This Season\\". The New York Times. January 11, 1932. p. 30. She was a member of the Lambda Gamma Phi sorority and Aesclepiad, a woman's pre-medical honor society.\\"Honored at N.Y.U.\\" Times Union (Brooklyn, New York). November 10, 1931. p. 4. After three years at New York University, Ozarin entered medical school at New York Medical College's campus in Valhalla. Ozarin was one of six women enrolled in a class of one-hundred. Ozarin earned a doctor of medicine degree in 1937. Civilian career Ozarin worked as a resident at Harlem Hospital in pediatrics for two years. During five months of that time, Ozarin worked on an ambulance, which she found exciting. Given the choice between treating patients with tuberculosis or mental illness, Ozarin chose the latter because it was not a communicable disease. Ozarin then worked as a resident at Westchester County Hospital's small psychiatric unit. Seven months into the position, her father suffered a stroke, and she decided to move near Buffalo, New York, where he was living at the time. Ozarin worked at the Gowanda State Hospital for three years. Ozarin began in the acute ward and then later transferred to the chronic ward. Ozarin had five-hundred patients under her care. Finding that the hospital's chronic psychiatric patients were being kept in very poor conditions, Ozarin tried to improve their conditions while she was there. Military career When the United States entered World War II, the hospital's male psychiatrists left, and Ozarin found herself the only physician for a thousand patients, most of whom had schizophrenia. Ozarin felt it was impossible to perform her job well when she was spread so thin. Legislation established Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service as a branch of the United States Naval Reserve in 1942. Inspired in part by her brother's decision to join the military as an engineer in 1942, Ozarin decided she join as well. The hospital's superintendent would not approve Ozarin's request for leave, so Ozarin resigned her position instead. Ozarin temporarily worked as Assistant to the Superintendent at New York's Metropolitan Hospital for six months until she was sworn into the Navy. The Navy's commissioning document was intended to be used for a man, and the form referred to Ozarin using male pronouns. Ozarin's title was Assistant Surgeon, Lieutenant Junior Grade. Ozarin was one of the first seven female psychiatrists with commissioned officer status in the United States Navy. Without undergoing any military training at all, Ozarin was immediately assigned to Bethesda, Maryland, in October 1943, reporting to Captain Forrest Martin Harrison. Ozarin spent four months working in a military hospital until she received orders to report to Camp Lejeune. At the time, there were 33,000 men and 3,000 women stationed at Camp Lejeune. It had two female physicians who were both assigned to the dependents clinic located outside the base. The commander of the hospital gave Ozarin the impression that he respected neither women nor the field of psychiatry. Ozarin was told to do physical examinations on applicants for employment at the hospital, which Ozarin found to be waste of her skills, particularly when doctors with just ninety days of psychiatric training were treating psychiatry patients. After a few weeks, a colleague in Bethesda helped Ozarin secure a transfer to the WAVES training station at Hunter College in New York City. Ozarin was one of three woman physicians at Hunter College. Ozarin conducted psychiatric examinations of the women entering WAVES and SPARS. In February 1945, Ozarin was given orders to return to Bethesda to treat WAVES who were suffering from anxiety and other issues. When she was not seeing patients, Ozarin studied at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. At the end of World War II, Ozarin thought the Navy would soon no longer require her service, and she began to look elsewhere. She applied for a child psychiatry fellowship, but she was not accepted. She passed the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in Psychiatry later that year in order to increase her worth on the job market. Post-military career Following the end of World War II, the Navy began discharging its physicians in 1946. Ozarin returned to New York state to live with her parents, while remaining in the Naval Reserves. Looking for work, she networked with a fellow Navy orientee Mike Spotswood who recommended she apply to work at the Veterans Administration. It took brief interviews with Dr. Harvey Thompkins and Dr. Daniel Blain to secure a position as Assistant Chief of Hospital Psychiatry. Within a year, Ozarin was promoted to Chief of Hospital Psychiatry. While working at the Veterans Administration, Ozarin asked Thompkins why so many patients were in the hospital for ten years, and Thompkins responded with an assignment. Ozarin visited all of the Veterans Administration's mental hospitals and about seventy of its general hospitals to investigate the backlog for mental health services and monitor the care provided to patients with mental illness. Ozarin wrote an article for Reader's Digest about chronic psychiatric patients who never received visitors, but the Veterans Administration would not allow its publication. Reader's Digest paid $200 to Ozarin for the article, which she then donated to a patients' fund at Tuskagee Hospital, a greatly underfunded hospital. In the early 1950s, Ozarin traveled to Bethel, Maine, for the National Training Laboratories' two-week T-group training, led by sociologists. When Ozarin returned, she set up T-groups and other new programs for the psychiatric patients at the Veterans Administration's hospitals. Ozarin also started a training institute at Coatsville VA Medical Hospital where the Veterans Administration's clinical directors would discuss advances in psychiatry. Ozarin decided to give up her military commission and the Navy Reserves in 1957. She joined the United States Public Health Service the same year. For three years, Ozarin worked as the medical officer of its regional office in Kansas City, where she stimulated mental health activities and made sure funding was spent in accordance with rules and regulations. Ozarin advocated for treating psychiatric patients for their illnesses, and preserving the patients' freedom, dignity, and equality as psychiatric necessities as part of the treatment.Smith, Delos (June 19, 1958). \\"Nation's Program for Mental Treatment Has Some Defects\\". United Press International. Simpson's Leader-Times (Kittanning, Pennsylvania). p. 7. Ozarin attended the Harvard University School of Public Health, earning a Masters in Public Health in 1961. She returned to the Kansas City regional office after graduation. When President of the United States John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, the National Institute of Mental Health chose Ozarin as one of five people to write the regulations and establish community mental health centers across the country. In order to determine what form a community mental health center should have, Ozarin traveled around the country, evaluating psychiatric services provided by medical facilities to determine what was effective. After writing the regulations, Ozarin evaluated and approved applications for grants to replace long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less-isolated community mental health centers for people with a mental illness or a developmental disability. Ozarin said the costs of building of local psychiatric treatment centers was costly \\"just as all medical care is costly\\" but she asked \\"What is the alternative? It is also costly for families to be disrupted and for people to be disabled for long periods of time.\\"\\"Tells Rock County's Potential for Treating Mental Disorders\\". Janesville Daily Gazette (Janesville, Wisconsin). February 1, 1967. p. 2. Ozarin was a proponent of the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients, and she advocated for the eliminating the [Mental disorder#Stigmasocial stigma of psychiatric treatment].Saul, Scotty (February 16, 1964). \\"She Bears Hope to Mentally Ill\\", The Palm Beach Post (West Palm Beach, Florida). Ozarin returned to the National Institute of Mental Health, where she developed new programs to help people with mental illness. Ozarin helped bring psychiatrists and social workers to medical facilities in rural areas, making it easier for people with mental illnesses living in rural areas to receive treatment. Around 1972, Ozarin was based in Copenhagen, Denmark, researching treatment programs for drug and alcohol addiction in nine European countriesAustria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, West Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. for the World Health Organization. As part of her research, Ozarin met with officials at each country's Ministry of Health and visited each country's mental health facilities. After writing a report about each country's mental health services, Ozarin convened a meeting on improving alcohol and drug programs that was attended by people from 21 countries. In the early 1980s, the World Health Organization selected Ozarin to serve as its drug-abuse officer, based in Copenhagen, for nine months. Ozarin worked until her retirement in 1983. Retirement Beginning in the mid-1980s and continuing for about 25 years, Ozarin began volunteering for the American Psychiatric Association. Ozarin went over every single book in the American Psychiatric Association's Melvin Sabshin Library and Archives and made sure they were all entered into its online catalog. Ozarin volunteered for the National Library of Medicine in the History of Medicine Division from 2004 to 2013.Conuel, Thomas. \\"Dr. Lucy Ozarin, NLM Volunteer Extraordinaire!\\". NLM in Focus. August 24, 2012.\\"A Remarkable Career in Psychiatry\\". Circulating Now. United States National Library of Medicine. August 18, 2014. During the Civil War, the Surgeon General John Shaw Billings had collected every medical book published in the country and every publication about public health and state medicine. Ozarin took it upon herself to catalog them, about twenty- to thirty-thousand documents and publications so that medical researchers would be able to find and learn from them. During this project, Ozarin learned a great deal about the history of medicine in the United States. Ozarin sorted and cataloged hundreds of medical dissertations from the 18th century. It was during this project that Ozarin discovered the medical dissertation of Benjamin Rush, one of the founders of American psychiatry and a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Ozarin wrote most of the text and selected images for the National Library of Medicine's web site, Diseases of the Mind: Highlights of American Psychiatry to 1900.\\"Diseases of the Mind: Highlights of American Psychiatry to 1900\\". United States National Library of Medicine. Retrieved July 22, 2016. She sorted through its collection of 20,000 items as part of her research. For her work, Ozarin received a Director's Honor Award in 2008. She also received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association in 2007.Vergare, Michael J. (February 2007). \\"The Council on Member and District Branch Relations\\". The American Journal of Psychiatry. 164 (2). p. 364. During her late nineties, Ozarin wrote over fifty biographies of notable psychiatrists on Wikipedia. For twenty years, Ozarin spent Saturday afternoons volunteering at the kitchen of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, after the end of her synagogue's Shabbat services. Ozarin was an active member of the senior citizen's group at her synagogue. She represented her apartment house at the National Institutes of Health Community Council in order to stay connected to the National Institutes of Health and to maintain access to its campus and facilities. Ozarin read medical journals every week, something she started doing in medical school. Ozarin considered physical activity, a good diet, and a modicum of religion and faith to be her key to a long life. Looking back, Ozarin was grateful for the opportunities she had, as well as for her courage, intelligence, and creativity that led her to take advantage of opportunities when she saw them. Asked during an interview what message she wanted to leave to young people for their future, Ozarin said, \\"Take advantage of your advantages. Be willing to take risks. ... If you have a question, and you know who to go to, don't call them up, go to see them because you never know what else you're going to learn. ... Look for openings. Look for places where you can go. And dream.\\"p. 45 Ozarin died in September 2017, at the age of 103.\\"In Memoriam ‚Äì Dr. Lucy Ozarin\\". American Medical Women's Association. September 26, 2017. Retrieved September 28, 2017.

Early life and business career Corliss was born on October 21, 1910 in Gloucester. She graduated from Simmons College. Professionally, she worked as an accountant for Birds Eye before becoming the assistant treasurer of Consolidated Lobster. She also aided her husband's business by picking strawberries and raspberries. Political career Corliss political involvement began as a member of the Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs of Gloucester, an organization whose activities included supporting candidates for appointed office. In 1951, Corliss attempted her first run for office as a candidate for Gloucester school committee. She was successful and was reelected in 1953. In 1955, she was the highest vote-getter in the city council election and was elected mayor by her fellow councilors; at the time, Gloucester employed a \\"weak mayor\\" form of government, and full time administration of the city departments was in the hands of an appointed city manager. She was reelected to the city council in 1957 and was once again chosen to serve as Mayor. In 1960, Corliss was a candidate for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the 2nd Essex District after incumbent Barclay H. Warburton III chose to retire.

Its principal geographic features are the Osmore Pond, and Owl's Head Mountain, at its highest peak. It encompasses nearly , extending eastward to Peacham Pond and Martins Pond in central Peacham, and south to Jannison Mountain and Deer Mountain. with The park has a campsite divided into two areas, with 46 tent/RV sites and 15 lean-to sites. Seven sites are specifically designed to accommodate horse campers. Restrooms include hot showers. There are picnic areas at Lake Osmore and on Owl's Head Mountain, which has a CCC-built access road to the summit area. Facilities in these areas include a play area, horseshoe pits, picnic pavilions, and access to miles of hiking trails. There are remotely placed leanto campsites around Lake Osmore, which are accessible either by boat or by a trail that circles the lake. The park is open seasonally between Memorial Day weekend and Columbus Day weekend; admission is charged for day use, and there are charges for camping. History The state began acquiring land for the creation of Groton State Forest in the 1910s, but much of it was occupied by leaseholders. It was not until the 1920s that most of the leases were closed out, and the state did not have the funds to develop the forest for recreation, although it made plans for such facilities. When the Civilian Conservation Corps was established by the federal government in the 1930s, the state used its crews and funding to develop this state park and others. The CCC crews that worked on the various state parks (now numbering seven) in Groton State Forest were based at a camp whose foundational remnants remain in this park. These crews built out the road network serving the campground and the picnic areas at Lake Osmore and Owl's Head, although the latter two were at first separately administered. They built a small campground (now eight sites within Area B of the present campground), and the picnic facilities at Lake Osmore and Owl's Head, as well as the small stone observation tower on Owl's Head. They were also responsible for cutting much of the early trail network through the northern part of the forest, and building part of the maintenance facilities used by the state forest today. Because of the state of preservation of these areas, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

It measures the extent to which citizens of the nations of the Arab League are able to make their own economic decisions without limitations imposed by the government or by crony elites. The report provides sound empirical measurement of economic policy that can distinguish between phony reform that leaves economic and political power in the hands of crony elites, and real reform that creates new prosperity, entrepreneurship, and jobs, by opening business and work opportunities for everyone no matter whom they know. Arab and Islamic societies have a rich trading tradition that celebrates markets open even to the humblest members of society. Economic freedom is consistent with that proud history and provides a path to a more prosperous and freer tomorrow.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Lockwood- Boynton House stands in North Springfield village, at the northwest corner of School and Main Streets. Its main block is roughly square, and covered by a hip roof with two interior chimneys. Three of its four walls are brick; that on the west is clapboarded, as is the wood-frame addition extending to the north. The main block has front facades facing both streets, each with five symmetrical bays. The ground floor windows and central doorways are set in slightly recessed round-arch panels, giving the house an arcaded appearance. The interior follows a central hall plan, and includes a full-width ballroom with coved plaster ceiling on the second floor. with The oldest brick portion of the house was built about 1800, and was the village's first tavern, located just north of the village green. It was a success as a center of social life in the village, and was enlarged in 1813 by Benoni Lockwood, owner of the area's first brickyard. Lockwood is credited with giving the house its present high-quality Federal period elements, although he was also responsible for subdividing the ballroom into bedrooms. In the 1870s, the house was owned by Durant Boynton, who owned a local sawmill, and served in both local and state government. In the 1970s the house was adapted for use as an elder care facility; alterations for later uses have generally preserved the building's historic fabric.

Activities includes camping, motor boating, waterskiing, fishing, swimming, paddling, horseback riding, hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. The park is open between the Memorial Day and Columbus Day weekends; fees are charged for day use and camping. Features Ricker Pond State Park is located near the geographic center of the town of Groton, on the east side of Groton State Forest, the state's second largest state forest. Ricker Pond is a roughly teardrop-shaped body of water with its outlet at the southeastern end. Vermont Route 232 runs roughly westward past the southeastern end, creating a triangular wedge of land between it and the southern shore of the pond. The park facilities are located in that area. The park entrance is at the western end of the park, with stone-posted gate and gatehouse, and CCC-built rangers' quarters nearby. Gravel roads provide access to three separate areas of the waterfront. Section A, the westernmost, has a loop of leanto camp sites and a boat launch. Section B is a tent camping area, and includes a 1938 CCC-built picnic pavilion and a sandy beach area. Section C, at the eastern end of the park, provides tent and trailer camping, and includes a small cabin that is available for rent. with In addition to the water-based facilities, the park provides access to the trail networks of the surrounding state forest. The Montpelier-Wells River Rail Trail (Cross Vermont Trail) runs through the middle of the park. History The outlet of Ricker Pond was the site of one of the first industrial sites in Groton, when Edmund Morse, one of the town's first settlers, built a sawmill and gristmill there in 1783. He sold the mills to Amaziah Ricker in 1827, and they remained in operation by the Ricker family until 1963. Construction of the railroad through the valley in the mid-19th century helped draw tourists to the area's scenic beauty. The state began purchasing land around Ricker Pond in 1919. The park was formally opened in 1933, its early facilities developed by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Depression-era jobs program. Surviving elements built by the CCC include the basic road network, the central picnic pavilion and beach, the ranger quarters, and a number of surviving stone fireplaces. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 in recognition of the historical significance of these elements.

According to demand-side economics, output is determined by effective demand. High consumer spending leads to business expansion, resulting in greater employment opportunities. Higher levels of employment create a multiplier effect that further stimulates aggregate demand, leading to greater economic growth. Proponents of demand-side economics argue that tax breaks for the wealthy produce little, if any, economic benefit because most of the additional money is not spent on goods or services but is reinvested in an economy with low demand (which makes speculative bubbles likely). Instead, they argue increased governmental spending will help to grow the economy by spurring additional employment opportunities. They cite the lessons of the Great Depression of the 1930s as evidence that increased governmental spending spurs growth. Demand side economics traces its origins to British economist John Maynard Keynes. He was able to show there is no automatic stabilizing mechanism built into an economy and that as a result state intervention is necessary to maintain output.

Barna was Minhaj Muhammad Khan's poetic name, also called takhallus in Urdu language. He was best known for his inspiring leadership and unrelenting struggle for press freedom during the rules of military dictatorships in Pakistan. From 1977 to 1988, during General Zia Ul-Haq's oppressive military regime, a popular slogan or battle cry was coined by the protesters just for Minhaj Barna \\"terey saath jeena, terey saath marna - Minhaj Barna, Minhaj Barna\\" (we will live or die with Minhaj Barna). Pakistani media described Barna as an \\"icon of struggle.\\" Abid Hassan Minto, a well-known progressive politician and constitutional expert said that Barna was considered a \\"sincere person and a conscientious, principled journalist,\\" who not only fought for the journalists but also fought for the rights of other press employees. Minhaj Barna was the elder brother of Meraj Muhammad Khan, a well-known left-wing politician. Minhaj Barna received the award Tamgha-i-Imtiaz by the Government of Pakistan for his contributions to journalism in 2015. Early life and career Minhaj Barna was born in 1923 in a conservative Rohilkhand Pathan family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, British India. His family came from Qaimganj in the Farrukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh. India. Barna obtained his primary education in Ahmadabad, later he moved to Bombay and worked as a teacher. After that, he went to Delhi, where he joined the Jamia Millia University and received his graduation degree from there. He also became the member of the Communist Party of India (CPI) to fight against the British rule of India. Minhaj Barna migrated with his family to Pakistan in 1949, where he joined several newspapers such as the Daily Imroze, the Pakistan Times and The Muslim. He also worked for the Associated Press of Pakistan news agency as its correspondent in London, England. It was his last assignment as a journalist. His major roles were as secretary-general and president of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ). He was first elected for these positions in 1969. He was also the founder-president of All-Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation (APNEC) that includes the union of journalists and combined unions of newspaper organisations. Minhaj Barna played a key role in a historic nationwide labor strike that lasted for 10 days in 1970. As a result, an act for protection of rights of journalists was made part of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan. Minhaj Barna's health suffered a harmful blow when he, as a trade union leader, went on the longest hunger strike that any political party leader or group had ever observed. Death and legacy Minhaj Barna died at a private hospital in Islamabad on 15 January 2011. He was suffering from duodenum ulcer in his stomach for a long time and had undergone surgery. After the surgery, he was struggling for his life. He was buried at the Racecourse Graveyard in Rawalpindi. Pakistan. Among his survivors are his daughter, Afshan Sardar, and his younger brother Meraj Muhammad Khan.

The Time Out award was attributed partly to the restaurant's bargain prices, which increased significantly as its popularity grew. Bocca di Lupo serves cuisine from a variety of Italian regions, with each dish's origin labelled on the menu. Founding Jacob Kenedy, chef-owner of Bocca Di Lupo, in front of Haidee Becker's paintings of fish and shellfish The restaurant was started by chef Jacob Kenedy and his business partner Victor Hugo in 2008, with funding and advice from Kenedy's entrepreneur uncle David Cleevely. Kenedy, who attended the University of Cambridge, and Hugo had both worked at Moro restaurant in London's Exmouth Market before starting Bocca di Lupo. The restaurant was so successful that it was described as \\"profitable within weeks\\" despite, or because of, opening at \\"the height of the credit crunch\\". Bocca di Lupo means \\"the mouth of the wolf\\"; in Italian the phrase is used to refer to either a trou de loup (a defensive obstacle), a type of pastry, or a basement ventilation opening. The restaurant owners use it to refer to the related Italian saying in bocca al lupo, a traditional Italian equivalent of the English saying \\"break a leg\\"; Bocca di Lupo's website is also headed by the English motto \\"For when you're hungry like the wolf\\". Critical reception The Time Out award was attributed to the restaurant's strong menu, good food and good value for money. Time Out's food and drink editor Guy Dimond said that previous winners of the listing missed out in 2009 because that year's awards focused more on affordable eating experiences, which favoured Bocca di Lupo. The menu's listing of regions of origin for each dish drew appreciation from one critic for the level of detail, but was seen by another as revealing a lack of authentic Italian devotion to a single region. The same critic also derided etched panels with Italian wording that \\"like a Peckham greengrocer, boast a rogue apostrophe\\". In 2012 the menu was described as \\"changing daily\\". Noted were the pork and foie gras sausages, and sanguinaccio dolce, a dessert of chocolate pudding flavoured with pig's blood. Bocca di Lupo's early critical popularity, which also included winning a Michelin Guide \\"Bib Gourmand\\" award,[2] was described by some critics as having negatively impacted the experience, with tables very hard to book and prices increasing from the bargain levels that had contributed to the initial success ‚Äì in 2010 it was described by The Observer as \\"not cheap, but worth every penny.\\" The restaurant went on to win the \\"Best Wine List\\" award in Tatler magazine's 2013 restaurant awards.[1]  Site and layout  Diners can sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work. Cleevely had purchased the freehold on the small site for about two and a half million pounds, taking the view that if a prime site was required, the huge risks of founding a new restaurant meant that it was better to own the property asset outright rather than enter into an expensive and difficult-to-end lease. The restaurant has a long Carrara marble bar for lighter meals, overlooking an open-plan kitchen, with the windowless main dining room at the back as well as a separate room that can be booked for private functions. It is decorated with large still- life paintings by Kenedy's mother, artist Haide Becker. Bocca di Lupo has been described as \\"small and slightly chaotic\\", with only fourteen tables. Supplier relations In 2013 Kenedy publicly smashed five bottles of red wine from one of his suppliers, Italian fine wine merchant Fulvio Bressan, on the street in front of the restaurant, in protest at a Facebook post by Bressan which used the racist epithet sporca scimmia nera about Italy's recently appointed minister for integration C√©cile Kyenge. Kenedy described Bressan as \\"not only a racist\\" but \\"also a spineless one\\" after Bressan deleted the post to minimise its impact. Bocca di Lupo no longer stocks wine from Bressan. Related ventures = Gelupo = Jacob Kenedy opened an ice- cream parlour called Gelupo in 2010 opposite the restaurant on Archer Street. The gelateria has appeared on 'best ice creams in London' lists, including Time Out and the Evening Standard. The blood orange granita was cited as one of the top dishes in London in 2012 and they regularly produce unusual flavours such as the Coronation Chicken gelato for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Prior to opening Gelupo, Jacob Kenedy learnt gelato-making at Gelatauro in Bologna. Gelupo Gelateria was the team's second venture, opposite their first. = VICO = In September 2015 the team behind Bocca Di Lupo opened an Italian street food counter-service restaurant called VICO on Cambridge Circus. The concept changed in December 2015 into a Southern Italian table-service restaurant, which subsequently won a Bib Gourmand in the Michelin Guide.

Organizations often adopt these technologies to prevent employees from using consumer-based file sharing apps to store, access and manage corporate data that is outside of the IT department‚Äôs control and visibility. Key characteristics EFSS applications are often characterized by having most or all of the following features and capabilities: * Sync files stored in corporate storage to user desktops and devices * Send links to large files with support for multiple file extensions and protocols * Integration to existing business applications via APIs, plugins and mobile apps * Built-in file creation, editing and previewing * User access permissions to files and folders * Protection of files stored and transferred by encryption, antivirus scanning, and DLP (data loss prevention) * Publish links to files with the ability to set a login requirement to access data * Authentication options for Active Directory, SAML, Azure Active Directory, etc. * Schedule and automate file transfers from automated systems and repositoriesSchedule transfer, move or backup data from one cloud storage to another. * Audit and report file activities and system actions Depending on what an EFSS provider offers, services can be deployed using cloud computing, on-premises, or hybrid. According to Forrester Research, some EFSS providers can provide the ability to lockdown data in certain geographies for companies that have requirements to store content/metadata in specific jurisdictions. History Box, one of the first EFSS products, was originally developed as a college project of Aaron Levie while he was a student of the University of Southern California in 2004. Levie left school to run the company full-time in 2005. In 2007 Dropbox was founded, and officially launched at 2008's TechCrunch Disrupt conference. The same year, Microsoft began beta testing of Windows Live Folders, a predecessor of OneDrive. Windows Live Folders Around 2010, the EFSS market emerged with over 100 vendors from a variety technology backgrounds including backup and cloud storage (Citrix ShareFile, Syncplicity), managed file transfer (Accellion, Biscom, Box, Hightail, Thru), enterprise content management and more. Many were developed as alternatives to consumer file sync and sharing services that did not have security features in place to protect company information nor the flexibility to integrate with existing content repositories and business applications. In October 2011, software company, Citrix Systems, announced that it had acquired private enterprise file sync and share service, ShareFile, to add to the Citrix product line. ShareFile was a competitor of Box and Dropbox but focused on selling its product to IT departments of large organizations. In 2012, CTERA Networks entered the EFSS market. In July 2013, Forrester Research released the first ‚ÄúForrester Wave‚Äù report on the EFSS market where they identified and scored products from the most significant providers. On June 25, 2014, Google announced at its I/O Conference that it was entering the enterprise file sharing market with the release of ‚ÄúGoogle Drive for Work.‚Äù In July 2014, Gartner Research released its first ‚ÄúMagic Quadrant‚Äù report on the EFSS market. The study evaluates the strengths and cautions of the most notable vendors in the industry. In October, 2014, encrypted vendor Tresorit entered the EFSS market with Tresorit for Business. Tresorit is a competitor of Dropbox and Box, promising businesses more security and privacy compliance with End-to-end encryption. In April 2015, BlackBerry Limited paid between $100 million and $150 million to buy WatchDox Ltd. for its enterprise file sync and sharing capabilities. In July 2015, one EFSS vendor, Syncplicity, was sold to private equity firm, Skyview Capital, by previous owner, EMC Corporation.

By the early 1960s, Nolan was back in Dublin drawing cartoons for Dublin Opinion and other publications, while his art gradually transitioned from watercolours and oil landscapes to abstract art and sculpture. His first solo show was at the Dublin Painters Gallery in 1963, and he was an active member in the establishment of the Project Arts Centre in Abbey Street in 1966‚Äì67.Obituary: Evin Nolan: distinguished painter and sculptor The Irish Times, 05 August 2016 Over the decades Nolan continued to exhibit at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, as well as taking part in the annual RHA exhibitions and at the Oireachtas festivals.

It is of real space and colour, as opposed to illusory space.\\" Critic Cyril Barrett noted: \\"Since the mid-1980s he has used strips of coloured paper for his reliefs. These reliefs are very varied and, with the play of light and shadow, that comes from the strip in relief, achieve a far greater richness and nuance of colour than colours on a plane surface.\\" Nolan had a lifelong passion for physics and astronomy; two of his uncles, JJ Nolan and PJ Nolan, were prominent physicists. He also wrote an unpublished humorous play, in which Eratosthenes' ancient Greek quest to calculate the circumference of the Earth is placed in a Dublin context.

Biography Octavian Blewitt was the son of John Edwards Blewitt, a merchant, and Caroline, daughter of Peter Symons, sometime mayor of Plymouth. He was born on 3 October 1810 in St. Helen's Place, Bishopsgate, London. Much of his early life was spent at Marazion House, in Cornwall, the residence of his great-uncle, Hannibal Curnow Blewitt; and he received his education at Plymouth grammar school. Entering the medical profession, he served the usual five years' apprenticeship, partly to his uncle, Mr. Dryden, assistant-surgeon of Devonport dockyard, and partly to Mr. Pollard of Torquay. In December 1833 he came to London, where he continued his medical studies in the infirmary of St. George's Hanover Square, and spent much of his time in the house of Sir James Clark, acting as tutor in classics to Clark's son and assisting him in preparing for the press his work on Phthisis (Tuberculosis). Afterwards he visited the island of Madeira with a patient, remained at Funchal for eight months, and subsequently travelled much in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1839. In March of the same year he was elected secretary of the Royal Literary Fund (RLF), which office he continued to hold till his death. During his 25-year secretaryship the institution greatly extended the sphere of its operations. Blewitt spent many years in arranging the archives of the association; and these documents, when classified, were stitched into covers and are now preserved in 130 folio boxes. Alexis Weedon, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography of Blewitt, notes his 'staunch Anglicanism' and 'stern moral attitude' to petitioners for RLF funds; and states that Blewitt stood in opposition to proposals for the reform of the society made by Charles Dickens and Charles Wentworth Dilke in the 1852-8 period. In 1872 Leopold II, King of the Belgians, presided at the annual banquet of the Literary Fund, and testified his sense of the secretary's services by creating him a knight of the order of Leopold. In 1846 he married, in London, Anne Roper Howard (b. 1811), the widow of Edward Howard and daughter of David Edward Williams. He died in London in November 1884. and was buried at Paddington Cemetery. After his death, Anne published The Rose and The Lily, How They Became the Emblems of England and France. A Fairy Tale in 1876 as Mrs. Octavian Blewitt. Works He was the author of: #A Panorama of Torquay Torquay, 1830, 12mo, which was so successful that the impression was speedily exhausted, and a second and enlarged edition, A Descriptive and Historical Sketch of the District between the Dart and Teign was published at London in 1833, 8vo. #Treatise on the Happiness arising from the Exercise of the Christian Faith. # The preface to Glynn's Autograph Portfolio. #Handbook for Travellers in Central Italy, including the Papal States, Rome, and the Cities of Etruria, London, 1843, 12mo (anon.); 2nd edition (with the author's name), 1850.

This may have been their family home, in which their father Joseph died two years earlier. In February 1884 the McMinn sisters moved their school to another property on nearby Buxton Street, which they dubbed \\"Tormore\\" for their birthplace in Ireland. :Residents of Tormore, Ireland included one Mary Rutherdale (c. 1764 ‚Äì 3 January 1849) - from Parish Headstones Donaghmore, Down, Ireland \\"Here lie the remains of Robert McMinn, of Tormore, who departed this life the 12th October, 1808, aged 70 years.

The school moved to new premises at 211 Childers Street in January 1899, with a house for boarders alongside. In 1907 Caroline Jacob took over the Unley Park Grammar School and ran the two institutions concurrently. Around this time substantial improvements were made: separate facilities for the younger (8‚Äì12 y.o.) students and additional premises for boarders, art studies and a kindergarten. Caroline Jacob's father financed the construction of a gymnasium, which also served as a large meeting-hall.

An expert on ancient Greek painted pottery, she coauthored the definitive study of Archaic and Classical household pottery. Biography Lucy Talcott was born in 1899 in Connecticut and educated at Radcliffe College, getting her B.A. in 1921. She did her graduate work at Columbia University, from which she received an M.A. She went on to study at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece. Talcott began her field work in archaeology in 1930 when she took part in excavations at the ancient Greek city of Corinth. She found that curatorial work was more to her taste than field work, however, and the following year she was made recording secretary of excavations in the Athenian Agora, a position she held for the remainder of the decade. In this capacity, she designed a system for organizing, recording, storing, and cross-referencing the many thousands of objects recovered from the Agora. Her system came to be considered critical to the final success of the project and a model for other excavations. She published her system in Archaeology magazine. One of her assistants during the 1930s was archaeologist Alison Frantz, then just beginning her career. After a hiatus caused by World War II, Talcott returned to the Athenian Agora excavations in 1947 and stayed for a further 11 years. During this phase, she also managed the local museum. Talcott became an expert in ancient Greek painted pottery and published her research in the journal Hesperia. With fellow archaeologist Brian A. Sparkes, she wrote the two-volume study Black and Plain Pottery of the 6th, 5th, and 4th Centuries B.C. (1970), which is considered the definitive reference on household pottery of the Archaic and Classical periods. She and Sparkes also co-wrote a popular book, Pots and Pans of Classical Athens (1958). For her work on the Athenian excavations, Talcott was decorated by King Paul in 1956. Talcott died of cancer in 1970 in Princeton, New Jersey.

History After the conclusion of the Civil War, a number of organizations were founded by veterans of the Union armed forces to commemorate the service and sacrifice of those who had served the Union cause during the war. The most prominent of these organizations were the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) and the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). Several other organizations were also founded to commemorate specific organizations such as the Society of the Army of the Cumberland and the Society of the Army of Tennessee. In 1869, the Society of the Army of the Potomac was founded and Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan was elected as its first president. A total of 12 vice presidents were also elected, representing 10 corps which served with the army as well as the artillery and the general staff. As the Society did not provide for hereditary membership, the Society gradually diminished as the veterans of the Civil War died off during the early twentieth century. By 1906, the Society had diminished to only 350 members. It held its last annual reunion in 1927. Insignia The Society had an elaborate insignia, made of gold, which was manufactured by Bailey, Banks and Biddle jewelers of Philadelphia. The insignia has a top piece of crossed cavalry sabres, a blue and white ribbon, a pair of crossed cannons below the ribbon and a planchet in the form of a six armed cross enameled in red with the badges of six of the corps assigned to the army.

It focuses on the preparations for the wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. Doherty and Iswarienko developed the show as a way to document the stress on a couple while planning their wedding. Filmed in Malibu, California over a seven-week period, Shannen Says was produced by RelativityREAL and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. To prepare for filming, Doherty watched reality shows by Tori Spelling and Kim Kardashian. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video under the title Shannen Says, Season 1, but it was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray. Shannen Says had low ratings, ranking below most other programs on its broadcast night. However, the series was popular among women between the ages of 25 and 54. Doherty said that it was intended as a one-off, with no plans for a second season. Reviews for Shannen Says and Doherty were mixed. Some critics likened her to other actresses who starred in reality television.  Production  =Concept and development= alt=A woman with shoulder-length black hair wearing a black dress with a plunging neckline speaks to a reporter. Shannen Says tracks the events leading up to Shannen Doherty's wedding to Kurt Iswarienko. It was Doherty's third wedding since she had previously been married to actor Ashley Hamilton and poker player Rick Salomon that ended in 1994 and 2003, respectively. Doherty previously worked on reality television as a host for Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and a contestant on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. Developed under the working title The Shannen Doherty Project, Shannen Says was first announced by WE tv on July 20, 2011. According to the network, the show was intended to portray Doherty from a more intimate perspective. WE tv senior vice president John Miller identified the series as part of the network's strategy to \\"present stories that showcase the wild ride of modern- day life from a woman's perspective\\". Prior to Shannen Says, WE tv was already associated with wedding-themed shows, such as Bridezillas and My Fair Wedding with David Tutera. Variety's Jill Goldsmith cited it, alongside Braxton Family Values, Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?, and Mary Mary, to discuss WE tv's focus on celebrity-based reality shows. Shannen Says was initially going to be developed by Doherty's production company, No Apologies Production, to air on an unidentified television network. The series was instead picked up by WE tv after Doherty rejected the previous network for making the material too sensational. Miller approved the show's pitch because he believed Doherty would be an appealing candidate for reality television. Doherty referred to Shannen Says as her agreement with Iswarienko to \\"chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [it's] not just you and that goes through the stress\\". Likening the show to a wedding video, she described it as a documentary rather than a reality show, and saw herself as an actor not a reality personality. In 2011, Barry Walsh of Realscrean.com described Shannen Says as a docuseries. =Filming and cast = For Shannen Says, Doherty and Iswarienko were inspired by the filming and production styles in Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and Deadliest Catch. Doherty questioned if a show could be \\"brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular\\". They purchased a RED camera to film the series since they wanted it to be \\"a cut above the rest as far as our crew and how it looks\\". Doherty intended for Shannen Says to provide a more authentic look into her life, in contrast to her public persona and acting roles. This idea was carried over into the show's opening (\\"Everyone thinks they know you\\"), which she wrote. She viewed the filming techniques as an important part of this goal, saying: \\"It had to be honest, it had to be truthful, and it had to look fantastic\\". The series was produced by No Apologies Production and RelativityREAL. Episodes were filmed over a seven-week period at the couple's home in Malibu, California and nearby locations. Production began in August 2011, and the wedding took place and was filmed on October 15, 2011. Pictures from the wedding were published in the November 2, 2011 issue of Us Weekly. Doherty and Iswarienko were executive producers for the series, along with Kathleen Iswarienko, Russell Heldt, and Tom Forman. Despite her initial hesitations about the lack of privacy during filming, Doherty felt more comfortable when the bedroom was set as off-limits for the show. To prepare for filming, Doherty watched former Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Tori Spelling's reality show about her relationship with husband Dean McDermott as well as Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Despite this, she resisted comparisons to Kim Kardashian's publicized wedding and divorce from basketball player Kris Humphries. David Tutera, a wedding planner and host of My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, acted as Doherty's event planner. The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo and her mother, Rosa. Professional dancer Louis Van Amstel and real estate agent Chris Cortazzo guest-starred in one episode. Doherty said Twitter users enjoyed how her mother chose to appear more natural rather than being styled by the show's crew.  Episodes   Broadcast history and release  A sneak peek was released prior to the show's debut, and Doherty promoted it through a Television Critics Association panel presentation at Pasadena, California. Promotional materials emphasized her conflict with Iswarienko. Shannen Says received additional publicity when Tori Spelling jokingly offered to plan Doherty's wedding during a 2011 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada: \\"I'll do the wedding, I could probably comment on the wedding she'd want 20 years ago, but that wouldn't make any sense.\\" Shannen Says premiered on April 10, 2012 in the United States on WE tv at 10:00-11:00 pm Eastern and Pacific. The original release date was scheduled for January 2012 and later April 3, 2012. The second episode aired on Tuesday night in the same time slot, and two episodes were aired every Sunday night in the same time slot until the end of the season. The show was broadcast internationally on WE tv Asia. AMC and Sundance Channel Global also acquired rights for Shannen Says, along with The Slap, Hell on Wheels, and Breaking Bad, in October 2011. The series was commercially unsuccessful, but it was popular among women between the ages of 25 and 54. 172,000 people watched the premiere, which ranked below the debut of Dance Moms: Miami. The rest of the episodes also had low ratings, scoring below most of the programs in its time slot. Doherty described Shannen Says as a one-off created and denied interest in a second season. She rejected a suggestion for a second-season storyline about a pregnancy and child. Shannen Says ended on May 12, 2012, and a writer from the Futon Critic reported that it was canceled after being \\"on hiatus for longer than 12 months ‚Äì without any news about its future\\". The series was released on the iTunes Store on April 10, 2012, as Shannen Says, Season 1. All of the episodes have been made available from Amazon Video since 2012, although it has not been released on Blu-ray or DVD.  Critical reception  Shannen Says received mixed reviews from critics. A Life & Style contributor praised the show as \\"very entertaining\\". In HitFix, Geoff Berkshire wrote that it \\"looks great and moves swiftly from one drama to the next\\", and believed the episodes would satisfy fans of reality television. On the other hand, Kevin McDonough, writing for SouthCoastToday.com, criticized Shannen Says for attempting \\"compensate for the lack of drama in Doherty's life with the manic production of a reality TV- sized wedding\\". As part of an article for The Washington Post, Emily Yahr, Caitlin Moore and Emily Chow cited Shannen Says, along with Hey Paula and Kirstie Alley's Big Life, as unsuccessful examples of the \\"autobiographical\\" reality show. Critics had mixed reactions to Doherty. A reviewer for The Huffington Post said she was an ideal fit for reality television, describing her as \\"every bit the bad girl fans have been loving to hate to love for the past twenty-odd years\\". Geoff Berkshire found Doherty to be \\"equal doses crazy and amusing\\". However, he thought her attitude, like requesting wedding guests to wear black or be kicked out, could alienate some viewers. McDonough questioned if audiences would be disappointed that Doherty acts as a \\"reformed monster who just wants to have a normal life\\". Doherty received comparisons to other actresses who starred in reality television. In MTV News, Maisy Fernandez said her personality resulted in a better reality show than Jennie Garth: A Little Bit Country, which starred her former Beverly Hills, 90210 co- star Jennie Garth. However, Fernandez criticized Doherty's choice of television network, believing it was unlikely a casual viewer would find the series while channel surfing. Mark Perigard, writing for the Boston Herald, jokingly said that Doherty does not \\"sob for an hour\\" like Tori Spelling did on her reality shows.

They are commonly found in the rocky intertidal zone. Description and habitat The red-striped anemone is relatively large, up to 75mm. The pedal disc protrudes at the base, diameter of the disc is up to 45mm. Red and white stripes run vertically up the body, the white sometimes turning a strong yellow or even lime green near the elevated mouth. 60 or so tentacles are arranged in 3 whorls, are usually white with a mauve tip and can be up to 25mm long. Habits rock pools around the low tide mark, adhering to stones and boulders. Broods its young.  Reproduction  Epiactis thompsoni exhibit internal brooding which is when the offspring remain within the gastrovascular cavity. Internal brooding is beneficial in the harsh intertidal zone and is a means of reducing dispersal. Some offspring in the broods of Epiactis thompsoni are born with multiple oral disks and tentacular crowns. This is thought to be due to the process of fusion of two or more embryos. They are known as being the primary species that brood offspring. Epiactis thompsoni also exhibit continuous reproduction in that they can breed throughout the year. They are also gonochoric meaning that the sexes are separate.Evolution of Brooding in Sea Anemones: Patterns, Structures, and Taxonomy  History  There has been confusion with the species name in the literature. In Australian literature, the ‚Äòp‚Äô from thompsoni has been dropped. The ‚Äòp‚Äô was originally dropped in Carlgren (1949), so it may be a spelling error that has been since present throughout subsequent literature. The correct spelling is with the ‚Äòp‚Äô, as the species was named after a harbour master in Otago, Captain Thompson.Epiactis thompsoni (Coughtrey, 1875) and E. mortenseni Carlgren, 1924 (Cnidaria: Anthozoa) References Actiniidae Cnidarians of the Pacific Ocean Animals described in 1875 ","title":"Epiactis thompsoni"},{"id":"51140870","text":"Euphyllia glabrescens is a species of large-polyped stony coral belonging to the family Caryophylliidae.

Her UNESCO Club was founded in the year the clubs were first conceived and was the third organization established in the world. In 1967 she was honored as one of the inductees for the Colorado Women of Achievement Award. She was knighted by Italy in 1975 receiving the rank of Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia. In 1991, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame for her many years of peace activism and work with women's rights issues. Early life Genevieve Natalina D‚ÄôAmato was born January 20, 1912 in Sunrise, Wyoming to Italian immigrants, Lorenzo and Anna D'Amato. Her parents had immigrated to the United States in 1908 from Petina, Italy. Her father was a miner, who taught himself blacksmithing and in 1919, moved with his family to Welby, Colorado. Initially, D'Amato attended a Catholic parochial school, but when she learned the school was not accredited, she campaigned for the Adams County School Board to allow she and her brother to attend a school outside of their district. The Board eventually paid half of the children's tuition and allowed them to attend Union High School #1, where they were ostracized as the first Italians in the school. D'Amato worked to overcome the stereotyping of her classmates and became senior class president and the salutatorian of her class. Her graduation with honors enabled D'Amato to earn a tuition waiver scholarship at the University of Colorado, but as her family could not afford her room and board, she did not accept the scholarship. On June 25, 1933, D'Amato married the printer John R. Fiore and they subsequently had three children: David, Phillip Dominic and Roxanna. Community service Having experienced personal discrimination, and losses of family members in both World War I and World War II, Fiore was passionate about creating a world focused on peace and tolerance. From the formation of the Steele Community Center in north Denver in 1937, Fiore worked as a volunteer. While serving as a board member of the Steele Center in 1947, Fiore learned that Denver was to host a regional United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference. The first UNESCO Club had been established a few months earlier by Koichi Ueda in Japan. Using the center‚Äôs registration, she attended the conference as an official observer and collected literature at the event to begin a UN library. She founded a UNESCO group at the Steele Center, though she initially had trouble getting others to support her pacifist views. When no one else would accept the chairmanship, Fiore took the role, planning to hire an executive director. The founding of the organization in 1947, marked only the third UNESCO club in the world, preceded by Ueda's group in Sendai and one founded in Kyoto. Urged to stay on and supported by family members Fiore became the executive director and worked an average of 70 hours per week as a volunteer. Through a school adoption program, Fiore and her club members provided clothing and school supplies to a school in Siculiana, Sicily as their first project and a few months later, adopted a school on the outskirts of Athens. Fiore presented programs on radio and television, at schools and organizations, discussing UNESCO‚Äôs projects and relief programs. Her presentations, totaling over 4,000, included her being on agendas with governors, congressmen, government officials, and businesswomen, urging international goodwill and cooperation. She traveled throughout the state, and attended conferences in New York City, as well as internationally, including British Columbia, Canada; Italy; Japan; and Mexico. In 1953, Fiore helped create Il Circolo Italiano (The Italian Circle) to promote friendship and understanding for the Italian-American community of Denver. The organization offered free Italian lessons. In 1955, she became a supporter of Japan's Peace Pole Project and in 1984 attended the World Federation of UNESCO Clubs, Centres and Associations (WFUCA) World Congress, held in Sendai. Until 1959, the Denver UNESCO organization was operated out of the Fiore family's basement. In that year, she moved the office and International Hospitality Center to the Denver International House and continued as executive director for another fourteen years. Fiore retired in 1974, but she continued her involvement with the International Hospitality Center, hosting foreign visitors and encouraging others to participate. She also attended the International Women's Conference and Tribunal held in Mexico City in 1975. The tribunal was a non-governmental meeting, while the conference was the official government meeting. Both sessions were held at the same meeting so that delegates participated in discussions on official policy and program implementation to improve women's educational opportunities, equality, economic position and collaboration. The 1975 UN World Conference on Women, which was part of the International Women's Year focus, was a precursor in the development of the provisions of Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Fiore felt invigorated by the experience and pledged to continue to work for women's empowerment. In 1977, Fiore chaired the Colorado Women‚Äôs Conference plan of action committee and received top votes to go as the state delegate to the National Women‚Äôs Conference in Houston. In 1979, she established the Genevieve Fiore Educational Trust Fund which provides awards annually to high school students who write essays about the United Nations. In 1983, the United States withdrew its UNESCO membership, citing mismanagement of funds, but Fiore argued for Denver's group, which had never utilized government funds, to continue its independent status. Her campaign was successful and in 1986, the organization changed its name to the UNESCO Association of Colorado. In 1994, Fiore began producing and hosting a weekly radio program called \\"Focus International\\", which examined international educational projects and UNESCO initiatives. Fiore died March 10, 2002 in Denver and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. Awards and honors In 1967 Fiore was honored as one of the inductees for the 1966 Colorado Women of Achievement Award along with Elizabeth McAulliffe Calabrese and Sabina O‚ÄôMalley. She was recognized nationally when she received the Freedoms Foundation's George Washington Medal and received the international Michelangelo Medal from UNESCO. On 15 October 1975, she was knighted by Italy receiving the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1991.

They released their debut album on October 28, 2016. History The origins of Serpentine Dominion can be traced back to 2009's Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival, which Killswitch Engage, Cannibal Corpse and The Black Dahlia Murder were all part of. The project began when Dutkiewicz wrote songs for Fisher and asked him to perform vocals over them, which he agreed to. Dutkiewicz also stated that the songs were written specifically for Fisher. Shannon Lucas was tapped to record the drums for the album. On July 22, 2016 the band announced that their name would be \\"Serpentine Dominion\\". On August 11, 2016, they revealed the release date and track listing for their self- titled debut, to be released under Metal Blade Records. Serpentine Dominion was officially released on October 28, 2016, and was met with positive reviews from both fans and critics.  Musical Style  Serpentine Dominion's sound has been described as death metal, and extreme metal, when asked about the project's musical style, Dutkiewicz said: \\"It's not straight death metal ‚Äî there's some melodic elements in there ‚Äî but it's much faster and more aggressive than Killswitch Engage is. And the drums are blazing, so Shannon is probably one of the only guys on the face of the earth who could pull this off.\\" The band's lyrics for their debut album were written by Killswitch Engage vocalist Jesse Leach. Fisher stated in \\"The Jasta Show\\": \\"I originally was going to write stuff, and you know what? Writing lyrics has just never been my thing, and we were getting down to when I was supposed to go up there and lay down my vocals. And Adam just said 'Look, I'll ask Jesse to write some stuff.' So he wrote it, and I just said I don't want no pro-religious crap 'cause I ain't about all that. Anyway, so it's more just about like getting revenge against corrupt motherfuckers and shit like that.\\"  Members  * Adam Dutkiewicz - guitar, bass, vocals * George Fisher - vocals * Shannon Lucas - drums Discography * Serpentine Dominion (2016, Metal Blade Records) References American heavy metal musical groups Extreme metal musical groups ","title":"Serpentine Dominion"},{"id":"51140924","text":"Lund Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Lund Municipality in Rogaland county, Norway.

Most people are engaged in agriculture, farming and trading. The main cash crops are: rubber, paddy, coconut, areca nut, ginger, turmeric, 'kacholam' and pepper. Koothattukulam which today covers an area of 2318.71 hectares lies 17 km to the south of Muvattupuzha town and 38 km to the north of Kottayam town via the MC Road which passes through this town. Four Brahmin families It is believed that originally this area had been ruled by the four Brahmin families of Athiman Illom, Kottanadu, Kattimuttam and Pariyaram. Territories Today the Koothattukulam consists of the four distinct territories (locally known as ‚Äòkaras‚Äô) of Koothattukulam, Vadakara, Paittakulam and Kizhakombu and has a population of about 18,970. Etymology from legends There are interesting folklores connected with the current names of each of the territories. One of them relates to a lady who, while digging in an isolated hillock inadvertently hit the head of a sunken idol with her implement. Immediately, blood began to ooze out of the idol‚Äôs head and on seeing this the terrified lady took to her heels. This shock and terror upset her balance of mind, driving her ultimately to madness and she spent the rest of her days wandering aimlessly (‚Äôkoothady‚Äô) from place to place. The place thus came to be called as ‚ÄòKoothattakalam‚Äô which over a period of time became known as Koothattukulam. The spot where the idol‚Äôs blood is believed to have spilt was called Chorakuzhy (‚Äôpool of blood‚Äô). Annexation Prior to the annexation of this area to his kingdom by the Marthandavarma Maharaja of Travancore, the land had been ruled by the kings of Vadakkumkoor. They had a weapons training centre at Oonakkur, and so, this place came to be known as ‚Äòpayattukalam‚Äô, which is the present-day Paittakkulam. It is believed that some members of the Keezhekkombil family who were experts in domesticating wild elephants came over from Elanji and settled over here, which is why the place came to be known as Kizhakombu. Tenth Century In the beginning of the tenth century, a group of devotees from Vatakara in Malabar set out for the church at Kuravilangad, carrying with them a picture or a statue (still disputed) of Yohannan Mamdana. On their way to Kuravilangad, these people rested at a place near aittakulam and on account of this, the area was subsequently known as Vadakara. Buddhist period In his famous book ‚ÄòKeralathile Sthalacharithrangal‚Äô, the prominent historian and researcher V. V. K. Valath has pointed out that the cultural history of Koothattukulam dates back to the era of Buddhism and Jainism. Koothattukulam, thus, has an illustrious cultural history and the same is reflected in its very name, which suggests that this must have been a land of ‚Äòkooth‚Äô and ‚Äòaattam‚Äô. Looking at the forays made by the current generation of this place into the arena of art and culture, such a guess is not too far off. Administrative System Even about 100 years back, establishments like a quasi-judicial court, hospital, sub-registrar‚Äôs office, police station, post office, rest house (circuit house), tourist bungalow, Devaswam Board office and an excise inspectorate, all of which normally form part of a District HQs set up, had been established here. Religions From time immemorial, Koothattukulam has been a shining example of religious tolerance and comity. Hindus and Christians live here in complete harmony. Christian churches steeped in the cultural traditions of the Buddhist-Jainist era are a characteristic feature of the area. Though Christians form the majority of the population, there are a number of places of worship belonging to both religions. The Mahadeva temple at Koothattukulam, the Onamkunnu Kavu, the Shiva temple at Arjunanmala, the Devi temple at Kizhakombu, The St. John the Baptist Catholic Church and The St. John‚Äôs Syrian Jacobite Church at Vadakara etc... are just a few of the places of worship dating back several centuries. The St Jude shrine(Holy Family Church) is one of the Catholic Church in Koothattukulam. Holy Family Church dates back to 10th century, though it became Syro-Malabar Church in 1994 and on 20 October 2000 St.Jude Shrine was blessed and St. Jude Novena started here and within few years period its popularity has spread worldwide as God's grace abundantly showered here and people witnessed many miracles and healings. The church possesses the record of world's biggest oil lamp by Limca Book of Records in 2008. As an extra ordinary act here 1001 oil wicks are lit. And to continue this service uninterrupted and most beautiful and effective way a 1001 wicks Bronze Lamp has been manufactured(6640kg weight, 9 Storey, 24.5 foot height).

It was considered to be a \\"sister\\" division to the 415th, and was one of the divisions of Siberians sent west to help defend Moscow during the winter of 1941‚Äì42. It was assigned to the 50th Army and originally saw action in the defense of the city of Tula before going over to the counteroffensive in December, suffering massive casualties in the process. It spent much of the next year along the lines it gained over the winter, southwest of the capital, before beginning to push westward as part of Western Front's 1943 summer offensive. During the winter of 1943-44 it was in Belorussian Front (later 1st Belorussian Front) gradually gaining ground towards the Dniepr River to the east of Rogachev. At the start of Operation Bagration the 413th was in the 3rd Army but was soon reassigned to the 65th Army where it remained for most of the rest of the war. The division was awarded a battle honor for its role in the liberation of Brest in July and in 1945 received both the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Suvorov as it advanced into Poland and Germany with 2nd Belorussian Front. The 413th had a distinguished career as a combat unit, ending its combat path north of Berlin. It was disbanded in the summer of 1946.  Formation  The 413th Rifle Division began forming on August 6, 1941, entirely from assets in the Far Eastern Front. Soldiers and officers came from the South Kazakhstan and Blagoveshchensk Infantry Schools, the Khabarovsk Infantry and Military- Political Schools, and the Vladivostok Artillery Academy. Command cadre came from the staffs of the 1st and 2nd Red Banner Armies, and included many veterans of the Lake Khasan and Khalkhin-Gol fighting. Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 1320th Rifle Regiment * 1322nd Rifle Regiment * 1324th Rifle Regiment * 982nd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed from June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, pp. 113-14 * 291st Antitank Battalion (from January 19, 1942) * 519th Mortar Battalion (until October 10, 1942) * 207th Reconnaissance Company * 425th Sapper Battalion * 487th Signal Battalion (later 487th Signal Company) * 350th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 347th Chemical Protection (Anti-gas) Company * 212th Motor Transport Company (later 486th Motor Transport Battalion) * 524th Field Bakery * 159th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 960th Field Postal Station * 270th Field Office of the State Bank At the time of its formation its personnel were noted as being mostly Siberian and Kazakh.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 Maj. Gen. Alexei Dmitrievich Tereshkov was appointed to command on the day the division began forming. The division was considered to be ready for combat by October 1, and over the course of the month was railed westward to join Western Front on October 31, and was then assigned to 50th Army, near Tula, on November 5. It was one of six divisions transferred from Far Eastern Front to the fighting front from September to November. Contrary to the German understanding at the time, there were no wholesale transfers from the far east to the Moscow front.Walter S. Dunn, Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, pp. 82-83  Battle of Moscow  The 413th first went into action less than a week after joining its Army, which was in Bryansk Front. At this time it had a personnel strength of about 12,000 troops and about 100 artillery pieces and mortars of all types, making it quite a strong front-line division for that period.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 114 In the Army's plan for the defense of Tula the division was to launch a counterblow as soon as it de-trained against the forces of the German 2nd Panzer Army from the Volokhov area in the direction of Novyi Tulskii, from five to 15 km southeast of the city. Subsequent operations were to continue the advance towards Shchyokino to link up with 3rd Army. Upon arrival the division consolidated with two rifle regiments along the line from Nizhnie Prisady to Dubovka and the third in Dedilovo, where the 299th Rifle Division was also concentrating.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow 1941-1942, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 5 The counterattack began at dawn on November 7 but developed slowly due to active German resistance And inexperience on the Soviet side. The 32nd Tank Brigade was intended to coordinate with the 413th but was late in reaching its start line and communications between the two units and higher headquarters worked poorly. By the evening the division had reached a line from Malaya Yelovaya to Tikhvinskoe by was attacked there at 2200 hours by two battalions of infantry and 25-30 tanks and was forced to fall back towards Sergievka. (The division did not receive its 291st Antitank Battalion until January 19, 1942.) Following the failure of the Soviet attack the German forces renewed their efforts to force their way into Tula from the south, which were unsuccessful. On November 10 the 50th Army was re-subordinated to Western Front.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 5 In its first week of fighting the division's infantry strength had been reduced to just 800 men.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 114 On November 18 the 17th Panzer and 112th Infantry Divisions drove the 413th and 299th Divisions out of Dedilovo before developing their attack to the east in the direction of Stalinogorsk in an effort to outflank the city. During November 20 the division, along with the 32nd Tanks, fought stubborn defensive battles and by the end of the day no longer held a continuous front, with one regiment holding Bolokhovka, a second in the area of Gorki and Dubravo, and the third in the area of Kurakino, overall facing up to an infantry division and 40-50 tanks attempting to outflank Bolokhovka from the north and south. As a result of this fighting the division, along with the 299th and 239th Rifle Divisions, and supporting armor, regrouped 6‚Äì8 km north over the night, taking up a line chiefly along the north bank of the Shat River, with the 413th on the line from Marino to Verkhnee Petrovo. On November 24 the 17th Panzer made unsuccessful attempts to cross the river while its main forces advanced towards Kashira.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 5 During the first days of December the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions attacked towards Rudnevo, 20 km northeast of Tula, attempting to reach the northern and eastern outskirts of the city. The commander of 50th Army, Lt. Gen. I. V. Boldin, was ordered to destroy this force, starting on December 3. The division was at this point defending the city's eastern sector and during the day it occupied Kolodeznaya with one regiment and by 1400 hours was fighting for Dorofeevka, helping to secure the right flank of the 217th Rifle Division's 740th Rifle Regiment. As of December 7, with the vastly- overextended German offensive coming to a halt and with the Red Army about to shift to the counteroffensive, the 413th was securely holding a line from Height 217.2 to Kryukovo to Tulitsa.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 5 =Winter Counteroffensive= The initial objective of 50th Army was to encircle and destroy the 2nd Panzer Army in conjunction with the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps and the new 10th Army moving westward from the Ryazan area. Its offensive began on December 8 and the 413th, along with the 340th Rifle Division, was again ordered to advance on Shchyokino as well as Dedilovo with the aim of cutting off the retreat route of the Germans' Venev-Dedilovo-Stalinogorsk grouping. The division was supported by the 156th NKVD Regiment and part of the 112th Tank Division, which was under direct command of the 340th, and faced elements of the 296th Infantry Division. By the end of December 10 it had advanced up to 7 km against stubborn resistance. On the following day new orders directed the 413th to take the village of Bolokhovka prior to reaching positions 2 km west of Dedilovo. On December 14 the division secured the villages of Podosinki, Zamyatino and Krutoe (all 5 km southwest Bolokhovka) with its hardest fighting along the Shat River from Prisady station to the east. After December 15 the main forces of the Army began turning to the northwest and by the 18th began advancing towards Kaluga.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 By December 20 the 413th had reached a line from Sizenevo to Nikolskie Vyselki and was echeloned to the rear and left of the 50th Army's front with the 217th Rifle Division. On the next day, as the Army's forward detachments began to liberate Kaluga, the division was fighting for Odoevo with one regiment while its main forces were developing the offensive in the direction of Okorokovo. Odoevo was occupied by remnants of the 112th and 167th Infantry Divisions and was cleared by the end of December 22, which allowed the 1st Guards Cavalry to advance to the Oka River south of Likhvin. Over the next three days the division attacked in the direction of Cherepet and Likhvin meeting little resistance. General Boldin ordered General Tereshkov to avoid head-on attacks and encircle the latter town with two regiments while the third moved towards Gordikovo. After stubborn street fighting German resistance in Likhvin collapsed and it was cleared on December 26, following which the 413th continued to develop the offensive to the northwest; Boldin's intention was a deep envelopment of Kaluga from the southwest and west by his left flank divisions.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 Kaluga was finally cleared by 1000 hours on December 30 and the surviving German forces fell back to the northwest and west after suffering 7,000 casualties. On the same day the division reached a line from Kromeno to Rassudovo, preventing the retreating forces from moving to the southwest. Following this victory Boldin ordered the bulk of his forces to pursue in the direction of Yukhnov with the 413th and 217th Divisions specifically sent towards Uteshevo. During January 6, 1942 the 50th Army began to run up against more powerful German defenses and the division, having taken Zheleztsovo, continued attacking toward Osenevo and Nedetovo but was being pressed from the north where the 137th and 52nd Infantry Divisions were operating. After this date the Army's forces was involved in increasingly stubborn battles along the approaches to Yukhnov.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 By January 14 was regrouping his worn forces as he strained to reach Yukhnov as quickly as possible. The 413th had its front facing west and was fighting in the same area against a German group trying to break through to Uteshevo. The group was forced to fall back with the assistance of the 7th Guards Cavalry Division. By the end of January 18 the division was still slowly forcing the German grouping back along the line from Vshivka to Troskino, after with it was moved to the Army's left flank with the 290th Rifle and 7th Guards Cavalry Divisions which attacked together in the direction of Trufanovo from January 22 in order to bypass Yukhnov from the southwest. Meanwhile, German strength continued to build. An order of January 27 tasked the 413th with blocking two German strongpoints with part of its forces while advancing with its main forces to the area of Marino - Voitovo - Krutoe, due west of Yukhnov. The struggle for this city would continue through February,Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8 and it would not be finally liberated until March 5. Into Western Russia and Belarus Once Yukhnov was taken 50th Army ground to a halt, and remained roughly on a line from that town to Mosalsk until March, 1943, playing a limited role in the follow-up to the German 9th Army's evacuation from the Rzhev salient, ending up facing its defenses north of Spas-Demensk.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 330, 333 In January Col. Ivan Sidorovich Lazarenko had been appointed the 413th's deputy commander, a post he would hold until November 16, when he took command of the 369th Rifle Division. Lazarenko went on to be promoted to major general but was killed in action near Chausy in late June, 1944, posthumously being named a Hero of the Soviet Union in July.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2476 On May 24 Col. Ivan Stepanovich Khokhlov took over the 413th from General Tereshkov; Khokhlov would be promoted to the rank of major general on October 16. In the same month it was assigned to the 38th Rifle Corps. During Operation Kutuzov, 50th Army took a secondary role, acting as a flank guard for 11th Guards Army, but still made substantial gains during July. From July 18‚Äì21 the 1322nd Regiment was fighting for several villages, including Paliki. Starshina (sergeant- major) Stepan Ignatievich Khirkov was a deputy platoon commander and the political organizer for a company of the regiment. He had already been acclaimed within Western Front for his political work and had received the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd degree, from General Boldin in person. Khirkov helped to lead the defense of his company's positions, personally destroying two German tanks, and led a counterattack on July 21 which finally drove the German forces back, but suffered fatal wounds and died the same day. On June 3, 1944 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=267. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved August 16, 2019. In August, in preparation for the summer offensive towards Smolensk, 50th Army was transferred to Bryansk Front and the 413th went back to being a separate rifle division, but was then assigned to 46th Rifle Corps in September; it would be in that Corps for most of the rest of the war. When Bryansk Front was disbanded on October 10, 50th Army joined Central Front, which was soon renamed Belorussian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 160, 219, 248, 277 =Novyi Bykhov-Propoisk Offensive= By the third week of November the left (south) flank of 50th Army had reached the confluence of the Sozh and Pronya Rivers east of the town of Propoisk, which is on the west bank of the Sozh. The Front commander, Army Gen. K. K. Rokossovsky, ordered his 3rd and 50th Armies to attack across the Sozh, with the 3rd beginning on November 22 and the 50th two days later in a supporting role. At this time the 413th was again a separate division in the Army, which was facing the German 9th Army's XXXXI Panzer Corps. The division, with the 110th Rifle Division, attacked in the Uzgorsk and Krasnaia Sloboda sector just north of Propoisk after a ten-minute artillery raid with the 108th Rifle Division in second echelon. These forces were able to cross the river and penetrate the German defense despite rasputitsa conditions and an almost complete absence of roads; in fact, the attack developed quite slowly until 10th Army to the north entered the offensive on November 28 and the commander of 9th Army, Gen. Walter Model, convinced Hitler to allow him to withdraw to new defenses closer to the Dniepr. By November 30 the Army had advanced from 16 to 30 km on a 37 km front, with the 413th still in the first echelon.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 200, 202-03 =Bykhov-Chausy Offensive= General Rokossovsky planned an offensive to begin in the first days of January, 1944 in the direction of Bykhov to be mounted by his 3rd and 50th Armies. By this time the 3rd Army had reached the Dniepr and a large grouping of German forces were partially encircled east of the river around Bykhov, presenting an inviting target. The 413th, again with the 108th and 110th Divisions, supported by the 233rd Tank Regiment, attacked the positions of the 95th Infantry Division early on January 4 across the Ukhliast River on the 7 km-wide sector between Smolitsa and Krasnitsa with the initial objective of taking the German strongpoint in the latter village. The first day's attack took one German position but was stopped short of Krasnitsa. On January 6 the 324th Rifle Division arrived to reinforce the assault, but the defenders were also reinforced by a battalion-sized battlegroup from the 18th Panzer Grenadier Division which helped to bring the attack to a standstill. Late on January 8 Rokossovsky ordered the offensive halted.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 405-06, 408, 411, 415-16 =Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensive= Later in January the division was put under command of the 121st Rifle Corps, still in 50th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 42 On the morning of February 22 the left wing of the Army (110th, 108th, 324th and 413th Divisions) went over to an offensive along the Mshatoe Swamp to Adamenka line. On February 24 the 121st Corps assaulted across the Dniepr west of Selets-Kholopeev. The arrival of a battlegroup from 20th Panzer Division stabilized the situation but did not eliminate the bridgehead.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 506, 512 Shortly after the end of the operation on February 26 the division was moved back to 46th Corps, 50th Army in the renamed 1st Belorussian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 71 Rokossovsky's next target was the German bridgehead east of the Dniepr centered on Mogilev. He prepared an operation in late March which was to finally liberate both Bykhov and Chausy on the south side of the bridgehead with his 10th and 50th Armies backed by the 1st Guards Tank Corps. General Boldin formed a shock group consisting of the 121st Corps plus the 108th and 413th Divisions of 46th Corps in the 10-km wide sector from Vetrenka to Krasnitsa.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 526, 529 The group was supported by the tanks of 233rd Tank Regiment and the SU-76s of 8th SU Brigade,Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, p. 18 and faced about half each of 18th Panzer Grenadier and 31st Infantry Divisions. The assault began at dawn on March 25 but made little headway over the next six days, gaining between 1 ‚Äì 3 km and capturing the southern outskirts of Krasnitsa but unable to do more before the offensive was shut down on March 31.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 529, 534 Operation Bagration Development of the Bobruysk Operation. 3rd Army began well west of the Dniepr and advanced on Bobryusk from the northeast.The fighting in Belorussia went into a relative lull through April, May and early June. In April the 413th finally left 50th Army as it and 46th Corps was reassigned to 3rd Army while the 50th was moved to the new 2nd Belorussian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 131-32 On June 1 General Khokhlov handed his command over to Col. Ivan Vasilevich Mulov. At the start of the summer offensive 46th Corps had just two divisions (72nd and 413th) and was held in reserve to exploit the breakthrough of German 4th Army's lines by the 35th and 41st Rifle Corps, which were tightly packed on a 10 km front facing the northern flank of the 134th Infantry Division. At 0400 hours on June 24, the second day of the main offensive, the German front was hit by a two-hour artillery barrage by 3rd and 48th Armies, followed by the attack of 11 rifle divisions in the first echelon against less than three German infantry divisions. The 134th managed to halt 3rd Army's forces by 0800 hours but later that day the divisions to its north and south gave way which allowed the 9th Tank Corps to exploit into the German rear, gaining 10 km. The next day 46th Corps was committed into the battle in the direction of Ozerane and Pennoe, reaching the outskirts of Pennoe by the end of the day. The commitment of these two corps completed the breakthrough of 4th Army's defenses during June 26, and 3rd Army was now moving decisively towards Bobryusk and the north. By nightfall on June 27 the German forces in the city had been surrounded. The task of taking and clearing the city over the next few days fell to 48th Army while 3rd Army pressed on to the north and west with Osipovichi as its objective.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans.

Baranovichi was taken by 0400 hours on July 8 by forces of 65th Army. At the start of the Brest-Siedlce operation on July 17 the 46th Corps remained in second echelon, along with 1st Guards Tank Corps and the 1st Polish Army.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 10, 11 Near the end of this offensive the 413th took part in the liberation of the city of Brest, on the pre-war border with Poland, on July 28, and received the name of that place as an honorific: At this time the division was in the 114th Rifle Corps of 70th Army. By August 1 it had returned to the 46th Corps which had been transferred to 65th Army, still in 1st Belorussian Front. A month later it was back in 114th Corps of 70th Army, but in October it returned to 46th Corps in 65th Army, where it would remain for the duration of the war.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 223, 255, 316 On September 25 Colonel Mulov was replaced in command by Col. Andrei Nikolaievich Volkov.  Into Poland and Germany  On November 19 Marshal Rokossovsky officially assumed command of 2nd Belorussian Front and as part of the handover the 65th Army, which had fought under his command since Stalingrad, was reassigned to that Front, where it would remain for the duration.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, pp. 366, 370 In the plan for the Viatula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945 the Army was deployed along the line from Borsuki to Ceppelin and was to attack with its left wing on a 7 km front in the direction of Jackowo, Sochocin and Drobin. On January 14 the Army broke through the German defense along a 12 ‚Äì 13 km front and advanced in fighting from 3 to 5 km. A further advance of 3 to 4 km was made the next day following a 12-minute onslaught by all its artillery. The attack continued overnight, and during January 16 the Army gained up to 20 km, captured the German strongpoint at Nasielsk and cut the railroad from Ciechan√≥w to Modlin. On the 18th the M≈Çawa fortified area was secured by combined forces of 5th Guards Tank, 48th and 65th Armies.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 130, 199-200, 202-04, 207-08 On February 19 the division was recognized for its part in the battles for M≈Çawa, Dzia≈Çdowo and P≈Ço≈Ñsk in this early stage of the offensive with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. By the end of January 26 the 65th Army had reached the approaches to Marienwerder and Graudenz and the east bank of the Vistula River southwest of Graudenz.

The term was popularized by Laura Sessions Stepp in her viral 2007 Cosmopolitan article \\"A New Kind of Date Rape\\", which says gray rape is \\"somewhere between consent and denial and is even more confusing than date rape because often both parties are unsure of who wanted what\\". The term \\"gray rape\\" has been criticized. Lisa Jervis, founder of Bitch magazine, argued that gray rape and date rape \\"are the same thing\\", and that the popularization of the gray rape concept constituted a backlash against women's sexual empowerment and risked rolling back the gains women had made in having rape taken seriously. Former chief of sex crimes for Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office Linda Fairstein states that while \\"in the criminal justice system there‚Äôs no such thing as gray rape, [it] is not a new term and not a new experience.

Ford described a female roommate's experience with her boyfriends, which she describes as \\"just lay there and let them do it\\", such as \\"...when you come home and you're drunk, or you're too tired, or you don't feel like it, but he's there and he wants to, so you just...kinda...let him\\". Ford \\"identified... the need for \\"more definitive language\\" to facilitate nuanced conversations about the \\"spectrum of harm\\" inflicted on women physically and psychologically as a result of these experiences.\\" In a New York Times article entitled ‚ÄúWhen saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô is easier than saying ‚Äòno,‚Äô‚Äù Jessica Bennett describes the \\"complex situation\\" of sexual encounters \\"...you thought you wanted, or maybe you actually never wanted, but somehow here you are and it‚Äôs happening and you desperately want out, but you know that at this point exiting the situation would be more difficult than simply lying there and waiting for it to be over. In other words: saying yes when we really mean no\\", which have been termed ‚Äúthe point of no return,‚Äù ‚Äúgray zone sex,‚Äù ‚Äúbegrudgingly consensual sex,‚Äù ‚Äúlukewarm sex,‚Äù and ‚Äúbad sex,‚Äù an expression in which \\"bad\\" refers ‚Äúnot to the perceived pleasure of it, but to the way you feel in the aftermath.‚Äù The term gray rape was used to describe the 1996 Brown University rape allegation involving students Adam Lack and Sara Klein. According to Lack he had consensual sex with Klein. Klein was apparently unaware the two had sex until days later after Lack asked about the experience. She said she did not remember the incident due to her consumption of alcohol, and 5 weeks later, filed charges. Lack said she not only gave consent, but was the one initiating and that he was unaware she was intoxicated. The charges were subsequently dropped, but Lack received academic discipline as a result. After Laura Sessions Stepp's Cosmopolitan article, \\"A New Kind of Date Rape\\", gray rape definition came to include regrettable sexual experiences and decisions made under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Reina Gattuso states that women have sexual \\"experiences that feel violating yet ambiguous\\", which \\"challenge us to think of violence as a spectrum of power and coercion, rather than a simple dichotomy between ‚Äúgood sex‚Äù and ‚Äúrape.‚Äù\\" Gattuso states that the ‚Äúgray zone‚Äù \\"...idea has often functioned as a tactic to minimize or dismiss violence [in couples], and therefore evade accountability, by claiming that sex is inherently a murky, illegible realm.\\" Feminist magazine Bust defines the expression ‚Äúgray zone‚Äù as \\"sex that isn't completely consensual, but isn't sexual assault\\" or as an ‚Äúunwanted sexual experience.\\" Amanda Sileo states that the \\"gray zone\\" was \\"...constructed by a society engulfed in rape culture and should not exist\\", because \\"open communication is missing from so many sexual encounters\\" and because \\"women feel too unsafe to speak up\\". Sileo states that ‚ÄúIf you've ever tried to put your finger up a straight guy's ass during sex, you'll know that they actually understand ongoing consent, withdrawal of consent and sexual boundaries very well. They act confused when it's our [women's] bodies.‚Äù Sileo states that during an encounter, \\"without the enthusiastic consent of your partner for a new sexual activity [when changing activities], you are no longer participating in consensual sex.\\" Examples An article about a woman (pseudonymously named Grace) \\"regarding her sexual encounter with proclaimed feminist actor and comedian Aziz Ansari\\" was perceived by the woman as ‚Äúviolating,‚Äù telling Ansari the next day via text that ‚ÄúYou ignored clear non-verbal cues; you kept going with advances.‚Äù Following this story, there was widespread discussion in the media; The New York Times stated that ‚ÄúEveryone seems to have an opinion about what she did, what he did and whether talking about gray-zone sex, where the man believes that everything that happened was consensual and the woman feels otherwise.\\" Writer Anna North states that \\"[s]ituations like the one Grace describes, in which a man keeps pushing and a woman, though uncomfortable, doesn‚Äôt immediately leave, happen all the time\\"; Samantha Bee commented that ‚ÄúWe need to set a higher standard for sex.‚Äù Controversy and debate The University of Florida stated that a \\"debate has erupted over a particular kind of encounter, one that may not be viewed as sexual assault but which constitutes something murkier than a bad date.\\" In 2014, Washington and Lee University expelled a student identified only as John Doe for what was described as \\"gray rape\\" after he allegedly raped a woman identified as Jane Doe. According to the claim, Jane met John at a party in February 2014 where the two had sex; she did not ask him to stop at the time, but later regretted it, reportedly after seeing him kiss another woman. In the summer of 2014 while working at a women‚Äôs clinic that helps sexual assault victims, Jane spoke with staff and later reassessed the encounter as rape. Within 21 days John was expelled from Washington and Lee. John Doe later sued the school. In 2015, Washington and Lee filed to dismiss the lawsuit, but Judge Norman K. Moon denied the motion to dismiss allowing John Doe to continue seeking damages from his expulsion believing that John had been the wrongly accused of sexual misconduct. Washington and Lee University ended up settling out of court with the student. Some reject the idea of gray rape, saying that it promotes the myth that rape can be an accident. They say that consent is consent, and there is no gray area between consent and lack of consent. In Sara Alcid's 2013 article \\"Navigating Consent: Debunking the ‚ÄúGray Area‚Äù Myth\\", she argues that the ‚Äúgray area‚Äù around sex and consent that \\"...we have come to know as an inevitable part of sex and consent is a product of our culture‚Äôs less than healthy or communicative approach to sex\\"; Alcid states that \\"women‚Äôs outfits...are [wrongly] perceived as an invitation for sex or a signal of pre-consent\\"; \\"[f]lirting and acting romantically interested in someone is commonly interpreted [incorrectly] as a desire to have sex\\"; the incorrect belief that dating confers \\"a permanent state of consenting to sex\\", or the myth that being pressured or intoxicated is consent. Responses Susuana Amoah, who founded the I Heart Consent Campaign, has called for more consent education, including on boundaries: \\"To avoid grey areas, it's important that people of all ages are educated about what sexual consent means and are able to have informed wider discussions about coercion, body language and abuse of power.\\" Rachel Thompson has called for more \\"conversations of grey areas\\", noting the wide-ranging discussion over the short story \\"Cat Person\\" in New Yorker, which examined the \\"realm of bad sex\\" and the \\"reality of terrible sex and its emotional impact\\". Conor Friedersdorf stated that \\"singling out individuals\\"‚Äîlike Aziz Ansari‚Äîisn't an \\"effective\\" way to explore \\"these thorny, noncriminal, nonworkplace flaws in sexual culture.\\" Friedersdorf stated that it may be better to discuss the fictional portrayals of sex in movies and TV shows. Kate Margolis states that \\"[w]e need to get to the point where saying no is much, much easier. We need to make no-guilt-attached sexual refusal the norm\\" and it \\"should be easier to say, 'I don‚Äôt really feel like having sex' without the addition of an adamant push, or a neighbor-alarming yell\\"; she says discussing these issues could \\"help men to distinguish between genuine enthusiasm and silent reluctance\\".

The fire started around 2:10 p.m. on July 22, 2016 near the intersection Soledad Canyon Road and Sand Canyon Road. By 10 P.M., less than 8 hours after it was reported, the fire had burned at least . At the time the fire broke out, temperatures were over with sustained winds of gusting up to . The Santa Clarita Valley remained under a Red flag warning throughout the 23rd with temperatures reaching and sustained winds. By the evening of Saturday July 23, the fire had grown to with 10% containment. Mandatory evacuations had been issued for parts of Sand Canyon, Placerita Canyon, and Little Tujunga Canyon areas. Hundreds of birds and animals were also evacuated from the Wildlife WayStation sanctuary in Little Tujunga Canyon. Officials from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed Saturday night that a male's body had been found in the burn area. The body, which was located on North Iron Canyon Road well within the mandatory evacuation area, was identified as Robert Bresnick, a 67-year-old man who had been visiting a friend in the area and had refused to evacuate. Sunday afternoon officials confirmed that Sable Ranch, a popular filming location, had been destroyed by the fire. Popular shows including Maverick, The A-Team and 24 were all filmed at Sable Ranch. By Monday July 25, the fire had reach an estimated with 40% of the perimeter contained.

The creek's name is of Seneca origin, and was recorded in early records as Ganusgago, Kanuskago, and Caniskrauga. Translations of the name include both \\"among the milkweeds\\" and \\"slippery elms\\". Course Canaseraga Creek rises in the town of Nunda, and initially flows south. The creek turns eastward before passing through the village of Canaseraga, after which it flows north. It passes to the west of the village of Dansville, and continues north before joining the Genesee River east of the village of Mount Morris and just downstream of the Mount Morris Dam. The creek's watershed is the largest sub- watershed of Genesee River. It is primarily composed of agricultural land (46.8%) and forests (44.4%), with 5.7% of the watershed developed for residential and industrial uses. Recreation The main stem of Canaseraga Creek is annually stocked with brown trout by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation; in 2015, the creek was stocked with 5,670 trout at locations in Allegany and Steuben counties. Anglers may also target small populations of wild brown trout that are found in Mill Creek and Sugar Creek, both of which flow into Canaseraga Creek near Dansville. Whitewater rafting takes place in the upper reaches of the creek. An stretch of the creek upstream of Dansville contains class IV and V rapids, although water levels are frequently too low for rafting outside of spring flooding events.

His influence as an architect, especially during the development and growth of Sedona in the 1950s and 1960s, lead to him being called \\"the first architect of Sedona\\". In 1948, after graduating with a degree in science and commerce from the University of Iowa, Madole moved to Arizona after his parents purchased 10 acres of land in West Sedona. Madole designed and built his first house with his family using a mud concoction containing recycled asphalt to add strength to the bricks that they had invented. Madole continued to learn the construction business and carpentry and by 1952 owned the largest construction business in Northern Arizona. Through his involvement with Taliesin West, he worked with Frank Lloyd Wright where he helped to build the Usonian design structure there. Madole went on to pioneer his own style with signature elements, including the use of local stone, wood 2x4s on edge for roofing materials, flared roof lines, unusual pitched and shaped structures, and fireplaces that penetrated large glass walls. Over the years, Madole not only created innovative designs, but he built the largest construction business in Northern Arizona and built award winning homes and contemporary commercial buildings in Phoenix. Several of his signature homes survive in Sedona, and four have been designated Sedona Historic Landmarks. Madole moved to Phoenix in 1966, and went on to design hundreds of residential and commercial buildings all over Arizona, including the former Northwestern Mutual Life building located on the southwest corner of Third Street and Osborn. He died on January 29, 2015.

Each plant has from two to four ground- hugging leaves and between three and fifteen flowers during the wet season and the species often forms spreading colonies on sandstone escarpments. Like others in the genus, the flowers are pollinated by a species of thynnid wasp. Description Arthrochilus latipes is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. There are two to four lance-shaped, ground-hugging, dull green leaves at the base of the plant, each leaf long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, tall with three to about fifteen flowers, each long with and green with brownish glands on the labellum. The dorsal sepal curves downwards, is narrow egg-shaped to spoon-shaped, about long, wide and is wrapped around one-quarter of the column. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back towards the ovary, the sepals about and the petals about the same length but narrower. The labellum is about but wider at the base, greenish with a dark purple blotch at its base. The callus resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp and is covered with short, shiny, club-shaped, yellowish brown to brown structures called \\"calli\\". The tip of the callus is bulb-shaped and covered with shiny black glands. The column is shaped like a semi-circle, about long with its inner surface hairy. One pair of column wings are triangular and point forwards, while the other pair on the side of the column are erect and have a hooked summit. Flowering occurs from October to January and is followed by a dehiscent, oval-shaped capsule about long. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus latipes was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected in Radon Gorge in Kakadu National Park. The specific epithet (latipes) is derived from the Latin words latus meaning \\"broad\\" and pes meaning \\"foot\\" referring to the broad base of the labellum of this orchid species. Distribution and habitat Robust elbow orchid is found in the Top End of the Northern Territory, east of Darwin, growing on rocky outcrops and sandstone escarpments, especially in the Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, robust elbow orchid is pollinated by males thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

Some cybersecurity experts, as well as the U.S. government, stated that the cyberespionage was the work of Russian intelligence agencies. Forensic evidence analyzed by several cybersecurity firms, CrowdStrike, Fidelis, and Mandiant (or FireEye), strongly indicates that two Russian intelligence agencies infiltrated the DNC computer systems. The American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which removed the hacking programs, revealed a history of encounters with both groups and had already named them, calling one of them Cozy Bear and the other Fancy Bear, names which are used in the media. On December 9, 2016, the CIA told U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded Russia conducted the cyberattacks and other operations during the 2016 U.S. election to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency. Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that specific individuals tied to the Russian government provided WikiLeaks with the stolen emails from the DNC, as well as stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, who was also the target of a cyberattack. These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the Republican National Committee (R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C., but chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C.  Cyber attacks and responsibility Cyber attacks that successfully penetrated the DNC computing system began in 2015. Attacks by \\"Cozy Bear\\" began in the summer of 2015. Attacks by \\"Fancy Bear\\" began in April 2016. It was after the \\"Fancy Bear\\" group began their activities that the compromised system became apparent. The groups were presumed to have been spying on communications, stealing opposition research on Donald Trump, as well as reading all email and chats. Both were finally identified by CrowdStrike in May 2016. Both groups of intruders were successfully expelled from the DNC systems within hours after detection. These attacks are considered to be part of a group of recent attacks targeting U.S. government departments and several political organizations, including 2016 campaign organizations. On July 22, 2016, a person or entity going by the moniker \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" claimed on a WordPress- hosted blog to have been acting alone in hacking the DNC. He also claimed to send significant amounts of stolen electronic DNC documents to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has not revealed the source for their leaked emails. However, cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike, Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, SecureWorks, ThreatConnect, and the editor for Ars Technica, have rejected the claims of \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" and have determined, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the cyberattacks were committed by two Russian state-sponsored groups (Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear).  According to separate reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post, U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded with \\"high confidence\\" that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC.Ellen Nakashima, Is there a Russian master plan to install Trump in the White House? Some intelligence officials are skeptical, New York Times (July 27, 2016). While the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia was behind the cyberattack, intelligence officials told the Washington Post that they had \\"not reached a conclusion about who passed the emails to WikiLeaks\\" and so did not know \\"whether Russian officials directed the leak.\\" A number of experts and cybersecurity analysts believe that \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" is probably a Russian government disinformation cover story to distract attention away from the DNC breach by the two Russian intelligence agencies. Note: Dmitri Alperovitch is a CrowdStrike co-founder, CTO, and cybersecurity expert. Note: This news article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a discussion about computer security issues, which took place as a side segment during the then- ongoing G20 summit in China in September 2016. Obama said Russian hacking stopped after his warning to Putin. In a joint statement on October 7, 2016, the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the US intelligence community is confident that the Russian government directed the breaches and the release of the obtained or allegedly obtained material in an attempt to \\"‚Ä¶ interfere with the US election process.\\"  Background  As is common among Russian intelligence services, both groups used similar hacking tools and strategies. It is believed that neither group was aware of the other. Although this is antithetical to American computer intelligence methods, for fear of undermining or defeating intelligence operations of the other, this has been common practice in the Russian intelligence community since 2004. This intrusion was part of several attacks attempting to access information from American political organizations, including the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns. Both \\"Cozy Bear\\" and \\"Fancy Bear\\" are known adversaries, who have extensively engaged in political and economic espionage that benefits the Russian Federation government. Both are believed connected to the Russian intelligence services. Also, both access resources and demonstrate levels of proficiency matching nation-state capabilities. \\"Cozy Bear\\" has in the past year infiltrated unclassified computer systems of the White House, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to CrowdStrike, other targeted sectors include: Defense, Energy, Mining, Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Think tanks, Pharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries as well as universities. \\"Cozy Bear\\" observed attacks have occurred in Western Europe, Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and Central Asia. \\"Fancy Bear\\" has been operating since the mid-2000s. CrowdStrike reported targeting has included Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and the Media industries. \\"Fancy Bear\\" intrusions have occurred in United States, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Republic of Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. Targeted defense ministries and military organizations parallel Russian Federation government interests. This may indicate affiliation with the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU, a Russian military intelligence service). Specifically, \\"Fancy Bear\\" has been linked to intrusions into the German Bundestag and France‚Äôs TV5 Monde (television station) in April 2015. SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the \\"Fancy Bear\\" target list included not merely the DNC, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however.  Hacking the DNC  On January 25, 2018 Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant and TV program Nieuwsuur reported that in 2014 the Dutch Intelligence agency General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) successfully infiltrated the computers of Cozy Bear and observed the hacking of the head office of the DNC and subsequently The White House and were the first to alert the National Security Agency about the cyber-intrusion.Dutch intelligence first to alert U.S. about Russian hack of Democratic Party In early 2015, the NSA apprised the FBI and other agencies of the DNC intrusions which the Dutch had secretly detected and on August 15, 2015, the Washington field office first alerted DNC technical staff of the compromise of their systems.Miller, Greg (2018). The Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy. New York: Custom House. p.20. . Much later, the lack of higher level communications between the political party and the government was seen by the former as an \\"unfathomable lapse\\" and it wasn't until April 2016 when legal authorizations to share sensitive technical data with the government finally apprised DNC leaders that their systems had been penetrated.Miller, 2018, p. 24. Cozy Bear\\" had access to DNC systems since the summer of 2015; and \\"Fancy Bear\\", since April 2016. There was no evidence of collaboration or knowledge of the other's presence within the system. Rather, the \\"two Russian espionage groups compromised the same systems and engaged separately in the theft of identical credentials\\". \\"Cozy Bear\\" employed the \\"Sea Daddy\\" implant and an obfuscated PowerShell script as a backdoor, launching malicious code at various times and in various DNC systems. \\"Fancy Bear\\" employed X Agent malware, which enabled distant command execution, transmissions of files and keylogging, as well as the \\"X-Tunnel\\" malware. DNC leaders became aware of the compromise in April 2016. These attacks broadly reflect Russian government interest in the U.S. political system, as well as political leaders' policies, tendencies and proclivities while assessing possible beneficial outcomes. The attacks also broadly reflect Russian government interest in the strategies, policies, and practices of the U.S. Government. This also globally reflects foreign governments' interest in ascertaining information on Donald Trump as a new entry into U.S. political leadership roles, in contrast to information likely to have been garnered over the decades pertaining to the Clintons. The DNC commissioned the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to defeat the intrusions. Its chief technology officer, Dmitri Alperovitch, who is also a cybersecurity expert, stated: Other cybersecurity firms, Fidelis Cybersecurity and FireEye, independently reviewed the malware and came to the same conclusion as CrowdStrike--that expert Russian hacking groups were responsible for the breach.Michael Kan, Russian hackers were behind DNC breach, says Fidelis Cybersecurity, IDG News Service/ComputerWorld (June 20, 2016). In November 2017, US authorities identified 6 Russian individuals who conducted the hack. Beginning in December 2016 the Russian government arrested Sergei Mikhailov, a high ranking government cyber-spy, Ruslan Stoyanov, a private sector cyber-security expert, Georgy Fomchenkov, a former government cyber-spy, and Dmitry Dokuchaev, a Mikhailov associate and charged them with aiding U.S. intelligence agencies which the New York Times associated with the DNC hacking.Shane, Scott; Sanger, David E.; and Kramer, Andrew E. (27 January 2017). \\"Russians Charged With Treason Worked in Office Linked to Election Hacking\\". New York Times website Retrieved 31 December 2017.Levintova, Hannah. (21 December 2017). \\"Is Putin Trying to Pin the DNC Hacks on America‚Äôs Own Spies?\\" Mother Jones website Retrieved 31 December 2017. =Donor information= Although the DNC claimed that no personal, financial, or donor information was accessed, \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" leaked what he or they claimed were donor lists detailing DNC campaign contributions to Gawker and The Smoking Gun. However, this information has not been authenticated, and doubts remain about Guccifer 2.0's backstory. Guccifer 2.0 In June 2016, a person or person(s) claimed to be the hacker who had hacked the DNC servers and then published the stolen documents online.Tal Kopan, \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" later also claimed to have leaked 20.000 emails to WikiLeaks. U.S. intelligence conclusions ODNI declassified assessment of \\"Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections\\" The U.S. Intelligence Community tasked resources debating why Putin chose summer 2016 to escalate active measures influencing U.S. politics. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said after the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests that Putin's confidence in his viability as a politician was damaged, and Putin responded with the propaganda operation. Former CIA officer Patrick Skinner explained the goal was to spread uncertainty. U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, commented on Putin's aims, and said U.S. intelligence agencies were concerned with Russian propaganda. Speaking about disinformation that appeared in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Poland, Schiff said there was an increase of the same behavior in the U.S. Schiff concluded Russian propaganda operations would continue against the U.S. after the election. On December 9, 2016, the CIA told U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded Russia conducted operations during the 2016 U.S. election to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency. Multiple U.S intelligence agencies concluded people with specific individuals tied to the Russian government gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee (D.N.C.) and additional sources such as John Podesta, campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia hacked the Republican National Committee (R.N.C.) as well as the D.N.C.‚Äîand chose not to leak information obtained from the R.N.C. The CIA said the foreign intelligence agents were Russian operatives previously known to the U.S. CIA officials told U.S. Senators it was \\"quite clear\\" Russia's intentions were to help Trump. Trump released a statement December 9, and disregarded the CIA conclusions. U.S. legislative response Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee traveled to Ukraine and Poland in 2016 and learned about Russian operations to influence their affairs. U.S. Senator Angus King told the Portland Press Herald that tactics used by Russia during the 2016 U.S. election were analogous to those used against other countries. On 30 November 2016, King joined a letter in which seven members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia's role in the U.S. election. In an interview with CNN, Senator King warned against ignoring the problem, saying it was a bipartisan issue. Representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to monitor the National security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor propaganda. On 30 November 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to act against propaganda with an inter-agency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period. The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy. Portman urged more U.S. government action to counter propaganda. Murphy said after the election it was apparent the U.S. needed additional tactics to fight Russian propaganda. U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden said frustration over covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan. Republican U.S. Senators stated they planned to hold hearings and investigate Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. elections. By doing so they went against the preference of incoming Republican President- elect Donald Trump, who downplayed any potential Russian meddling in the election. U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr discussed plans for collaboration on investigations of Russian cyberwarfare during the election. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker planned a 2017 investigation. Senator Lindsey Graham indicated he would conduct a sweeping investigation in the 115th Congress. President Obama order On December 9, 2016, President Obama ordered the entire United States Intelligence Community to conduct an investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election -- and provide a report before he left office on January 20, 2017. Lisa Monaco, U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president, announced the study, and said the intrusion of a foreign nation into a U.S. national election was an unprecedented event that would necessitate further investigation by subsequent administrations in the executive branch. The intelligence analysis will take into account data from the last three presidential elections in the U.S. Evidence showed malicious cyberwarfare during the 2008 and 2016 U.S. elections.

These emails were subsequently leaked by DCLeaks in June and July 2016 and by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, just before the 2016 Democratic National Convention. This collection included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the United States' Democratic Party. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. On November 6, 2016, WikiLeaks released a second batch of DNC emails, adding 8,263 emails to its collection. The leaks resulted in allegations of bias against Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, in apparent contradiction with the DNC leadership's publicly stated neutrality, as several DNC operatives seemed to deride Sanders' campaign and discussed ways to advance Hillary Clinton's nomination. Later reveals included controversial DNC‚ÄìClinton agreements dated before the primary, regarding financial arrangements and control over policy and hiring decisions. The revelations prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz before the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The DNC issued a formal apology to Bernie Sanders and his supporters \\"for the inexcusable remarks made over email\\" that did not reflect the DNC's \\"steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process.\\" After the convention, DNC CEO Amy Dacey, CFO Brad Marshall, and Communications Director Luis Miranda also resigned in the wake of the controversy. On December 9, 2016, the CIA told U.S. legislators that the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded Russia conducted operations during the 2016 U.S. election to prevent Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. Multiple U.S intelligence agencies concluded people with direct ties to the Kremlin gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. WikiLeaks did not reveal its source. Later Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, claimed that the source of the emails was not Russia. In June 2017, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who was appointed by and served under President Barack Obama, testified before a House Select committee that his department offered their assistance to the DNC during the campaign to determine what happened to their server, but said his efforts were \\"rebuffed\\" because the Department of Homeland Security was offering to provide assistance months after the FBI had provided assistance. On July 13, 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian military intelligence agents of a group known as Fancy Bear alleged to be responsible for the attack, who were behind the Guccifer 2.0 pseudonym which claimed responsibility.  Contents of leak The emails leaked by Wikileaks, in two phases (the first on July 22, 2016 and the second on October 7th, 2016), revealed information about the DNC's interactions with the media, Hillary Clinton's and Bernie Sanders' campaigns, and financial contributions. It also includes personal information about the donors of the Democratic Party, including credit card and Social Security numbers, which could facilitate identity theft. Earlier, in late June 2016, Guccifer 2.0 instructed reporters to visit the DCLeaks website for emails stolen from Democrats. With the WikiLeaks disclosure of additional stolen emails beginning on July 22, 2016, more than 150,000 stolen emails from either personal Gmail addresses or via the DNC that were related to the Hillary Clinton 2016 Presidential campaign were published on the DCLeaks and WikiLeaks websites. On August 12, 2016, DCLeaks released information about more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, including their personal cellphone numbers. The numerous prank calls that Hillary Clinton received from this disclosure along with the loss of her campaign's email security severely disrupted her campaign, which changed its contact information on October 7, 2016 by calling each of her contacts one at a time. =Media= The emails include DNC staff's \\"off-the-record\\" correspondence with media personalities, including the reporters at CNN, Politico, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. =Bernie Sanders' campaign= In the emails, DNC staffers derided the Sanders campaign. The Washington Post reported: \\"Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign.\\" In a May 2016 email chain, the DNC chief financial officer (CFO) Brad Marshall told the DNC chief executive officer, Amy Dacy, that they should have someone from the media ask Sanders if he is an atheist prior to the West Virginia primary. On May 21, 2016, DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach sent an email to DNC Spokesman Luis Miranda mentioning a controversy that ensued in December 2015, when the National Data Director of the Sanders campaign and three subordinate staffers accessed the Clinton campaign's voter information on the NGP VAN database. (The party accused Sanders' campaign of impropriety and briefly limited its access to the database. The Sanders campaign filed suit for breach of contract against the DNC, but dropped the suit on April 29, 2016.) Paustenbach suggested that the incident could be used to promote a \\"narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never had his act together, that his campaign was a mess.\\" The DNC rejected this suggestion. The Washington Post wrote: \\"Paustenbach's suggestion, in that way, could be read as a defense of the committee rather than pushing negative information about Sanders. But this is still the committee pushing negative information about one of its candidates.\\" =Debbie Wasserman Schultz's emails= Following the Nevada Democratic convention, Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrote about Jeff Weaver, manager of Bernie Sanders' campaign: \\"Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred\\". In another email, Wasserman Schultz said of Bernie Sanders, \\"He isn't going to be president.\\" Other emails showed her stating that Sanders doesn't understand the Democratic Party. In May 2016, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski accused the DNC of bias against the Sanders campaign and called on Wasserman Schultz to step down. Wasserman Schultz was upset at the negative media coverage of her actions, and she emailed the political director of NBC News, Chuck Todd, that such coverage of her \\"must stop\\". Describing the coverage as the \\"LAST straw\\", she ordered the DNC's communications director to call MSNBC president Phil Griffin to demand an apology from Brzezinski. =Financial and donor information= According to The New York Times, the cache included \\"thousands of emails exchanged by Democratic officials and party fund-raisers, revealing in rarely seen detail the elaborate, ingratiating and often bluntly transactional exchanges necessary to harvest hundreds of millions of dollars from the party's wealthy donor class. The emails capture a world where seating charts are arranged with dollar totals in mind, where a White House celebration of gay pride is a thinly disguised occasion for rewarding wealthy donors and where physical proximity to the president is the most precious of currencies.\\" As is common in national politics, large party donors \\"were the subject of entire dossiers, as fund-raisers tried to gauge their interests, annoyances and passions.\\" In a series of email exchanges in April and May 2016, DNC fundraising staff discussed and compiled a list of people (mainly donors) who might be appointed to federal boards and commissions. (republished at Huffington Post) Center for Responsive Politics senior fellow Bob Biersack noted that this is a longstanding practice in the United States: \\"Big donors have always risen to the top of lists for appointment to plum ambassadorships and other boards and commissions around the federal landscape.\\" The White House denied that financial support for the party was connected to board appointments, saying: \\"Being a donor does not get you a role in this administration, nor does it preclude you from getting one. We've said this for many years now and there's nothing in the emails that have been released that contradicts that.\\" =France= In 2011, France, under President Nicolas Sarkozy, led calls for international intervention in the Libyan Civil War, voted in favor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 and, subsequently, dispatched the French Air Force into direct military action in Libya in support of the National Transitional Council. At the time, France said the move was to protect Libyan civilians. But in a private email from Sidney Blumenthal to Hillary Clinton - revealed as part of the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak - Blumenthal claimed France was more concerned with Libya's large gold reserves, which might pose a threat to the value of the Central African Franc, thereby weakening French influence in Africa, and that Sarkozy was interested in increased access to Libyan oil. Former French diplomat Patrick Haimzadeh called Blumenthal's analysis, while it reflected a popular theory on conspiracy websites, \\"not credible\\" because \\"the timeline just doesn't add up\\" with Sarkozy's decision to intervene preceding knowledge of Gaddafi's plans. French investigative journalist Fabrice Arfi dismissed Blumenthal's claim as \\"far-fetched,\\" while also acknowledging that even U.S. intelligence did not find France's publicly stated motivations for the Libya intervention to be entirely credible either. Perpetrators =Cybersecurity analysis= A self-styled hacker going by the moniker \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" claimed to be the source of the leaks; WikiLeaks did not reveal its source. Cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike, Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, SecureWorks, and ThreatConnect, and the editor for Ars Technica, stated the leak was part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups. U.S. intelligence agencies also stated (with \\"high confidence\\" (citing \\"federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence\\").) that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the DNC, according to reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange initially stuck to WikiLeaks policy of neither confirming or denying sources but in January 2017 said that their \\"source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party\\", and the Russian government said it had no involvement. Comey testified that the FBI requested, but did not receive, physical access to the DNC servers. According to Comey, the FBI did obtain copies of the servers and all the information on them, as well as access to forensics from CrowdStrike, a third- party cybersecurity company that reviewed the DNC servers. Comey said that access through Crowdstrike was an \\"appropriate substitute\\" and called the firm a \\"highly respected private company.\\" =United States intelligence conclusions= ODNI declassified assessment of \\"Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections\\" On October 7, 2016, the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the US intelligence community was confident that the Russian government directed the breaches and the release of the obtained or allegedly obtained material in an attempt to \\"... interfere with the US election process.\\" The U.S. Intelligence Community tasked resources debating why Putin chose summer 2016 to escalate active measures influencing U.S. politics. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said after the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests, Putin's confidence in his viability as a politician was damaged, and Putin responded with the propaganda operation. Former CIA officer Patrick Skinner explained the goal was to spread uncertainty. U.S. Congressman Adam Schiff, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, commented on Putin's aims, and said U.S. intelligence agencies were concerned with Russian propaganda. Speaking about disinformation that appeared in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Poland, Schiff said there was an increase of the same behavior in the U.S. Schiff concluded Russian propaganda operations would continue against the U.S. after the election. On December 9, 2016, the CIA told U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded Russia conducted operations during the 2016 U.S. election to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency. Multiple U.S intelligence agencies concluded people with direct ties to the Kremlin gave WikiLeaks hacked emails from the DNC and additional sources such as John Podesta, campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. These intelligence organizations additionally concluded Russia attempted to hack the Republican National Committee (RNC) as well as the DNC but were prevented by security defenses on the RNC network. The CIA said the foreign intelligence agents were Russian operatives previously known to the U.S. CIA officials told U.S. Senators it was \\"quite clear\\" Russia's intentions were to help Trump. Trump released a statement December 9, and disregarded the CIA conclusions. = Steele dossier allegations = The Steele dossier contains several allegations related to the hacking and leaking of the emails. The individuals named have denied the allegations. Dossier sources allege: * That Russia was responsible for the DNC email hacks and the recent appearance of the stolen DNC e-mails on WikiLeaks, and that the reason for using WikiLeaks was \\"plausible deniability\\". (Report 95) * That \\"the operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of TRUMP and senior members of his campaign team.\\" (Report 95) * That after the emails were leaked to WikiLeaks, it was decided to not leak more, but to engage in misinformation: \\"Rather the tactics would be to spread rumours and misinformation about the content of what already had been leaked and make up new content.\\" (Report 101) * That Trump's foreign policy adviser Carter Page had \\"conceived and promoted\\" the idea of \\"leaking the DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks during the Democratic Convention\\" \\"to swing supporters of Bernie SANDERS away from Hillary CLINTON and across to TRUMP.\\" (Reports 95, 102) * That the hacking of the DNC servers was performed by Romanian hackers ultimately controlled by Putin and paid by both Trump and Putin. (Report 166) * That Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had a secret meeting with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016, where he arranged \\"deniable cash payments\\" to the hackers and sought \\"to cover up all traces of the hacking operation\\", as well as \\"cover up ties between Trump and Russia, including Manafort's involvement in Ukraine\\". (Reports 135, 166) Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations, labeling the dossier as \\"discredited\\", \\"debunked\\", \\"fictitious\\", and \\"fake news\\". Paul Manafort has \\"denied taking part in any collusion with the Russian state, but registered himself as a foreign agent retroactively after it was revealed his firm received more than $17m working as a lobbyist for a pro-Russian Ukrainian party.\\" Cohen has also denied the allegations against him. Page originally denied meeting any Russian officials, but his later testimony, acknowledging that he had met with senior Russian officials at Rosneft, has been interpreted as appearing to corroborate portions of the dossier. In his February 2019 testimony before Congress, Cohen implicated Trump, writing that Trump had knowledge that Roger Stone was communicating with Wikileaks about releasing emails stolen from the DNC in 2016. Reactions On July 18, 2016, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary for Russian president Vladimir Putin, stated that the Russian government had no involvement in the DNC hacking incident. Peskov called it \\"paranoid\\" and \\"absurd\\", saying: \\"We are again seeing these maniacal attempts to exploit the Russian theme in the US election campaign.\\" That position was later reiterated by the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, which called the allegation \\"entirely unrealistic\\". Then Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Twitter: \\"Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes , really vicious. RIGGED.\\" The leak fueled tensions going into the 2016 Democratic National Convention: although DNC operatives initially denied accusations of bias, Sanders operatives and multiple media commentators cited the leaks as clear evidence that the DNC had been favoring Clinton and undermining Sanders. Several media commentators have disputed the significance of the emails, arguing that the DNC's internal preference for Clinton was not historically unusual and was unlikely to have swayed the final outcome of the primary; whereas many of Sanders' supporters viewed the revelations as symptomatic of an entrenched, unethical political establishment. On July 24, 2016, Sanders urged Wasserman Schultz to resign following the leak and stated that he was \\"disappointed\\" by the leak, but that he was \\"not shocked.\\" Jeff Weaver, Bernie Sanders' campaign manager, called for greater accountability in the DNC, calling Wasserman Schultz \\"a figure of disunity\\" within the Democratic Party. Later the same day, Wasserman Schultz resigned from her position as DNC Chairman, effective as of the end of the nominating convention. After Wasserman Schultz resigned, Sanders said that she had \\"made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party.\\" On the following day, the DNC apologized to Bernie Sanders and his supporters, stating, \\"On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Senator Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,\\" and that the emails did not reflect the DNC's \\"steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process.\\" On July 24, 2016, in an interview with NPR, former DNC Chair and current Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe said \\"...that the chair's job should be \\"to remain neutral.\\" \\"I sat in that chair in 2004 trying to navigate all the different candidates we had. But if you had people in there who were trashing one of the candidates, I can tell you this, if I were still chairman they wouldn't be working there. I mean, that is just totally unacceptable behavior.\\" On July 25, 2016, Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter for the BBC, commented that \\"the revelation that those in the heart of the Democratic establishment sought to undermine the anti-establishment Sanders is roughly on a par with [Casablanca character] police Capt Renault's professed shock that gambling was taking place in the Casablanca club he was raiding, as a waiter hands him his winnings.\\" On July 25, 2016, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said that \\"Today's events show really what an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week in unifying their party. Starting out the week by losing your party chairman over longstanding bitterness between factions is no way to keep something together.\\" After the emails were released, the Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informed the U.S. government that, in May 2016 at a London wine bar, Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos had told him that the Russian government had a large trove of Hillary Clinton emails that could potentially damage her presidential campaign. The FBI started a counterintelligence investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On October 14, 2016, NBC News reported that multiple sources were telling them that Barack Obama had ordered the CIA to present him with options for a retaliatory cyber attack against the Russian Federation for allegedly interfering in the US presidential election. Sources said that this is not the first time the CIA has presented such options to a president, but that on all previous occasions the decision was made not to carry out the proposed attacks. In an op-ed for The Intercept, James Risen chided the media for its lopsided reporting on emails: > To their disgrace, editors and reporters at American news organizations > greatly enhanced the Russian echo chamber, eagerly writing stories about > Clinton and the Democratic Party based on the emails, while showing almost > no interest during the presidential campaign in exactly how those emails > came to be disclosed and distributed ... The hack was a much more important > story than the content of the emails themselves, but that story was largely > ignored because it was so easy for journalists to write about Clinton > campaign chair John Podesta. Media coverage and public perception On July 27, 2016, The New York Times reported that Julian Assange, in an interview on British ITV on June 12, 2016, had \\"made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency\\", and that in a later interview on the program Democracy Now! on July 25, 2016, the first day of the Democratic National Convention, he acknowledged that \\"he had timed their release to coincide with the Democratic convention.\\" In an interview with CNN, Assange would neither confirm nor deny who WikiLeaks' sources were; he claimed that his website \\"...might release \\"a lot more material\\" relevant to the US electoral campaign...\\" Following the publication of the stolen emails, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized WikiLeaks for its wholesale leakage of data, writing that \\"their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake.\\" The Washington Post contrasted the difference between WikiLeaks' practices and Snowden's disclosure of information about NSA: while Snowden worked with journalists to vet documents (withholding some where it would endanger national security), WikiLeaks' \\"more radical\\" approach involves the dumping of \\"massive, searchable caches online with few‚Äîif any‚Äîapparent efforts to remove sensitive personal information.\\" On July 25, 2016, Anne Applebaum, columnist for The Washington Post, writes that > ... with the exception of a few people on Twitter and a handful of print > journalists, most of those covering this story, especially on television, > are not interested in the nature of the hackers, and they are not asking why > the Russians apparently chose to pass the emails on to WikiLeaks at this > particular moment, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. They > are focusing instead on the content of what were meant to be private emails > ... She goes on to describe in detail other Russian destabilization campaigns in Eastern European countries. On July 25, 2016, Thomas Rid, Professor in Security Studies at King's College, London, and non-resident fellow at the School for Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, DC, summed up the evidence pointing to Russia being behind the hacking of the DNC files and the \\"Guccifer-branded leaking operation\\". He concludes that these actions successfully blunted the \\"DNC's ability to use its opposition research in surprise against Trump...\\" He further writes that data exfiltration from political organizations is done by many countries and is considered to be a legitimate form of intelligence work. \\"But digitally exfiltrating and then publishing possibly manipulated documents disguised as freewheeling hacktivism is crossing a big red line and setting a dangerous precedent: an authoritarian country directly yet covertly trying to sabotage an American election.\\" Russian security expert and investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov said \\"It is almost impossible to know for sure whether or not Russia is behind a hack of the DNC's servers\\". According to him, one of the reasons Russia would try to sway the US presidential election is that the Russian government considers Clinton \\"a hater of Russia\\": \\"There is this mentality in Russia of being besieged; that it is always under attack from the United States ... They are trying to interfere in our internal affairs so why not try to do the same thing to them?\\" Civil DNC lawsuit On April 20, 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New York, accusing the Russian government, the Trump campaign, Wikileaks, and others of conspiracy to alter the course of the 2016 presidential election and asking for monetary damages and a declaration admitting guilt. A hearing on the defendants' motions to dismiss was scheduled for May 17, 2018. In July 2019, the suit was dismissed with prejudice. In his judgement, federal judge John Koeltl said that although he believed the Russian government was involved in the hacking, US federal law generally prohibited suits against foreign governments. The judge said the other defendants, \\"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\\" and were therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC's argument was \\"entirely divorced from the facts\\" and even if the Russians had directly provided the hacked documents to the Trump team, it would not be criminal for the campaign to publish those documents, as long as they did not contribute to the hacking itself. Koeltl denied the defendants motion for sanctions, but dismissed the suit with prejudice, meaning it had a substantive legal defect and could not be refiled.

The dance hall is of primarily log construction with an open log-truss roof. It measures about by on a stone and concrete foundation. The logs are shaped to fit closely, without chinking. The roof is a clipped gable, with a porch extension to the front over the large double entry doors. The dance floor was designed to float on 24 box car springs to optimize it for rhythmic group dancing. The Woods Landing Dance Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 13, 1985. It continues to operate as part of the Woods Landing Resort.

A lieutenant-colonel when commander of the police special forces of the Interior Ministry of Tajikistan until 2015, he then defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In September 2016, he was reported to have been appointed as the minister of war of ISIL in place of Abu Omar al-Shishani; his appointment had not been announced by ISIL for fears that he might be targeted in airstrikes by the anti-ISIL coalition. On 8 September 2017, Khalimov was allegedly killed during a Russian airstrike in Deir ez-Zor. However, recent reports, indicate that he is in Idlib and has lost his position as the IS \\"minister of war. The U.S. has not confirmed Khamilov's death and he remains the subject of a $3,000,000 bounty by the Rewards for Justice Program. History = Early life = He was born 14 May 1975 in Varzob, Tajikistan, then part of the Soviet Union. = Service with the Tajik security forces = Khalimov eventually joined the Tajik security forces, was trained as sniper and rose to lead the Tajik OMON special forces; in this position, he was considered to be \\"one of the best trained officers in the country\\". He helped the government to repress Islamist extremists during the Tajikistan insurgency. From 2003 to 2014, Khalimov participated in five counterterrorism training courses in the United States and in Tajikistan, through the United States Department of State's Diplomatic Security/Anti-Terrorism Assistance program. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Khalimov disappeared in late April 2015 and resurfaced on 28 May 2015 in an ISIL video. Although hundreds of Tajiks had already joined ISIL by this point, Khalimov's defection was an \\"unprecedented case\\" due to his being a successful, high profile officer and part of the establishment rather than the poor, from whom Islamist groups mostly recruit. According to regional expert Deirdre Tynan, Khalimov's defection was nevertheless symptomatic, as \\"there is an element of doubt in people within the [Tajik] civil and security services about what is the trajectory of their countries\\" and increasing support for radical religious ideologies. Khalimov was the most prominent of the more than 2,000 Tajiks reported to have joined ISIS. After joining ISIL, Khalimov travelled to Syria, where he was reportedly appointed war minister, and became an important recruiter for the group. In July 2017, four of his relatives in Tajikistan were killed and three arrested by security forces; according to the government, they were ISIL supporters. =Tajik reaction= Tajik Prosecutor- General Manuchehr Makhmudzod announced on 29 May 2015 that a probe had been opened into Khalimov's activities. The Prosecutor-General's Office said on June 3 that Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov was wanted for crimes including high treason and illegal participation in military actions abroad. \\"Acting for mercenary means, he joined the international terrorist organization calling itself Islamic State,\\" the statement said. =US and UN sanctions= On 29 September 2015 he was made subject to sanctions by the United States Department of State. He was also made subject to sanctions by the United Nations Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee on 29 February 2016. In August 2016, the United States Department of State issued a $3 million USD bounty on Khalimov under its Rewards for Justice program. Reported death On 8 September 2017, Khalimov was allegedly killed during a Russian airstrike in Deir ez-Zor, possibly along with Abu Muhammad al-Shimali, with unconfirmed reports of the attack using Russia's largest non-nuclear bomb.

On October 4, 2016 the film was released on iTunes and other Video On Demand platforms by Gravitas Ventures. Plot All Through the House revolves around the story of a Christmas-obsessed neighborhood that becomes engulfed in fear when five-year- old Jamie Garrett mysteriously vanishes from her home. Citing various different explanations ranging from Krampus to kidnapping, the adult denizens of the district begin to treat the young girl's mother and her home as the stuff of a spooky, holiday-themed legend. The missing girl‚Äôs house goes dark as her mother becomes a depressed recluse. The local children, mesmerized by the seemingly-haunted story, trade bedtime fears about their missing friend, eventually turning the tragedy into an innocuous fairytale. Fifteen years later, Rachel Kimmel, a 22-year-old student, comes home for Christmas. The offbeat and slightly creepy Mrs. Garrett invites Rachel to her home as she finally emerges from her self-imposed exile, determined to make this Christmas a jovial one to be remembered, which brings Rachel‚Äôs memories of the missing girl rushing back to her. All the while, the same neighborhood is being terrorized by a faceless killer dressed in a Santa suit and mask who stalks the wintery streets- slaughtering women and castrating men. Rachel and her two best friends soon find themselves trapped in a grisly nightmare, fighting for their lives as the Santa killer's obsession zeroes in on them as well as Mrs. Garrett and her festively-decorated home. After various terrifying encounters with the Santa killer that leave a trail of even more dead bodies behind, Rachel finally uncovers the madness behind the Santa mask and the truth behind the mysteries of the neighborhood's past. The killer‚Äôs twisted revelation sends Rachel into shock as she learns her own sick connection to the Garrett family legacy.

Europaeus studied in Turku where he got influenced by early Fennoman movement. Following to his appointment as vicar in Liperi in 1832, he developed folk education and library system. Europaeus was member of committee that planned new ecumenical law to Grand Duchy of Finland. He took part in Diet of Finland 1863‚Äì1864 as representative of clergy. Europaeus was married twice and he got altogether ten children.  Early years and studies  Europaeus was born in Kuolemaj√§rvi which was part of Old Finland, ruled by Russian Empire, major part of Finland still being under Swedish rule until 1809. His parents were chaplain of Parikkala Isak Emanuel Europaeus and Maria Kristina n√©e Steen. He completed his matriculation exam in 1817. Europaeus was interested in careers as teacher or theologist. Eventually, he opted the latter and continued his studies in Theological Faculty at Imperial Academy of Turku. In Viipuri Europaeus had got influenced about local Fennoman movement which emphasised education and awareness. After moving to Turku, the contemporary political-artistic Finnish national movement called Turku Romanticism influenced his nationalistic and religious views. He became friends with Carl Axel Gottlund who was a notable figure in Finnish national awakening. Europaeus later helped him at selling his book Otava. Europaeus regarded the then applied church service ritual boring and hoped it to be more experiential. Europaeus studied at the academy until 1820. He worked as teacher of Russian language in Loviisa in 1821‚Äì1822. In 1822‚Äì1825 Europaeus taught Russian and German languages in Savonlinna Regional School; he graduated as Master of Arts in 1823. Following to Savonlinna, Europaeus continued as teacher in Viipuri.  Clerical career  Europaeus was appointed vicar of Liperi in 1832. Typical to education-oriented priests of his time, he also promoted development of agriculture, administration and care of the poor. At an early stage of Europaeus's career, Liperi was under effect of pietistic preacher Henrik Renqvist who had upset many priests of the area. Instead of confrontation, Europaeus wanted to mediate between Renqvist and the church. Europaeus opposed the seclusion of the pietists but respected their religiosity. He placated the other priests' attitude towards pietists. Europaeus opposed the hard church sanctions; he thought that their time was over and regarded that they cause more harm than good. In 1868 Europaeus founded an orphanage to raise children who had lost their parents in the previous famine.  Developing of education  Europaeus wanted to develop the ethnically Finnish culture and education; he contributed frequently newspaper Sanan Saattaja Wiipurista. In 1857 Europaeus founded in Liperi the first folk school which operated four weeks every autumn and spring. Although the school was discontinued already in 1860, Europaeus had managed to arouse interest in education amongst the peasants, and a new school was established in 1869. Europaeus wanted to develop and widen the education of the clergy. He initiated foundation of Diocese Library that was funded by annual fees collected from priests. The library did not only consist religious books and newspapers, but also included a wide selection of books about human sciences. In 1845 Europaeus founded the first Finnish-speaking folk library in Liperi; the annual five-ruble financing came from the funds of the parish. While large proportion of the books were religious, Europaeus particularly wanted to include into the selection temporal and entertaining reading. Europaeus was interested at investigating Finnish, in particular Karelian history. He wrote several articles about history of settlement in the area. His writings were mainly without scientific basis, and he was largely inspired by Kalevala. In 1843 he was invited to become member of the Danish Royal Nordic Society of Antiquaries which also published his writings. Although libraries and schools started by Europaeus remained short-living, he managed to create favourable atmosphere for folk education.  Political career  During the 1850s Europaeus was member in a committee assigned by the Finnish senate to prepare a new ecumenical law. Due to this, he was awarded Doctor of Theology title. In the 1860s Europaeus took part in politics. He represented clergy in so-called January Committee in 1862 and in Diet of Finland in 1863‚Äì1864. He was a moderate conservative, reserved against large reforms and wanting to proceed with small steps in order to avoid of major failures. He was against the municipal administration reform, but on the other hand supported equal rights to over 21-year-old men and women to manage themselves and their own properties. He initiated founding an upper primary school in Joensuu; this was accepted, and Europaeus became the first inspector of the subsequently founded school. His other initiative, founding a Finno-Ugric faculty in the Imperial Alexander University in Finland was rejected, because it was seen as interfering to internal affairs of the university.  Family  Europaeus was married twice. In 1834 he married Sofia n√©e Boije af Genn√§s, who died already in 1836 soon after giving birth to son Anders Theodor. In 1837 Europaeus married Selma n√©e Lampa, daughter of Helsinki merchant, with whom he got nine children.

Plot The film begins with a man (who later turns out to be the kidnapper, Phil - Richard Tyson) driving his van to an abandoned house in a remote area. He cooks a meal and brings it to the basement, where a girl (Eve - Tina Ivlev) is being held captive, with her leg chained to the floor. Without him noticing, she pulls out a brick and hits him violently on the head. She searches for the keys, unlocks the chain holding her leg and uses it to chain his leg. She rushes out of the house, just to find out she's completely stranded in the middle of nowhere, with no one to ask for help. She can't start the van because she doesn't have the van keys. After finding a phone inside the house, she tries to call the police, but it doesn't work. While searching for the van keys, she discovers a revolver and a folder containing photos of some girls, along with their names (even her own photo). She quickly learns that she's not the only victim of Phil. She takes a bath, puts on Phil's clothes before getting back to the basement. She holds the revolver at Phil, asking him where the other girls are. He dares her to kill him, telling her that he's the only one that knows their whereabouts; if she kills him, she will kill them too (he informs her that there are 4 other girls in total). He also makes a deal with her: he shows her the girls, she brings him to the hospital. She goes upstairs, makes a snare, puts it around his neck and leads him to the van, forcing him to take her to the closest victim: a black girl named Nina. Eve finds Nina at the first house, but when she finishes unlocking the chain holding Nina's leg, she rushes out of the house in a hysterical fear - despite Eve's explanation that she's trying to help her. Nina trips over a water hose and falls onto a metal fence, which impales her neck and kills her. Eve makes Phil drive to the next house, where she finds Laura - the second victim - in a room chained to the ceiling. He frees her, but right then, he tells Laura that Eve is about to take her place. Laura angrily beats Eve, giving him the chance to get the snare out of his neck. Eve shoots Laura dead in self-defense and shoots his leg before he can attack her. She beats him with a wooden bar before taking him to the van. He taunts her that she caused the death of those victims (Nina, Laura, and Dylan - another victim girl who appears in the flashback footage with Eve at an amusement park. It is later revealed that Dylan is Eve's sister; she was held captive in the same basement with Eve, and she was dead). She ties him up with duct tape and drives to the next house. She gets in the house alone and finds Lea (Bianca Malinowski) - the third victim - chained in a dark room. Right then, two men - one fat and one skinny - get in the house and go upstairs, ready to rape Lea. Eve recognizes the skinny one to be the rapist that sexually attacked her before. Eve shoots both of them, killing the fat guy immediately and leaving the skinny guy bleeding to death. Lea accompanies Eve to the next location: an abandoned warehouse. They find some girls inside a locked room. They tell Eve and Lea that the kidnappers brought them there, they couldn't do anything but wait for those men to take them away. Eve leaves Lea at the warehouse, telling her to keep an eye on the girls and call the police. When she returns to the van, she finds Phil sitting in the front seat. He distracts her when a tall guy (presumably the captor of the girls in the warehouse) sneaks behind her, then grabs her and subdues her. When she wakes up, Phil is holding her tight, telling the tall guy to shoot her leg, like she did to him before. But at that very moment, Lea appears and hits the tall guy on the head with a spanner, killing him. Eve beats Phil for tricking her. Lea then stays at the warehouse when Eve goes with Phil to the final house. She gets in the house to find no one but her boyfriend Ronnie (who also appears in the flashback footage with Eve and Dylan) sleeping on an armchair. Panic-stricken, she holds the revolver at him and interrogates him why he's there (because it's not his house), and why Phil knows his name (Phil keeps calling Ronnie's name on the way to the houses). He concocts a story that the police didn't help him to find Eve, and in the desperate attempt to look for her, he lost his job. He tries to calm her down, but she suddenly hears a noise at the closet and she takes him there. Eve spots the photos of the victim girls in a folder, but Ronnie again lies to her that on the way searching for her, he found and rescued many girls, except her. She orders him open the closet door and turn on the light. To her horror, she finds Katrina - the last victim - lying inside. Eve now realizes that her boyfriend and Phil are behind all of the kidnappings, including hers. In the van, Phil cuts the duct tape holding his hands, but before he can start the van to get away, he hears gunshots and sees the light flashing inside the house several times, suggesting that Eve shoots Ronnie dead. At that time, the police arrive at the warehouse and free all captive girls there, including Lea. Eve leaves the house, shoots the van in a frenzy of rage, before telling Phil that they will go to the ‚Äúfinal address‚Äù, where it turns out to be Phil's house (a flashback reveals that she asks Ronnie for Phil's address before finishing him off). Afraid that his wife and daughter may find out his true colors, he pleads with her not to go there, but this bears no fruit. She throws him in front of his house. His wife is terrified to find her husband severely beaten. She quickly brings him into the house, but before his daughter closes the door, a hand (Eve's hand) holds it open, implying that she comes back to exact her revenge on Phil. What really happened to him and his family remains unknown. The movie ends with the satisfied Eve walking away, then standing on the street, with a cold and murderous look on her bloody face.

On June 26, 2015 the film had a limited theatrical release in the United States prior to its release on home media on November 11 of the same year, also in the United States. Reception Critical reception for Bound to Vengeance has been negative and the movie currently holds a rating of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews, and 27 on Metacritic, based on 5 reviews. Common criticism for the film centered upon its violence and story, which Slant Magazine felt \\"trivializes victim trauma by treating its main character's best-laid plans as punchline fodder.\\" A reviewer for TheFrightFile.com commented that the movie \\"holds one's attention, but not one's faith, telling a story that simply has too many holes to buy into it.‚Äù In contrast, Cinema Crazed gave a more favorable opinion and commented that the film would be polarizing, that it would be best appeal to a niche audience, and that it was an entertaining example of revenge exploitation cinema. Shock Till You Drop editor Chris Alexander wrote a mixed review, writing \\"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good film but it‚Äôs tight, taut, never dull and offers some nice deviations from the usual revenge programmer, enough that I certainly can recommend it as a fine bit of filthy time-wasting.\\" References * External links 2015 films 2015 horror films 2010s exploitation films 2015 horror thriller films American exploitation films American horror thriller films American films English-language films Films about kidnapping Rape and revenge films ","title":"Bound to Vengeance"},{"id":"51141627","text":"Alan Gustavo Ram√≠rez G√≥mez (born November 23, 1989 in Guadalajara, Jalisco) is a Mexican professional footballer who last played for Loros UdeC.

Rodchenkov is known for his involvement in the state-run doping program in Russia. In November 2015, the Independent Commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had determined that Rodchenkov was ‚Äúat the heart of the positive drug test coverup‚Äù, and that he had been directly involving with concealing positive tests and destroying 1,417 urine samples. Rodchenkov made headlines in 2016 after an interview to The New York Times exposing the doping program in Russia. Rodchenkov said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of athletes at Sochi Olympics. Rodchenkov's allegations were confirmed by the independent McLaren Report, leading to Russia's partial ban from the 2016 Summer Olympics and total ban from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Since the revelations became public, Rodchenkov has been living in hiding. Rodchenkov and his connections to Russian doping were the subject of the 2017 Netflix documentary Icarus, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 90th Oscars ceremony.  Life and career  Grigory Rodchenkov graduated from Moscow State University and received his Ph.D. in chemistry. From July 2006 until November 2015 he has worked as the director of the Anti-Doping Center, Russia's only laboratory accredited by WADA. = Doping investigation in 2011 = In 2011, Russian authorities opened an investigation against Rodchenkov's sister, champion runner , for buying and possessing banned drugs that she admitted she had intended to supply to athletes. Rodchenkov was also arrested in relation to this investigation and questioned on suspicion of sourcing and selling banned drugs. Charges against him were eventually dropped, but his sister was convicted and jailed in December 2012. At the time Rodchenkov was the director of the Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. In June/July 2013, British journalist Nick Harris informed International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA about this criminal drug case and suspicions of Rodchenkov's involvement, but this information was apparently ignored. Rodchenkov claims that he was not jailed by Russian authorities in 2012 because they had earmarked him to dope their athletes at 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. = Doping scandal after 2014 = In 2015, numerous accusations against Rodchenkov came from the WADA Independent Commission (IC). The IC established that Rodchenkov \\"not only accepted, but also requested money\\" from athletes in order to conceal their positive test results. \\"Rodchenkov had personally instructed and authorized the disposal of 1,417 samples\\" prior to the arrival in Moscow of a WADA audit team, which \\"directly defied and violated the WADA directives\\". Besides, \\"Rodchenkov instructed that all records showing the existence of the samples, as well as any documentation of the resulting analysis, be destroyed\\". Rodchenkov later admitted that he destroyed the samples on purpose in order to limit the extent of WADA's audit. The IC report concluded that Rodchenkov was \\"at the heart of the positive drug test coverup\\". Shortly after release of the IC report, the Moscow Antidoping Center headed by Rodchenkov since 2006 was suspended by WADA. In January 2016, fearing for his safety, Rodchenkov boarded a flight from Moscow to Los Angeles and settled in the United States, where he is currently in the witness protection program. Two major Russian anti-doping executives, Vyacheslav Sinyev and Rodchenkov's friend Nikita Kamaev, unexpectedly died in the months after the doping scandal started. Rodchenkov discussed doping at the Sochi Olympics with whistle-blower Vitaly Stepanov, who recorded 15 hours of their conversations without his knowledge. Rodchenkov also gave details to The New York Times, alleging that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was involved in covering up positive doping samples. In July 2016, the McLaren Report, an independent investigation commissioned by WADA found corroborating evidence after conducting witness interviews, reviewing thousands of documents, cyber analysis of hard drives, forensic analysis of urine sample collection bottles, and laboratory analysis of individual athlete samples, with \\"more evidence becoming available by the day.\\" The Moscow laboratory \\"operated under State oversight and control\\" and \\"personnel were required to be part of the State directed system that enabled Russian athletes to compete while engaging in the use of doping substances\\". On 9 December 2016, McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. Emails indicate that they included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old. According to McLaren's summary of the evidence provided by Dr. Rodchenkov, a key aspect of the doping scheme was the creation and use of a so-called \\"Sochi Duchess List\\". This list contained the names of 37 Russian athletes \\"whose samples were to be automatically swapped for their own clean urine stored in the FSB Command Center at Sochi\\". Those athletes' samples needed to be swapped because the athletes \\"had been authorised to use the cocktail of oxandrolone, methenolone and trenbolone during the Games\\". The Russian Olympic Committee insists that the Duchess List is nothing more than a competition schedule, which was prepared ahead of the Sochi Games for the purpose of identifying potential medalists. During the Arbitration between Alexander Legkov v. International Olympic Committee (IOC), the IOC submits that \\"Dr. Rodchenkov's account of events is truthful and accurate\\", stating: * Since Dr. Rodchenkov is no longer in Russia, he is now able to speak honestly with less fear of the consequences than if he had chosen to describe the existence and detail of the scheme while he was in Russia. * Dr. Rodchenkov's statements are precise and clear. They are also very consistent and contain \\"no contradictions\\" between the various elements of his account. * Dr. Rodchenkov only provided detailed information concerning particular athletes when he appears to have specific information relating to those athletes. In many cases, he simply mentions the athlete's presence on the Duchess List and the objective consequence of this, without seeking to add specific details. * On every occasion when other evidence has been available, that evidence has \\"systematically corroborated\\" Dr. Rodchenkov's account According to the IOC, minor inconsistencies in his testimony were considered unimportant. For example, the Duchess Cocktail which he developed was originally described in writing as a mixture of trenbolone, oxandrolone and methasterone; but was subsequently described as containing metenolone, not methasterone. Dr. Rodchenkov stated that the word \\"methasterone\\" in the original was a \\"typographical error\\". Rodchenkov stated that he personally had never distributed the Duchess Cocktail, had never seen an athlete take the mixture or instruction being given to either them or to coaches to use the substance, and had never seen an athlete give a clear urine sample or \\"tamper with a doping sample.\\" Dr. Rodchenkov also stated that: (a) he \\"never observed first hand any bottles being opened or de-capped\\"; (b) accordingly, he did not know the \\"precise method\\" used to open the bottles; but (c) he did see a \\"table with instruments that resembled a dentist's tools\\". According to the Arbitral Award in the arbitration between Alexander Legkov, Russia v. IOC, Dr. Rodchenkov's statement is called \\"a bare assertion which is uncorroborated by any contemporaneous documentary evidence. As such, the probative weight of this evidence is limited and the Panel is unable to find based on such evidence that the Athlete committed and ADRV\\".  Reactions  Following the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Rodchenkov the Order of Friendship. In 2016, after the doping allegations were widely reported, Putin called Rodchenkov a \\"man with a scandalous reputation.\\" The McLaren Report stated that Rodchenkov was \\"an integral part of the conspiracy to extort money from athletes in order to cover up positive doping test results\\". It also found that Rodchenkov was truthful with respect to the subject matter under investigation. In November 2017, an IOC panel concluded: \\"Whatever his motivation may be and whichever wrongdoing he may have committed in the past, Dr. Rodchenkov was telling the truth when he provided explanations of the cover-up scheme that he managed.\\" On December 5, 2017, it was announced that Russia would be banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Following the announcement, Jim Walden, an attorney for Rodchenkov, issued a statement applauding the decision by the IOC that sends \\"a powerful message that it will not tolerate state-sponsored cheating by any nation.\\" > As the world has seen, Dr. Rodchenkov provided credible and irrefutable > evidence of the Russian state-sponsored doping system,\\" Walden said in a > statement. \\"Russia's consistent denials lack any credibility, and its > failure to produce all evidence in its possession only further confirms its > high-level complicity. Russia's doping program and Rodchenkov's work was highlighted in testimony before the U.S. Helsinki Commission (also known as the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe) in Washington, DC on February 22, 2018. During that hearing, Walden discussed Rodchenkov's work in detail and suggested that the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee needed to do more to restore integrity to international sport. Despite the information presented in the McLaren report, Russia was reinstated by the IOC for international competition in September 2018. In an editorial published in the American newspaper USA Today, Rodchenkov expressed his dismay at the decision calling it \\"catastrophic.\\". His lawyer, Jim Walden, issued a statement on behalf of Rodchenkov saying that the decision to reinstate Russia is \\"the greatest treachery against clean athletes in Olympic history.\\" Rodchenkov continues to fear for his life and remains in hiding under protective custody. =In Russia= Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported that sports minister Pavel Kolobkov said the investigative committee found no evidence to support the state operated a doping system. That committee seeks Rodchenkov's extradition from the United States, where he is in witness protection. Despite assertions from Russian officials that no system existed, \\"empirical evidence is totally to the contrary,\\" IOC member Dick Pound said, adding, \\"so I think what we're seeing in the Russian press is for domestic consumption.\\" = Lawsuit by Mikhail Prokhorov = Following Russia's banning from the 2018 Winter Olympics and the stripping of medals from multiple Russian athletes, Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, controlling owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, agreed to finance a defamation lawsuit in New York against Rodchenkov. The suit claims that Rodchenkov defamed three Russian biathletes ‚Äî Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina ‚Äî when Rodchenkov included them on a list of athletes who took performance-enhancing drugs as part of a state-controlled program that corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The women, who were stripped of the silver medal they won as part of a relay team, are seeking $10 million each in damages. In April 2018, Rodchenkov, through his lawyer, Jim Walden, countersued Prokhorov under New York's anti-SLAPP law claiming that Prokhorov's suit was frivolous and intended to limit individuals from exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech. According to published reports, the countersuit is likely to seek the names of other individuals who are financing the lawsuit against Rodchenkov as well as information about the assets of Prokhorov. > \\"Prokhorov has assets here,\\" Walden said. \\"We need to go about expeditiously > securing them, so he doesn't go about taking them out of the country. You > can expect that's what we're going to be looking at next.\\" Walden stated that he believes Prokhorov's lawsuit was intentionally designed to uncover Rodchenkov's whereabouts in the United States and allow agents of the Russian government to find him.  Icarus  Rodchenkov was featured in the 2017 Netflix documentary Icarus, directed by Bryan Fogel. In Icarus, Rodchenkov describes his involvement in a conspiracy to help Russian athletes to beat doping tests in the Olympic Games. On March 4, 2018, Icarus won Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

The building was then called the Leesburg Stockade, and gave its name to the event. The young prisoners became known as the Stolen Girls... Background In July, 1963, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (the SNCC), in cooperation with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, organized a protest march in Americus from the Friendship Baptist Church to a segregated movie theater. As part of the protest, a group of young women joined the line to attempt to purchase tickets at the movie theater, and were arrested for doing so. After being held briefly in Dawson, Georgia, the protesters were moved to the Leesburg Stockade. Estimates of the number of young women who were held there range from 15 to about 30 or as many as 33. Imprisonment Some of the prisoners were as young as 12. Conditions in the stockade were poor: the prisoners had only concrete floors to sleep on, water only in drips from a shower, a single non-functional toilet, and poor food. The prison authorities did not inform the parents of the prisoners of their arrest or location, and they only found out through the help of a janitor. The young women were threatened with murder, and at one point a rattlesnake was thrown into their cell. After the SNCC and Senator Harrison A. Williams used a set of photos by Danny Lyon to publicize the situation,. the young women were released, and did not face any criminal charges, but were nevertheless charged a fee for their use of the facilities. Recognition Two of the Leesburg Stockade women, Carol Barner Seay and Sandra Russel Mansfield, were added to the Hall of Fame of the National Voting Rights Museum in 2007.. The National Museum of African American History and Culture of the Smithsonian Institution publicized the story of the stolen girls in 2016, and they were recognized by a resolution of the Georgia state legislature.. On Friday, September 27, 2019 the Georgia Historical Society erected a Historical Marker at the stockade as part of their Civil Rights Trail.
