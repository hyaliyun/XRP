Sir Henry Ford was a nephew of the dramatist John Ford (1586-c.1639) Early life Henry Ford was born in January 1617 and was baptised at Littleham on 19 January 1617, four months after his father's death in September 1616. His mother remarried five years later in 1621 to John Clobery. Henry matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 21 November 1634 aged 17, 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500‚Äì1714: Flooke-Fyrmin', Alumni Oxonienses 1500‚Äì1714 (1891), pp. 510‚Äì541. Date accessed: 23 June 2012 and went home to look after his inheritance. Parliamentary career In April 1660 Ford was elected Member of Parliament for Lostwithiel in the Convention Parliament, but his election was declared void on 5 May. He purchased Nutwell Court, in Woodbury, near Exeter, which he made his home. He was put in the Commission of the Peace for the county, and was lieutenant-colonel in the militia for the eastern division of the shire, of which he was likewise a deputy-lieutenant.He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1663 On 6 April 1664 he was elected MP for Tiverton in a by-election to the Cavalier Parliament. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Ford, Henry In 1669 he accompanied John, lord Robartes, the lord-lieutenant, to Ireland as secretary of state, but 'to his no little damage and disappointment' was recalled along with his chief the very next year. In 1672 Ford, having been knighted at Whitehall on 20 July in that year,(Le Neve, Knights, Harl. Soc., p. 279) served in the same capacity for Arthur Capel, 1st Earl of Essex. He did not, however, continue in office long, 'for being sent into England on some important affair, contrived by those who were willing to put him out of the way, he returned no more unto Ireland'.(Prince, p. 316) The fact was that his brusque, overbearing manner made him everywhere disliked. He was re-elected MP for Tiverton in the two elections of 1679 and in 1681. Ford died in 1684, aged 65, at Nutwell Court, and was buried in Woodbury Church.(Lysons, Magna Britannia, vol. vi., Devonshire, pt. i. pp. cxcv‚Äìvi, pt. ii. pp. 291‚Äì292) Family Ford left a son Charles, supposed to have died in his minority, and three daughters, married to Drake, Holwell, and Egerton.(Lysons, Magna Britannia, vol. vi. pt: ii. p. 571) References 1619 births 1684 deaths Fellows of Exeter College, Oxford English knights Year of birth uncertain Fellows of the Royal Society English MPs 1661‚Äì1679 English MPs 1679 English MPs 1680‚Äì1681 English MPs 1681 Chief Secretaries for Ireland ","title":"Henry Ford (Tiverton MP)"},{"id":"32746359","text":"Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences (KyAMK) was a university of applied sciences in the region of Kymenlaakso located in Kotka and Kouvola.

Malmesbury Castle He is first mentioned in 1139. His origin is not known, but he is spoken of as a kinsman of William of Ypres, and as one of those Flemish mercenaries who had flocked to England at Stephen's call. On 7 Oct. 1139 he surprised by night Malmesbury Castle, which the king had seized from the Bishop of Salisbury a few months before, and burnt the village. The royal garrison of the castle fled for refuge to the abbey, but Robert soon pursued them thither, and, entering the chapter-house at the head of his followers, demanded that the fugitives should be handed over. The terrified monks with difficulty induced him to be content with the surrender of their horses. He was already plundering far and wide, when Stephen, on his way to attack Trowbridge, heard of his deeds, and, turning aside, laid siege to the castle. At the close of a week, William prevailed on Robert to surrender, and within a fortnight of his surprising the castle he had lost it and had set out to join the Earl of Gloucester. Marlborough Castle After five months in the Earl's service he left him secretly, and on the night of 26 March (1140) surprised and captured by escalade the famous Devizes Castle, then held for the King. The keep resisted for four days, but then fell into his hands. On the Earl of Gloucester sending his son to receive the castle from Robert, he scornfully turned him away from the gate, exclaiming that he had captured the castle for himself. He now boasted that he would be master by its means of all the country from Winchester to London, and would send for troops from Flanders. Rashly inviting John FitzGilbert, castellan of Marlborough, to join him in his schemes, he was decoyed by him to Marlborough Castle and there entrapped. The Earl of Gloucester, on hearing of this, hastened at once to Marlborough, and at length by bribes and promises obtained possession of Robert. The prisoner was then taken to Devizes, and the garrison, according to the practice of the time, warned that he would be hanged unless they surrendered the castle. They pleaded the oath they had sworn to him that they would never do so, and declined. Two of his nephews were then hanged, and at last Robert himself. The castle was subsequently sold by the garrison to the king. This episode is dwelt on at some length by the chroniclers, who were greatly impressed by the savage cruelty, the impious blasphemy, and the transcendent wickedness of this daring adventurer.

A native of Dublin, Ford had been a pupil of engraver John Brooks. When Brooks left Ireland around 1747, Ford set up shop as his successor in a store on Cork Hill. There, he engraved a number of portraits in mezzotint, which on account of their scarcity are highly valued by collectors. He also painted portraits, and engraved some himself. Ford's address as publisher appears on some of the engravings by Andrew Miller and James MacArdell. With the former he seems to have been in rivalry, as they often engraved the same subjects, notably Hogarth's full-length portrait of Gustavus Hamilton, of which Ford's print seems to be the earlier of the two. It is probable that Ford visited London, but this is not certain. On 27 October 1758 the ship Dublin Trader, Captain White, left Parkgate, Cheshire, for Dublin, and foundered in the Irish Sea; she carried 70,000 Irish pounds in money and ¬£80,000 in goods, along with around sixty passengers, among whom were Edward, fifth Earl of Drogheda, the actor Theophilus Cibber, and others.

The ethnic name Kangar is an early medieval name for the Kangly people, who are now part of the Kazakh, Uzbek,Tolstoi V.P. Origin of the Karakalpak people//KSIE, Moscow, 1947. p.75 and Karakalpak nations. The capital of the Kangar union was located in the Ulytau mountains. The Pechenegs, three of whose tribes were known as Kangar (Greek: ŒöŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ±œÅ), after being defeated by the Oghuzes, Karluks, and Kimek- Kypchaks, attacked the Bulgars and established the Pecheneg state in Eastern Europe (840-990 CE).  Etymology  The Kengeres, mentioned in the Orkhon inscriptions, were possibly known in the Islamic world and in the west as Kangar, a collective name for three Pecheneg tribes (of eight).P.Golubovsky, Pechenegs, Torks, and Polovetses before Tatar invasion, SPb, 1884. p.55, in L.Gumilev, Ancient T√ºrks, Ch.20 (In Russian) Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus stated that Kangar signified nobleness and bravery.Constantine Porphyrogenitus, De Administrando Imperio Ukrainian historian Omeljan Pritsak suggested that Kangar originated from Tocharian A *k√¢nk \\"stone\\" and Kengeres combined Kenger with the Iranian ethnonym As, supposedly from *√¢rs < *√¢vrs < *Aoru≈°a (Greek: ŒëŒøœÅœÉŒøŒπ). However, Golden objected that *Aoru≈°a would have yielded Ors/Urs and Pritsak's opinion on the Kengeres-Kangars' ethnonym and mixed Tocharian-Iranian origin remained \\"highly hypothetical\\". Other Orientalists, Marquart, Toltsov, Klyashtorny, attempted to connect the Kangar and Kengeres to the Qanglƒ±, the eastern grouping of the Cuman-Kipchak confederation as well as the Indo-European Kangju in Chinese sources. Akhin≈æanov proposed that the Kipchaks simply assumed the name Qanglƒ± (literally \\"wagon\\") after taking over the Kang region. Nevertheless, all of these connections, if any, remain unclear.  Independence  After the capture of Zhetysu by the Chinese, Kangars become independent from the Turkic Kaganate. The Syr Darya cities retained their autonomy. The Oguzes in the southern Kazakhstan, Kimaks in the Irtysh River valley, Cumans in Mugodjar, and Kypchaks in the northern Kazakhstan became the vassals of the Kangar union. At the end of the 7th century the Syr Darya cities rebelled and formed an alliance with the Sogdiana. The revolt was successful, but the Moslem Arab armies attacked Sogdiana from the south. The revolt has waned, and Kangars consented to the continued autonomy of the Syr Darya cities.  Fall of the Union  At the beginning of the 8th century the Oghuz confederation and the city of Tashkent seceded from the Kangar union. The Arabs continued raiding Sygnakh, Jend, and other rich Kangar cities. The Oguzes formed an alliance with the Kimaks and Karluks, and their joint assault defeated the Kangars, whose union dissolved.Golden, Peter B. (1992).

Biography Simon Ford, son of Richard Ford, was born at East Ogwell, near Newton Bushel, Devon, around 1619. He was educated at the grammar schools of Exeter and Dorchester, and entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1636. He was lineally related to Nicholas Wadham, the founder of Wadham College, but failed to obtain a scholarship there. In 1641 he proceeded to attain his B.A., and was expelled from Oxford soon afterwards on account of his strong Puritan leanings . When the parliamentary visitors were sent to Oxford in 1647, Ford returned and was received with honour. He attained his M.A. on 12 December 1648, was made a delegate of the visitors in 1649, and was given his B.D. \\"by dispensation, of the delegates\\" on 16 February 1649‚Äì50. His friend, Dr. Edward Reynolds, who had become dean of Christ Church, admitted him as a senior student there and he frequently preached at St. Mary's. A sermon delivered against the Engagement of 1651 led to the removal of his studentship. He became lecturer of Newington Green, London, and later was vicar of St. Lawrence, Reading. There he engaged in much local controversy. In an assize sermon preached in 1654 he denounced the people of Reading for their support of extravagant religious views, and was called before the grand jury to explain his conduct. Two years later a Quaker named Thomas Speed excited his wrath. Ford and Christopher Fowler, another Reading clergyman, published jointly A Sober Answer to an Angry Epistle ... written in haste by T. Speed in London, 1656, to which Speed replied in The Guilty-covered Clergyman unvailed in 1656. In July 1659, Ford left Reading to become vicar of All Saints, Northampton. On 30 January 1661 he preached at Northampton against \\"the horrid actual murtherers of Charles I\\". In 1665 he proceeded to gain his D.D. at Oxford. On 30 March 1670 he was chosen to be minister of Bridewell, London, but resigned the post on becoming vicar of St. Mary, Aldermanbury on 29 December. Failing health compelled him to remove to the rectory of Old Swinford, Worcestershire, which was conferred on him by Thomas Foley on 22 May 1676. Simon Ford died at Old Swinford 7 April 1699, and was buried in his church. His first wife, Ann Thackham, died 21 February 1667. They had at least five children. He then married Martha Stampe of Reading with a licence granted 13 August 1672, having at least one child. Martha Ford died 13 November 1684. His will makes reference to his third wife, Catherine. He was survived by his daughters Mary Hercy and Martha Milward. Works #Ambitio Sacra.

He is a Fellow of the British Academy (elected 2007), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (elected 2005), and a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (elected 2003). He has been a member of the British Sociological Association since 1970. In 2015 he became Chair of Section S4 of the British Academy. In 2016 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Essex University.https://www1.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/ Early life and education John Scott was born in Battersea, London, and spent most of his childhood in Feltham, Middlesex. He attended Cardinal Road Infant school, Hanworth Road Junior school and Hampton Grammar School. Following a repeat year to improve his A-level results he studied for a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology at Kingston College of Technology (now Kingston University) from 1968 to 1971. He started a PhD in sociology at the London School of Economics under the supervision of John Westergaard and Percy Cohen. This work explored the relationships between the concepts of status and class, involving a detailed examination of the work of Talcott Parsons. After two years, Scott moved to Strathclyde University and completed his doctoral thesis in 1976. Career Scott was appointed to a lectureship at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, in 1972. Taking advantage of the Scottish location at a time of the North Sea oil boom and the debate over devolution, he began a project, with Michael Hughes, on the ownership and control of Scottish businesses and the involvement of economic elites in political power. An early paper from this project appeared in The Red Paper on Scotland, edited by future Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Scott was a member of the Quantitative Sociology Group of the British Sociological Association and, through this group, developed an interest in network analysis through contacts established with Barry Wellman, Joel Levine, Michael Schwartz, and Frans Stokman. Moving to Leicester University in 1976, Scott extended his research into an international comparative study of economic networks, working with Stokman and Rolf Ziegler on a project reported in Networks of Corporate Power. He formed the Social Networks Study Group of the British Sociological Association, jointly with J. Clyde Mitchell, and began work that appeared in Social Network Analysis: A Handbook. He also undertook work on capitalist class formation that appeared in Who Rules Britain? At Leicester he was Head of Department from 1992 to 1994, succeeding Terry Johnson (and before him Joe Banks and Ilya Neustadt). A move in 1994 to Essex University, the leading sociology Department in the UK, allowed Scott to develop wider interests in sociological theory and the history of sociology. He produced Sociological Theory in 1995 and Social Theory in 2006, the former setting out an account of the major ideas of key figures and the latter setting out an analytical account of key themes in sociological analysis. He began a study, with Christopher Husbands and Ray Bromley, of early British sociology, focusing on the work of Victor Branford and Patrick Geddes. At Essex he was Dean of the School of Social Sciences from 2000 to 2003. He moved to Plymouth University in 2008 and was appointed as Pro Vice-Chancellor for Research in 2010. At Plymouth he continued his work on social network analysis, the history of sociology, and social theory, producing, with Peter Carrington, The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis and, as sole author, Conceptualising the Social World. He retired from Plymouth University in 2013. Scott was elected as President of the British Sociological Association in 2001, succeeding Sara Arber, having previously held the posts of Newsletter Editor, Secretary (1990‚Äì1992), Assistant Treasurer (1996‚Äì1998), and Chairperson (1992‚Äì93). He is currently an Honorary Vice-President. He is a member of the Research and Higher Education Policy Committee of the British Academy. Scott has served on the Sociology Panel for the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), was Panel Chair in the 2008 RAE, and was appointed as Panel Chair for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. He has also been an Assessor for the Teaching Quality Assessment, the A-Level Core Curriculum Working Party of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the Subject Benchmarking Group of the Quality Assurance Agency, and numerous other committees. He was an Adjunct Professor at Bergen University, Norway, from 1997 to 2005 and has held short visiting positions at Hirosaki University, Ritsumeikan University, Hitotsubashi University, and Saitama University in Japan, and at the University of Hong Kong. He currently holds a Visiting Professorship at the University of Essex, UK, an Honorary Professorship at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and an Honorary Visiting Professorship at the University of Exeter, UK. Scott was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to social science. Class, power, and elites Scott has been one of the few British sociologists to investigate the capitalist class and its power. His research in stratification and political economy has explored the changing patterns of ownership in contemporary capitalist economies and the ways in which these changes are reflected in elite recruitment. Critical of the prevailing managerialist interpretation of business enterprise, he developed the influential concept of 'control through a constellation of interests' to describe the dispersed forms of ownership and control that allow representatives of dominant shareholding interests in Britain and the United States to exercise a constraining power over internal business decision-making.Corporations, Classes and Capitalism, John Scott, London, Hutchinson, 1979. His research on networks of shareholding and interlocking directorships has documented the structures and mechanisms through which this constraining power operates. The research has depicted the varying, path-dependent patterns of control found in major capitalist economies.Capitalist Property and Financial Power, John Scott, Brighton, Wheatsheaf, 1986. Scott has contrasted the 'Anglo-American' pattern of controlling constellations with the 'German' pattern of aligned corporate filiations, the 'Latin' pattern of 'corporate webs', and the 'Japanese' pattern of corporate sets.Corporate Business and Capitalist Classes, John Scott, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1997. Scott explored, in the British case, the historical development of a capitalist class through a close association of landholding and financial interests and showed the mechanisms through which this class could be described as a ruling class.Who Rules Britain? John Scott, Cambridge, Polity Press, 1991. Theory and methodology Social network analysis has been at the heart of Scott's methodological work. He has helped to popularise this method of structural analysis through synthesising texts and his own applications of the method. He has, in addition, undertaken work on the use of documents in social research, producing, in 1990, A Matter of Record as one of the first texts on this topic. Like his work on social network analysis,Social Network Analysis, John Scott, London and Beverley Hills, Sage Publications, 1992. this work developed from a practical research involvement in the use of the method. Scott's reflections on documentary research derived initially from his use of company records, civil registration records, and newspapers as source materials in his studies of business organisation. Scott's commitment to social theory as the core sociological activity dates from his early engagement with the work of Talcott Parsons and has been inspired by that writer's commitment to theoretical synthesis.Towards a Theoretical Model of Status, John Scott, PhD thesis, University of Strathclyde, 1976 Scott's view is that behind the contending theoretical explanations proposed by different theorists there is a set of concepts that constitutes a shared foundation for sociological analysis. Thus, concepts of 'structure' and 'action', for example, may inform a variety of competing accounts of particular social phenomena, but there is no necessary opposition between structural and agential accounts. Conceptualisations of the social world can be seen as complementary to each other, and sociologist should eschew the overemphasis of difference if comprehensive, cooperative endeavours are to be produced. Scott's latest work highlights the achievement of sociology as a discipline in establishing a set of fundamental principles of sociological analysis that can be used cooperatively. These are culture, nature, structure, action, system, space- time, mind, and development.Conceptualising the Social World. Principles of Sociological Analysis, John Scott, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2011. The view that these basic principles of sociological analysis were established early in the history of the discipline and have subsequently been developed and elaborated underpins Scott's interest in the history of sociology. His books on theory have concentrated on the earliest statements of the various arguments considered and have led him to investigate the ideas of many now-forgotten figures. He has, in particular, explored early British sociology and has begun to establish the reputation of Victor Branford, the founder of the Sociological Society and the Sociological Review and the only British sociologist to have been made an Honorary Life member of the American Sociological Society.Victor Branford and the Building of British Sociology, John Scott and Christopher T.

She was inspired by the work of the Soviet psychologist Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky, the founder of cultural- historical psychology. Chaves was a proponent of the empty acts theory in children's learning processes. The theory argues that the relationship between teachers and students must be focused on the Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, in order to avoid negative interactions with other students, potencializing the ability to interpret, as a complex interaction between the text and the reader, the information symbols represent, and to be able to re- create those same symbols so that others students can derive the same meaning.

Early life Born in Rochester, New York to Frank and Geneva Bowen, Bowen had spent his early childhood in the Port Norris section of Commercial Township, New Jersey, in Brielle, New Jersey and in Crisfield, Maryland. He was raised from nine months old by Delacy Justice, a Jazz singer, and Henry Ellington, a Gospel singer. He had moved from Port Norris to Brielle in 1954, and then to Crisfield, MD in 1959. He began singing at an early age, first starting out singing in local church choirs with Ellington at the age of 7 in the Port Norris area, and had continued to sing in church choirs throughout his childhood. Career =1960-1980= In 1960, Bowen got his start singing with a local band, The Rockets in Maryland where he had gone by the name of Little Johnny Redding, the moniker arising from his emulation of Otis Redding‚Äôs style. His adoption of this nickname was also due to him being the youngest member of the band, with all of the other members being at least ten years his senior. He stayed with The Rockets until he moved to Lakewood Township, New Jersey, in 1965. It was during his tenure with The Rockets that he met Clarence Clemons, who was attending Maryland State College and was moonlighting with the band The Vibratones. Bowen and Clemons would frequent each other's bands early on, which helped foster a 50-year musical relationship. After moving to Lakewood, New Jersey, Bowen was drafted into the US Army in December, 1966 and served on the Korean Demilitarized Zone until 1968, where he had reached the rank of SP-4. Upon Bowen‚Äôs honorable discharge in 1968, he had started singing as lead vocalist of Soul Flame, a local Asbury Park, New Jersey West Side R&B; and Soul band, from 1968 to 1970. Then, after leaving Soul Flame, Bowen became the lead vocalist of the Chosen Few, another Asbury Park West Side R&B; band from 1969 to 1976. Around the period 1970-71, Clarence Clemons also played with the Chosen Few before moving on to work with Bruce Springsteen. After his time singing with the Chosen Few, Bowen joined the band Surrender in 1976 as lead vocalist until 1981. =1980-1995= In 1980, Bowen had been invited by Scarlet Rivera to sing vocals for the first time on a record album for the song ‚ÄúLift Away‚Äù, which was on Rivera's Jerry Wexler-produced second album: Scarlet Fever. Then, upon Clemons‚Äô opening Big Man's West, a nightclub in Red Bank, New Jersey, Bowen started working as the doorman. Around this time in 1981, Clemons had asked Bowen to join him as lead vocalist for the Red Bank Rockers, where he would sing lead on their debut album Rescue, which featured \\"Woman's Got the Power\\" and a Bruce Springsteen composition, \\"Savin' Up\\".Marsh, David. Glory Days. Duke and Duchess Ventures Inc, 1987, p. 82. The Red Bank Rockers would tour extensively between 1981‚Äì84, including an appearance on the Alan Thicke's late night TV show Thicke of the Night. Also during this period, Bowen lent his vocals to Little Steven & the Disciples of Souls album Men Without Women, the Bruce Springsteen-produced Gary U.S. Bonds album On the Line and the Garry Tallent of the E Street Band- produced album We've Got the Love.Jersey Artists For Mankind - J.A.M.

Backstreets Magazine - Springsteen: The Man and his Music. Backstreets Publishing Inc, 1989, p. 201. Bowen had fronted many bands as well during this period: notably The Shore Patrol with Asbury Jukes Saxophone player Ed Manion and former E Street drummer Ernest Carter. In the early 1990s, he also had toured Japan with the band Joey Leone's Chop Shop. =2010s= In Jan 2011, he performed at Clarence Clemons 69th Birthday Bash at the Hard Rock Cafe Seminole in Hollywood, Fla. He then reemerged on the Asbury Park Music Scene on April 3, 2011 with a sold out Stone Pony show with the Sensational Soul Cruisers. On July 17, 2011, Bowen and the Soul Cruisers were joined on stage at the Wonder Bar by Bruce Springsteen at a tribute show to Clarence Clemons.

They had cone-like reproductive structures reminiscent of those of modern conifers. The Cordaitales appeared during the Carboniferous Period forming large trees that seem to have been particularly abundant on drier ground, in tropical environments. Also, some tall trees but also shrubby and mangrove-like species of Cordaitales seem to have grown in the Carboniferous coal swamps. Cordaitales were also abundant during the Permian, but became less important during the Triassic and died out during the time of the end-Triassic mass extinction. Many Cordaitales had elongated strap-like leaves, resembling some modern-day conifers of the Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae. Common genera from the Carboniferous include Mesoxylon and Cordaixylon. Other genera are Noeggerathiopsis and Sumaropsis. Features of the female cone (megastrobilus) of the members of Cordaitales indicate that the cone scales, possessed by themselves and their descendants, may correspond to short shoots, rather than leaves. This is because the cone consists of these short shoots, emerging from bracts. Among conifers, a leaf of any kind does not emerge from the axil of a bract.

He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he won the Jim Thorpe Award as the best defensive back in the country and was unanimously recognized as an All-American. He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys sixth overall in the 2012 NFL Draft. Early years Claiborne was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He attended Fair Park High School in Shreveport, where he played for the Fair Park Indians high school football team. He was a three-star recruit according to Rivals.com. He played quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back. As a senior, he had over 2,000 all purpose yards and 30 touchdowns as a quarterback. Claiborne was also on the school's track & field team, where he competed as a sprinter. He won the 100 meters at the 2009 Louisiana Outdoor State Championships, with a career-best time of 10.76 seconds, and also ran the fourth leg on the 4 √ó 100 metres relay squad, helping them earn a first-place finish at 42.06 seconds.

College career LSU Tigers Claiborne attended Louisiana State University, where he played for coach Les Miles's LSU Tigers football team from 2009 to 2011. After spending his freshman season as a backup in 2009, he started 12 games in 2010 and recorded 37 tackles and a team-leading five interceptions as a sophomore in 2010, and was named a second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection. Following his junior season in 2011, Claiborne won the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the year's best defensive back, earned first-team All-SEC honors, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American. Professional career Claiborne was not perceived as a first-round draft pick prior to his junior season. By midseason, however, he had drawn the attention of NFL scouts and analysts, having erased concerns his sophomore production resulted from playing opposite of Patrick Peterson. Towards the end of his junior season, Claiborne had established himself as one of the best cornerback prospects for the 2012 NFL Draft, unanimously projected as a top-6 selection. On January 12, 2012, Claiborne announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2012 NFL Draft. Scouts for the Dallas Cowboys had Claiborne as the highest-graded cornerback in the draft since Deion Sanders. Claiborne scored a 4 out of 50 on the Wonderlic Test, which is an aptitude test given to NFL prospects to test basic intelligence.Mike Florio, Claiborne gives birth to a four on the Wonderlic, NBCSports.com, April 3, 2012. After being drafted, Claiborne admitted he \\"blew the test off\\" (the Wonderlic test) after seeing that it had \\"nothing on the test that came with football\\". Claiborne withheld surgery to repair a wrist injury until after he performed at the NFL Combine and LSU‚Äôs pro day. He sustained a ligamentous injury to his wrist on November 5, 2011, but elected to play through it for the remainder of the season. =Dallas Cowboys= The Dallas Cowboys selected Claiborne in the first round (sixth overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft. The Dallas Cowboys traded their first (14th overall) and second round picks (45th overall) in the 2012 NFL Draft to the St. Louis Rams and received their first round pick (6th overall) which they used to draft Claiborne. Claiborne was the first defensive back drafted in 2012 and was the Cowboys‚Äô highest draft pick since they drafted Terence Newman fifth overall in 2003. During the pre-draft process, the Dallas Cowboys did not have a pre-draft visit with Claiborne as they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think it was realistic‚Äù he would be available at 14th overall. The Dallas Cowboys‚Äô owner Jerry Jones stated Claiborne would be the only player the Cowboys would be willing to trade up for in the first round. 2012 On July 23, 2012, the Dallas Cowboys signed Claiborne to a fully guaranteed four-year, $16.4 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $10.3 million. Claiborne was not able to physically participate at rookie minicamp and organized team activities as he recovered from surgery on his wrist. During training camp, Claiborne competed to be a starting cornerback against Mike Jenkins. Head coach Jason Garrett named Claiborne and Brandon Carr the starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season. They began the season starting alongside free safety Gerald Sensabaugh, strong safety Barry Church, and nickelback Orlando Scandrick. He made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the Dallas Cowboys‚Äô season-opener at the New York Giants and recorded four solo tackles during their 24‚Äì17 victory. On October 21, 2012, Claiborne recorded two combined tackles, deflected two passes, and made his first career interception as the Cowboys defeated the Carolina Panthers 19‚Äì14 in Week 7. Claiborne intercepted a pass by Panthers‚Äô quarterback Cam Newton, that was originally intended for wide receiver Louis Murphy, during the second quarter. On December 9, 2012, Claiborne sustained laceration to his face during the third quarter of the Cowboys‚Äô 20‚Äì19 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 14.

In Week 4, he collected a season-high seven combined tackles (six solo) during a 30‚Äì21 loss at the San Diego Chargers. On October 1, 2013, it was reported that the Cowboys had chosen to demote Claiborne to being the third cornerback after he struggled and was replaced by Orlando Scandrick. Claiborne sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him for two games (Weeks 9‚Äì10). In Week 12, Claiborne returned, but further aggravated his hamstring injury during the Cowboys‚Äô 24‚Äì21 win at the New York Giants. Claiborne missed four consecutive games (Weeks 13‚Äì16) and explained his rehabilitation was delayed due to the death of his father and birth of his daughter. He finished the season with 26 combined tackles (24 solo), five pass deflections, and one interception in ten games and seven starts. 2014 On January 28, 2014, the Dallas Cowboys announced their decision to promote defensive line coach Rod Marinelli to defensive coordinator. Former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin was named assistant head coach. Claiborne competed against Orlando Scandrick to be a starting cornerback during training camp. Claiborne missed most of the preseason due to knee tendinitis and an AC joint separation. Head coach Jason Garrett named Claiborne and Brandon Carr the starting cornerback tandem to begin the regular season after Orlando Scandrick was suspended for the first two games. On September 21, 2014, Claiborne recorded a season-high three solo tackles, deflected a pass, and made an interception during a 34‚Äì31 victory at the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. He returned to a reserve role after the third game, even though he made the interception that clinched the win. When told of his demotion from the coaches on September 23, he walked out of the Cowboys' practice facility but returned later that night. On September 28, 2014, Claiborne tore a patellar tendon in his left knee during a 38‚Äì17 victory against the New Orleans Saints. On September 30, 2014, the Dallas Cowboys officially placed Claiborne on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. He finished the 2014 NFL season with seven combined tackles (five solo), two pass deflections, and one interception in four games and three starts. 2015 Claiborne rehabbed his potential career-threatening injury and progressed better than expected, regaining his previous form and being able to avoid missing time in training camp. Throughout training camp, Claiborne competed to be a starting cornerback against Brandon Carr, Orlando Scandrick, and Byron Jones. Head coach Jason Garrett named Claiborne and Brandon Carr the starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season after Orlando Scandrick tore his ACL and MCL during the preseason. Claiborne with the Dallas Cowboys in 2015 In Week 3, he collected a season-high five solo tackles and broke up a pass during a 39‚Äì28 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. Claiborne was inactive for two games (Weeks 11‚Äì12) due to a hamstring and ankle injury. He re-injured his hamstring and was sidelined for the last three games (Weeks 15‚Äì17) of the regular season. Claiborne finished the 2015 NFL season with 37 combined tackles (30 solo) and seven pass deflections in 11 games and 11 starts. 2016 On March 11, 2016, the Cowboys re-signed Claiborne to a one-year contract worth $3 million, that could reach a maximum of $3.75 million with incentives. In training camp, while Orlando Scandrick was out recovering from a knee injury, he earned the starting left cornerback position. During the season, he showed the potential that was expected from him since the 2012 NFL draft and had his best season with the Cowboys. In the week 4 win against the San Francisco 49ers, he played a key role in the fourth quarter with an interception and tackling wide receiver Torrey Smith short of a first down on a crucial 4th-and-6 play, getting the ball back so the Cowboys could run out the clock. In the next game, he limited All-Pro A. J. Green to 4 receptions for 50 yards (including a pass breakup of a sure touchdown), contributing to a 28-14 win against the Cincinnati Bengals. Against the Green Bay Packers, Claiborne had to leave in the third quarter because of a concussion. Unfortunately in the next game after a bye, he severely injured his groin during the Cowboys‚Äô overtime win against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 8. There was a fear that the injury could require season-ending surgery, but the team decided to let it to heal on its own and not place Claiborne on the injured reserve list. After a nine-game absence, he returned for the divisional-round playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, but he injured his ribs in the first half and had to leave the game with 10 minutes left in the third quarter. In five seasons with the Cowboys, Claiborne had 151 tackles, four fumble recoveries, and four interceptions, never recording more than one interception per season and only played in 47 games out of a possible total of 80. =New York Jets= 2017. 2017 On March 18, 2017, Claiborne signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets, who were looking to replace veteran Darrelle Revis at cornerback.

Coming from Maldon in Essex, England, he sailed to New England in 1634 with his wife and two young daughters, settling in Roxbury in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He soon moved to Boston where he became interested in the preachings of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson, and following their banishment from the colony during the Antinomian Controversy, he joined many of their other followers in Portsmouth. In Portsmouth, Freeborn was active in a number of minor civic roles, such as constable, member of the petit jury, and overseer of the poor, and also held the position of Deputy to the General Court for a year. He and his wife both died in 1670, five days apart. They had two daughters and one son, all of whom married and had families. Freeborn became a Quaker, and his death, and that of his wife, are recorded in the Friends' records.  Life  Portsmouth Compact with Freeborn's signature 12th on the list Freeborn originated in the town of Maldon, Essex, England, and was married to Mary Wilson in the nearby St Mary's Church, Mundon on 25 July 1625. He and his wife were enrolled to sail to New England at Ipswich, Suffolk on 30 April 1634, with their two daughters Mary and Sarah, and the teenager John \\"Aldburgh\\" (John Albro). They made the voyage aboard the ship Francis, and upon their arrival first settled at Roxbury, where Freeborn was admitted to the church that year, and where he became a freeman in early September. By 1637 Freeborn was in Boston, when a major theological rift arose in the colony, called the Antinomian Controversy, and he became attracted to the preachings of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson. Following the banishment of these two individuals from the Massachusetts colony, Freeborn and many other followers were disarmed when on 20 November 1637 he and others were ordered to deliver up all guns, pistols, swords, powder and shot because the \\"opinions and revelations of Mr. Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinson have seduced and led into dangerous errors many of the people here in New England.\\" Scores of the followers of Wheelwright and Hutchinson were ordered out of the Massachusetts colony, but before leaving, a group of them, including Freeborn, signed what is sometimes called the Portsmouth Compact, establishing a non-sectarian civil government upon the universal consent of the inhabitants, with a Christian focus. Planning initially to settle in New Netherland, the group was persuaded by Roger Williams to purchase some land of the Indians on the Narragansett Bay. This they did, settling on the north east end of Aquidneck Island, and establishing a settlement they called Pocasset, but in 1639 changing the name to Portsmouth. William Coddington was elected the first chief magistrate of the settlement, not being called Governor, but instead using the Biblical title of Judge. Freeborn had arrived in Portsmouth by 13 May 1638 when he was present at a general meeting there. The following year he was granted a lot on the condition that he build there within a year. In 1641 he was made a freeman of Portsmouth, and the following year he was made Constable of the towns of Portsmouth and Newport. From 1641 to 1655 he held a number of town offices, including member of the town council, overseer and collector for the poor, and member of the petit jury. In 1655 he appeared on a list of freemen for Portsmouth and in 1657 was a Deputy for Portsmouth to the Rhode Island General Court. Freeborn died on 28 April 1670 according to the Friends' records, but the age of 80 given for him is inflated. His only known wife, Mary, died five days later.  Family  With his wife Mary, Freeborn had three known children: Mary, who married Clement Weaver; Sarah, who married Nathaniel Browning; and Gideon, who first married Sarah Brownell, and then married Mary (Boomer) Lawton. Gideon served for several years as a Deputy from Portsmouth, and also as Overseer of the Poor. Freeborn is the ancestor of the first Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Gideon Cornell.

This makes the area ideal for wind energy projects. Beginning in the 1980s the San Gorgonio Pass wind farm started being developed. Many wind turbines were proposed and constructed around the community of Bonnie Bell. Though a tiny community, the people of Bonnie Bell strongly resisted any wind development that encroached on the town, or the ridges around the town. In 1992 the residents successfully lobbied the Bureau of Land Management, and Mesa Wind Developers, to move 24 wind turbines from the eastern edge of the company's right-of-way, further back into the San Bernardino Mountains. In 1999, and again in 2019, new proposals to install wind turbines on the ridges of Whitewater Canyon, above Bonnie Bell, were submitted for consideration.

The ideal Warlander combines the Iberian horse's intelligence, facility for collection, flexibility, and powerful hindquarters, with the Friesian's tractability, dramatic leg action, \\"bone,\\" and strong forequarters. History The crossing of Iberian and Friesian-type horses to produce improved cavalry horses has a history going back to at least the sixteenth century, though the term \\"Warlander\\" was coined only in the late twentieth century by the Classical Sporthorse Stud in Western Australia who named the breed after their association with veterinarian Dr Warwick Vale.http://www.warlander.com.au/warlanderhistory.htm Characteristics Warlander breeders seek to augment the strongest and most desirable qualities of Iberian and Friesian breeds through the genetic heterosis created by combining two purebred lines. Another goal is to address concerns related to inbreeding depression that may exist in progenitor lines as a result of having closed genetic stock. Because of this, significant debate exists over whether a Warlander will only obtain genetic benefit if it is an F1 hybrid. A crossbred animal is likely to enjoy hybrid vigor and therefore have genetic gains over both of its parents. However, there is uncertainty over whether an F2 horse - produced by a Warlander-Warlander, Warlander-Andalusian, or Warlander-Friesian pairing - would be likely to suffer from genetic atavism. The statistically tiny number of F2 and subsequent generation Warlander horses bred internationally has meant empirical resolution of this question has not yet been possible.Maharaj, Akaash (2011). A 21st Century Breeding Programme for the 21st Century Cavalry. Toronto: UNICEF Team Canada The Warlander Studbook Society acknowledges that the following genetic defects are known to come from the base breeds of the Warlander and WSS breeders must notify the society if any horses show the following - Cryptorchidism, Monorchidism. Dwarfism, Fallen Crest, Water head/crown head foals (hydrocephalus) and Mesocolic Rente. Recognition Warlander, cross between Friesian and Andulusian Although evidence of breeders utilizing an Iberian-Friesian cross dates back 400 years, the Warlander has been a distinctly organized horse breed only since the 1990s. No breed-specific Warlander organizations are affiliated to the global Universal Equine Life Number (UELN) foundation,UELN Database, Universal Equine Life Number, retrieved August 14, 2011 although the Bavarian Specialist Breed Registry (Bayerischer Zuchtverband f√ºr Kleinpferde und Spezialpferderassen, or BZKS), which does hold a UELN designation for its studbooks, publishes a Warlander breed standard.

Licensed to Salina, Kansas, United States, the station serves Salina and communities to the northwest. The station is currently owned by Eagle Communications. KINA originally went on the air in April 1964 as KLSI. Missouri disk jockey Sam Bradley fought with Kansas broadcaster Sherwood Parks over the original construction permit (CP) for almost 6 years beginning around 1958 until the two agreed to put the station on the air jointly in 1964 with Grover Cobb and Cobb's mother Ruth as stockholders. The call letters would change to KINA in September 1970. Parks would buy out his partners in February 1979 and then sold KINA late the same year to a group of Topeka businessmen, dba Smoky Hill Broadcasting. In 1995 Hays-based Eagle Communications, the current owner, acquired KINA. The broadcast studios were located at 108 E. Walnut in downtown Salina and programmed Top-40 music to a teen audience and the servicemen at Schilling Air Base, which was still operational in 1964. By the late 1970s KINA was broadcasting country music. KINA's dial position at 910 kHz would prove troublesome, as it was exactly on the second harmonic of radios with a 455 kHz IF (intermediate frequency). This resulted in an annoying tone or whistle in the background of the station's programming on home radios. This problem has since been overcome with modern digital radios. Under the current news and talk format, KINA currently airs such syndicated talk shows as The Laura Ingraham Show, The Savage Nation, The Alex Jones Show, The Mark Levin Show, as well as two local talk shows and Fox Sports Radio overnights and weekends.

Service is offered from June to October. However as of 2019 the train will run in winter. History =Grand Trunk & Canadian National Railways= As early as 1928, regular year-round passenger service operated once a day as far as La Malbaie (then referred to as Murray Bay). A seasonal second train per day service operated from June to September from Quebec City. By 1931, the service was extended to Montreal. At this time, only freight would continue to Clermont. By 1944, the extra train operated during summer months was dropped from the schedule, resulting in a once-daily schedule year round. In February 1971, Canadian National Railways extended service to Clermont. =VIA Rail Canada= In 1977, VIA Rail Canada took over operation of most Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railways passenger services. By this time, Gare du Palais was closed for renovations, and Ste-Foy became the origin of all trains on the route, with a stop at Limoilou near the core of Quebec City. VIA Rail began operating the service daily with Budd RDCs. VIA Rail cancelled the train by the end of 1977. =Current tourist railway= Work on starting the train began in September 2008, when renovation of Charlevoix Railway trackage began, partially funded by grants from the national and provincial governments, and with a total cost of C$18.4 million. In April 2010, work began on rebuilding eight railcars at a cost of close to $5 million; the cars were originally built in 1955 and 1956 by the St. Louis Car Company and were previously used in commuter rail service in Chicago. Once refitted, the eight cars had a total capacity of 550 people, and along with two MLW RS-18 locomotives comprise the rolling stock used for the train. The refurbished rolling stock is now in storage, with the current rolling stock being two married pairs of DB Class 628.1,Histoires de train with a third added in 2018 for increased service. In early 2019, it was announced that the train would begin operating during the winter months in partnership with a new Club Med location opening at the ski hill.

The station is currently owned by Alpha Media LLC,. History KSAJ- FM went on the air April 1, 1985, as a re-frequencied KABI-FM, and was licensed to Abilene, Kansas. The ‚ÄúSAJ‚Äù call letters stood for ‚ÄúSalina-Abilene- Junction City‚Äù ‚Äì the primary cities of its coverage area. KABI-FM was originally a 3,000-watt (ERP) Class A station at 98.3 MHz. The frequency change to 98.5 MHz was accompanied by an increase in power to 100,000 watts (ERP), and a physical move of the transmitter site from northwest Abilene to about 10 miles south of Abilene, east of K-15 on 1400 Avenue in rural Dickinson County. Also on April 1, 1985, sister station KABI changed call letters and became KSAJ. The stations simulcast programming for about two years. In 1987, KSAJ returned to being KABI with separate programming, and KSAJ continued on as an FM-only radio station, carrying an oldies format. The station long carried ABC Radio Networks' \\"Good Time Oldies\\" satellite feed before switching to The True Oldies Channel, then switched back to Good Time Oldies in 2014. KSAJ-FM and KABI were sold by broadcaster Norton Warner of Lincoln, Nebraska, to J.K. Vanier and Jerry Hinrikus of Salina, Kansas in late 1991, who later sold them to MCC Radio (Morris Communications) in January 2004. Then on September 1, 2015, Alpha Media LLC acquired the stations. In October 2016, Alpha sold their Salina cluster (which KSAJ-FM was a part of) to Manhattan-based Rocking M Media. Alpha Sells Five in Kansas However, KSAJ-FM was retained by Alpha, who announced plans to move the station into the Topeka market (with the process beginning in the late 1990s) and join it with WIBW and WIBW-FM, and KTPK. In February 2017, after the closing of the Salina cluster's sale to Rocking M, Alpha moved the KSAJ-FM studios from Abilene to Topeka. Initially, the station planned to relocate their transmitter to the tower of WIBW-FM/TV, located west of Topeka in rural Wabaunsee County, and reduce their power output 69,000 watts. However, due to co-channel interference concerns with KQKQ-FM in Omaha, KSAJ-FM changed transmitter sites, first to the site of WIBW (and reduced power to 25,000 watts), and then to the KTWU-TV/KWIC/KTOP-FM tower in northwest Topeka, and reduced power even further to 17,500 watts. At 6 p.m. on November 10, 2017, KSAJ-FM shut down its Dickinson County transmitter, signed on their new Topeka transmitter (with a new city of license of Burlingame), and began stunting with Christmas music as \\"Christmas 98.5.\\" At midnight on December 26, KSAJ-FM debuted its new adult hits format as \\"98.5 Jack FM.\\" Daily Domains 9/18: Country Acquisition & Revamp in Jacksonville?

Geary was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium-fast. He was born in East Croydon, London. Having played for the Surrey Second XI since 1921 in the Minor Counties Championship, he made his first- class debut for Surrey against Somerset in the 1922 County Championship. It wouldn't be until the 1925 season that he became more of a regular starter in the Surrey XI. By the time he played his final first-class match against Lancashire in the 1931 County Championship, he had made 90 first-class appearances. Geary's role within the team was as a bowler, in his 90 first- class matches he took 198 wickets at an average of 30.64, with best figures of 6/50. These figures, one of six five wicket hauls he took in his career, came against Hampshire in the 1927 County Championship, a season in which he took 79 wickets at an average of 25.15, which was his most successful season of his career. A lower-order batsman, Geary scored 670 runs at a batting average of 10.63, with a high score of 40. His time at Surrey was characterised by him making nearly as many appearances for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship as he did for the First XI. With pitches the batsman friendly pitches at The Oval not helping his bowling, with him being all too often overlooked by the Surrey selectors, he left the county at the end of the 1931 season. While playing for Surrey, he stood as an umpire in a first-class match between the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. He soon after moved to Jersey, playing a single match for the Jersey cricket team against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1934. The match was a success for Geary, with him taking a total of 8 wickets in it, as well as scoring a century in Jersey's first- innings. The match though was not rated as first-class. Geary would go on to take 437 wickets against touring teams in eight seasons for the island. He lived out the remainder of his life on Jersey, with him dying in Saint Peter on 21 January 1989.

In 1911, shortly before being amalgamated into the South African Railways, the Natal Government Railways placed the first two of seven Pacific type narrow-gauge tank steam locomotives in service. In 1912, when these two locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways, they retained their engine numbers, but with an \\"NG\\" prefix added.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1944). The Locomotive in South Africa ‚Äì A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter III ‚Äì Natal Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, September 1944. p. 670. Five more of these locomotives were delivered to the South African Railways in 1913 and 1914. When a system of grouping narrow- gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were all designated Class NG4. Natal's narrow gauge Alfred County railway By 1906, the Natal Government had realised that light railways were essential as feeders to open up fertile districts which were distant from the existing main- and branch lines, particularly when the intervening stretches of country were difficult from an engineering point of view. The third narrow-gauge railway line in Natal was the Alfred County Railway which ran from Port Shepstone on the South Coast to Harding. The first section to Paddock was opened on 8 November 1911.Statement Showing, in Chronological Order, the Date of Opening and the Mileage of Each Section of Railway, Statement No. 19, p. 186, ref. no. 200954-13 Manufacturers D.A. Hendrie Like their two predecessor locomotive types, the Hunslet Side-tank of 1906 and the Hawthorn Leslie Side-tank of 1907, this third batch of narrow- gauge Pacific locomotives of the Natal Government Railways (NGR) were also built to the design of NGR Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie, using the Hawthorn Leslie drawings for the Class NG3. The majority of their parts were interchangeable with those of the earlier engines. Between 1911 and 1913, the High Com¬≠mis¬≠sioner for the Union of South Africa placed three orders for altogether seven of these locomotives with Kerr, Stuart and Company.Jux, Frank (1991). Kerr Stuart & Co. Ltd. Locomotive Works List (1st ed.). England: Frank Jux. * Two locomotives were ordered on 10 January 1911. They were dispatched from the factory in September of that same year with Kerr, Stuart works numbers 1207 and 1208, for delivery to the Natal Government Railways. They were numbered NGR 10 and 11 and designated Class N on the NGR roster. * Two more were ordered on 28 September 1912. They were dispatched from the factory in April and May 1913 with works numbers 1294 and 1295, for delivery to the South African Railways (SAR). They were numbered SAR NG12 and NG13. * Three more were ordered on 10 June 1913. They were dispatched from the factory in July 1914 with works numbers 1342 to 1344. They were numbered SAR NG14 to NG16.

The boiler pitch had been raised from to to make a larger firebox possible. They had outside plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes and used Walschaerts valve gear. The most obvious visual differences from the Hawthorn Leslie locomotives were the higher side tanks, the less ornate sand boxes on top of the boiler and the Belpaire firebox hump. As built, they had no headlamps, but some were later equipped with the large oil headlamps which were in use on the SAR at the time.Railway Modelling Scene, South Africa, circa 1985, articles written by Neill Mardell Classification When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways ‚Äì Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, narrow-gauge locomotives were included in the SAR's narrow-gauge numbering scheme, but were not classified. They retained their existing engine numbers, but with an \\"NG\\" number prefix for narrow gauge. The two locomotives which had been delivered in 1911, listed as \\"Late Administration S.A.R. numbers 10 and 11\\" in the renumbering lists, were therefore renumbered NG10 and NG11. The system of grouping SAR narrow-gauge locomotives into classes was only adopted somewhere between 1928 and 1930 and, at that point, these seven locomotives were designated Class NG4.South African Railways and Harbours Narrow Gauge Locomotive Diagram Book, 2'0\\" Gauge, S.A.R.

Since a large part of the territory's railway infrastructure was destroyed or damaged by retreating German forces, an urgent need arose for locomotives for use on the narrow-gauge lines in that territory. In 1917, no. NG12 was transferred to the Defence Department for service in South West Africa. It returned to Natal after the war.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947).

He began as an apprentice for Alexander Chaplin & Co. in Glasgow, and then Anderson & Co. in London. He married Ruth Pearce in early 1860 and traveled to Vancouver Island on August 26, 1860, to construct a sawmill. The two (with one child) traveled to Hawaii in February 1865. They had nine surviving children. Young had operated a small foundry and machine shop in Hilo, Hawaii, with William Lidgate, and business expanded with the growth of Hawaii's sugar plantations. He moved to Honolulu around 1869 and bought the Honolulu Iron Works from Thomas Hughes, who had revived the business after a devastating fire in 1860. In 1875 Theophilus Harris Davies refinanced the Honolulu Iron Works and hired Young as manager. The two then organized the Waiakea Mill Company. Around 1900 he formed the von Hamm-Young Company. Principals were Young's son Archibald Alfred Young and son-in-law Conrad Carl von Hamm. An early project was the Alexander Young Hotel. In 1887 he became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and from 1887-1892 served in the House of Nobles. After the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he served on an advisory council for the provisional Government of Hawaii. From October 27, 1899, to May 18, 1900, he served as Minister of the Interior until the Territory of Hawaii government was established. After Young's death July 2, 1910, and Archibald's in 1925, von Hamm took over the business. It expanded to include automobile dealerships in the 1920s and other businesses. In 1964 it was renamed \\"The Hawaii Corporation\\". After von Hamm's death in 1965 the company eventually liquidated in one of Hawaii's first large bankruptcy cases.

Franklin was a right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was considered the best amateur wicket-keeper of his time. Early career Born in Upper Norwood, Greater London, he was educated at Repton School, where he represented the school cricket team. Franklin went on to make his debut for Buckinghamshire against Berkshire in the 1911 Minor Counties Championship. In that same season he made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Yorkshire. He would go on to make a further 14 first-class appearances for the university, the last of which came against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI in 1913. He gained his Blue in 1912, but in 1913 he did find his opportunities limited by the arrival of Arthur Lang in the team, who the Cambridge selectors thought was a better batsman. A more than capable wicket-keeper, Franklin took 16 catches and made 15 stumpings, an unusual amount considering most wicket- keepers will take considerably more catches in their first-class careers. With the bat in hand, he scored 307 runs at an average of 21.92, with a high score of 68 not out. This score, one of two fifties he made for the university, came against Sussex in 1913. 1914 saw Franklin make his debut for the Marylebone Cricket Club, playing two matches against Oxford University. However, further first-class appearances and appearances for Buckinghamshire were cut short in later in that year when county cricket was cancelled due to the start of World War I. He served in the war and was mentioned once in dispatches, in July 1917, when the London Gazette published details of his temporary promotion to Captain, with him already holding the rank of temporary Lieutenant. Franklin held this rank as a recruiter in the Volunteer Force. Following the war, he returned to play for Buckinghamshire and was made county captain upon his return. In 1921, Buckinghamshire were offered first-class status and the chance to join the County Championship, however Buckinghamshire declined the invitation citing a lack of first-class facilities in the county. The early twenties were a successful period for the county, under his captaincy Buckinghamshire won the Minor Counties Championship in 1922, 1923 and 1925. Further first-class appearances followed for Franklin for the Marylebone Cricket Club, who he would go on to make a further 27 first-class appearances for, the last of which came against Kent in 1933. In 29 first-class matches for the MCC, he scored 660 runs at an average of 17.36, with a high score of 77. This score was one of two half centuries he made for the MCC, and came against Wales in 1925. Behind the stumps he was again proficient, taking 31 catches and making 25 stumpings. Later career He made his first appearance for the Minor Counties in 1924 against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI. His abilities behind the stumps were rated so highly that he was selected to represent the Gentlemen against the Players in 1926. His performances for the Gentlemen in 1926, and his ability behind the stumps were written about by Sir Pelham Warner in his book Lord's, in which he wrote about how well Franklin kept in the match, as well as comparing him as being on the same level as George Duckworth, the then England Test wicket-keeper. He made 6 further first-class appearances for the Gentlemen, playing his last match against the players in 1930. An appearance for the North came in 1928, alongside his appearances for the MCC. He later made further first-class appearances for the Minor Counties in the mid thirties, mostly against touring teams, it was against the touring New Zealanders in 1937 that his final first-class appearance came. At Buckinghamshire, further success came under his captaincy, with the county winning the Minor Counties Championship in 1932 and 1938, making him the most successful captain in Buckinghamshire's history, an accolade which remains to this day. Having played for the county since 1911, making 200 appearances in that time, he finally retired from county cricket in 1946. For a Minor counties cricketer, Franklin made a large number of first-class appearances, making 60 in total and scoring 1,362 runs at an average of 18.91. It was perhaps behind the stumps that he stood out most, taking 63 catches and making an impressive 53 stumpings. Following retirement he became president of the Minor Counties Cricket Association, as well as becoming president of Buckinghamshire County Cricket Club. He also contributed a chapter in the Lonsdale volume on wicket-keeping. He was also a master at the Haberdashers' Company. He died of a heart attack while playing croquet at Knodishall, Suffolk on 5 March 1968. He was survived by his wife, his son Dr. Jonathan M. Franklin and his daughter, Miss Virginia Franklin, with Franklin later being cremated in a private ceremony. A memorial service was held for Franklin on 8 May 1968, with the service being addressed by Sir Ian Bowater, then master of the Haberdashers' Company.

In 1989, he joined the commission of the History Department of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by its corresponding member Yuri Polyakov to determine population losses and received access to statistical reports made by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD and kept in the Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR) renamed the State Archive of the Russian Federation. According to Leonid Lopatnikov, Zemskov was the only historian admitted to the archives for the reports, and later the archives were again \\"closed.\\" Between 1990 and 1992, he published the first precise statistical data on the Gulag which were based on the Gulag archives. However, his papers were criticized by Sergei Maksudov. In Maksudov's opinion, Lev Razgon and his followers including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did not envisage the total number of the camps very well and markedly exaggerated their size. At the same time, from their experience, they knew something extraordinarily important about the Archipelago, its diabolical anti-human nature. On the other hand, Viktor Zemskov, who published many documents by the NKVD and KGB, is very far from understanding of the Gulag essence and the nature of socio-political processes in the country. Without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutizes the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth. As a result, his attempts to make generalized statements with reference to a particular document, as a rule, do not hold water. In response, Zemskov wrote that the charge that Zemskov allegedly did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers is that they do not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he tried not to overuse the juxtaposition of new information with \\"old\\" one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB- MVD. In 2005, Zemskov defended his doctoral thesis \\"Special settlers in the USSR. 1930‚Äì1960\\".

It is part of the Cahuilla Reservation and lies in a high desert valley at an elevation of 3642 feet (1110 m). It is located south by road from mile-high Idyllwild. Cahuilla is on SR 371, about west of Anza, California. The Cahuilla Post Office first opened in 1888, moved in 1889 and 1895, closed in 1903, reopened in 1909, closed for a time in 1919, closed again in 1921, reopened in 1924 before closing for good in 1926. In 1926, the Anza Post Office was officially established. Facilities in Cahuilla have addresses on Highway 371 and use Anza, CA as their postal code. The Cahuilla Casino, first opened in 1996, and Mountain Sky Travel Center, a convenience store and gas station first opened in 2015, are both owned by the Cahuilla Band of Mission Indians of the Cahuilla Reservation and both located in Cahuilla with addresses in nearby Anza. A new casino and hotel, after some delay from the coronavirus, replaced the old casino and was opened May 2020.  2016-2019 Cahuilla Seismic Swarm  From early 2016 to late 2019, Cahuilla got on the map when a swarm of earthquakes occurred nearby, less than to the southwest and near the western edge of the Cahuilla Reservation. More than 22,000 individual seismic events were recorded -- ranging in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.4 -- the strongest one occurred in August 2018, south of Lake Riverside, just off Cahuilla Road (SR 371). By using computer algorithms, researchers were able to piece together a detailed picture of the Cahuilla fault zone responsible for the earthquake swarm. The fault zone is no more than wide, long, with the earliest seismic swarm events localized down near the base at below the surface while the latest events migrating upwards to below the surface and spread throughout the fault zone's length. Containing complex subterranean horizontal channels and prominent bents in its depth profile, the fault zone sits on top of a deeper natural underground reservoir of fluid under pressure with a connector at below the surface that was initially sealed off from the fault zone. When that seal broke open in early 2016, fluids were injected up into the fault zone's base and diffused slowly through the complex channels up to below the surface, which triggered the prolonged earthquake swarm that lasted until late 2019. This analysis provides detailed evidence that fault zone valving is a mechanism for seismogenesis in swarms.

The history of Egypt under the British lasts from 1882, when it was occupied by British forces during the Anglo-Egyptian War, until 1956, when the last British forces withdrew in accordance with the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1954 after the Suez Crisis. The first period of British rule (1882‚Äì1914) is often called the \\"veiled protectorate\\". During this time the Khedivate of Egypt remained an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, and the British occupation had no legal basis but constituted a de facto protectorate over the country. Egypt was thus not part of the British Empire. This state of affairs lasted until 1914 when the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War on the side of the Central Powers and Britain declared a protectorate over Egypt. The ruling khedive was deposed and his successor, Hussein Kamel, compelled to declare himself Sultan of Egypt independent of the Ottomans in December 1914.Panayiotis J. Vatikiotis, The history of modern Egypt: from Muhammad Ali to Mubarak (1991). The formal protectorate over Egypt did not long outlast the war. It was brought to an end when the British government issued the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence on 28 February 1922. Shortly afterwards, Sultan Fuad I declared himself King of Egypt, but the British occupation continued, in accordance with several reserve clauses in the declaration of independence. The situation was normalised in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, which granted Britain the right to station troops in Egypt for the defence of the Suez Canal, its link with the Indian Empire. Britain also continued to control the training of the Egyptian Army. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45), Egypt came under attack from Italian Libya on account of the British presence there, although Egypt itself remained neutral until late in the war. After the war Egypt sought to modify the treaty, but it was abrogated in its entirety by an anti-British government in October 1951. After the 1952 coup d'√©tat, the British agreed to withdraw their troops, and by June 1956 had done so. Britain went to war against Egypt over the Suez Canal in late 1956, but with insufficient international support was forced to back down.  Veiled Protectorate (1882‚Äì1913)  Throughout the 19th century, the ruling dynasty of Egypt had spent vast sums of money on the infrastructural development of Egypt. In keeping with its own military and foreign origin, the dynasty's economic development was almost wholly oriented toward military dual-use goals. Consequently, despite vast sums of European and other foreign capital, actual economic production and resulting revenues were insufficient to repay the loans. Consequently, the country teetered toward economic dissolution and implosion. In turn, European and foreign finances took control of the treasury of Egypt, forgave debt in return for taking control of the Suez Canal, and reoriented economic development toward capital gain. However, by 1882 Islamic and Arabic Nationalist opposition to European influence and settlement in the Middle East led to growing tension amongst notable natives, especially in Egypt which then as now was the most powerful, populous, and influential of Arab countries. The most dangerous opposition during this period came from the Egyptian army, which saw the reorientation of economic development away from their control as a threat to their privileges. A large military demonstration in September 1881 forced the Khedive Tewfiq to dismiss his Prime Minister and rule by decree. Many of the Europeans retreated to specially designed quarters suited for defense or heavily European-settled cities such as Alexandria. Consequently, in April 1882 France and Great Britain sent warships to Alexandria to bolster the Khedive amidst a turbulent climate and protect European lives and property. In turn, Egyptian nationalists spread fear of invasion throughout the country to bolster Islamic and Arabian revolutionary action. Tawfiq moved to Alexandria for fear of his own safety as army officers led by Ahmed Urabi began to take control of the government. By June, Egypt was in the hands of nationalists as opposed to European domination of the country and the new revolutionary government began nationalizing all assets in Egypt. Anti-European violence broke out in Alexandria, prompting a British naval bombardment of the city. Fearing the intervention of outside powers or the seizure of the canal by the Egyptians, in conjunction with an Islamic revolution in the Empire of India, the British led an Anglo-Indian expeditionary force at both ends of the Suez Canal in August 1882. Simultaneously, French forces landed in Alexandria and the northern end of the canal. Both joined together and maneuvered to meet the Egyptian army. The combined Anglo-French-Indian army easily defeated the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country putting Tawfiq back in control. British barracks on the Nile The purpose of the invasion had been to restore political stability to Egypt under a government of the Khedive and international controls that were in place to streamline Egyptian financing since 1876. It is unlikely that the British expected a long-term occupation from the outset; however, Lord Cromer, Britain's Chief Representative in Egypt at the time, viewed Egypt's financial reforms as part of a long-term objective. Cromer took the view that political stability needed financial stability and embarked on a program of long-term investment in Egypt's agricultural revenue sources, the largest of which was cotton. To accomplish this, Cromer worked to improve the Nile's irrigation system through multiple large projects, such as the construction of the Aswan Dam, the Nile Barrage, and an increase in canals available to agriculturally focused lands.Cleveland, \\"A History of the Modern Middle East\\" (Westview Press, 2013) Gathering of Egyptian, Turkish and British royalty in 1911. Queen Mary seated and King George V standing at extreme right In 1906 the Denshawai Incident provoked questioning of British rule in Egypt. This was exploited in turn by the German Empire which began re-organizing, funding, and expanding anti-British revolutionary nationalist movements. For the first quarter of the 20th century, Britain's main goal in Egypt was penetrating these groups, neutralizing them, and attempting to form more pro-British nationalist groups with which to hand further control. However, after the end of World War One, British colonial authorities attempted to legitimize their less radical opponents with entrance into the League of Nations including the peace treaty of Versailles. Thus, the Wafd Party was invited and promised full independence in the years ahead. British occupation ended nominally with the UK's 1922 declaration of Egyptian independence, but British military domination of Egypt lasted until 1936.Vatikiotis, The history of modern Egypt: from Muhammad Ali to Mubarak (1991). During British occupation and later control, Egypt developed into a regional commercial and trading destination. Immigrants from less stable parts of the region including Greeks, Jews and Armenians, began to flow into Egypt. The number of foreigners in the country rose from 10,000 in the 1840s to around 90,000 in the 1880s, and more than 1.5 million by the 1930s.Tarek Osman, Egypt on the Brink (Yale University Press, 2010), 33. Formal Protectorate (1914‚Äì22) In 1914 as a result of the declaration of war with the Ottoman Empire, of which Egypt was nominally a part, Britain declared a Protectorate over Egypt and deposed the Khedive, replacing him with a family member who was made Sultan of Egypt by the British. A group known as the Wafd Delegation attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 to demand Egypt's independence. Included in the group was political leader, Saad Zaghlul, who would later become Prime Minister. When the group was arrested and deported to the island of Malta, a huge uprising occurred in Egypt. Egyptian and British soldiers on standby during the 1919 riots Female nationalists demonstrating in Cairo in 1919 In the aftermath of World War One, the large British Imperial Army in Egypt which was the centre of operations against the Ottoman Empire was quickly reduced with demobilization and restructuring of garrisons. Free of the large British military presence, the incipient German backed revolutionary movements were able to more effectively launch their operations. Consequently, from March to April 1919, there were mass demonstrations that became uprisings. This is known in Egypt as the 1919 Revolution. Almost daily demonstrations and unrest continued throughout Egypt for the remainder of the Spring. To the surprise of the British authorities, Egyptian women also demonstrated, led by Huda Sha'rawi (1879‚Äì1947), who would become the leading feminist voice in Egypt in the first half of the twentieth century. The first women's demonstration was held on Sunday, 16 March 1919, and was followed by yet another one on Thursday, 20 March 1919. Egyptian women would continue to play an important and increasingly public nationalist role throughout the spring and summer of 1919 and beyond.Ziad Fahmy, Ordinary Egyptians: Creating the Modern Nation through Popular Culture (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2011), 138‚Äì39. The anticolonial riots and British suppression of them led to the death of some 800 people. In November 1919, the Milner Commission was sent to Egypt by the British to attempt to resolve the situation. In 1920, Lord Milner submitted his report to Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, recommending that the protectorate should be replaced by a treaty of alliance. As a result, Curzon agreed to receive an Egyptian mission headed by Zaghlul and Adli Pasha to discuss the proposals. The mission arrived in London in June 1920 and the agreement was concluded in August 1920. In February 1921, the British Parliament approved the agreement and Egypt was asked to send another mission to London with full powers to conclude a definitive treaty. Adli Pasha led this mission, which arrived in June 1921. However, the Dominion delegates at the 1921 Imperial Conference had stressed the importance of maintaining control over the Suez Canal Zone and Curzon could not persuade his Cabinet colleagues to agree to any terms that Adli Pasha was prepared to accept. The mission returned to Egypt in disgust. Continued occupation (1922‚Äì56) In December 1921, the British authorities in Cairo imposed martial law and once again deported Zaghlul. Demonstrations again led to violence. In deference to the growing nationalism and at the suggestion of the High Commissioner, Lord Allenby, the UK unilaterally declared Egyptian independence on 28 February 1922, abolishing the protectorate and establishing an independent Kingdom of Egypt. Sarwat Pasha became prime minister. British influence continued to dominate Egypt's political life and fostered fiscal, administrative, and governmental reforms. Britain retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt's external protection; protection of foreigners and separate courts for foreigners; the police forces, the army, the railways and the communications. British troops were stationed in cities and towns. King Fuad died in 1936 and Farouk inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by Italy's recent invasion of Ethiopia, he signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt, except at the Suez Canal (agreed to be evacuated by 1949). During World War II, British troops used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war. The 1952 coup overthrew the Egyptian monarchy and established the modern Republic of Egypt. The last British troops left Egypt in June 1956 as per the 1954 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement, returning briefly during the Suez Crisis. Languages During the period of British colonization French was actually the lingua franca that was used among foreigners and between foreigners and Egyptians;Mak, Lanver. The British in Egypt: Community, Crime and Crises 1882-1922 (Volume 74 of International Library of Historical Studies). I.B.Tauris, March 15, 2012. , 9781848857094. p. 87. the mixed French-Egyptian civil courts operated in French, and government notices from the royal family, taxi stand information, timetables of trains, and other legal documents were issued in French.Mak, Lanver.

This was partly because many well-off Egyptians received their education in French, but also because of the prominent status of the French language internationally. Despite efforts from British legal personnel, English was never adopted as a language of the Egyptian civil courts during the period of British influence.Mak, Lanver.

Description San Antonio architect Alfred Giles beat out eighteen other competitors to submit the winning bid on designing the 1886 courthouse at a cost of $60,000. Giles modeled the Second Empire style building after the El Paso courthouse he also designed in 1886. When the structure was completed, the county held a celebratory grand ball on January 1, 1887. The courthouse can be seen from almost any location in Marfa. Designed of brick and stone quarried in Marfa, the exterior is of pink stucco with Lady Justice sitting atop the central dome. The tower is spanned by Roman arches. Interiors are designed of pecan wood. Dormers extend over the roof, with triangular pediments and iron cresting. The building has entrances on all sides, meeting in a central rotunda. When designed, the district courtroom took up the entire east side of the second floor. The grand jury room was on the third floor. A remodeling took place in 2001.

Diversity Its diversity is found both in its topography and in its residents. Canyon Crest was formed by six separate land annexations, all of which occurred between 1959 and 1986. Most of the development in the neighborhood reflects modern subdivision design. The land is developed for medium-density residential uses, with some high- and low-density areas included to serve a variety of residential needs. The hilly terrain has shaped development. The Canyon Crest Town Centre is the economic focus for the area and offers a variety of dining options and shopping for the neighborhood, including the large student population in the nearby apartments. History Canyon Crest has its roots in the citrus industry. In 1907, the Monte Vista Nursery was established in the area, which now includes the Canyon Crest Town Centre. This nursery, which specialized in citrus stock, once occupied 200 acres. Two cultural resources within the neighborhood include the William Childs House, a 1910 Craftsman bungalow listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the locally significant Art Deco entry monuments at University Drive. These monuments were once in place on the west side of the old Buena Vista Bridge, and were moved when the bridge was replaced in the 1960s. Canyon Crest includes the Sycamore Highlands Specific Plan area, which abuts the northeastern edge of Sycamore Canyon Park and is in close proximity to the Box Spring Mountains. These natural features, along with the Tequesquite Arroyo, provide open spaces for outdoor recreation and scenic vistas. The Canyon Crest Country Club section of the community has views of the city, mountains and golf course. Community The Canyon Crest Neighborhood is served by public facilities, community parks and schools. New Canyon Crest Fire Station No.14 and Mission Grove Fire Station No.9 serve the neighborhood. Castle View Park includes three acres developed as a playground and 27 acres in natural open space. Quail Run Park is an undeveloped, open space park. Sycamore Highlands Park is a 10-acre neighborhood park serving recreational needs of the residents within the Sycamore Highlands area. This park has views of Riverside's downtown and surrounding areas and includes access to the many trails within the extensive Sycamore Canyon Wilderness Park. The 30-acre Andulka Park is adjacent to the neighborhood at the intersection of Central and Chicago Avenues. This park includes two new baseball fields, a tennis complex with a pro-shop, two lighted basketball courts, two volleyball courts, restroom and concession facilities, children's playground, picnic facilities, open meadow areas, parking and a walking/jogging trail with a native habitat area. Canyon Crest Country Club is located in the center of Canyon Crest.

His best remembered work captured a weeping Graham W. Jackson, Sr. playing his accordion as the body of the recently deceased President Franklin D. Roosevelt was being transported to Washington, DC. The Nashville Tennessean Clark dropped out of Hume-Fogg High School after he told the editor of the Nashville Tennessean newspaper he was a photographer and got a job as an assistant. \\"I lied,\\" he later admitted. He recalled that \\"Covering a parade once, I used too much flash powder and nearly blew myself off the roof\\". However, he learned quickly and was promoted to staff photographer, a position he held for 13 years. Life magazine His work came to the notice of Life, which made him a stringer in 1936. A 1942 photograph of World War I hero Alvin York registering for the \\"old man's draft\\" brought a job offer, but he turned it down; \\"I was raising two young boys, and New York didn't seem like the place to raise them,\\" he later explained. However, he changed his mind, becoming a staff photographer in 1944, after Life allowed him to remain in Tennessee for a few years. =Graham Jackson photograph= When he received a telephone call informing him that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died, he drove all night from his home in Nashville to Warm Springs, Georgia. As the President's body was being taken to the train station, Clark, alone among the swarm of photographers present, noticed United States Navy bandsman Graham W. Jackson, Sr. playing \\"Goin' Home\\", one of Roosevelt's favorite tunes, on his accordion as tears ran down his face. The iconic photograph was published full page in the April 17, 1945, issue of Life, capturing the nation's grief. =Post- war= In 1945, he was temporarily assigned to the Paris offices. At the Nuremberg Trials, Clark photographed Hermann G√∂ring. In 1948, a series of photographs documented the gross inequality in educational resources allocated to white versus black children in the West Memphis School District of Arkansas; a single teacher had 100 black students, crammed into a single classroom. The Life story led to the construction of a new building for them. That same year, Clark was assigned to the Los Angeles bureau, where he became acquainted with Hollywood stars. He was the only photographer invited to the wedding reception of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Around 1950, a friend told him of a \\"hot tomato\\" who had just signed with Twentieth Century-Fox. He took a series of pictures of a then unknown Marilyn Monroe which were not published at the time; much later, they came to light during a search of Lifes archives. He was also in the good graces of presidents. He took a portrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower using a Mathew Brady camera. On Eisenhower's last day as President, Clark was the only photographer permitted in the Oval Office. Another memorable photo showed then Senator John F. Kennedy spending time with his baby daughter Caroline. The Kennedys were so pleased with the result that it hung in the Oval Office after he was elected, and Jackie Kennedy asked for 75 copies. In 1955, Clark received an unexpected invitation from the Soviet Union. He became the first Western photographer allowed behind the Iron Curtain in 30 years. The same year, Edward Steichen included his work in MoMA's blockbuster, world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, seen by more than nine million people. Due to budgetary cutbacks, Life let go a third of its photographic staff in 1963, Ed Clark among them. By then, his vision had become impaired due to a cataract. Later life He became a building contractor in Bethesda, Maryland or Washington. In 1982, a doctor removed his cataract and implanted a new lens, restoring his vision. In 1990, he was awarded the Photographic Society of America's Understanding Through Photography Award. He took some courses on modern methods of black-and-white and color printing at Nashville State Tech. He later donated his collection to that institution. Ed Clark and his wife Joyce moved to Sarasota, Florida. He died there on January 22, 2000, at the age of 88. His first wife, Garnet, predeceased him. He was survived by Joyce, his son Tom (from his first marriage), two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Career Dora Carrington made this work based upon one of Albert Rutherston's designs Rutherston started as a realist painter but changed to a more decorative style around 1910, the year of his first one-man exhibition at the Carfax Gallery. He served in the Army in Palestine between 1916‚Äì19. Rutherston then wrote the book \\"Decoration in the Art of the Theatre\\" published in 1919 and edited the Contemporary British Artists series between 1923‚Äì27. In 1927 Rutherston illustrated the Thomas Hardy book Yuletide In A Younger World, and designed posters and tickets for the London Underground. He held the post of Ruskin Master of Drawing in Oxford from 1929 to 1948. He also designed stage sets for Harley Granville-Barker's productions.

The present church was designed and built by Guarino Guarini during 1668‚Äì1687. History Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, was one of the leaders of the Habsburg armies of his cousin Philip II of Spain; they decisively defeated the French armies in the Battle of Saint-Quentin in Northern France on 10 August 1557, the Feast of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo), which affected the outcome of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr√©sis; in which, the Savoy, including Turin, was returned to the rule of the mercenary duke. That the Battle occurred on the Saint's feast instigated Phillip's denomination and design of the palace of El Escorial. Emmanuel Philibert, on his return to Turin in 1562, renovated the old ducal chapel of Santa Maria ad Presepae, which is still present near the entrance, and erected this church dedicated to St. Lawrence. Construction of the contemporary church began in 1634. Interior view of cupola. The architect Guarino Guarini was a great innovator in Baroque principles first developed by the great Roman Baroque architect Francesco Borromini, in particular the play with optical effects and organic \\"deconstruction\\" of the classical orders and principles of column and entablature. However, in San Lorenzo Guarini took these further.Henri Stierlin (ed), Baroque. Architecture of the World, Taschen, Lausanne, 1964. The ground plan is a kind of square which becomes an octagon at the level of the entablatures above the columns only to change again to become a Greek cross at the level of the pendentives of the vaults. Again, the base of the dome is circular in plan yet the lantern above it octagonal. The dome itself is supported by eight ribs forming a lattice similar to those found in mosques and Romanesque churches in Spain. To this superposition of - by the standards of convention - contradictory central plans is added an elliptical choir. The high altar, separated from the nave by a convex and concave archway receives natural light from a hidden dome, devices drawn from the other key Roman Baroque architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

In living creatures, structural coloration is the production of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often iridescent. Structural coloration was first observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle ‚Äì wave interference ‚Äì explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles. In animals such as on the feathers of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath. Structural coloration has potential for industrial, commercial and military application, with biomimetic surfaces that could provide brilliant colours, adaptive camouflage, efficient optical switches and low-reflectance glass.  History  Robert Hooke's 1665 Micrographia contains the first observations of structural colours. In his 1665 book Micrographia, Robert Hooke described the \\"fantastical\\" colours of the peacock's feathers:Hooke, Robert. Micrographia. Chapter 36 ('Observ. XXXVI. Of Peacoks, Ducks, and Other Feathers of Changeable Colours.') In his 1704 book Opticks, Isaac Newton described the mechanism of the colours other than the brown pigment of peacock tail feathers. Newton noted that In 1892, Frank Evers Beddard noted that Chrysospalax golden moles' thick fur was structurally coloured. Thomas Young (1773‚Äì1829) extended Newton's particle theory of light by showing that light could also behave as a wave. He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from sharp edges or slits, creating interference patterns. In his 1892 book Animal Coloration, Frank Evers Beddard (1858‚Äì1925) acknowledged the existence of structural colours: But Beddard then largely dismissed structural coloration, firstly as subservient to pigments: \\"in every case the [structural] colour needs for its display a background of dark pigment;\\" and then by asserting its rarity: \\"By far the commonest source of colour in invertebrate animals is the presence in the skin of definite pigments\\", though he does later admit that the Cape golden mole has \\"structural peculiarities\\" in its hair that \\"give rise to brilliant colours\\".  Principles  = Structure not pigment = thin film, the waves reflected from the upper and lower surfaces travel different distances depending on the angle, so they interfere. Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Structural colour under the microscope! Feathers, beetles and butterflie!! Colours are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the colour's wavelength. Structural coloration is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness. = Principle of iridescence = Electron micrograph of a fractured surface of nacre showing multiple thin layers Iridescence, as explained by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect part of the light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further part of it is reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further ‚Äì controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell ‚Äì the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart ‚Äì in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength ‚Äì a pure colour ‚Äì at any given angle, but other wavelengths ‚Äì different colours ‚Äì at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.  Mechanisms  = Fixed structures = Butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals microstructured chitin acting as a diffraction grating A number of fixed structures can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can be far more elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific solution to the problem of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions. Drawing of 'firtree' micro-structures in Morpho butterfly wing scale A diffraction grating constructed of layers of chitin and air gives rise to the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales as well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a diffraction grating is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin- film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue- green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection. Photonic crystals can be formed in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized holes in the chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and are about the same distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond- based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.The Photonic Beetle: Nature Builds Diamond-like Crystals for Future Optical Computers . Biomimicry News, 21 May 2008. Structural coloration through selective mirrors in the emerald swallowtail Selective mirrors to create interference effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with multiple layers of chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, the emerald swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by the sides of the pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope. Crystal fibres, formed of hexagonal arrays of hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin walls of the hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 Œºm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita one of the most iridescent of marine organisms. Magnificent non-iridescent colours of blue-and-yellow macaw created by random nanochannels Deformed matrices, consisting of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections are not all arranged in the same direction, the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent. The most intense blue known in nature: Pollia condensata berries Spiral coils, formed of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils, create Bragg reflection in the \\"marble berries\\" of the African herb Pollia condensata, resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature. The berry's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls, containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light. Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins. Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies, and is one of the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a pixellated or pointillist effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell circularly polarizes the light it reflects in one direction or the other. Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light.\\"Visual Ecology\\" by Cronin, T.W., Johson, S., Marshall, N.J. and Warrant, E.J. (2014) Princeton University Press Spiral microstructures are also found in scarab beetles where they produce iridescent colours. Buttercup petals exploit both yellow pigment and structural coloration. Thin film with diffuse reflector, based on the top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The brilliant yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at the centre of the flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature. Surface gratings, consisting of ordered surface features due to exposure of ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears only after the ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear. = Variable structures = Variable ring patterns on mantles of Hapalochlaena lunulata Some animals including cephalopods like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in the skin of the Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected. Blue-ringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. If they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second. In the greater blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata), the rings contain multi-layer iridophores. These are arranged to reflect blue‚Äìgreen light in a wide viewing direction. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the bright blue rings are exposed.  Examples  File:European bee eater.jpgEuropean bee-eaters owe their brilliant colours partly to diffraction grating microstructures in their feathers File:Butterfly Morpho rhetenor helena (M) KL.jpgIn Morpho butterflies such as Morpho helena the brilliant colours are produced by intricate firtree-shaped microstructures too small for optical microscopes. File:Parotia lawesii by Bowdler Sharpe.jpgThe male Parotia lawesii bird of paradise signals to the female with his breast feathers that switch from blue to yellow. File:Green Swallotail (Papilio palinurus) - Relic38.jpgBrilliant green of emerald swallowtail, Papilio palinurus, is created by arrays of microscopic bowls that reflect yellow directly and blue from the sides. File:Parides sesostris MHNT dos.jpgEmerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, Parides sesostris, creates its brilliant green using photonic crystals. File:Curculionidae - Lamprocyphus augustus.JPGIridescent scales of Lamprocyphus augustus weevil contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give almost uniform green. File:Aphrodita aculeata (Sea mouse).jpgHollow nanofibre bristles of Aphrodita aculeata (a species of sea mouse) reflect light in yellows, reds and greens to warn off predators. File:Loligo pealeii.jpgLongfin inshore squid, Doryteuthis pealeii, has been studied for its ability to change colour. File:Thinfilmbubble.jpgThin-film interference in a soap bubble. Colour varies with film thickness.  In technology  One of Gabriel Lippmann's colour photographs, \\"Le Cervin\\", 1899, made using a monochrome photographic process (a single emulsion). The colours are structural, created by interference with light reflected from the back of the glass plate. Gabriel Lippmann won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for his work on a structural coloration method of colour photography, the Lippmann plate. This used a photosensitive emulsion fine enough for the interference caused by light waves reflecting off the back of the glass plate to be recorded in the thickness of the emulsion layer, in a monochrome (black and white) photographic process. Shining white light through the plate effectively reconstructs the colours of the photographed scene. In 2010, the dressmaker Donna Sgro made a dress from Teijin Fibers' Morphotex, an undyed fabric woven from structurally coloured fibres, mimicking the microstructure of Morpho butterfly wing scales. The fibres are composed of 61 flat alternating layers, between 70 and 100 nanometres thick, of two plastics with different refractive indices, nylon and polyester, in a transparent nylon sheath with an oval cross-section. The materials are arranged so that the colour does not vary with angle. The fibres have been produced in red, green, blue, and violet. Structural coloration could be further exploited industrially and commercially, and research that could lead to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers. The surface of the compound eye of the housefly is densely packed with microscopic projections that have the effect of reducing reflection and hence increasing transmission of incident light. Similarly, the eyes of some moths have antireflective surfaces, again using arrays of pillars smaller than the wavelength of light. \\"Moth-eye\\" nanostructures could be used to create low-reflectance glass for windows, solar cells, display devices, and military stealth technologies. Antireflective biomimetic surfaces using the \\"moth-eye\\" principle can be manufactured by first creating a mask by lithography with gold nanoparticles, and then performing reactive-ion etching.

He studied with Franz Liszt and was in close contact with Richard Wagner, Hans von B√ºlow, Peter Cornelius, Louise Otto-Peters, Ferdinand Lassalle, August Bebel and many other notable musicians. He served as composer and conductor of choirs in Mainz, Darmstadt, Baden-Baden, W√ºrzburg, Munich, Leipzig, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf, Szczecin, Strasbourg and at Milan's La Scala. Early life =Origin, family and childhood= The Stone Mill Winery, where Wendelin Wei√üheimer was born in 1838 The Wei√üheimer family resided in Westhofen in the 14th century. Wendelin's grandfather, Johann Wei√üheimer I, from Osthofen, inherited a stone mill from his mother's family at the end of the 18th century. Viticulture, agriculture, animal husbandry and mill grinding were already undertaken on the manor complex in the 19th century. The manor is still owned by the Wei√üheimer family. This complex was one of the most important in the former Grand Duchy of Hesse. Wendelin Wei√üheimer was born on 26 February 1838 at the Stone Mill Winery of Osthofen, the eighth and youngest child of Johann Wei√üheimer II and Ottilie, n√©e Best der Welt. His parents were wealthy and his father, a highly respected and multi-talented man with a keen interest in history and politics, had already been mayor for several years and a member of the first Osthofen Hessian St√§ndekammer, which is why Wendelin met, at a young age, men of the March Revolution of 1848 at the Stone Mill. Despite his commitments as landowner and politician, Wendelin Wei√üheimer's father found time to deal with family and traditional, historical studies, the result of which was his multi-volume chronicle of the Osthofens recorded in handwritten diaries. He allowed Wendelin to study music, although this clearly contradicted his intentions of making Wendelin his estate's heir. =The path to music= Louis Schindelmeisser Wei√üheimer's background differed from other composers in that he did not come from a musical family. His father had intended him to inherit the Stone Mill, and thus he was sent to a secondary school in Darmstadt when he was only 13 as an apprentice. There, through his piano teacher, a member of the theater orchestra, he had an opportunity to listen to a rehearsal for the performance of Tannhauser. He had heard earlier parts of the music during a visit to a military concert. Wei√üheimer wrote that these experiences influenced him greatly. In his book: Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries, he wrote: \\"An unsuspected new world had risen for me, in fact.\\" Soon thereafter, in Darmstadt, Wendelin Wei√üheimer listened to the Lohengrin opera, and in Frankfurt to the Flying Dutchman, putting him into a Wagnerian delirium. In his final year in school Wendelin was introduced to music theory by theater conductor Louis Schindelmeisser. This so captivated him that he soon began to compose. Schindelmeisser was the first to recognize Wendelin's musical talent. He had to persuade Wendellin's father to allow him to pursue his musical intentions. To this end, Schindelmeisser went to the Stone Mill in Osthofen on 16 March 1856. The father's initial astonishment gave way to his approval. On his departure, Schindelmeisser gave young Wei√üheimer a picture dedicated to him as well as one of many original letters written by Richard Wagner. =Music studies= Wendelin Wei√üheimer attended the Leipzig Conservatory from May 1856. Both Leipzig and Weimar had a lively musical scene. While Leipzig was conservative and spurned the new music of Liszt and Wagner, the revolutionary youth in Weimar sought new forms of musical expression and embraced the so-called New German School and its genius, Franz Liszt. After completing his studies Wendelin took the post of second conductor at the city theatre in Mainz under Schindelmeisser. Before beginning, he traveled to Zurich to visit Richard Wagner, who was living there in exile. Wagner was working on his musical drama Tristan and Isolde and usually declined to see visitors. Wendelin was first rejected, but eventually spent one memorable afternoon with the master on 17 July 1858. Wei√üheimer writes of his encounter: \\"The pale expressive face of the then forty-five-year-old, accompanied me in town and everywhere else.\\" Musical career =Conducting in Mainz= Just 20 years old, Wei√üheimer took up his post as conductor in Mainz on 17 August 1858 and, among other things, visited publisher Franz Schott and his musical wife Betty. After a performance of Wagner's Faust overture, Wei√üheimer got to know his Rhine-Hessian compatriot, the poet-composer Peter Cornelius, who became a lifelong friend. =With Franz Liszt in Weimar= Wei√üheimer's mentor, Franz Liszt Wei√üheimer moved back to Weimar after the theatre season. He and Liszt were musically like-minded and so Wei√üheimer was accepted by Liszt as a student in composition. Lessons were held three to four times a week, for several hours at a time. Wei√üheimer soon became Liszt's favorite student. Here, in Altenburg, Weimar, home of Liszt's close friend Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein of Sayn-Wittgenstein, Wei√üheimer was introduced to a new musical world. While here he met his friend, Peter Cornelius, who had also come to Weimar in 1860, and was introduced to Felix Draeseke, Hans von Bronsart, Carl Tausig, the Bohemian Smetana, Franz Bendel, Gru√®re and Hans von B√ºlow among other notables. In Weimar, one of Wei√üheimer's compositions was first performed by an orchestra. Liszt included Wei√üheimer's symphony on Schiller's Ritter Toggenburg on the program for the court concerts that he conducted on 13 March 1860. To allow Wei√üheimer to take part in this concert at the Grand Ducal Palace, which was only accessible to the court and nobility, Liszt had him wear a tail coat and a white tie and placed him in the middle of the string orchestra, where he had to pretend to play the violin. At the end of the concert, the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess expressed approval of the composer. The next day on his visit to Liszt, Wei√üheimer met daughter Cosima, who was married for two years to von B√ºlow and who would later become Wagner's second wife. Wei√üheimer's stay in Weimar climaxed in 1861. He presented a musical meeting starting with Liszt's Faust Symphony under B√ºlow's baton. Wei√üheimer achieved complete success with the presentation of his Grave in Busento by the court orchestra and the academic choir of Jena students. Wagner made an unexpected appearance at this event, after eleven years of exile in Switzerland. =Friendship with Richard Wagner= Richard Wagner In the autumn of 1861 Wei√üheimer returned to the Mainz theatre as music director. During this period he befriended Wagner. After the Weimar meeting, Wagner tried unsuccessfully to reach Paris in late November where Prince Metternich had provided him with a garden apartment at the Austrian Embassy. On 1 December, he arrived unexpectedly in Mainz to negotiate his stage festival play Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg with the Schott publishing house. He already had the text and the poetic process was to take place in Paris. During the days in Mainz, Wagner attended the opera performances conducted by Wei√üheimer and Wei√üheimer also participated in his meetings with Mrs. Betty Schott. \\"Richard-Wagner-house\\" in the Garden of Stone Mill. After successfully completing his Meistersinger poetry in less than two months in Paris, Wagner returned to Mainz on 31 January 1862. That same evening, in the Schotts' house, before a selected circle of listeners, Wagner presented the Meistersinger's poetry. Peter Cornelius and Wei√üheimer were present. Wei√üheimer writes about this memorable night that \\"Wagner carried away with the audience and caused them to rally tumultuously. At the end of the play the audience was aware that they stood at the cradle of a mighty work of art.\\" In order to be able to complete the composition without uninterruption, Wagner rented a small apartment in nearby Biebrich, just below the ducal castle on the Rhine. As a result, Wei√üheimer and Wagner were together almost every day. Wei√üheimer had become almost indispensable for Wagner, so, despite the 25-year difference in age,Richard Wagner at that time was 48 years old while Wendelin Wei√üheimer was just 23 a warm friendship developed. Wagner's recurrent financial difficulties prompted Wei√üheimer to visit his father in order to request financial help for his friend. Johann complied. This was Wagner's first visit to the Stone Mill.Where Wagner met Wendelin's parents, siblings, and last but not least, the \\"wine\\" on 1 June 1862 He met Wendelin's parents, siblings, and last but not least, the \\"wine\\" on 1 June 1862. When he had to stay in bed a few weeks due to illness, Wagner paid a surprise visit to the Stone Mill to leave Wendelin the only copy of The Valkyrie for Wendelin's appreciation. In the garden pavilion by the lake shore, known as \\"Richard- Wagner-house,\\" Wagner spent many hours boozing and proved to be a brilliant entertainer. That August, Wagner returned to the Stone Mill, this time accompanied by Hans and Cosima von B√ºlow. =Richard Wagner's patron= Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries Wei√üheimer knew of Wagner's financial problems. Die Meistersingers was not finished on schedule and Schott held back the payments. Wagner's admirers denied him further assistance. To relieve Wagner's financial difficulties Wei√üheimer organized a concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on 1 November 1862. Despite the personal involvement of Wagner, von B√ºlow and other renowned artists and organizations with works by Wagner, Liszt and Wei√üheimer, the attendance at the concert was so low that not enough revenue was collected to cover the costs.This concert was the first time that Richard Wagner was allowed to perform in Germany after his exile. This concert was the first time that Wagner had been allowed to perform in Germany after his exile. Wei√üheimer writes: \\"Instead of Wagner filling up his pockets, I quickly had to call my father for help,\\" and again and again latter provided financial support. Wagner no longer held events in Biebrich but moved to Vienna in November 1862. There he again tried to premiere \\"Tristan,\\" but without success. Although Wagner had a lot of money from a concert tour in Russia in 1863, he was again in financial straits. Finally, he had to flee from Vienna to avoid being put in debtors' prison. On 29 April 1864, Wendelin Wei√üheimer received a telegram from Stuttgart from Wagner, asking him for an immediate visit. Wei√üheimer went and Wagner reported his financial and psychological breakdown. Wei√üheimer thus decided to stay with Wagner. Since Wagner was in debt he was urged to disappear. They agreed on a secluded spot in Rauhe Alb, where Wei√üheimer would accompany him. There Wei√üheimer intended to finish the piano score of the first Meistersingers act as quickly as possible in order to persuade the publisher, Schott, to make additional payments. Their journey had been set for 3 May, as Wagner wanted to see a performance of Don Giovanni conducted by Karl Eckert. However, on 2 May, at the hotel Marquard, the Secretary of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, Council of State Franz Seraph von Pfistermeister, appeared with a mission to explore the residence of Richard Wagner and return with him to Munich. When crown Prince Ludwig II listened to Wagner's Lohengrin he said: \\"When I am crowned, I want to show the world how much I know of the genius of Wagner.\\" He was seeking a way to maintain his self-given promise. As Wagner's most ardent admirer, he wanted to give him the opportunity to finish his Der Ring des Nibelungen. So, instead of the rough journey to the Alps, Wagner went on 3 May 1864 to Munich, and after the reception by the King, returned to Vienna to pay his debts before he moved into the Villa on Lake Starnberg provided to him by the King. =Ferdinand Lassalle= Ferdinand Lassalle Wendelin Wei√üheimer's soon developed a friendship with Ferdinand Lassalle, the greatest demagogue of his time. After studying economics, history and philosophy, he dealt primarily with social issues and made it his life's work to create a \\"democratic party for social progress\\" which the monarchy respected as the uppermost representative of the people. Wei√üheimer was attracted by Lassalle's writings. In July 1864 Wei√üheimer found out that Lassalle had arranged an excursion in the Palatinate with the countess Sophie von Hatzfeld. He invited both to Stone Mill. The news of Lassalle's arrival quickly spread in Osthofen. The villagers watched, with curiosity, as both guests walked from the railway station to the Stone Mill on 6 July. At the Stone Mill the reception was polite. Lassalle captivated the Wei√üheimer family for hours describing his plans and goals and he spoke with Johann Wei√üheimer on his studies about Franz von Sickingen. Lassalle made friends there and when they parted, he ordered a barrel of the \\"Riesling\\" which he had been served. Wendelin Wei√üheimer spent several days in the Palatinate with Lassalle, the Countess von Hatzfeld and other friends. Wendelin was invited to accompany Lassalle on a trip to the east of Switzerland but, because of an urgent message received from his wife, who had fallen seriously ill in Leipzig, he had to decline the invitation. Lassalle traveled alone to Lake Lucerne in mid- July, while the Countess von Hatzfeld went to Wildbad for a cure. Lassalle met Helena von D√∂nniges, daughter of historian Wilhelm von D√∂nniges, known to him from Berlin. This occasion turned disastrous as Lassalle was challenged to a duel and was fatally shot. Lassalle's death was a severe blow that took Wendelin a long time to overcome, convinced that Lassalle's death could have been averted if he had stayed with him. Throughout his life Wendelin remained faithful to the Social Democratic Party, although this commitment brought disadvantages for his professional career. =Wei√üheimer as conductor and composer= Luitpold Hall in Nuremberg, Bavaria Wendelin Wei√üheimer became music director in Augsburg. Despite his official duties and numerous other engagements he continued to compose. After scoring songs and ballads of the German Minnesang, as well as from Goethe and other poets, he dealt with his first opera Theodor K√∂rner. Franz Liszt and Wagner spoke appreciatively of this work. Lassalle, who had particularly liked the libretto and was equally enthusiastic about the music, had offered to write Wei√üheimer a textbook on Florian Geyer, Thomas Munzer or the Bohemian Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, but his death put an end to this idea. Wagner had written for Wei√üheimer a draft for the opera, Wieland the Blacksmith, but gave it back before scoring it. For the premiere of Theodor K√∂rner at the Berlin Court Opera, Liszt began with the former artistic director Count von Redern. However, Count von Redern recommended Liszt to run the premiere on a different stage because Prince Louis Ferdinand was to play a role which would affect the Prussian royal family too strongly. For the premiere to be accommodated elsewhere it would be important to gain Wagner's support, for whom Wendelin had fought for many years. But Wagner was too immersed in his own work to be of any help. Wei√üheimer's negotiations with Munich moved very slowly. Original notes from Wei√üheimer's Theodor K√∂rner While a conductor at the Augsburg palace, Wendelin married Rosalie Scholle from Leipzig on 10 January 1865. They were married for 45 years but produced no children. Rosalie survived her husband, dying at the age of 79 on 25 September 1920 in Darmstadt. From Augsburg, Wei√üheimer went to the Kroll Opera in Berlin, then to the theater in D√ºsseldorf. From 1866 to 1868 he was in W√ºrzburg. From here he tried once again a world premiere of his patriotic opera Theodor K√∂rner. For this reason he looked up to Wagner in Munich. Wagner was living with Hans and Cosima von B√ºlow in a house on Arcisstra√üe, donated to him by the king and where Cosima was a housewife who took care of Wagner's correspondence. Wagner soon became interested in Mrs. B√ºlow. His relationship with Wei√üheimer began to wane, and Wei√üheimer drew closer to Peter Cornelius at the premiere of the latter's 1865 opera Der Cid. The friendship between Wei√üheimer and Richard Wagner ended in June 1868. This was after Cosima, without reviewing the music, wrote on 6 July to Wei√üheimer that the text of his \\"Theodor K√∂rner\\" could not be performed in court theaters because its seditious tendency might provoke trouble in peaceful times. Wendelin, like his father, was stubborn and didn't support her views. His disagreement with Cosima came between him and Wagner. The situation was compounded when Wendelin Wei√üheimer recognised their love affair. He sided with the betrayed von B√ºlow. At the premiere of Die Meistersinger in Munich on 21 June 1868, Wei√üheimer had his last encounter with Wagner. =Wei√üheimer's last years= Opera score of Wendelin Wei√üheimer's Master Martin And His Companions From W√ºrzburg Wei√üheimer came again to conduct in Mainz. During the subsequent activity in Zurich, friendship linked him and his wife to the Wesendonck family. From 1873 to 1878, he worked in Strasbourg where his opera Master Martin And His Companions premiered on 14 April 1879 in Karlsruhe. Now Wei√üheimer moved to Baden-Baden where he became in charge of the larger spa concerts. Together with Otto Dessoff he headed the concerts of the artists meeting with the performance of his Master Martin and his companions in May 1880. In the large central lodge, Wei√üheimer listened to the performance together with Liszt and French composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns outright, receiving from both acclaimed recognition for his accomplishment. In the following years Wendelin Wei√üheimer conducted for several years despite personal disappointment, with continuing veneration of Wagner's genius, at the famous Teatro La Scala in Milan. He had his residence on the idyllic Lake Como. Around 1893, Wei√üheimer moved to Freiburg im Breisgau in order to focus on his literary career. His 1898 book, Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries saw three editions in one single year. Around 1900 he moved to Nuremberg and from Freiburg and Nuremberg the way led him back again more often to his native homeland at the Stone Mill. In the casino society there he spent hours with old friends whom he pleased most joyfully with improvisations on works by Wagner and Liszt and on his own compositions. In his last years, Wei√üheimer led mass choirs at social-democratic Party Congresses. His target was the huge masses of the workers' movement. When Wei√üheimer died on 16 June 1910 in Nuremberg, his death caused great turmoil. 30.000 unionized socialists paid him their respects and read obituaries of him in the leading newspapers. Works Wei√üheimer left 106 works, including songs and choral cycles. Even though he tried compositionally to go his own way, he could not emerge from the shadow of his great teacher Liszt, and of Wagner. His operas, his cantatas, and his instrumental music underline this. Even if his \\"absolute\\" music pays homage to one of the great string quartet and successful \\"obligatory violin parts\\" to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, he displays in his other works a clear tendency for program music. Wei√üheimer's piano pieces Reminiscence of Gioventu and At Beethoven's Grave, as well as his Symphony for Schiller's Knight Toggenburg match the spirit of the New German School. His literary taste is evident in the texts he set to music. German minstrel poems, texts by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, K√∂rner, Heinrich Heine and others found a musical home in his songs and cantatas. Wei√üheimer summarized his individual compositions into larger cycles. Thus arose the 24 songs in the cycle \\"German minstrel,\\" the 18 settings of Goethe, as well as songs from Heine and K√∂rner, appeared for the men's choir \\"Eight Songs,\\" along with previously unpublished choral cycles. After his departure with Wagner, Wei√üheimer turned increasingly to the labor movement and exercised with his compositions for male chorus a particular influence on the cultural aspirations of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. =Printed and frequently performed works= Operas *1863/1864 Lyre and sword, an alternative titles Theodor K√∂rner (Text: Louise Otto-Peters); Patriotic Opera in Four Acts, premiered in 1872 at the Court and National Theater Munich. *1878 Master Martin And His Companions (on the story by E.T.A.

His extensive diaries tell nearly 80 years of his life, documenting economic, political, social and climatic conditions. They are considered the most important primary sources about Osthofen and also of the Rhenish-Hessian history in the 19th century. Because of his extensive studies, he is also called the \\"chronicler\\" of Osthofen. Life Johann Wei√üheimer II was born on 25 October 1797 in Osthofen as the eldest son of John I and Margaret Wei√üheimer, n√©e Dechen, in his father's estate, the stone mill in Osthofen. Shortly before he celebrated his wedding with Ottilia Best, the daughter of the Osthofener proprietor of the Swan Inn and future mayor Wendelin Best, he managed to transfer to the stone mill the associated goods in the ownership of his family through the gradual acquisition of fields and vineyards, thus making the stone mill to become one of the most important companies in the Rhenish Hesse. In his 1500-page diary, he reported in detail over 70 years of his life. Career He made the stone mill in Osthofen, around the middle of the 19th century, the most important estate in the Rhenish Hesse. It is thanks to him that his youngest son Wendelin Wei√üheimer could begin studying music, laying so the foundation stone for his career. Encouraged by him, Johann Wei√üheimer II often contributed significantly by providing financial assistance to the composer Richard Wagner so, enabling him to set a foothold in Germany. As mayor of Osthofen from 1831‚Äì1842, he led many reforms such as the introduction of the volunteer fire department and a charity fund. Osthofen was for the first time during his term of office, extended beyond its medieval boundaries. As a member of the first Hessian Chamber he took in Darmstadt, during the 1848 revolution, the interests of his home and suggested reforms, later becoming High Commissioner and permanent member of the City Council. He died in his hometown in 1883 leaving for posterity extensive studies of more than 2000 pages which are among the most important sources about the history of Osthofen from the Middle Ages to the 19th century.

He founded the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1987 and is its Artistic Director and Chief Executive Officer. He also runs a concert agency in the Frankfurt Alte Oper, the Pro Arte Konzertdirektion, and started an agency for concerts in the Kurhaus Wiesbaden in 2019, Wiesbaden Musik, beginning with a concert on his 75th birthday.  Career  When Herrmann announced in 2011 the first concert of the Rheingau Musik Festival's annual composer's portrait, featuring Hans Zender, he recalled that he was an altar boy at the church in Wiesbaden where Zender was the organist. In the 1960s, Herrmann attended the Pablo Casals Festival in Prades three times. Meeting important chamber musicians there, later singing in choral concerts in Eberbach Abbey in the early 1970s, inspired the idea of a music festival in the Rheingau. Herrmann, who first learned bookselling, turned to tourism and worked in the Canary Islands for ten years. He met Christoph Eschenbach, Justus Frantz, J√ºrgen Ponto, Helmut Schmidt, Will Quadflieg and Leonard Bernstein. He returned to Germany in 1982 and worked for concert agencies. In 1985 he founded his own artists and concert agency. Michael Herrmann announcing a concert by Andreas Scholl and members of the Baroque orchestra Accademia Bizantina at the church of Hallgarten, 16 July 2011 He founded the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1987, with a first season in the summer 1988 of 19 concerts, together with Tatiana von Metternich, Walter Fink and others. They created an association, the Rheingau Musik Festival e. V, which ran the festival until 1992, and has continued to support the festival. In 2010, it had 3300 members. Herrmann won sponsors who choose to fund their own concerts. It is normal for him to contact three to four sponsors a day. 180 companies have sponsored the festival. About half of the budget is funded by the sponsors and the remainder by ticket sales. Herrmann was successful in keeping the festival independent of public funding, but the minister-president of Hesse is traditionally its patron. Since 1992 the festival has been run by a GmbH (company with limited liability), with Herrmann as partner and managing director (Gesellschafter und Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer). The festival has grown from 19 concerts in the two months of the first season to an average of 150 events each season, many of them in the Rheingau's vineyards and historical buildings, making the festival \\"one of the largest in Europe\\". Herrmann made the festival a member of the European Festivals Association and serves as the association's vice president. 25 years RMF, celebrated in the Kurhaus, Wiesbaden on 17 June 2012 The program is mostly dedicated to classical music, but also features cabaret, jazz, readings, musical cruises, children's concerts, wine tastings and culinary events with music. It is regularly opened by a symphony concert in Eberbach Abbey, broadcast live by Hessischer Rundfunk. Anniversaries of composers are celebrated, such as Giuseppe Verdi (\\"Viva Verdi\\") in 2001, and Franz Liszt and Gustav Mahler in 2011. Every year it has a theme, such as \\"Heimweh\\" in 2011. \\"Treffpunkt Jugend\\" (meeting point youth) presents soloists still in their teens in two marathon concerts of chamber music and concertos with orchestra. Work cycles, running over several years, have included the piano sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, played by Rudolf Buchbinder, and the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, with the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and Eliahu Inbal. \\"Rendezvous\\" shows artists in dialogue. In the Rheingau, a traditionally Catholic region, the feast of the Assumption is celebrated on 15 August by a Marienvesper (Vespers for the Virgin Mary). In 2011 the Concerto Romano ensemble, conducted by Alessandro Quarta, performed a medley of works by composers from Rome. On this occasion, Hermann asked for an exceptional collection to benefit his guest of honor, bishop Ambroise of the diocese of Maradi in Niger. Organ concert on the historic instruments of the region are featured regularly. \\"Komponistenportr√§t\\" features annually a living composer in conversation, chamber music and symphonic music. Herrmann got Anne-Sophie Mutter to perform the German premiere of Wolfgang Rihm's violin concerto Lichtes Spiel, premiered in Avery Fisher Hall in 2010. He gave Andreas Scholl, born in the Rheingau, the opportunity to perform with friends and his sister Elisabeth in four of the area's historic churches. The festival usually concludes with a choral concert in Eberbach Abbey, including rarely performed works. In 2005 Frieder Bernius conducted Penderecki's Polish Requiem, Helmuth Rilling conducted Messa per Rossini in 2001 and Messiah of both Sven-David Sandstr√∂m and Handel in 2009. In the 25th anniversary season, he invited several of his long-term friend, called \\"Wegbegleiter\\" (\\"Companions along the way\\"), to appear again. In 2013, 160 events were offered at 45 locations, with a budget of 7,6 million Euro. Since 2005 Herrmann has been vice president of the European Festivals Association. Since 2008 he has been director of the Pro Arte Konzertdirektion in Frankfurt. In 2019, he began a concert agency, Wiesbaden Musik for concerts in the Kurhaus Wiesbaden. The first concert on his 75th birthday was played by the Bamberger Symphoniker, a program of late Mozart symphonies, in G minor and C major, and Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto.  Awards  In 1997 Herrmann was awarded the Hessian Order of Merit, and in 2002 received the Goethe Plaque, the highest award of the Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts.

The name Frunti exists to this day as a specific geographical location, although in Medieval times the name referred to a larger, more expansive area of land. Frunti is located southwest of Teramo. History Frunti's significance is well documented in the works of the historian Nicholas Palma as well as in research available from the Abruzzo Regional entity DAT (Documenti dell'Abruzzo Teramo; Documents of Teramo in Abruzzo). The site which today bears the name Frunti contains is completely abandoned and consists mainly of the ruins of pre-existing houses and domesticated farm animal dwellings. Beginning at least in the year 1328, the feudal territory of Frunti (at the time more commonly referred to as \\"di Fronto\\") Francesco Savini, le famiglie feudali della regione teramana nel medioevo, Roma 1916 carried the privilege of the Forum. In subsequent years the area was governed for short periods by the patrons of a castle, Fornarolo (today Frondarola) Nel 1363 la Regina dispone della 3^ parte del feudo di Fronto, gi√† appartenuta a Roberto di Lalle di Fronto morto senza eredi; Francesco Brunetti, Sacra ac profana Aprutii Monumenta, Fragmenta, Te 2008 (a cura di Roberto Ricci). which sits to the southwest. Also associated with Frunti were the communes (castrates) of Scalellis and Rocca di Padula, these later coming under the rule of Montagna di Roseto and more recently administrated by the commune of Cortino. To the south of the area known today as Frunti, lies the ruins of an ancient Benedictine abbey, San Giovanni in Pergulis. References to the abbey are made in a Papal Bull of 1153 which stated that it belonged to the Chiesa Aprutina (Catholic Church Abruzzo). During medieval times the San Giovanni in Pergulis abbey enjoyed seigneurial rights in the surrounding area. The larger nearby village of Valle San Giovanni was also a thriving entity at this time and it is likely here where the Frunti governing signori (noble family members) lived. In later times, Frunti came under the rule of Count, later Marquis, of Montorio where it remained until the breakup of the feudal states. In modern times much of the area of Frunti lies within the commune of Teramo.

Irvine is the founding president of the Alice Paul Institute, named after American suffragist leader Alice Paul, and is the executive director of the New Jersey Historic Trust. In 2007 she was an honoree for Women's History Month by the National Women's History Project. Historic preservation > \\"While Barbara Haney Irvine was initially influenced by Alice Paul, she has > created her own powerful legacy through her tireless efforts to ensure that > the stories of women‚Äôs lives and the places where women lived, worked and > died will continue to inspire us and all future generations. - The National > Women's History Project =Alice Paul Institute and Paulsdale= Paulsdale, ca. 1958, the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul Finding inspiration in the life of Alice Paul, the suffragist and women's rights activist who initiated and ran the main actions and events of the 1910s Women's Voting Rights Movement which successfully lobbied for the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote, Irvine co-founded the Alice Paul Centennial Foundation in 1984. Now known as the Alice Paul Institute (API), the organization was formed to celebrate the centennial of Paul's birth. For over 16 years Irvine served as volunteer president and board chair for API, leading successful campaigns to preserve historic objects related to Paul's life and to the lives of other women's activists. The group successfully raised over $58,000 to purchase a collection of Paul's books, papers and personal items, including a desk owned by Susan B. Anthony which Paul also used during her movement. The collection was then donated to the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Harvard University. Less than a year after the collection acquisition, API was offered the chance to purchase Paulsdale, the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. The home was threatened by housing developments, which threatened to swallow the six-acre site. Irvine led the national campaign to preserve the site, raising over $1.8 million in private and public funds to purchase and rehabilitate the site, turning it into an interpretive site. In 1991, under the leadership of Irvine, the property was declared a National Historic Landmark. Paulsdale continues to serve as a leadership development center for women and girls attesting to the ongoing inspiration of Paul's vision for women's equality. =Other opportunities in heritage preservation= During the Paulsdale campaign, Irvine started and chaired the first national conference about women's historic sites. This conference was held in 1994 at Bryn Mawr College, and in 1999 the National Collaborative for Women's History Sites was founded. The Collaborative serves to preserve and interpret the sites and venues where women were key in American history. During this time, Irvine also assisted in the creation of the New Jersey Women's Heritage Trail. Irvine has also served as a program content adviser for the New Jersey history program, Our Vanishing Past, produced by the New Jersey Network. Current life In 2004 Irvine became the executive director of the New Jersey Historic Trust, seeking to shift the Trusts' focus towards the preservation of urban historic buildings. She is married to Geoffrey Irvine and lives in Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey.

Opened in 2011, the plant was developed, and then owned and operated by Veolia Energy-Dalkia. Development In May 2009, Veolia Energy-Dalkia, who had a base in nearby Cramlington, Northumberland and had previously provided cogeneration (CHP) plants for the Newcastle General, Freeman and Royal Victoria Infirmary hospitals in Newcastle, announced their plans to build a biomass fueled CHP power station in the County Durham town of Chilton. The site chosen had previously been occupied by a feed mill and silo, which had been highly visible throughout the town and had come to be known locally as Chilton Cathedral. The new plant was expected to cost ¬£40 million, half of which was to be spent within the North East region, on materials and components for the plant, aiding the local economy. Chilton Town Council voted unanimously in support of the plant, saying it would be a catalyst for the regeneration of the area, and this was supported by a 340 name petition from the local people. Planning permission was granted later that June and construction commenced in January 2010. 50 jobs were created during the construction of the plant, with 17 permanent jobs created following completion. Commissioning of the plant began in June 2011, taking three to four weeks to complete. Operations 115,000 to 120,000 tonnes of wood are burned in the station per year, providing electricity for up to 20,000 homes through the National Grid. The plant is one of the first in the UK to burn domestic waste wood to provide electricity for the National Grid, rather than for an industrial site. It is the first of a number of similar sites which Dalkia are planning in the UK. The feedstock for the plant is wood which has reached the end of its useful life such as old shipping pallets, manufacturing offcuts, wood from the construction and demolition industries, and material from civic amenity sites. This wood is collected through a network set up by Dalkia The fuel would other wise be sent to landfill. 50,000 tonnes of wood pellets are produced on site each year, for use elsewhere. Design and specification The plant has a generating capacity of 17.5 megawatts.

The season ran from 1 July 1926 to 30 June 1927. Overview For the second season in succession, Torquay United found themselves competing in both the Southern League and the Western League. With the Professional Section of the Western League now expanded to include twelve teams, United had to play a total of 48 games spread across the two leagues. The Magpies certainly rose to the challenge in both competitions. In the Southern League, Percy Mackrill's men were particularly impressive at Plainmoor where only a shock Boxing Day defeat to Bath City prevented the team from achieving a 100% home record. United also suffered just one home defeat in their Western League campaign, a 2‚Äì0 loss to eventual champions Bristol City Reserves. However, in the Southern League, it was the Magpies who prevailed over City's Reserves and Torquay United were crowned winners of the Western Section in April.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999). Torquay United, The Official Centenary History, 1899-1999. Yore Publications. As Western champions, Torquay met the winners of the Eastern Section, Brighton & Hove Albion Reserves, in the Southern League play- off final. However, United lost the game 4-0 making Brighton's Reserves the overall Southern League champions.Holgate, Mike (1999). Torquay United Football Club 1899-1999. Tempus Publishing. Following an impressive display against Third Division South side Reading in the previous season's FA Cup, Torquay were this season given a bye to the First Round proper. United again gave a good account of themselves against Football League opposition when, after holding Bristol Rovers to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Plainmoor, they were unfortunate to be beaten 1‚Äì0 in the replay at the Eastville Stadium in a game in which Torquay missed a penalty. Having enjoyed such a successful season, Torquay United now made a second attempt to gain membership of the Football League. Although they hadn't received a single vote in their previous attempt to enter the Third Division South in 1922, United's bid was now far more credible and was reflected in the votes cast this time around. At the Football League's meeting in London's Connaught Rooms on 30 May, one of the two current League clubs up for re-election, Watford, won a respectable 44 votes, while the other, Aberdare Athletic, found themselves tied with Torquay in second place on 21 votes each. Despite claims by Aberdare's secretary of a biased scrutineer, a second vote went in the Magpies favour with a 26‚Äì19 split meaning that Torquay United would now be taking the Welsh team's place in the 1927‚Äì28 season of the Third Division South. After nearly thirty years of organised football and various team mergers and name changes, the town of Torquay finally had a Football League club of its own.

Formation  WESPA was formed in the course of a players' meeting at the 2003 World Scrabble Championship in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and formally constituted on 17 November 2005 at its first Biennial General Meeting held in London. BGMs are now held at each World Scrabble Championship (taking place every odd year), and there are currently 24 member organisations. WESPA was created to represent the interests of international Scrabble competitors and national bodies worldwide. Its main functions are to promote global recognition of Scrabble as a serious competitive activity; to provide for the benefit of members in pursuing the game; to further the best interests of Scrabble and international tournament players; to represent such players in dealings with other bodies, including the trademark owners of the game; to promulgate and encourage international convergence towards common standards and norms (including international rules, word lists and ratings); to organise global competitions and events; to publish relevant material; and to maintain a website for the benefit of the game and its players. The trademark for Scrabble is owned by Hasbro in North America and Mattel in the rest of the world. Achievements to date have included the preparation of a set of international rules, the publication of a WESPA-endorsed word list which is valid for international tournament play, and the promulgation of international Scrabble ratings.  Rules  Following a six-month worldwide consultation process, the first version of WESPA's rules for global Scrabble was released in August 2009. The rules were based on key elements of existing rules that were in force in various national associations, which were synthesised to create global best practice. Following feedback from their use in various international tournaments, extensive reviews took place prior to the issue of version two in November 2010, which was used at the 2011 World Scrabble Championship in Warsaw, Poland, and other international events such as the Causeway Challenge.http://www.causewayscrabble.com/ Version three was released in 2015. A number of national associations have adopted WESPA rules for domestic use, including the Association of British Scrabble Players.  Word list  The word source currently in use for international play, known as Collins Scrabble Words or CSW (formerly Official Scrabble Words or OSW) is not derived from a single dictionary, but combines three components: Collins (7th edition, 2005), Chambers (1998 edition) and TWL, the current Northern American wordlist. TWL (Tournament Word List) is a subset of CSW, but is itself drawn from a range of sources, mostly different editions of Webster's. North American tournaments generally use TWL alone for domestic play, but all tournaments under the auspices of WESPA must use CSW. The current word list (CSW19) came into force internationally on 1 July 2019, including updates from the most recent editions of original OSW sources as well as eliminating some inconsistencies in previous editions. CSW19 contains over 275,000 words in total (up to the theoretical maximum fifteen letters in length), of which around 119,000 are up to eight letters in length. By contrast, TWL holds approximately two thirds as many words in total. CSW is therefore substantially larger than TWL and has a more international flavour, including a number of local or dialect words from around the world.  Ratings  International Scrabble ratings have been maintained since their inception by Bob Jackman in Sydney, Australia, using a variant of the Australian ratings calculation system. All tournaments played to WESPA rules are able to be rated within the system, and regular updates are posted on the WESPA website. The first rated tournament in the system was the 1993 World Scrabble Championship, which was held in New York.  Tournaments  WESPA has established the criteria for running international Scrabble tournaments, and it is now mandatory for WESPA rules and the WESPA word list to be used. Tournament organisers are also required to pay a ratings levy on a fee per player basis, in order for the tournament to qualify for international rating. The tournament committee oversees the calendar of international Scrabble events, and has also liaised with Mattel on a number of issues relating to the World Scrabble Championship (WSC), including the number of games to be played and the format of the finals. Furthermore, a country's allocated number of representatives may fluctuate for each WSC depending on the team performance in the previous event, and WESPA has ratified the formulahttp://www.wscgames.com/2011/history.html for changes to team allocations. In short, after each event the participating countries are ranked according to the average individual finishing rank of their players; teams falling in the top half may be entitled to gain a player for next time, while teams in the bottom half may lose a player. Following the establishment of Mind Sports International, the title 'World Scrabble Championship' was claimed by that entity for official world titles (sanctioned by Mattel under licence). WESPA has undertaken to host biennial world events from 2015 onwards using the old WSC format, with teams qualifying from national organisations. The WESPA Championship 2015 was hosted in Perth, Australia, the 2017 edition took place in Nairobi, Kenya, and the 2019 edition in Goa, India.  Youth Scrabble  The World Youth Scrabble Championships, renamed WESPA Youth Cup for 2017 further to a naming issue with Mindsports Academy, have been organised annually since 2006 under the aegis of WESPA for players under 18 on qualification date. The Youth committee has also been active in promoting the game among young players worldwide, including training workshops held in various locations.  Committee  The WESPA committee is made up of nominees representing member nations, and the current Chair is Elie Dangoor (UK). Various subcommittees are charged with matters such as promotions and communications, ratings and tournaments, rules, dictionary and youth. The first Chair of WESPA was Allan Simmons (UK) who led the organisation from inception through to 2008. He was succeeded by Bahrain-based Roy Kietzmann, who died in 2009 prior to the appointment of Elie Dangoor.  Other federations  WESPA has committee links with the two other major world Scrabble federations, FISF (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Scrabble Francophone)http://www.fisf.net and FISE (Federaci√≥n Internacional de Scrabble en Espa√±ol).http://www.fisescrabble.org  Mailing list  The world-scrabble mailing listhttp://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/world-scrabble/ discusses international Scrabble matters and WESPA issues.

It was executed, along with a number of other high-society portraits, during his second visit to Italy. The woman wears a patterned gown with tied-on sleeves that show the chemise beneath. Her hair frames her face in soft waves, and back hair is confined in a small draped cap.

It is similar in pose and colour tone to his c 1507 A German Woman from Venice, while at least two studies of Venetian women are known, both of which are very daring.

During his visit to Italy D√ºrer became fascinated by and befriended Giovanni Bellini, an established master when D√ºrer was still a relative unknown outside of Germany.

The work was not identified as a D√ºrer original until it was found in a private Lithuanian collection in 1923. The identity of the sitter is lost; however, in dress and hairstyle, she appears to be Venetian, rather than Germanic.

Pedersen went to high school in Middelfart, before leaving for military service. He would later leave to pursue a career in insurance and investment. Currently lives in Farum with his family.

Business history A one time chairman of K√∏benhavns Fondsb√∏rs (English: Copenhagen Stock Exchange), Pedersen was also involved with Akademisk Boldklub, a football club based in Gladsaxe, Copenhagen, as vice-chairman. He was one of three major shareholders, before taking up the role in 2000. His involvement included, but not limited to, sponsorship agreements and contract negotiations. Pedersen is involved with a diverse selection of Danish investments which include hotel services, industry, travel, sports, food and medicine, of which 10 or more he is chairman or a board member of. He is also vice-chairman of the Divisionsforeningen (English: The Danish League), where he was on the board before taking over the role in 2008, replacing Niels- Christian Holmstr√∏m. Sports ownership =F.C. Nordsj√¶lland= Allan K. Pedersen started investing in FCN when the club was in financial difficulty, before buying further shares to gain ownership in the club with holding company AKP Holding with himself as director and his wife Bente Pedersen, as chairman. During his initial time as chairman of FCN, he would control many aspects of the club, including player purchases and sales, as well as scouting and talent development. Gradually delegating these responsibilities to then head coach Morten Wieghorst and sports director Jan Laursen. In October 2008, Allan K. Pedersen sold F.C. Nordsj√¶lland from AKP Holding to himself for a reported 500,000 Danish kroner, shortly before his holding company went bankrupt. A price Pedersen denies. Following an investigation from his creditors, it was found the sale was forced through without the bank's consent, and that the value for which the club was sold was too low, which ultimately reduced the finances the creators received for the sale. FCN was reevaluated to be worth 35 million kroner at the time of sale. The case has gone to supreme court, but it could still take 1-4 years to resolve.

History The first French to arrive to Haiti were pirates who began to use the island of Tortuga (northern Haiti) in 1625 as a base and settlement for raids against Spanish ships.Pirate Den: Tortuga In 1663, French settlers founded a colony in L√©og√¢ne, on the western portion of Hispaniola. After the Nine Years' War in 1697, Spain ceded the western portion of Hispaniola with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick that same year and France named the colony Saint- Domingue.History of Haiti The colony was France's most productive and richest colony and was made to grow primarily tobacco, indigo, sugar, cotton, and cacao using the labor of slaves from Africa as a result of the near extinction of the Ta√≠no people.To Heal Haiti, Look to History, Not Nature =Independence= Battle of Verti√®res, 1803 From 1789‚Äì1799, France underwent a revolution. The revolution in France had great implications in Haiti. In August 1791, slaves in the northern region of Haiti staged a revolt which would be known as the Haitian Revolution. In 1793, France sent as an envoy L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax to maintain control and stabilize the colony from the revolution. In February 1793, Haitian leader Toussaint Louverture joined Spanish forces in fighting the French.Upheavals in France and Saint-Domingue In October 1793, Sonthonax emancipated the slaves in all of Haiti. In May 1794, Louverture left the Spanish army after they refused to free their slaves in the eastern part of Hispaniola. In 1801, Louverture defeated the Spanish in Santo Domingo and emancipated the slaves of the territory. In 1802, General Napoleon Bonaparte sent 40,000 French and Polish troops to Hispaniola. Soon afterwards, Napoleon's brother-in-law General Charles Leclerc asked to meet Louverture to discuss terms. It was a deception and Louverture was seized and deported to France where he died in April 1803.Toussaint Louverture After the death of Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines stood as leader of the independence struggle and continued battling French forces. After the battle of Battle of Verti√®res in November 1803, France abandoned all hope of retaining control over the colony. On 1 January 1804, Dessalines declared independence for Saint-Domingue and renamed the new nation 'Haiti'.Independence of Haiti France officially acknowledged Haitian independence in 1824.M.

France threatened to invade Haiti and sent 12 war ships to the island nation.France Asked to Return Money ‚ÄòExtorted‚Äô From Haiti On 17 April 1825 an agreement was made between the two nations. France renounced all attempts to re-conquer Haiti and recognized Haiti as an independent nation after Haiti agreed to pay France 150 million gold francs in indemnity to the former colonists within five years. In November 1825 the first French consul presented his credentials to President Jean-Pierre Boyer.La premi√®re ambassade fran√ßaise en Ha√Øti (in French) On 12 February 1838, a 'Treaty of Peace and Friendship' was signed between both nations.Les relations franco-ha√Øtiennes (in French) Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between, both nations have signed several agreements and treaties, such as an agreement on commerce (1958); treaty on trade (1959); agreement on air transportation between both nations (1965); agreement on cultural, scientific and technical cooperation (1972); convention on the protection of investments (1973); cooperation on tourism (2007) and an agreement on joint research and of professional training (2015).France Diplomatie: Agreements and Treaties with Haiti (in French) French military unloading equipment and aid onto a beach in Haiti, 2010 Since independence, France continued to play an important role in Haitian affairs. Several Haitian Presidents ousted from power sought refuge in France, such as Presidents Jean-Pierre Boyer, Lysius Salomon, Franck Lavaud and Jean-Claude Duvalier. In December 1993, France asked the United Nations to tighten sanctions on Haiti after the removal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power by the military in September 1991.France Is Seeking Support in U.N.

It is currently under Google management and used to operate as an independent subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Based in New York City, Jigsaw is dedicated to understanding global challenges and applying technological solutions, from \\"countering extremism\\", online censorship and cyber-attacks, to protecting access to information. Jared Cohen, formerly with the Policy Planning Committee at the US State Department, is the CEO of Jigsaw, and was formerly co-founder and director of Google Ideas. History =Google Ideas= In 2010, Eric Schmidt approached Jared Cohen to lead Google Ideas, as a \\"think/do tank\\" to research issues at the intersection of technology and geopolitics, and has worked on projects intended to protect activists and independent media from cyber-attacks. Google Ideas also set a moon-shot goal of ending censorship within a decade. Ideas brought together a team of Google engineers, research scientists, product managers, and policy experts to address these issues. The team also hosted a number of conferences, the most recent of which was the Conflict in a Connected World Roundtable Series, in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations‚Äô Center of Preventative Action. Ideas came under scrutiny for its links with the US State Department and its regime change activities. =Jigsaw= In February 2016, Eric Schmidt announced in a Medium post the expansion of Google Ideas to a technology incubator named Jigsaw. According to Schmidt, the new name \\"reflects our belief that collaborative problem-solving yields the best solutions\\" and the team's mission \\"is to use technology to tackle the toughest geopolitical challenges, from countering violent extremism to thwarting online censorship to mitigating the threats associated with digital attacks.\\" Jigsaw will also leverage more of Alphabet's engineering talent and resources to build more sophisticated products. Projects =Perspective= In February 2017, Jigsaw and Google launched the free Perspective API, \\"a new tool for web publishers to identify toxic comments that can undermine a civil exchange of ideas.\\" Using machine learning technology, Perspective offers a score from zero to 100 on how similar new comments are to others previously identified as toxic, defined as how likely a comment is to make someone leave a conversation. Publishers can use Perspective in a number of ways, from offering readers instant feedback on the toxicity of their comments to giving readers the power to filter conversations based on the level of toxicity they'd like to see. Jigsaw claims \\"its AI can immediately spit out an assessment of the phrase‚Äôs ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù more accurately than any keyword blacklist, and faster than any human moderator.\\" Perspective's launch partners included The New York Times, The Guardian, The Economist and Wikipedia. The research on Wikipedia started discussion about Artificial intelligence in Wikimedia projects. In June 2017, The New York Times announced that as a result of the partnership with Jigsaw, the Times will offer comments on all top stories and scale comments to 80% of its articles by the end of the year. =Project Shield= Project Shield is a free anti-distributed denial-of- service (anti-DDoS) service that is offered by Jigsaw to websites that have \\"media, elections, and human rights related content.\\" The main goal of the project is to serve \\"small, under-resourced news sites that are vulnerable to the web‚Äôs growing epidemic of DDoS attacks\\", according to team lead George Conard. It is similar to services offered by companies like Cloudflare. Google initially announced Project Shield at their Ideas Conference on October 21, 2013. The service was initially only offered to trusted testers, but on February 25, 2016, Google opened up the service to any qualifying website. The service works by having the website use Google's IP's, and traffic is routed through a Google-owned reverse proxy that identifies and filters malicious traffic. Project Shield provides news, human rights, and election monitoring sites with protection from DDoS cyber-attacks by a system of caching (storing the data from the protected website to reduce load on the site). It also filters traffic to thwart DDoS attacks. Project Shield is built on Google Cloud Platform. It is provided free of charge to the qualifying websites of independent journalists, human rights, and elections monitoring websites to protect them regardless of their location and Project Shield as of 2016 October has users in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa. Project Shield rescued Brian Krebs's security blog from a then-unprecedented DDoS attack that knocked the website entirely offline. In March 2017, Jigsaw launched a campaign called \\"Protect Your Election,\\" a suite of free tools to help protect access to information during elections. These tools include Shield, Password Alert, and two-step verification. =Redirect Method= The Redirect Method is an open source methodology developed by Jigsaw in partnership, with Moonshot CVE, that leverages Google's AdWords platform and YouTube to target potential ISIS recruits and dissuade them from joining the group. Redirect, which was inspired by interviews with ISIS defectors and jailed recruits, \\"places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes it can effectively undo ISIS‚Äôs [influence]‚Äîclips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS‚Äôs corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group‚Äôs dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq.\\" Jigsaw claims that during a pilot project conducted in early 2016, its advertising was three to four times more effective than a normal campaign, and \\"those who clicked spent more than twice as long viewing the most effective playlists than the best estimates of how long people view YouTube as a whole.\\" Jigsaw published the detailed steps for the methodology under a Creative Commons license on a GitHub repository. Initially piloted against ISIS, the Redirect Method has since been deployed against white supremacists and disinformation in partnership with groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and Moonshot CVE. =Outline= Outline is an open-source tool that lets news organizations provide their network of journalists safer access to the internet,powered by Shadowsocks. Jigsaw claims the VPN software can be set up on one's own server in a matter of minutes, even if the user is not technically savvy. According to WIRED, \\"Outline aims to provide an alternative to, on the one hand, stronger anonymity tools like Tor that slow down web browsing by bouncing connections through multiple encrypted hops around the world and, on the other hand, commercial VPNs that can be expensive, and also put users' private information and internet history at risk.\\" WIRED adds that because administrators can add unlimited secret keys, \\"Outline [is] an easy way to run a VPN for an entire organization, like a group of activists or journalists.\\" Another feature is that Outline requires minimal upkeep, as \\"a feature called Watchtower automatically checks for security updates and installs them.\\" = Intra = Intra, launched 3rd October 2018, is a DNS over HTTPS client for Android versions 4.0 and above that helps protect against DNS manipulation attacks and SNI sniffing attacks typically employed by Internet Service Providers to censor websites, apps, and games. =Other projects= Other Jigsaw projects include Detox, Sideways Dictionary, Password Alert, Unfiltered.news, Digital Attack Map, and Montage (graduated to Storyful). In 2016, Jigsaw worked with the Wikimedia Foundation on Detox, a project using Machine learning to help better understand online harassment on Wikipedia, with application to other web platforms. The tool was removed in 2019, however, due to concerns about its accuracy. In March 2017, Jigsaw partnered with The Washington Post to launch Sideways Dictionary, a community- driven collection of analogies to explain complex tech jargon. Sideways Dictionary is available as a Chrome extension and on The Washington Post. Password Alert helps protect against phishing attacks; according to WIRED, \\"the company developed it for Syrian activists targeted by government-friendly hackers, but when it proved effective, it was rolled out to all of Google‚Äôs users.\\" Unfiltered.news \\"uses Google News data to show users what topics are being under-reported or are popular in regions around the world,\\" and the Digital Attack Map displays the top digital attacks in the world in real time. Montage is a program that \\"lets war correspondents and nonprofits crowdsource the analysis of YouTube videos to track conflicts and gather evidence of human rights violations.\\" In May 2016, Jigsaw announced it had partnered with Vice News on a five-part documentary series called Blackout to examine free expression around the world. Jigsaw also helped develop CopCast, an open source project that can turn any Android phone into a body-worn camera system for law enforcement. In June 2017, USA Today reported that the Jersey City Police Department will scale this technology to more than 250 officers.

As Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for BOEMRE, Monnett coordinated much of the agency's research on Arctic wildlife and ecology and had duties that included managing about $50 million worth of studies on the impact of oil/gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean. In July 2011, Monnett was suspended for 6 weeks, and lost his COR status, pending an ongoing investigation by the DOI Office of Inspector General. His defenders claimed he was subjected to a smear campaign. Unrelated to the Inspector General investigation, in December 2013, The Department of the Interior settled a whistleblower suit initiated by Monnett. They cleared his record of any reference to wrongdoing and awarded him $100,000.  Research  Monnett's research has been focused on the Arctic. He is the author of several studies on the Arctic ecosystem, particularly several done for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill Some of Monnett's most noted work deals with polar bears and the effects of climate change on the species. Monnett was on a research flight tracking bowhead whales in 2004 when he and a colleague, Jeff Gleason, spotted four dead polar bears floating in the water after a storm. After additional research, Monnett found that this was \\"the first time dead bears [had] been spotted among more than 350 sightings of swimming bears recorded over 16 years of surveying the area.\\" Monnett conjectured that this was due to \\"bears having to swim up to 60 miles across open sea to find food. They [were] being forced into the long voyages because the ice floes from which they feed [were] melting, becoming smaller and drifting farther apart.\\" Monnett published his findings in 2006 in an article in the peer-reviewed journal Polar Biology. Al Gore referenced Monnett's study in his 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which made the polar bears into an important symbol of climate change. The paper was cited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in its 2008 decision to list the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  Investigation and suspension  On July 18, 2011, Dr. Monnett was suspended and put on administrative leave by BOEMRE, pending results of an investigation into \\"integrity issues\\" by the DOI Office of Inspector General. During his paid leave, he was forbidden from speaking to colleagues or entering any Interior offices. BOEMRE director Michael Bromwich stated that Monnett's dismissal was not politically motivated, and did not involve questions about his scientific integrity. However, there was comment from climate \\"sceptics\\" that did raise questions about the integrity of scientists. British politician and columnist Ann Widdecombe used the case to support her view that \\"climate change money should go to armed services\\". Monnett's legal representative, the non-profit watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), stated that Monnett is subjected to a \\"witch hunt\\" regarding his 2006 scientific paper on drowned polar bears and released a transcript of a February 2011 interview of Monnett conducted by criminal investigator of the DOI Office of Inspector General. Although Monnett was questioned in the interview about the polar bear paper, it is not clear what relation, if any, it had to the integrity issues which bureau officials have cited. The investigations did impact on Monnett's oversight of a Canadian research study: BOEMRE briefly issued a stop-work order on the study, which was providing data on the movements of radio-collared polar bears being monitored by Canadian scientists. Monnett returned to work on August 25, although BOEMRE declared that Monnett will have no role in developing or managing contracts and will instead be in the environmental assessment division, and that future administrative actions are not ruled out. The investigation of a scientist by criminal investigators of the Inspector General triggered an outcry of protests from scientists and environmental and legal watchdog groups alike. \\"There's no way this can have anything but a chilling effect on the ability of other scientists to carry out their work,\\" says Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute with the Center for Biological Diversity. and group of Australian scientists sent a letter to President Obama, stating \\"This seems like the type of anti-science action that would have occurred under your predecessor and is similar to actions more expected in the pre-1989 Soviet Union\\". The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) so far takes a neutral stand on the issue. \\"We won't know, until the inspector general is done, exactly what the charges are and exactly what they are finding,\\" says Francesca Grifo, director of the scientific integrity program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Last year, UCS declared that the new DOI scientific integrity policy, as instated by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar on September 29, 2010, was \\"not an agency-wide scientific integrity policy as it states, but rather a scientist misconduct policy\\". PEER filed an official complaint with the DOI to protest the treatment of Monnett under this suspension and inquiry, asked that Monnett be reinstated and that the investigation be dropped or pursued by specifying charges against Monnett, along with a public apology from BOEMRE and the Inspector General.  Outcome  In 2012 Monnett was cleared of scientific misconduct in the media. The question whether or not Monnett was guilty of scientific misconduct was never addressed by the Department of the Interior Scientific Integrity Policy, but reprimanded for the improper release of government documents. The documents in question, issued from 2007 to early 2008, had been cited by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in making decisions to vacate BOEMRE's approval of the Shell oil exploration plans in the Beaufort sea. BOEMRE argued that the documents were exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, and thus should not have been disclosed. http://www.peer.org/assets/docs/noaa/10_1_12_Monnett_reprimand.pdf Monnett and PEER then filed a suit against BOEMRE, arguing that the e-mails he disclosed showed that the agency was breaking laws to push through Arctic offshore drilling permits, and the reprimand thus represented retaliation against a whistleblower. In 2013 BOEMRE settled, claiming that \\"The settlement document states that it does not constitute any admission of liability and that the agency entered into it to avoid the costs of litigation\\". However, the Department then removed all reprimand from Monnett's record and awarded him a cash settlement of $100,000. In addition to the other agreements in the settlement, the agency issued a certificate for a conservation award from the secretary of the interior which Monnett won in 2010, but that the agency had removed his name from.

During that time Crotta O'Neill's were one of the strongest sides in Kerry hurling. He won six Kerry Senior Hurling Championships. Nolan won the first of his County Championship medals in 1943, when Crotta, defeated Kenmare in the final.

Ward was co-founder of the publishing house Sheed and Ward. Early life Maisie Ward hailed from genteel Victorian blue bloods. She was born in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight on 4 January 1889, the eldest of the five children of Wilfrid Philip Ward and the novelist Josephine Mary Hope-Scott Ward. On her mother's side she was descended from Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk and on her father's side from William George Ward, a prominent member of the Oxford Movement. All four of her grandparents were converts to Roman Catholicism. She spent her childhood at first on the Isle of Wight, then Eastbourne, and finally in Dorking, before being sent off to board at St Mary's School, Cambridge. Here she was influenced by the preaching of Robert Hugh Benson and inspired by Mary Ward who had founded the order of nuns who ran the school. Career On leaving school, Maisie returned home to become her father's secretary. She worked for the Red Cross as a nurse during the First World War, and after her father's death in 1916 she co-edited with her mother a posthumous collection of his last lectures. In 1919, Ward became a charter member of the Catholic Evidence Guild. Ward was a forceful public lecturer. It was through the Guild that she met Frank Sheed. The couple have sometimes been cited as a modern Catholic example of street preaching. They were married in 1926; that same year, they moved to London and founded Sheed and Ward publishing. Ward was well-known for her best-selling authorized biography of friend G. K. Chesterton, written at the request of Chesterton's widow. Ward also wrote biographies of John Henry Newman, her own father, and Robert Browning; and in other areas, including New Testament scholarship, spirituality, and stories of saints and lesser notables, among them her friend, the writer and mystic Caryll Houselander. The amount and quality of what they wrote, spoke, translated and edited are a tribute to the contagious enthusiasm born of their felicitous pairing. Maisie Ward died 28 January 1975 in Jersey City, New Jersey. Sheed wrote a posthumous tribute to his wife under the title The Instructed Heart. Family Ward was the great-great-grandniece of Robert Plumer Ward, father of Sir Henry George Ward and grandfather of Dudley Ward; the great-granddaughter of William Ward, and of Henry Fitzalan- Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk and Augusta Mary Minna Catherine Lyons; the granddaughter of William George Ward, and of James Hope-Scott and Lady Victoria Alexandrina Fitzalan-Howard; the niece of James Hope, 1st Baron Rankeillour; and the daughter of Wilfrid Philip Ward and the novelist Josephine Mary Hope-Scott Ward.

The film was produced by ASA Productions and Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. and was released on 12 August 2011. Plot The film opens with a person (presumed to be the protagonist) who goes to a guru in Manchester, who tells him that he has to pay for his crimes in this life and the next one too. That person then goes to the cellar of a Mansion called Dia Mansion, writes all that he has done on a letter, places it in a huge coffin-like box, and then shoots himself. The next part of the film opens in modern-day UK, where the protagonist Dr. Kabir Malhotra (Rajneesh Duggal) is shown living happily with his wife Sia (Roshni Chopra). One day she goes missing without even a word. The worried doctor searches for her everywhere and questions everyone including her best friend Monica (Monica Agarwal) but does not find anything, until he comes across Disha,(Adah Sharma) a musician and sooth sayer with special powers of premonition on touching objects who does that job for free. Initially Kabir insults her and rejects her, but later on being convinced by inspector Asif Sheikh (Parag Tyagi)about her authentic powers, he agrees to take her help. With Sia gone, Kabir reflects on everything in the past- how he found Sia, how he had fought with other men at bars who went near her, how they had a good time. Soon Disha and the police find that Sia had gone with Monica and somebody else in a car somewhere, and that car is found abandoned. Kabir and Disha go to Monica's house, only to find that she has been murdered. The case takes an interesting turn when Disha happens to visualize something about Sia, which she does not tell Kabir because of her fear that it would be too shocking for him to accept. Soon Kabir and his parents get a call that Sia has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper asks for 1 million pounds from Kabir's parents. The kidnappers ask Kabir to come alone to deliver the money through directions given to him time and again over phone. Kabir goes with transmitters fitted on him and the police tracking him, but these measures are rendered useless by the apparently smart criminals. Soon Kabir finds himself in a dance bar, where the bags are taken from him, but the criminals find that it is filled with only paper, and they beat him and threaten to kill his wife. Kabir chases them, only to be stopped by Disha who arrives at the scene. She tells him that she knows where his wife is. Disha takes Kabir and the cops to Dia Mansion, where on searching they come across the cellar and the coffin box. Kabir opens it to find a skeleton and a worn out parchment. He reads all that was on it, and understand that this was written by none other than himself centuries ago. Kabir had at that time been deceived by a jealous friend of his into believing that his wife was unfaithful, and he murdered his wife and kept her in the coffin box. Later on knowing the truth, he was not able to forgive himself, so he had approached a guru, who told him that he will pay for his crimes now and in the next life, and told him what to do next. Kabir had then written everything and had shot himself at the cellar. Soon the kidnappers send a disc to Kabir's family with a video of Sia being tortured as a warning not to call police, and this time Kabir is called to an isolated ship to pay up and take his wife. On reaching the ship, Kabir goes alone, but Disha sees a gang of goons following him, senses danger and follows him secretly. On the deck, Kabir meets with the greatest shock of his life when he sees his wife, hale and hearty waiting to meet him, with none other that her Englishman boyfriend, whom Kabir had once beaten in a bar for going to Sia. Apparently everything that has taken place has been an act and both have been involved in the entire drama. Sia shoots Kabir in the shoulder. She then tells him that she and the Englishman were lovers, and that her only interest in Kabir was in his father's money and property, for which she married him. She also admits that it was she who killed Monica as the latter was involved in the crime and knew all about it. They tell Kabir that on killing him, she will put up an act of innocence before his parents and later the property will be transferred to her. They also say they shall eliminate his parents. As Kabir is going to be shot again, Disha breaks in and pushes the gun off Sia's hands. Kabir breaks fee and beats up all the goons. Disha is pushed off the ship and hangs on the deck margins. Kabir goes to save her, manages to pull her up, but gets stabbed by Sia's lover. Everyone flees the scene. Sia arrives at Kabir's house and tries to convince his parents that he was killed by goons, but there comes Inspector Asif, who has come to know about everything, telling them the truth. He arrests Sia on charges of attempting to Murder Kabir and on charges of murdering Monica. Now in hospital, in a critical condition and under surgery, Kabir's souls leaves his body and meets Guru, who tells him that he has faced the punishment for his crimes in the past, but he has also saved lives as a doctor, so the circle of karma is complete, and that he shall live. The film ends in Goa, India, where Kabir arrives as a surprise guest at the house of Disha who has moved down to India. He says that he searched and found a picture of the past of him and his wife. His wife of the past happens to be none other than Disha herself. Disha says she knew this but was afraid to admit it as she feared falling in love again.

It was a hesitant and slow attempt at democratisation of the Dutch East Indies. The power of the Volksraad was limited as it only had advisory powers. Although part of the council was elected only a small proportion of the population had voting rights.Harry J. Benda, S.L. van der Wal, \\"De Volksraad en de staatkundige ontwikkeling van Nederlandsch-Indi√´: The Peoples Council and the political development of the Netherlands-Indies.\\" (With an introduction and survey of the documents in English). (Publisher: J.B. Wolters, Leiden, 1965.) Opening of the Volksraad, Batavia 18 May 1918. The Volksraad had sixty members: 30 members from various indigenous groups, 25 European, and 5 from Chinese, Arab and other Foreign Orientals. The Volksraad was reconstituted every four years. The members of the Council were partly chosen, partly appointed by the colonial administration. History Kan Hok Hoei (appointed), R. Sastro Widjono (elected) and Mas Ngabehi Dwidjo Sewojo (appointed) The Volksraad was founded in Weltevreden, Batavia, Java, as an infant form of democratic representation on 18 May 1918 by the colonial chief executive Johan Paul, Count van Limburg Stirum (1873-1948), who was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1916 to 1921. In 1925 the Volksraad was made a semilegislative body; although decisions were still made by the Dutch government, the governor-general was expected to consult the Volksraad on major issues. The Soetardjo Petition was submitted by some progressive members in 1936, led by Soetardjo Kartohadikusumo, requesting independence for Indonesia as part of a Dutch commonwealth within ten years. The last election was in 1939. In 1942 the Volksraad was dissolved during the Japanese occupation. Volksraad article Britannica. In 1945 the Volksraad building located in Weltevreden was renamed the Pancasila building. Members The term of office for Volksraad members was three years, in 1925 increased to four years. Famous Indo-European members included Karel Zaalberg and Dick de Hoog. There were also representatives of the colony's Vreemde Oosterlingen, or 'Foreign Orientals', including Chinese members, such as Khouw Kim An, Majoor der Chinezen, H. H. Kan, Loa Sek Hie and Phoa Liong Gie. Arab members included Sayyid Ismail bin Sayyid Abdoellah bin Alwi Alatas. Among prominent indigenous parliamentarians in the Volksraad were the Javanese Tjokroaminoto and Mohammad Husni Thamrin, the Bantenese-Sundanese Ahmad Djajadiningrat, the Sumatran Agus Salim and the Menadonese Sam Ratulangi.

Section 1, \\"Republic of South Africa\\", defines South Africa as \\"one, sovereign, democratic state\\" and lists the country's founding values as: * Human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms. * Non-racialism and non-sexism. * Supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law. * Universal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness. This section is more deeply entrenched than the rest of the constitution; it would require the agreement of three-quarters (300) of the members of the National Assembly and six of the nine provincial delegations in the National Council of Provinces to amend it. Section 2, \\"Supremacy of Constitution\\", is the supremacy clause; it declares that any other law or conduct that is inconsistent with the constitution is invalid. This section gives the Constitutional Court and the other courts the power to overturn acts of Parliament, elements of the common law and actions of the executive that are unconstitutional. Section 3, \\"Citizenship\\", declares that there is a common South African citizenship, and that all citizens have equal rights and responsibilities. This is a response to the apartheid-era policies under which the government revoked the South African citizenship of many black people, making them instead citizens of the nominally-independent bantustans.

It was opened in 2010 based on a collection of commercial packaging, advertising, graphic arts, common devices and many other objects dating back to 1810 collected by Bruno Newman over more than forty years. The museum is dedicated to the preservation of its collection of more than 30,000 items from two centuries and to the research in the history of design and communications. Organization Glendora coffee can, first half of the 20th century. The Museo del Objeto del Objeto is a private foundation begun by Bruno Newman, a collector and founder/director of Zimat Communications in Mexico City. The museum is part of a long tradition in Mexico City of collectors who donate their collections in order to found or expand museums. Art collectors and other kinds of collectors have been behind museums such as Soumaya, Franz Mayer, Museo del Juguete and others. Collectors have also been important to the development of state museums in the country as well. The museum is one of several efforts in the country to promote and consolidate information about the history and culture of commercial design in Mexico. MODO is considered to be the first of its kind, with many of its objects not normally displayed in museums in the country. It focuses on the analysis of its collection and similar objects using the principles of design and communications as well as the use of new technologies. The museum is also dedicated to the support of collectors of every day objects, promoting formal arrangement and study of the objects collected. One reason the museum promotes collecting is that very often items related to design and communication are simply thrown away as junk, such as 1980s sneakers and 1970s skateboards. Morley's Prickly Pear Soap. Paper wrapping, beginning of the 20th century. Work to establish the museum started in 2004, with the inventorying, cataloging and photographing of each of the pieces. The last was done not only for conservation purposes, but also to allow access to the pieces electronically. The building, a former mansion in Colonia Roma, was restored for the museum. The museum was inaugurated in October 2010. The opening of the museum drew a number of international diplomats, including those from Russia, Guatemala, Haiti and Slovenia. Diplomats were invited to the event because the collection contains objects from various countries outside of Mexico. La Gunilla Editores is the publishing branch of the MODO organization. It is dedicated to the research and publication of materials related to design and communications. Much of its work complements that of the museum producing books and magazine in both print and electronic forms. Its first eight books include Mext√©ncil, Calcoman√≠as, Black Book M√©xico and Arte Urbe, which relates to graffiti in Mexico as a communication mode. Recorrido con Recordaciones y Encuentros con Conocidos are guidebooks to parts of Mexico and its capital, and El Objeto Ins√≥lito, o Solito and Una Gruesa de Colecciones both discuss collecting. MODO‚Äôs gift shop promotes young, mostly Mexican designers to distribute their work. Another line of products are those based on the museum‚Äôs permanent collection and temporary exhibits. The museum offers workshops, seminars, conferences and other activities designed to promote design and communication. Permanent collection Washing machine and carpet sweeper from the permanent collection. The museum‚Äôs permanent collection is based on the private collection of Bruno Newman, amassed over forty years. Newman began collecting when he was 13 years old, fascinated by his uncle¬¥s stamp collection. He says it was his first knowledge of other countries. He began collecting by purchasing five toiletry containers that he liked from the La Lagunilla Market. They turned out to be of a brand called Pompei from France made in 1910 and no longer produced. When he placed them on a table in his room, visitors were attracted by them. He moved on to old shaving supplies, then to advertisements. He bought things no one else wanted as most collectors wanted old books, colonial pieces and documents. Over the years the collection filled his house, his office and then three warehouses. In the mid-2000s, Newman began the process to found the museum in order that the collection be preserved and studied, especially as it relates to the development of package design, publicity and the graphic arts. The permanent collection is divided into 37 sections based on theme, such as soda bottles, cigarettes, music, stationery, printing material, pharmaceuticals, clothing and textiles and more. Braniff brand, second half of the 20th century. The total collection consists of over 30,000 items which date from 1810 to the present. This collection is too large to be shown in its entirety at the physical museum, so items on display rotate, presented in shows with themes or contexts. The first museum exhibit of the collection was a selection of 3,200 pieces entitles ‚ÄúNostalgia for the ordinary.‚Äù Most items are related to packaging, especially bottles, advertising and the graphic arts and are from everyday life. Other items include presses, some of which are over 100 years old, soda bottles from brands no longer in existence, utensils, cosmetics, food containers, clothing items and domestic appliances. Some notable items include old paper grocery bags from the Sumesa supermarket chain, a beer advertisement from 1890 and commercial packaging from occupied Japan. However, the museum space does not meet international standards of preservation. The collection is a starting point for the museum which aims to be a center of culture, exchange of ideas and research for communication and design. Temporary exhibits and events The museum holds regular temporary exhibits related to its collection and purpose, including the work of artists. During its opening in 2010, there was a temporary art exhibit by Carlos Aguirre named ‚ÄúODA a la Mujer‚Äù (Ode to a Woman). The exhibit consisted of five pieces created with phrases taken from a songbook series called Cancionero Picot. Aguirre selected portions of lyrics from these books, which are in the museum‚Äôs collection and include the first published in 1928. The selected lyrics were chosen as being depreciative to women to show misogyny. Pencils from the collection of Gonzalo Tassier Collection of Collections was the museum‚Äôs first major temporary exhibit after its opening, staged as part of the foundation‚Äôs mission to promote collecting. The idea was to expand what is worthy of a museum exhibit, focusing on what the museum calls ‚Äúurban collecting‚Äù about everyday objects not necessarily all that old. The idea behind it is that these objects have something to say about Mexican society. Part of the 1980s sneakers collection of Edgar Alejandro Cortes. The Collection of Collections consisted of seven collections belonging to private hands and one selected from the permanent collection of MODO. It is set up to show the wide range of collecting activities that occur in Mexico. Along with the display, the museum has co sponsored talks and meeting about collecting with academics from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. The total exhibit consisted of over 500 pieces with each collection given its own room. Postcard collection of Carlos Villasana and Raul Torres, who are well known Mexico City collectors. The exhibit only has about sixty of the over 15,000 which include rare ones by famous photographers such as Guillermo Kahlo, Hugo Brehme and Charles B. Waite who documented aspects of Mexico from the late 1800s to the early 20th century. The 1980s tennis shoe ( belonging to Edgar Alejandro Cortes) and 1970s skateboard collections (belonging to Perseo Medrano) were arranged by Pablo Romo Molina, director of Street Active Lifestyle magazine. Other collections included toy robots belonging to Barbara Berger, antique lamps belonging to Alexandre Lamaire and hats from the 1920s to 1950s part of Rodrigo Flores¬¥ collection. There is another room dedicated to Patricia Agraz¬¥s hands collection and one room dedicated a set of domestic appliances which were part of the original donation to the museum by Newman. In August and September 2011, the museum and the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico co-sponsored talks and workshops centered on design, communication and the collecting. These events invite academics from the university along with other specialists on design and collection. In September 2011, the museum inaugurated an exhibit called \\"El MODO de Tassier\\" based on the pencil collection and drawings of graphic designer Gonzalo Tassier. Building MODO is located in one of only eight buildings classified as Art Nouveau which still remain in Mexico City. It was built in 1906 and served for a time as Newman‚Äôs personal residence. It is located in Colonia Roma, just west of the historic center on Colima Street, known for its art galleries, restaurants and bars. Love locks Love locks at the MODO The love locks fence at the MODO is a place in Mexico City where people hang locks with their couple‚Äôs name as it has been done in other cities in the world, such as Florence and Paris. It was created by the MODO (Museo del Objeto del Objeto) which is located in front of the site; it consists of two fences that surround the trees and plants in the front of the museum, on the corner of the streets Colima and C√≥rdoba, in Colonia Roma, in Mexico City. The place was inaugurated on February 11, 2011 to celebrate Valentine's Day. MODO invited Mexican couples to show their love by hanging locks in the fences at one side of the building. The practice is part of a worldwide phenomenon called ‚ÄúMoccia phenomenon‚Äù, which is a massive placing of love locks at bridges. The ‚ÄúMoccia phenomenon‚Äù is based on the book ‚ÄúI want you‚Äù by the Italian author Federico Moccia, published in 2006.

Usual ingredients for nam phrik type sauces are fresh or dry chilies, garlic, shallots, lime juice and often some kind of fish or shrimp paste. In the traditional way of preparing these sauces, the ingredients are pounded together using a mortar and pestle, with either salt or fish sauce added to taste. Nam phrik type sauces are normally served on small saucers placed by the main dish as a condiment or dip for bland preparations, such as raw or boiled greens, fish, poultry and meats. Depending on the type, the region and the family that prepares it, nam phrik may vary in texture from a liquid to a paste to an almost dry, granular, or powdery consistency. Instead of khrueang kaeng or phrik kaeng, the words nam phrik can also be used to denote Thai curry pastes such as in nam phrik kaeng som for kaeng som or nam phrik kaeng phet for kaeng phet.http://www.thaifoodmaster.com/recipes/basic_techniques/thai_curry_paste_recipes/829 History The first Westerner to report of nam phrik was Simon de la Loub√®re, a French ambassador to the court of Ayutthaya. In 1687‚Äì88 he noted that it contains \\"a mustard like sauce, which consisted of crayfish corrupted (fermented fish); which they called kapi.\\" King Chulalongkorn, regarded as one of the greatest kings of Thailand, repeatedly stated during his tour of Europe in 1907 that, besides khai chiao (omelette), he most missed nam phrik. The chef David Thompson, an acknowledged expert on Thai cuisine, writes, \\"They are at the very core of Thai cooking and have fed the Thai from their distant past to the present.\\" Chili peppers originated in the Americas, where they have been cultivated for over 6,000 years. They were probably introduced to Asia, and Thailand, in the 16th century by Portuguese emissaries and traders in what is known as the Columbian Exchange. Before chili peppers were known and enthusiastically embraced in Thai cuisine, other spices such as black pepper, long pepper, and Sichuan pepper were used instead to achieve the desired \\"spiciness\\". Selected types :For \\"nam phrik\\" as curry pastes, see Thai curry Types of nam phrik vary according to the ingredients, the preparation and the region.

Design and development In 1946, Edward West, Jr obtained 6,000 war surplus General Electric Type B aircraft engine turbosuperchargers. His intention was to convert these into cheap, expendable turbojet engines that could be used to power target drones. He was awarded a US Navy contract to manufacture the engine, which was designated as the XJ38-WS-2. The modifications to the turbosuperchargers were extensive, as a single reverse flow combustion chamber was connected to the compressor outlet and the turbine inlet, where the aircraft piston engine would normally be fitted. A fuel metering system and new inlet and outlet ducts, and a re- engineered turbine was needed as well.Leyes The Navy contract called for three engines that would produce thrust at 26,000 rpm.

It has a mixed intake of over 1,200 boys and girls ages 11‚Äì16 with a comprehensive admissions policy. The school is operated by Outwood Grange Academies Trust, and the current principal is Godsway Dzoboku, taking over from Gavin Swinscoe in January 2020. It publishes a newsletter alongside Outwood Academy Valley, Outlook Magazine, on a termly basis. History Prior to its conversion, Portland School was in Special Measures (the lowest category for an Ofsted inspection). Following a massive investment of time, support and finance from the local authority, it had managed to achieve 41% 5A*-C including English and Maths, which was more than 10% below its target. However, this had been a great accomplishment as previously the school had spent several years achieving results that were in the teens. In Sept 2011 Outwood Grange Academies Trust began its journey with Portland School. The school was converted and became part of the Outwood Grange Academies Trust and was renamed Outwood Academy Portland. In January 2012 Dr Philip Smith was appointed Principal. The transformation began immediately and by March 2012 Ofsted stated that the ethos of the school was so different they were going to remove the Special Measures category and grade the school as satisfactory. They commented on the orderly manner in which students behaved, the quality of teaching and learning that was now evident, and the belief students were starting to have in themselves. That year the school exceed its target (of 52%) for the first time and achieved 57% 5A*-C including English and maths. The academy continued to excel in all aspects, with results the following year reaching 75%. Ofsted re-visited the school in March 2014 and graded it as Outstanding in every area, with the 24-month change from Special Measures to Outstanding being recorded as the fastest ever turn-around for a secondary school. The following year results increased again, and Outwood Academy Portland was also awarded the regional winner for its provision for disadvantaged pupils. An award it was nominated for again in 2016 following a further increase in 5 A*-Cs up to 81%. This also resulted in the academy receiving a letter from Nick Gibb (MP) stating that the academy had been identified as being in the top-100 schools in England for: attainment of 5A*-Cs, greatest sustained improvement, and value added from KS2 to KS4.  Ofsted judgement The academy has received a rating of \\"Outstanding\\", the highest rating, from Ofsted in its latest inspection in March 2014. OAP also maintained the Outstanding judgement at a monitoring visit in April 2019  Reporting system The progress of each pupil is monitored closely through the Praising Stars system of half-termly assessment, monitoring and intervention. As a commitment to parents the academy reports on every child‚Äôs progress every six weeks, giving accurate information for all subjects. The academy holds three parents‚Äô evenings per year where all parents/carers have the opportunity to meet all subject teachers to discuss progress.  Behaviour and discipline system  The academy uses a system of escalating \\"consequences\\" as a framework for discipline, beginning with C1 and ranging through to C6 (exclusion). This has proven to be highly successful in altering negative behaviour patterns and providing pupils with full responsibility for their actions and any following outcomes. C1 - C3 are warnings and a C4 means a detention from that particular subject. A C5 means that students have to spend a day in consequences or isolation. A C6 means exclusion Pastoral support Pupils are members of mixed-age tutor groups known as a vertical mentor groups that meet on a daily basis. Each mentoring group has pupils from all five school years (7 to 11), which leads to the groups evolving over time, as older pupils leave and are replaced by younger pupils entering the school. An advantage of mixed age tutor groups is the increased sense of community, allowing for pupils to share experiences and foster understanding. Vertical mentor groups are each named after a country, and split into houses named after the continents Africa, Europe, Asia, America and Oceania. Students go to assembly in the vertical mentor groups as each has a different day Sixth form Outwood Academy Portland shares a sixth form provision with Outwood Academy Valley.

E.T. Seton Park adjoins Thorncliffe Park, Flemingdon Park, and the Ontario Science Centre. It contains jogging and cycling paths, an archery range, nordic skiing and equestrian trails, as well as three fire pits. The park's archery range is one of only two public ranges in Canada. It was listed as the archery location in Toronto's bid book for the 2015 Pan American Games, but was not used for that competition because vehicular access to the range was not possible. The archery event for the Pan American Games was held at Varsity stadium on Bloor Street in downtown Toronto instead. In 2011, a disc golf centre was set up on the park's grounds.E.T.

The Bannock War of 1895, or the Bannock Uprising, refers to a minor conflict centered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the United States. During the early 1890s, Wyoming passed a state law prohibiting the killing of elk for their teeth, which led to the arrests of several Bannock hunters in 1895. The arrests and the death of one Bannock created wildly exaggerated rumors that the natives would revolt; at one point, the Eastern press reported that the Bannocks had massacred a large group of settlers in Jackson Hole. In response, the United States Army launched an expedition into the area- when troops arrived, it was found that the situation was peaceful and that the fears of uprising were unjustified. Conflict In the late 1800s elk populations in and around Jackson Hole declined. Fears arose that elk would become extinct due to poaching. By 1895, Jackson Hole was becoming a popular destination for big game hunters who felt the local Bannock hunters were interfering with their sport. Elk was a main food source for the Bannocks, who lived on Fort Hall Reservation across the border in Idaho, and whose treaty guaranteed a right to hunt \\"unoccupied lands.\\" In July 1895 a party of Bannock hunters was arrested for poaching by a posse of 27 men led by Constable William Manning. As they were marching back to town, the deputies all suddenly loaded their rifles. Concerned that they would be killed, the Bannocks escaped. In the melee, an infant was swept off his mother's back, and never found. An elderly, unarmed, nearly blind Bannock was shot four times in the back. Justice of the Peace Frank H. Rhodes, in a telegraph report to the Wyoming governor, said; \\"Nine Indians arrested, one killed, others escaped. Many Indians reported here: threaten lives and property. Settlers are moving their families away. Want protection immediately. Action on your part is absolutely necessary.\\" Once news of the incident reached the public, exaggerated reports made their way to the East Coast, where a New York newspaper claimed that all of the settlers in Jackson's Hole had been massacred by the Bannocks. The headline on July 27 of the Maryland newspaper \\"Baltimore Morning Herald\\" read: \\"Butchered by Bannocks - An Awful Massacre at Jackson's Hole. - TROOPS ARE TOO LATE. - Men, Women and Children Killed. - NOT ONE ESCAPED.\\" The newspaper went on to say that \\"[t]here is no doubt that the redskins have fired every home and cabin and by morning they will be repeating their work [in Idaho].\\" The source for the claim was three fishermen who said that \\"every man, woman and child in Jackson's Hole [was] murdered.\\" In an earlier article the \\"Baltimore Morning Herald\\" stated that their source, a mail carrier from Star Valley, said that the Bannocks had blocked off the passes leading into Jackson Hole and that the residents within the area were all fleeing for their lives. In response to these claims, the United States Army sent troops into the region with orders to occupy Jackson. Most were unable to traverse Teton Pass, but one company of Buffalo Soldiers managed to descend the slopes on their wagons with ropes. However, when the soldiers entered they found no Bannocks, no dead citizens or fires, proving that the whole situation was far different from what the newspapers were reporting. The Indian agent at Fort Hall telegraphed the following; \\"All Indians absent from reservation has returned. Had big council. Requested me to telegraph you their hearts felt good. Had not harmed a white man, and would start haying, leaving their grievances to the justice of the white man.\\" In the subsequent investigation, the United States Indian Service arranged for a test case regarding the Bannocks' treaty-reserved off- reservation hunting rights. A Bannock hunter named Race Horse was arrested for poaching, and taken to the District Court in Evanston (Jackson Hole was then in Uinta County, of which Evanston was the county seat). A habeas corpus case, Ward v. Race Horse, was then filed for his release. The case then went to the Supreme Court, which concluded that Wyoming statehood invalidated Bannock hunting rights. This decision was repudiated in the 2019 Supreme Court decision Herrera v. Wyoming. See also *Battle of Kelley Creek *Bering Sea Anti-Poaching Operations References *Who gets to hunt Wyoming's elk?

The years after World War II saw Japan as a defeated nation and the Japanese people had to improvise in many aspects of daily life. In the chaos of the post-war recovery large and very lucrative black markets opened throughout Japan. Various gangs fought for control over them. There were also many non-Japanese \\"third nationals\\" in post-war Japan. These \\"third nationals\\" or \\"third-country people\\" were former subjects of the Empire of Japan whose citizenship then transferred to other countries like China and Korea. The Shibuya incident involved former Japanese citizens from the Japanese province of Formosa (now called Taiwan) fighting against native Japanese Yakuza gangs. After the fight, the Chinese nationalist government stepped forward to defend the Formosans.  Background  Shibuya, Tokyo, in 1952. =Post-war Japan= The air raids on Japan left millions displaced in urban centers, and food shortages, created by bad harvests and the demands of the war, worsened when the importation of food from Korea, Taiwan, and China ceased. Repatriation of Japanese living in other parts of Asia only aggravated the problems in Japan as these displaced people put more strain on already scarce resources. Over 5.1 million Japanese returned to Japan during the fifteen months following October 1, 1945. Alcohol and drug abuse became major problems. Deep exhaustion, declining morale, and despair was so widespread that it was termed the . Inflation was rampant and many people turned to the black market for even the most basic goods. =Black markets= The black markets were among the first economic entities to spring up after the defeat of Japan. People who were desperate for food and basic necessities turned to the black market with its inflated prices as the official lines of supply and stores had either been destroyed or had nothing to sell. Four days after the surrender of Japan on August 14, 1945, the Ozu gang placed an ad in newspapers asking for factory owners, who up to that point only sold to the military, to come to gang headquarters and discuss distribution of their products. In Shinjuku, Tokyo, the Ozu gang then created a large market near the station and by had an enormous sign with 117 hundred-watt bulbs advertising its location; it was so bright that it could be seen from several miles away. Profits were huge, and the vendors ‚Äì who were known as \\"peanuts\\" ‚Äì earned as much as 50 yen a day (by comparison, teachers were paid a monthly salary of 300 yen). Other gangs followed suit and all over Japan open-air markets sprang up. About 30% of those working in the markets were \\"third-country people\\". =Third-country people= After the Empire of Japan's surrender, the territories it had controlled (often for decades) were broken up to form new countries, like North and South Korea, or occupied by Allied Powers. In response, the Japanese government regarded peoples of these places as foreigners, though they still had Japanese citizenship. Many thousands of these people had decided to emigrate to Japan. They were called \\"third-country people\\" or \\"third-national people\\" (daisan-kokujin in Japanese). With no work for even the Japanese and with thousands of refugees returning from the former colonies every day, there was little chance for third-country people to find work and so they turned en masse to the black markets and other underworld activities.  Turf war  With vast amounts of money to be made and simmering racist undercurrents, fights for control of the markets were probably inevitable. In fights broke out between Formosan gangs and the Japanese Yakuza group, Matsuba-kai. Outside the Shibuya police station over a thousand Matsuba members fought hundreds of Formosan gang members with clubs, metal pipes and some small firearms. Seven Formosans were killed and thirty-four wounded. The Japanese police suffered casualties too: one policeman was killed and another injured. The Japanese public were outraged by the chaos and blamed the non-Japanese Asians and the incompetence of the Japanese police. Tensions between the Korean and Formosan communities mounted. More than forty Formosans were arrested in connection with the incident, but their cases were quickly taken up by the Chinese component of Allied command in Tokyo. The men were given a very public trial and the Japanese government was also forced to put the Tokyo policemen who were involved in the incident on trial, something that was unheard of in Japan. The trial resulted in thirty-five convictions; sentences were either hard labor or deportation. The trial put a spotlight on the Chinese population in Japan; the Chinese used their influence in Allied command to grant special status to ethnic Chinese, and gave them special rights including extra rations, a privilege that was not granted to ethnic Koreans.

Trongsa Province occupied lands in central Bhutan corresponding somewhat to modern Trongsa District, although the power of the Trongsa Penlop extended far beyond his own realms, covering the entire east of Bhutan. The province was administered from the Trongsa Dzong in the town of Trongsa, and its ruling governor was known as the Penlop of Trongsa, or Tongsab. History Trongsa Dzong, administrative headquarters of Trongsa Province Under Bhutan's early theocratic dual system of government, decreasingly effective central government control resulted in the de facto disintegration of the office of Shabdrung after the death of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in 1651. Under this system, the Shabdrung reigned over the temporal Druk Desi and religious Je Khenpo. Two successor Shabdrungs ‚Äì the son (1651) and stepbrother (1680) of Ngawang Namgyal ‚Äì were effectively controlled by the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo until power was further splintered through the innovation of multiple Shabdrung incarnations, reflecting speech, mind, and body. Increasingly secular regional lords (penlops and dzongpons) competed for power amid a backdrop of civil war over the Shabdrung and invasions from Tibet, and the Mongol Empire. The penlops of Trongsa and Paro, and the dzongpons of Punakha, Thimphu, and Wangdue Phodrang were particularly notable figures in the competition for regional dominance. During this period, there were a total of nine provinces and eight penlops vying for power. Traditionally, Bhutan comprised nine provinces: Trongsa, Paro, Punakha, Wangdue Phodrang, Daga (also Taka, Tarka, or Taga), Bumthang, Thimphu, Kurtoed (also Kurtoi, Kuru-tod), and Kurmaed (or Kurme, Kuru-mad). The Provinces of Kurtoed and Kurmaed were combined into one local administration, leaving the traditional number of governors at eight. While some lords were Penlops, others held the title Dzongpen (Dzongkha: ‡Ω¢‡æó‡Ωº‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ωë‡Ωî‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã; Wylie: rjong-dpon; also \\"Jongpen,\\" \\"Dzongp√∂n\\"); both titles may be translated as \\"governor.\\" The Penlop of Trongsa controlled central Bhutan; the rival Penlop of Paro controlled western Bhutan; and dzongpons controlled areas surrounding their respective dzongs. The Penlop of Paro, unlike Trongsa, was an office appointed by the Druk Desi's central government. Because western regions controlled by the Penlop of Paro contained lucrative trade routes, it became the object of competition among aristocratic families. Chogyal Minjur Tenpa (1613‚Äì1680; r. 1667‚Äì1680) was the first Penlop of Trongsa (Tongsab), appointed by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. He was born Damchho Lhundrub in Min-Chhud, Tibet, and led a monastic life from childhood. Before his appointment as Tongsab, he held the appointed post of Umzey (Chant Master). A trusted follower of the Shabdrung, Minjur Tenpa was sent to subdue kings of Bumthang, Lhuntse, Trashigang, Zhemgang, and other lords from Trongsa Dzong. After doing so, the Tongsab divided his control in the east among eight regions (Shachho Khorlo Tsegay), overseen by Dungpas and Kutshabs (civil servants). He went on to build Jakar, Lhuentse, Trashigang, and Zhemgang Dzongs. The 10th Penlop of Trongsa Jigme Namgyel (r. 1853‚Äì1870) began consolidating power, paving the way for his son the 12th Penlop of Trongsa Ugyen Wangchuck to prevail in battle against all rival penlops and establish the monarchy in 1907.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, his family moved to Berea, Ohio in 1913. He graduated from Berea High School in 1918. After graduating Baldwin‚ÄìWallace College, he studied art at Cleveland School of Art and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. Early influences on his work were Gaar Williams, Ding Darling, and Billy Ireland. His career at the Plain Dealer began in 1922 as understudy to editorial cartoonist Hal Donahey. Kuekes handled general art chores for the Plain Dealer, such as illustrating news events. Over the years he drew a number of regular features for the paper, including a movie-themed feature called Closeups, an editorial cartoon called All in a Week, and a Sunday feature called Cartoonist Looks at the News. For much of the 1940s, his trademark was a rabbit named \\"The Kernel\\", which came from his work as an amateur stage magician. Following Donahey's death in 1949, Kuekes became chief editorial cartoonist of the Plain Dealer. Kuekes won the Pulitzer Prize for a Korean War cartoon called \\"Aftermath\\". In the cartoon, two soldiers carry a third on a stretcher. One asks \\"Wonder if he voted?\\" while the other replies \\"No, he wasn't old enough.\\" (In the United States, the voting age was not lowered from 21 to 18 until the passage of the 26th Amendment in 1971.) In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, Kuekes won three Freedoms Foundation medals in 1949, 1950, and 1951, a Silver T-Square in 1953, and a Christopher Award in 1955.

The festival takes place over a span of four days and has hosted a variety of Christian speakers and artists since the late 1980s.http://www.kingdombound.org/connect/why-kbm/ History Kingdom Bound started out as an idea by two locals from Buffalo, New York, Fred Caserta, a booking agent and concert promoter, and Mike Caputy, a local musician. 1980s- In 1986, Caserta and Caputy presented a concert featuring Christian artists Sheila Walsh, Russ Taff, and Mylon LeFevre. Following this concert, Caserta and Caputy were approached by Kevin Ketcham, who, at the time, was the Special Events Coordinator for Darien Lake Theme Park, located halfway between Buffalo and Rochester, New York. Ketcham presented them with an idea of holding a Christian music day at the theme park, and in October 1987, the Kingdom Bound festival made its debut. Despite chilly, 39 degree atmosphere, approximately 6,000 people showed up to hear the variety of Christian artists and speakers that Caserta and Caputy had put together. The following year, in 1988, the festival was moved from October to the end of August, where it would remain for the next twelve years. 1990s- In 1992, despite heavy rains from Hurricane Andrew, the Kingdom Bound festival was not cancelled. Many still attended the rain soaked event and to this day, the incident became lovingly known among patrons and staff as ‚ÄúMudfest‚Äù. The following year saw a first for the festival when Kingdom Bound booked three headliners: Newsboys, dc Talk, and Steven Curtis Chapman. With festival attendance and popularity growing at an incredible rate, Kingdom Bound began booking concerts year round in different cities, bringing in different Christian artists such as Steve Green and 4Him. 2000s-Upon entering the new millennium, Kingdom Bound was moved from Wednesday through Saturday in late August, to Sunday to Wednesday at the beginning of August. The new era also saw the beginning of Kingdom Bound‚Äôs website, www.kingdombound.org. In 2004, Kingdom Bound welcomed Enemy Opposition, a ministry that uses BMX, inline skating, and skateboarding to present the gospel, to the festival In 2008, Kingdom Bound Ministries partnered with CMS Productions to bring the Christian Music Summit to Buffalo. Artists/Speakers for King & Country performing at Kingdom Bound 2015 Artists have included- Michael W. Smith, Paul Baloche, Rebecca St. James, Skillet, Relient K, Jeremy Camp, Nicole C. Mullen, Kutless, Pillar, Casting Crowns, MercyMe, TobyMac, Chris Tomlin, Third Day, Thousand Foot Krutch, David Crowder Band, Seventh Day Slumber, Lecrae, Newsboys, and Hillsong United. Speakers have included- Jay Bakker, Frank Reich of the Buffalo Bills, Jill Kelly, actors Kirk Cameron and Stephen Baldwin, Dr. Kevin Leman, columnist Cal Thomas, Nick Vujicic, and Wes Aarum. Activities The annual Late Night Bonfire in the Darien Lake Campground Along with the various Christian speakers and artists, Kingdom Bound has worked hard to provide different activities for its patrons. For example, in the summer of 1996, the festival offered activities such as ‚ÄúRave in the Cafe‚Äù, a single‚Äôs coffee house, and nightly Bible studies with Rochester‚Äôs Pastor Samme Palermo and in 2014, Kingdom Bound invited artist Tony Goodwin to teach Art & Soul Workshops during the festival. Over the years, the festival has offered, and continues to offer, daily seminars throughout the event, as well as activities specifically geared towards youth such as KB Kidz, geared toward 4-8 year olds, and AMPED for 9-13 year olds. Not only are patrons encouraged to enjoy the activities, but the KB Marketplace as well, which contains a variety of Christian vendors and giveaways. Stages Darien Lake Amphitheatre: The Darien Lake Amphitheatre, or ‚ÄúPAC‚Äù, took shape in 1993 when for the first time in KB history, the festival booked three headliners. This stage serves as the main stage and continues to be where the headliners play during the festival. Artists that have performed here include TobyMac, Skillet, Mandisa, for King & Country, and Michael W. Smith The AWAKEN Stage Known as the ‚Äúplace for interactivity‚Äù, this stage plays host to a variety of acts such as teachings, skits, games, and hard rock or hip-hop Christian artists. Artists that have performed on this stage include RED, Manic Drive, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, KB, Social Club and many others. Worship Tent: Added in 1989, this stage has been called ‚ÄúThe heart of Kingdom Bound Summer Festival‚Äù. Located next to the campground, this tent offers teachings, music, and worship from morning to night all throughout the festival. Worship artists such as Paul Baloche, Robin Mark, Brothers McClurg and Rend Collective have performed on this stage. Camping at Kingdom Bound CAMPING/HOTELS: During the festival, Kingdom Bound offers all those attending the festival the chance to stay in the Darien Lake Theme Park Resort.

Starring Vincent D'Onofrio as a serial killer and Eamon Farren as a young prisoner of the killer, it explores their relationship as the killer seeks to turn his captive into his prot√©g√©. Gina Philips, Conor Leslie, Jake Weber, and Julia Ormond appear in supporting roles. The film premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival and was released direct-to-video in the United States by Anchor Bay Entertainment. It received a polarized, although generally positive response, with some contention over its content and ending, while the performances were praised. Plot Sarah Fittler and her nine-year-old son take a taxi to return home from a cinema, but the driver Bob abducts and brings them to his house. As a result of the abuse his father inflicted on him and his brother, Bob turns into a serial killer who rapes and murders young women. He kills Sarah and imprisons her son, whom he names Rabbit. When Rabbit tries to escape, Bob chains him to a wall. Years later, the teenage Rabbit remains in Bob's home doing housework and burying the bodies of Bob's victims. While still holding Rabbit captive, Bob tries to become more of a father figure and has Rabbit teach himself human anatomy. To convince Rabbit that nobody else cares for him, Bob reveals that Rabbit's father Brad has remarried. He also releases Rabbit from his chains. However, in bringing Rabbit closer, Bob intends to turn Rabbit into a serial killer like him. To complete Rabbit's transformation into a serial killer, Bob asks him to pick a victim from a yearbook. Rabbit initially refuses, but when Bob forces him to select, he chooses a girl named Angie and Bob abducts her. Leaving Rabbit and Angie in a room, Bob warns Rabbit that he will kill her if Rabbit doesn't. Rabbit hesitates and starts to bond with Angie, but stabs her in the stomach when Bob barges in. He then drags her body into the room containing the corpses of past victims. Satisfied, Bob agrees to his request to hunt for another girl. Bob brings Rabbit to the city with his cab and suggests several victims, but Rabbit declines them all. Along the drive, Bob discovers that Rabbit has written the word \\"help\\" on the side of the cab. Bob then realizes that Rabbit stabbed Angie in a non-lethal spot using his anatomy knowledge. He knocks Rabbit unconscious and enters the room where Angie is hiding to kill her. Angie manages to cut Bob's Achilles tendon while Rabbit awakens and comes to save her. In the following struggle, Rabbit kills Bob and buries him next to his victims. With Bob dead, Rabbit tracks down Brad, now living with his new wife Marie and Rabbit's half-brother Colin. Brad feigns delight about his survival until Rabbit, whose real name is Tim, confronts him with the fact that Brad had arranged the abduction of him and his mother. Through a letter he found, Tim discovered that Bob is Brad's brother. Brad, who had urged Sarah to take a taxi on the day of the kidnapping, wanted to get rid of his first wife and son. Brad responds to this revelation by physically assaulting Tim, and then Marie when she intervenes. Tim beats him to death. After Tim leaves at Marie's urging, Marie calls the police and says that a burglar killed her husband. Tim returns to Bob's house and shuts the garage door. As the closing credits roll, the sounds of him entering the house, opening the fridge, cutting paper, walking back into the garage, entering the cab, and re-opening the garage door are heard.

Amy Matysio appears as Mary, one of Bob's victims. Director Jennifer Lynch has a cameo as a cooking show host on TV.  Production  The film was shot in Regina, Saskatchewan, over a period of 15 days. Lynch used the same crew as Surveillance. The original concept came from a script by Damian O'Donnell. Although Lynch liked the script, she felt it was wrong for her, as she did not want to shoot a film in the style of torture porn. The producers explained that they wanted to see her take on the script, so she rewrote it to focus on the characters rather than gratuitous violence. Lynch said that by focusing on the story, she was able to \\"humanise and explain ‚Äì though not justify ‚Äì the devastating behaviour that is a serial killer.\\" D'Onofrio was drawn to the project by Lynch's involvement, as he had wanted to work with her on Boxing Helena. Lynch had also wanted to work with D'Onofrio, but the role was not specifically written for him. Lynch was drawn to D'Onofrio, who was always her first choice, because the part required an actor that was capable of showing an injured inner child. Because D'Onofrio was willing to do this, Lynch praised his performance as brave. Farren and D'Onofrio worked well together on the set, which D'Onofrio credits for their on-screen chemistry. The actors used very little improvisation. For Bob, D'Onofrio said that he needed to find the character's moral compass, even though Bob is a serial killer. As a character actor, D'Onofrio said that he is drawn to fascinating characters, no matter how flawed. Farren was impressed with Lynch's cover letter for the script reader and got along very well with her when they spoke. On set, Farren and Lynch collaborated easily, and Farren said that she did not need to give much direction to him. Lynch recruited Bird, who played the young Rabbit, over Skype after the casting crew recommended him. Lynch said that his audition tape gave her chills. The film is a study of how monsters are made, and Lynch says that she wanted to \\"promote a dialogue about child abuse.\\" Through Bob's back story, Lynch attempted to show how society had turned him into a monster through child abuse. With Rabbit, she wanted to explore the theme of \\"nature vs nurture\\". Farren described Rabbit as a stunted child, a nineteen-year-old man who stopped emotionally maturing at nine. Rabbit did not become what Lynch called \\"a full blown replica of Bob\\" because he has a loving childhood. This allowed Lynch to compare and contrast how the two men turned out. Lynch did not want to perpetuate the cycle of violence and make Rabbit into a killer, which she said would have been boring. Lynch was contractually obligated to keep the film to a certain run time, so she had to abbreviate the plot twist. Although she recognizes that some people find it to be tacked on, she said that a director's cut would expand on it and make it more natural. The ending scene is meant to be hopeful, and Lynch says that she sees it as both realistic and happy.  Release  Chained had its world premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal on 5 August 2012. Anchor Bay Entertainment released it direct-to- video on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on 2 October 2012. Although there was money budgeted for a director's cut, they had to use it in other areas. Lynch still wants to do a director's cut eventually. The film was originally rated NC-17 by the MPAA for \\"some explicit violence\\". Lynch appealed the rating, but it was upheld. She later edited the film to achieve an R rating. Kevin Carney of Anchor Bay said that films with comparable violence were rated R for arbitrary reasons, and Lynch said that her films were targeted with NC-17 ratings for their authenticity and intensity, which, according to her, \\"rewards a casual attitude toward violence.\\" Lynch later said that NC-17 had failed, as audiences still associated it with the old X rating. The NC-17 scene that was cut, which depicts a more graphic version of Mary's (Amy Matysio) death, is included as a special feature. Lynch stated that she would have preferred to release the film under its working title Rabbit, but the studio would not comply.  Reception  The film drew a polarized response from critics. Negatively comparing it to Jennifer Lynch's debut Boxing Helena in terms of misogyny, Dennis Harvey of Variety called it \\"a repugnant exercise in physical and psychological sadism\\" and \\"a redundant wallow in arted-up, torture-porn cruelty.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph both rated it one out of five, with Bradshaw calling it a \\"fantastically crass and fatuous serial-killer movie\\" and Robey calling it \\"a lurid disgrace\\". David Hughes of Empire rated it two out of five and described it as \\"plenty nasty but singularly lacking in clever new twists on a weary genre.\\" Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk rated it one and a half out of five, criticizing Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as \\"kind of comical\\" and the ending as \\"increasingly ridiculous\\", although he praised the sequence between Rabbit and Angie and Conor Leslie's performance. Conversely, Matt Glasby of Total Film rated it three out of five and called it a \\"tense serial killer thriller\\", with the ending being his only main point of contention. Rod Lott of the Oklahoma Gazette praised the first half of the film as \\"absorbing and tense\\", and while finding the second half to be less-interesting, noted that \\"Lynch does not compromise in her direction, nor shy away from depicting depravity\\" throughout the entire film. Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! wrote that it is a \\"deeply disturbing, but deeply human look at the causation of cyclical violence.\\" Simon Foster of the Special Broadcasting Service rated it three and a half out of five, and called it a \\"bleak, claustrophobic and brutal serial killer drama.\\" Scott Weinberg of Fearnet described the film as \\"a stark, unpredictable, and frequently ugly rumination on themes like free will and morality\\" and \\"deserves credit for trying to mine some relatively intelligent chills out of something different, topical, and primally disturbing.\\" Lauren Taylor of Bloody Disgusting rated it four out of five and wrote, \\"Chained takes a typical tale of an abused child growing up to become a serial killer and makes it something that is Oscar worthy\\", with praise for D'Onofrio's performance. Serena Whitney of Dread Central rated it three and a half out of five and wrote, \\"Not since American Psycho have audiences experienced a clever dissection of the appalling misogyny displayed in the serial killer subgenre from a female perspective\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict concluded that Chained \\"stumbles a bit yet still manages to crawl under your skin and creep you out.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 68% approval rating based on 19 reviews.

The first official school year as an independent school district was the 1908‚Äì1909 school year. The original location of Mayfield High School was on West Walnut Street School which opened in September 1908, and in 1909 the high school moved to the old West Kentucky College Building. A new stadium was built behind the high school and dedicated on November 6, 1925, at the Madisonville/Mayfield Game. Up to this point, games were played at Cyclone Park, which was in the far north corner of what was Maplewood Cemetery.http://www.cityofmayfield.org/Public_Works_Cemeteries_Department_files/Graves%20County%20Cemeteries.pdf In 1966, Dunbar High School, the school for black students in the Mayfield area, was closed and the students enrolled in Mayfield High School by court order.

Located just outside the historic boundary of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, AARFAM was founded with a collection donated by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and an endowment from her widower, John D. Rockefeller Jr., heir to the Standard Oil fortune and co-founder of Colonial Williamsburg. With her seminal collection, Abby Rockefeller \\"elevated a body of material that had long been dismissed as homespun craft to a nationally-recognized and highly-regarded form of American art.\\" The original building opened in May 1957 and was expanded in 1992 before being moved and expanded again in 2007, each time to accommodate its growing collection. Abby Rockafeller's collection of 424 pieces became the basis of a collection that now includes more than 7,000 folk art pieces dating from the 1720s to the present. A further expansion at its current location is projected to open in 2019. Having opened originally as the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection (AARFAC), the facility changed names in 1977 to the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center (AARFAC) and again in 2000 to Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. Now co-located with the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum, both collections retain their respective names -- and are together known as the Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg. History After collecting a formative group of American folk art pieces under the advisement of consultants and art dealers, art patron Abby Aldrich Rockefeller anonymously loaned part of her folk art collection to the Museum of Modern Art exhibition American Folk Art: The Art of the Common Man in America, 1750‚Äì1900 which ran from November 30, 1932, through January 14, 1933 in New York. The exhibition would later tour six US cities, and in 2017, Antiques Magazine wrote that \\"whether or not there was unanimous agreement on the importance of folk art in that story, the category could no longer be ignored.\\" In 1935 Rockefeller loaned part of her folk art collection to the Ludwell-Paradise House in Williamsburg.Gerard C.Wertkin and Lee Kogan, eds., Encyclopedia of American Folk Art (New York: Routledge, 2004), 1, https://www.questia.com/read/110904768 Four years later, she donated the collection to Colonial Williamsburg, where it remained in the Ludwell-Paradise House until 1956. In 1956, after the 1948 death of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and two years after her husband announced he would endow a Williamsburg museum bearing the Rockefeller name, their son David Rockefeller augmented the collection at the Ludwell-Paradise House with another 54 folk art objects his mother had donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. The collection remained open to the public at the Ludwell Paradise House until January 1, 1956.\\" In conceiving a new location for the collection, the Rockefellers had worked with pioneer collector in the field of American decorative arts and folk art, Nina Fletcher Little who in the early 1950s suggested \\"the ceilings be lowered and the interior become a series of domestic-scaled spaces. She did the first research on the collection, made attributions of paintings, and wrote the first catalogue of the collection.\\" The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection opened in May 1957 in a new two-story, purpose-built Georgian/Federal Revival brick building with a prominent oval garden -- located just outside the historic district of Colonial Williamsburg at South England Street, adjacent to the Williamsburg Inn. At this time (1957), the Ludwell-Paradise House, despite being the original real estate purchase by John Rockefeller to create Colonial Williamsburg, became a private residence.\\" In 1992, the museum inaugurated a 19,000 sf single-story brick addition featuring a prominent planted wood and brick pergola and an adjoining fountain garden, designed by architects Roche- Dinkeloo. In 2007, the AARFAM left the South English Street building and co- located the growing folk art collection with the nearby DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum -- on Francis St. between Nassau and South Henry Streets, near Merchants Square. There, the collection occupied an expansion of 10,400 square feet of exhibition space with 11 galleries, entered via a notably circuitous arrival sequence beneath Colonial Williamsburg's adjacent Public Hospital of 1773 building. With the AARFAM's relocation, the original building (with its oval garden) and the 1992 addition (with its fountain garden) became associated with the Spa of Colonial Williamsburg. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation announced in 2014 a $40 million addition to the Dewitt Wallace/Abby Aldrich structure to break ground in April 2017 and open in 2019 -- to include a new 65,000sf wing and to feature a new more accessible, street-level entrance on Nassau Street. Collection The 424 objects, collected by Abby Rockefeller between 1929 and 1942 remain the core of the collection, however the museum has grown into containing more than 3,000 objects today. The Old Plantation, ca. 1785‚Äì95, watercolor by slave-holder John Rose. The first year after its opening the museum came to include, besides Rockefeller's collection, works assembled by J. Stuart Halladay and Herrell Thomas, Holger Cahill, Edith Gregor Halpert, and John Law Robertson. Now the museum contains works of portraiture, Southern and African American folk art, sculpture, fraktur, and textiles. It includes representative works of well renowned artists, such as Eddie Arning, Wilhelm Schimmel, Erastus Salisbury Field, Edward Hicks, Lewis Miller, Albert Hoffman, Louis Joseph Bahin and Ammi Phillips. Various exhibitions of the museum regarded 18th and 19th-century painters such as Zedekiah Belknapp, James Sanforth Elsworth, and Asabel Lynde Powers. The museum includes notable 18th-century watercolor paintings such as The Old Plantation, by South Carolina slave owner John Rose. One of the notable curators of the museum has been Thomas N.

It was popularised by pioneering and successful retailers such as Harry Gordon Selfridge, John Wanamaker and Marshall Field. They advocated that customer complaints should be treated seriously so that customers do not feel cheated or deceived. This attitude was novel and influential when misrepresentation was rife and caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) was a common legal maxim. Variations include \\"le client n'a jamais tort\\" (the customer is never wrong) which was the slogan of hotelier C√©sar Ritz who said, \\"If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked\\". A variation frequently used in Germany is \\"der Kunde ist K√∂nig\\" (the customer is king), while in Japan the motto \\"okyakusama wa kamisama desu\\" () meaning \\"the customer is a god\\", is common. However it was pointed out as early as 1914 that this view ignores that customers can be dishonest, have unrealistic expectations, and/or try to misuse a product in ways that void the guarantee. \\"If we adopt the policy of admitting whatever claims the customer makes to be proper, and if we always settle them at face value, we shall be subjected to inevitable losses.\\" The work concluded \\"If the customer is made perfectly to understand what it means for him to be right, what right on his part is, then he can be depended on to be right if he is honest, and if he is dishonest, a little effort should result in catching him at it.\\" An article a year later by the same author addressed the caveat emptor aspect while raising many of the same points as the earlier piece.

In sports therapy, an ice bath, or sometimes cold-water immersion or cold therapy, is a training regimen usually following a period of intense exercise in which a substantial part of a human body is immersed in a bath of ice or ice-water for a limited duration.Note: This article only refers to the use of ice baths in sports therapy and not to their use in cold exposure programs like the Wim Hof Method where ice baths are of different temperatures and are used differently. While it is becoming increasingly popular and accepted among athletes in a variety of sports, the method is controversial, with a risk of hypothermia, with the possibility of shock leading to sudden death. Many athletes have used cold water immersion after an intense exercise workout in the belief that it speeds up bodily recovery; however, the internal physical processes are not well understood and remain elusive. Evidence supporting cold water immersion as part of an athletic training regimen remains inconclusive, with some studies suggesting a mild benefit such as reducing muscle damage and discomfort and alleviating delayed onset muscle soreness,Christine Kearney, 20 February 2012, Medical News Today, Muscle Soreness ‚Äì Is Cold Water Immersion Effective For Treatment?, Retrieved October 5, 2016, \\"...a cold bath may be an effective way to prevent and help sore muscles. ...difficult for researchers to determine exactly how much cold water immersion helps sore muscles, ...The researchers say it is necessary for more studies to be done in order to be sure of the effectiveness of cold water baths in treating muscle soreness. ...\\" with other studies suggesting that cold water immersion may slow muscle growth and interfere with an overall training regimen. Techniques Ice baths have been used as a part of military training. =Bath= It is done by standing or sitting in a bucket or bath of icy water. One writer advised: \\"don't overdo it.\\" Wearing rubberized \\"dive booties\\" on the feet (to protect toes) as well as rubber briefs to warm the midsection have been recommended. Champion weightlifter Karyn Marshall, who won the world women's weightlifting championship in 1987, described what it was like to take an ice bath after a day of competition at the CrossFit Games in 2011 in Los Angeles: One report suggested that if ice water is circulating, it's even colder such that the water will be colder than measured by a thermometer, and that athletes should avoid overexposure. Physical therapist Nikki Kimball explained a way to make the bath more endurable: =Ice bath only versus contrast bath therapy= Iceman Wim Hof in an ice bath in 2007. Some athletes use a technique known as contrast water therapy or contrast bath therapy, in which cold water and warmer water are alternated. One method of doing this was to have two tubs‚Äì‚Äìone cold (10‚Äì15 degrees Celsius) and another hot (37‚Äì40 degrees Celsius) ‚Äì‚Äìand to do one minute in the cold tub followed by two minutes in a hot tub, and to repeat this procedure three times. =Temperature and timing= The temperature can vary, but is usually in the range of 50‚Äì59 degrees Fahrenheit or between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius. Some athletes wear booties to keep their toes warm or rubberized coverings around their midsection while immersed. Some drink a warm beverage such as tea. One report suggested that \\"ten minutes immersed in 15 degree Celsius water\\" was sufficient. Accounts vary about how long to be immersed and how often to do them. One adviser suggested that an athlete should take ten two-minute ice bath treatments over a two-week period. One account suggested immersion times should be between ten and twenty minutes. Another suggested that immersion run from five to ten minutes, and sometimes to twenty minutes. There were no sources advocating being immersed for longer than twenty minutes. =Ice baths versus cold baths= Several sources suggest that cold baths (60‚Äì75 degrees Fahrenheit, 15.5-22.8¬∞C) were preferable to ice baths. Physiotherapist Tony Wilson of the University of Southampton said that extremely cold temperatures were unnecessary and a \\"cold bath\\" would be just as effective as an ice bath. Another agreed that a mere cold bath is preferable to ice baths which are \\"unnecessary.\\" A third report suggested that cool water (60‚Äì75 degrees Fahrenheit, 15.5-22.8¬∞C) was just as good as water at a lower temperature (54‚Äì60 degrees Fahrenheit, 12.2-15.5¬∞C) and that eight to ten minutes should be sufficient time, and warned against exceeding ten minutes. Effectiveness In summer 2014, the Ice Bucket Challenge went viral on social media to raise money for the ALS Association. After exercise, there is some evidence that taking an ice bath may reduce delayed onset muscle soreness and perceptions of fatigue, but no good evidence of any other benefit. Safety There is agreement in the medical and scientific communities that ice baths can pose serious risks to health. Risks include hypothermia, shock and the possibility of sudden cardiac death. History Marathon runner Paula Radcliffe won the 10,000m event at the 2002 European championships and attributed her victory to the use of ice baths. She reportedly said \\"It's absolute agony, and I dread it, but it allows my body to recover so much more quickly.\\" She reported taking ice baths before racing and preferred her pre-race bath temperature to be \\"very cold.\\" After the Radcliffe comment, the technique has grown in popularity. It is gaining in popularity among athletes, such that some athletes \\"swear by it\\" but other accounts suggest it may be a fad. It has been used by athletes such as A. J. Soares and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps as well as other celebrity endorsers and is getting to become \\"common practice\\" among athletes from different sports, including American football, association football (soccer), long distance running, rugby, tennis, volleyball, and other sports. There was a report that sports equipment manufacturers are considering different designs for ice baths. In the summer of 2014, as a fundraising method, the nonprofit ALS Association, which raises money for research and public awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, began the Ice Bucket Challenge which involved donors filming themselves and challenging other donors to participate and then being doused with a bucket of ice cold water; as a fundraising effort, it raised $16 million over a 22-day period.August 14, 2014, Campbell North, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, People around the country have ALS challenge down cold, Retrieved Aug. 18, 2014, \\"...Those who forgo the ice bath are asked to donate to an ALS organization...\\"Bill Saporito, Aug. 18, 2014, Time magazine, How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Could Change Fundraising Forever, Retrieved Aug. 18, 2014, \\"...Never mind the ice bath; you could have just written the check....\\" There are indications that ice baths may be gaining popularity with groups outside sports, such as dance. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that some Radio City Rockettes, a precision dance company performing in New York City, use ice baths after a long day of performing as a way to \\"unwind\\" and cope with \\"aches and pains.\\" One report suggested that entertainer Madonna used ice baths after her performances. And there are indications that use of ice baths is spreading to amateur sports, such as high school football. Explorer and athlete Fiann Paul is known for using ice baths as part of his training routine. Ice baths are a part of a broader phenomenon known as cryotherapy‚Äîthe Greek word cryo (Œ∫œÅœÖŒø) means cold‚Äîwhich describes a variety of treatments when cold temperatures are used therapeutically. Cryotherapy includes procedures where a person is placed in a room with \\"cold, dry air at temperatures as low as ‚àí135 ¬∞C\\" for short periods of time, and which has been used in hospitals in Poland as well as a center in London to treat not only muscular ailments, but psychological problems such as depression. Basketball player Manny Harris reportedly used a Cryon-X machine featuring extreme low temperatures around minus 166 degrees Fahrenheit, but used it with wet socks resulting in a serious freezer burn. Occasionally ice baths have been an ill-advised treatment of fever in young children, but that doctors were counseled not to use this technique because of the risk of hypothermia. Ice baths have been suggested as a way to prevent muscle soreness after shoveling snow. In addition, there have been instances of ice bathing as an extreme bodily test by persons vying for an endurance record, such as Dutch Iceman Wim Hof, and Chinese record-holders Chen Kecai and Jin Songhao. According to reports, doctors and scientists are studying how these people can spend an hour and a half submerged in an ice bath, and survive; for almost all humans, such tasks are impossible.

In 2008, Govindan was awarded the title of \\"Yoga Acharya\\" by the Federation Francophone of Yoga, and made one of only 39 \\"Lifetime members of the World Yoga Council\\" out of more than 10,000 members of the International Yoga Federation of teachers in recognition of his contributions to the field of Yoga. On January 17, 2010 he was honored in Chennai, India for his contributions to this work. M. Govindan Satchidananda has been given the honorary \\"Patanjali Award\\" for 2014 for his outstanding service to Yoga by the World Wide Yoga Council and Dharmachari Swami Maitreyananda, President of International Yoga Federation, which is the oldest and largest international Yoga association and registry of Yoga teachers. Satchidananda has been added to a long list of recipients who have received this award every year since 1986. See the list of previous recipients of this award here.  Career  Upon graduating Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in 1970, he was initiated into Kriya Yoga by Yogi S.A.A. Ramaiah (1923-2006). He remained his disciple until the end of 1988, assisting him in the establishment of 23 Kriya Yoga centers around the world. He has described his two meetings with the guru of Yogi Ramaiah, Babaji Nagaraj, above Badrinath in 1999 and has written about Babaji and the Siddha Yogis.  Reception  The Indologist and Yoga scholar Georg Feuerstein wrote in review of Govindan‚Äôs publication of the Tirumandiram: \\"Yoga-loving English speakers and the academic community owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Marshall Govindan (Satchitananda) for initiating and sustaining this mammoth project.\\" In his 1996 Yoga Journal review of Govidnan's publication Thirumandiram: A Classic of Yoga and Tantra, Feurstein praised Marshall Govindan for his contribution to the field of Classical Yoga by editing and publishing for the first time in English, one of what he called the four most important literary works related to Yoga. In November 2001, in his Yoga Journal review of Govindan's Kriya Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Siddhas, Feurstein wrote: \\"A significant contribution to the sadhana of every serious yoga student, this copious (nearly 300 pages) new work, the result of a 10-year effort, includes detailed translation, tips for integrating the lessons into one's practice, references to other commentaries, and indexes to both Sanskrit and English keywords in the text.\\" Hinduism Today (July 2010) wrote: The publication of English translations of the Tamil Yoga Siddhas literary works is moving the state government of Tamil Nadu, India, to recognize their importance and publish them. In January 2010, the Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments of Tamil Nadu, K. R. Periyakaruppan, spoke at a function aimed at launching the 10-volume series of the English translation of Tirumandiram. Periyakaruppan stated: \\"The state government will favourably consider setting up a publication house for Tamil religious books.\\" Stephane Champagne, journalist for La Presse newspaper of Montreal, reported: \\"The Master of the ashram, Marshall Govindan, and his wife Durga, are known almost everywhere in the world. They teach Yoga, we are told, in the United States, in Europe and even in India. M. Govindan is building an ashram in the region of Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India.\\"  Partial bibliography  * Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga Tradition, 1991, Babaji‚Äôs Kriya Yoga and Publications, 8th edition, 2008, * Babaji‚Äôs Kriya Hatha Yoga: Eighteen Postures for Relaxation and Rejuvenation, Babaji‚Äôs Kriya Yoga and Publications, 8th edition, 1992, 8th edition, 2009, * The Thirumandiram: Classic of Yoga and Tantra, Siddha Thirumular, Editor: M.

The lakes lie in the far west region of New South Wales, Australia, near the town of Menindee. The Menindee Lakes Water Storage Scheme supplies water to Broken Hill, the lower Darling and to water users along the Murray River in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement. Seven of the lakes have been incorporated in an artificially regulated overflow system providing both for flood mitigation and as storage for domestic use, livestock and irrigation downstream. The lakes are also important for waterbirds. Location and features Surface find of Aboriginal camp. Menindee Lakes, N.S.W., 1976. The lakes are located approximately south-east of Broken Hill in the semi-arid zone on grey clay and duplex soils, and siliceous and calcareous sands of the far west region. The lakes range in size from . The largest are Lakes Menindee, Wetherell, Pamamaroo and Cawndilla. These four, with Tandure, Bijijie and Balaka, are part of the Menindee Lakes Water Storage Scheme, with Cawndilla and Menindee also within the Kinchega National Park. Lakes Nettlegoe, Kangaroo, Stir Tank, New and Malta are unregulated. Lake Tandou is managed as irrigated cropland and is no longer subject to flooding.

Important Bird Areas factsheet: Menindee Lakes. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 15 August 2011. =Menindee Lakes Storages= The Menindee Lakes Storages is a major gated dam, including multiple weir and lake impoundments and a concrete spillway, with six vertical lift gates, across the seven lakes that form part of the Menindee Lakes Water Storage Scheme. The lakes were originally a series of natural depressions that filled during floods. As the flow receded the floodwaters in the natural depressions drained back into the Darling River. In 1949, work began on building dams, weirs, levees, canals and regulators to catch and retain floodwaters. Major works were completed in 1960 and final completion was in 1968. There were electrical upgrades in 2007. The scheme was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission, to manage river flows, town water supplies and other domestic requirements, irrigated agriculture, industry, and flood mitigation. It has become increasingly important for regulating environmental flows. Construction of the retaining walls required of rock fill, high and long. The average water depth is and, at 100% capacity, the dam walls hold back of water at an average of above sea level. The surface area of the lakes within the scheme is and the combined catchment area is . The uncontrolled concrete spillway with six vertical lift gates is capable of discharging water at . =Birds= Some of the lakes and their surrounds, with the exception of Lake Tandou, have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported up to 222,000 waterbirds, including over 1% of the world populations of freckled ducks, grey teals, pink-eared ducks, red-necked avocets, sharp- tailed sandpipers and red-capped plovers. Other waterbirds sometimes using the lakes in large numbers are Australasian shovellers, Australian shelducks, pied cormorants, yellow-billed spoonbills, Eurasian coots and white-headed stilts. Other species recorded in the IBA include Australian bustard, black and pied honeyeaters, chirruping wedgebill and grey falcon.

It is a parody of the Harry Potter films yet it also contains many jokes related to the radio programme. The film's name comes from a critical review by Kermode of the film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. Plot The film opens with a prologue narrated by Stephen Fry, introducing the audience to Benjamin Sniddlegass (Andrew Griscti), a nerdy redheaded orphan from Cockfosters, UK, who lives with his domineering Aunt David Morrissey (Linda Newstead). After discovering his Aunt has been hiding packages addressed to him, he sneaks down to the mailbox one morning and finds an envelope containing an iPhone, which teleports him to Luna Park in Sydney, Australia. He's met by Mr. Pentangle (Alec Doomadgee), an imposing Aboriginal man, who reveals that Ben is part of an ancient magical sect of Wittertainers. The pair journey to a small island off the Australian coast, which is home to Fairport Academy, the magic school that Ben will be attending. While moving into his dorm, Ben meets Scarlett McKenna (Catherine Davies), a gorgeous co-ed a few years his senior, who casts a spell curing his near-sightedness. At the school assembly, Ben is ignored by the student population, but Scarlett comforts him. The new principal, Bavarian filmmaker Werner Herzog (Dorian Newstead), gives the opening address, warning the students that changes will be made with him in charge. A musical montage shows the next three months of Ben's school life. His initial classes with Professor Mumblecore are a disaster, and Ben is the subject of humiliating gossip among his fellow students. He takes advantage of a history project to deliver a presentation on his idol, skiffle legend Johnny Leroy, which wins over his classmates, who applaud him enthusiastically. A chat between Ben and Scarlett shows their relationship beginning to grow closer, as Ben's confidence has grown. He is outfitted with a new wardrobe, and is given a suit belonging to his father as a going away present from Pentangle, who is swimming to Germany to take up his new post as headmaster of Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School. Ben visits Principal Herzog, curious about the history of his family. Herzog tells Ben of his early life, fighting alongside Ben's father Percy (also Andrew Griscti), a secret agent employed by the British government. Percy's career was focused on defeating the machinations of the sinister Lord Emmerich, a vicious mastermind with the head of a gorilla. In a flashback, Ben's mother Lucy (Sarah Linnegar) is held hostage by Lord Emmerich in his lair, inside a hollowed out Icelandic volcano. Percy breaks into the facility and confronts Emmerich, defeating him and rescuing his bride. Sensing his defeat, Emmerich sets the self-destruct sequence, causing the volcano to erupt and kill them all. Ben relates his troubles to Scarlett over a game of billiards in the Fairport Academy bar. She reveals she lusted after Ben's father when she was growing up, and they trade innuendo as she beats him decisively. As they get more and more drunk, she delivers a rambling speech to him about hero worship and they almost kiss. The next morning, Ben invites Scarlett down to the disused concert hall, and shows her his plan to resurrect the school's tradition of concerts, which used to be filled by the ghosts of dead rock stars. Ben's strategy is to run school talent quests, then start to bring in notable living performers, like Bruce Springsteen. An impressed Scarlett joins Ben on the stage and they perform a duet of the Fairport Academy School Song. The print becomes scratchy and is replaced by a technical difficulties card. The projectionist (Max Newstead) phones the director of the film (Jeremy Dylan) and explains that he's lost the next two reels of the film. Dylan is concerned that this skips a number of important plot points, but they conclude that no one will notice. Kenneth restarts the projector. Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney have just left the stage as Ben concludes his performance at the school talent quest to rapturous applause. Later, Ben sleeps uneasily. Ben dreams he's back in the concert hall, watching Johnny Leroy and the Impulsives perform on stage. In the second verse, Leroy transforms into the Lord Emmerich, who leaps down from the stage and menaces Ben, demanding to know the 'secret of the cauldron of penguins'. Ben awakes with a start. Scarlett comes to his door to check on him, but Ben assures her it was merely a bad dream. A concerned Scarlett calls Pentangle in Germany and relays the news. Ben is plagued by another dream involving Lord Emmerich and the Cauldron of Penguins, this time more violent, and awakes in a panic. Scarlett comes to his door again, more concerned, and they sit together in his room and resolve to go to Principal Herzog for advice. She comforts him and they have sex. In his office the next morning, Herzog tells Ben of his concern that Emmerich is using Ben's dreams as a way to regain a footing in the physical world. The only solution is to keep Ben awake indefinitely and Herzog concocts a mixture of energy drinks, coffee and cocaine that Ben reluctantly drinks. He heads to the school library with the mixture, researching penguins in hopes of discovering the solution to the mystery of the cauldron. As he ingests more the mixture and stays awake longer, he begins hallucinating a talking stuffed penguin (Lauren McKenna), who mocks him. Ben punches him repeatedly in the face. Two weeks later, a concerned Pentangle arrives at the library, searching for Ben, who has become totally unhinged. Pentangle cleans him up and tells him that Scarlett and Herzog have been kidnapped by Lord Emmerich, and together they search for clues where they were last seen. Ben finds an iPhone and uses the transporter app to follow them. He appears in Lord Emmerich's hollowed out Icelandic volcano lair, an exact replica of the room where he faced off with Ben's parents. Scarlett is bound and gagged on an operating table and Emmerich stands over her, threatening them with a pistol. He removes his gorilla mask to reveal that he is really Werner Herzog, who created the fictional persona of an eccentric Bavarian filmmaker to escape the authorities after surviving the destruction of his old lair. He reveals his overly elaborate plan in a long-winded speech, then prepares to shoot them both dead.

His co-host Simon Mayo declared that he wanted to see that film. In Australia, music video director Jeremy Dylan created a mock poster for the film and uploaded it to a blog at benjaminsniddlegrass.com, which was discovered by fans of the show, who sent it in, along with Dylan's subsequent mock press releases about the film, into the show. Mayo read some of Dylan's work out on 26 February and he and Kermode encouraged Dylan to make the film. Assembling a cast made up of performers from amateur musical theater societies around Sydney and penning the screenplay himself, Dylan and his production team started shooting on 6 June 2010 and shot the film over seven days between June and mid-October. Locations included The Exchange Hotel, Epping Boys High School and a motel which was used for the school dormitories. Stephen Fry is a known listener to the Mayo and Kermode show and when he travelled to Sydney in August 2010, Jeremy Dylan approached him about narrating the film by passing a copy of the screenplay to him at the end of his one-man show at the Sydney Opera House. The show was filmed by the ABC and Dylan can be seen doing so in the television special made of the show. Two days later, Fry emailed Dylan and invited him to come to his hotel with his recording equipment. The narration was recorded that afternoon. The film's score was provided by Mike Carr, a Golden Guitar winning singer-songwriter active in the country music industry. Carr also wrote one of the original songs featured in the film, 'Famous'. Along with 'Bad Man', the main title theme, and 'Judgement Day', another skiffle song, the original songs were recorded in a studio in Riverwood, produced by Dylan and the engineer, Jeff Cripps. The songs were performed live by the actors who portray Johnny Leroy and the Impulsives in the film, in an attempt to emulate the early Elvis Presley Sun Studio recordings. The cinematographer, Yavor Dimitrov, was studying at UTS when the film was in production, and owned the camera the film was shot on. He became a producer on the film as production wore on. When the film was completed, Dylan was interviewed on the Mayo/Kermode show, promoting the film's theatrical premiere in Sydney the following week. The premiere was held on 31 January 2011, at the Dendy Cinema, Newtown, to a sold out house, and the DVD and digital download of the film became available immediately afterward. The film was subsequently screened at the State Theatre in Hobart. Reception The film was reviewed by Kermode the week following the premiere, where he expressed ambivalence about the film, but admitted to laughing \\"six or seven times\\".

The club have won the Hungarian League 20 times and the Hungarian Cup 8 times. Early years The club was founded on 16 June 1885 by school teacher J√°nos Goll in √öjpest, a separate city in those times, just next to the borders of Budapest under the name √öjpesti Torna Egylet. It was formed first as a general athletic club, performing gymnastics and fencing, and its motto was \\"Soundness, Strength, Harmony\\" (). In 1899, a football club was formed in the city of √öjpest under the name √öjpesti FC and with the same colours, purple and white. The first official match of √öjpesti FC was a 1:1 draw on 29 April 1900 against III. Ker√ºleti TVE. In 1901 the two clubs (UTE and √öjpesti FC) merged and formed the football division of √öjpesti TE and the club joined the second division of the newly formed Hungarian League. √öjpest is ever since one of two teams in Hungary that have never missed a season since the beginnings of league games in the country. √öjpest were promoted to the first division in 1904 and they have managed to play on top flight ever since except for the season of 1911‚Äì12 when they finished as champions of the second division after a one-year relegation. The first golden era Juventus, 1934 Central European Cup quarter-finals. The club built the new Megyeri √∫ti stadion in 1922, which marked the opening of a new era of medal collection. The legendary \\"Fogl-gate\\" (Fogl-g√°t in Hungarian), a massive defending formation of brothers K√°roly Fogl II and J√≥zsef Fogl III for both the national team and √öjpest was the key point for the club's successes. From 1926, after the introduction of professional football in Hungary, the football team was playing under the name √öjpest FC. The late 1920s and 30s brought the first golden age of the club, marked by finishing on top of the Hungarian first division 5 times and international cup success, including two Mitropa Cup titles in 1929 and 1939, and also the Cup of Nations title in 1930. In the 1938‚Äì39 season, B√©la Guttmann coached the team to wins of the Hungarian League and the Mitropa Cup (the precursor to the European Cup). The team finished on one of the first three positions in every season between 1926 and 1942, and played in five cup finals during the 1920s and 30s. √öjpest gave 5 players for the World Cup of 1938 to silver medalist Hungary including Gy√∂rgy Sz≈±cs, Antal Szalay, Istv√°n Balogh I, Jen≈ë Vincze, and the rising star of Hungarian football, Gyula Zsengell√©r. After World War II The first years after World War II saw the second golden era of √öjpest, and saw the club on the top of the championship three times in a row, once even giving 9 players to the Hungarian national team. Players like Ferenc Szusza, B√©la Egresi, S√°ndor Balogh II, Istv√°n Nyers or Mih√°ly Nagymarosi were setting records of winning 30 consecutive games, or scoring 187 goals in one single season. B√©la Guttmann in early 1947 rejoined √öjpest FC, then known as √öjpesti TE, and won another Hungarian League title. In 1950 the communist government chose √öjpest as official club of the police and renamed them Budapesti D√≥zsa (after Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa), a fairly common practice in Eastern Bloc countries (except that in other places \\"police clubs\\" were all named Dinamo/Dynamo) and two decades of moderate league and cup success followed. In 1951, defender S√°ndor Sz≈±cs, after being executed by the communist government for high treason during a secret pre-arranged trial, became a martyr of the club. As a result of the less successful years, Mih√°ly T√≥th was just one of two √öjpest players in 1954 World Cup squad, and the only one to play in the final. During the 1956 revolution, the club renamed itself √öjpesti TE; however, after the revolution was pulled down by the Soviets, the Hungarian government ‚Äì unlike for FTC or MTK ‚Äì didn't let the club use their old name. This resulted the name √öjpesti D√≥zsa, which was referring both to the district and to the police. After 13 years without a league title, √öjpest became champions of Hungary in 1959‚Äì60, and reached the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final in 1962 with the help of the new star, J√°nos G√∂r√∂cs. 1960s √öjpest won the 1959‚Äì60 season of the Hungarian League. Therefore, √öjpest were eligible to enter the European Cup 1960-61 season. On 28 September 1960, √öjpest beat Red Star Belgrade 2‚Äì1 at the Jugoslavenska Narodna Armija in Belgrade. On 12 October 1960, √öjpest beat Crvena Zvezda 3‚Äì0 at the Megyeri √∫ti Stadium. In the first round, on 6 November 1960, √öjpest were beaten 6‚Äì2 by Benfica at the Est√°dio da Luz in Lisbon. On 30 November 1960, √öjpest beat Benfica 2‚Äì1 at the N√©pstadion. In the same season, √öjpest entered the 1960‚Äì61 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In the first round, on 16 October 1960, √öjpest lost 3‚Äì2 to Birmingham City at the St Andrew's, in Birmingham, while in the second leg, played on 26 October 1960, √öjpest lost 2‚Äì1 at the Megyeri √∫ti Stadium. √öjpest entered the 1961‚Äì62 European Cup Winners' Cup. In the first round √öjpest beat Floriana F.C. 5‚Äì2 at the Independence Ground, Floriana, Malta. In the second leg, √öjpest beat Floriana F.C. 10‚Äì2 at the Megyeri √∫ti Stadium. In the second round, √öjpest lost to Ajax Amsterdam 2‚Äì1 at the Olympic Stadium. In the second leg, √öjpest beat Ajax Amsterdam 3‚Äì1 at the Megyeri √∫ti Stadium. In the quarter-finals, √öjpest beat 4‚Äì3 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. at the Megyeri √∫ti Stadium.

There are some of us, like myself, who feel we should have more input.\\"Ingrid Peritz, \\"Drapeau's the boss, and no argument; Civic Party celebrates 25 years of power,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 October 1985, B1.

Rumours circulated in the mid-1980s that the Civic Party could drop Savoidakis as a candidate. Savoidakis said that he was not concerned with this threat; describing himself as a \\"small-c conservative,\\" he also said that he would not defect to the progressive Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM), which was then in opposition.Montreal Gazette, 14 November 1984, A3. When Jean Drapeau announced that he would seek not re-election in 1986, Savoidakis supported Yvon Lamarre's unsuccessful bid to become the party's new mayoral candidate.Ingrid Peritz, \\"The man who might be mayor; To understand Yvon Lamarre visit his fiefdom in southwest,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 May 1986, B6.

This competition is fielded largely by privateer teams racing unibody-based production vehicles. History Beginning in 2004, The Sport Compact Car and Superstreet magazine sponsored Super Lap Battle finals are typically held just before SEMA, which lands in November of each year. The event was held twice in its inaugural year and with the exception of non-finals events being held at other venues, the Super Lap Battle finals have since been run once a year on Buttonwillow's Clockwise 13-turn (CW13) configuration.Superstreet Magazine, Source Interlink Magazines LLC, February 2010. Borrowing heavily from the Hyper Rev Super Battle held at Tsukuba Circuit in Japan, its prominence has been bolstered by numerous visiting world-class time attack teams. The most notable visiting team has arguably been the Japanese HKS team and their Mitsubishi Evolution \\"C230R\\", which made its way to Buttonwillow Raceway Park in 2007, lapping the course in 1 min 43.523 sec which was five seconds quicker than the previous record set by the Japanese Sun Auto \\"Cyber Evo\\" team in 2004. The HKS C230R record lap triggered an aggressive response by American competitors to regain the title.Sport Compact Car Magazine, Source Interlink Magazines LLC, Volume 21, No. 3 March 2009. After nearly three years of progressive development and failed attempts at regaining the Super Lap Battle record from HKS, the lap time was finally bested by a substantial margin at the 2010 event by Sierra Sierra Enterprises' Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Factor X Motorsports Development's Acura NSX, muscling their way to lap times of 1:41.056 and 1:41.949 respectively.

Smith (November 22, 1914 - October 8, 1991) was an American sports writer and editor. He was the sports editor and columnist for the Detroit Free Press from 1945 to 1965 and the president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America from 1955 to 1956. He later served as the public relations director and business manager for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1980. Early years A native of Peoria, Illinois, he attended Bradley University and the University of Illinois. He was inducted into the Bradley University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1950. Smith began his career in journalism as a reporter for the Chicago Daily News. He spent seven years with the Chicago Daily News from 1938 to 1945. He claimed to have given the \\"Whiz Kids\\" nickname to the 1943 Illinois basketball team. Detroit Free Press In March 1945, Smith was hired as the sports editor and columnist at the Detroit Free Press, a position he held until 1965. During his time with the Free Press Smith was included in the committee of baseball writers charged with selecting the American League Most Valuable Player. In 1947, Smith became involved in a controversy over competing claims to the national collegiate football championship by undefeated teams from Notre Dame and Michigan. Notre Dame was ranked No. 1 in the final regular season AP Poll, but Michigan went on to defeat USC by a score of 49-0 in the Rose Bowl. Smith urged the Associated Press to conduct a post-bowl poll, arguing that Michigan had defeated three common opponents by larger margins than Notre Dame and had a tougher schedule. After Smith's comments, the AP agreed to conduct a post-bowl poll, the first of its kind, and Michigan was selected as the national champion in that poll by a vote of 226 to 119. After the results were tallied, Smith wrote in The Sporting News, \\"Michigan won another football battle!\\" Also in January 1947, Smith broke the story of the Detroit Tigers' decision to sell Hank Greenberg to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Smith reported that Tigers owner Walter O. Briggs had read comments from Greenberg about his desire to play for the Yankees and concluded that \\"Greenberg was ungrateful, unkind and unfair to Detroit,\\" and ordered the team's general manager to \\"get rid of Hank.\\" In August 1948, three days after the death of Babe Ruth from cancer, Smith proposed that Major League Baseball designate September 30, 1948 as \\"Babe Ruth Day\\" and that all proceeds from games played on that day be donated to cancer research. Smith's 1948 tribute to Harry Heilmann, former batting champ and radio voice of the tigers, was published in The Sporting News. Smith wrote: > \\"[H]e is so good that if he gets any better there'll be no more attendance > records set at Briggs Stadium. After all, who wants to leave that nice, soft > easy chair to be pushed around with 50,000 other fans when he can stay right > at home and get a word picture ... with anectodes ... of the game. Only > thing wrong with his broadcasts is that you hate to get out of your chair > and rush to the ice box to get a bottle of that cool stuff he mentions now > and then.\\" In October 1954, Smith was elected as the vice president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. In the spring of 1955, Smith asked readers to submit ideas for a nickname for the Tigers' star right-fielder Al Kaline. From the submissions, Smith chose \\"Salty,\\" which the reader explained, \\"After all, salt means alkaline.\\" In September 1955, he was elected as the president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America and served in that role in 1956. Smith also served as a director of the Football Writers Association of America for several years. Smith was chosen as the chief scorer for the 1956 World Series, and was the scorer for Don Larsen's perfect game in the World Series. Fellow sportswriter Arthur Daley noted, \\"By the ninth inning, the most nervous people in the ball park, bar none, were the three official scorers, Lyall Smith of Detroit and his two assistants ... They were terrified that a questionable decision would confront them and ruin Larsen's performance for posterity.\\" Larsen, too, acknowledged that he was not the only nervous person at Yankee Stadium as the game progressed, acknowledging the scrutiny that would be given to any close calls by Smith as he sat in the press box as the official scorer. In May 1965, Smith was chosen to serve a five-year term on the board of directors of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Detroit Lions In September 1965, Smith left the Free Press to accept a position as the public relations director for the Detroit Lions. In January 1967, Smith took on the additional title and responsibility as the Lions' business manager. Over the next 15 years, Smith was employed by the Lions as their public relations director, business manager, and director of marketing. When the Lions moved to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1975, Smith was responsible for coordinating the move and organized an exhibition day game in August 1975 for fans to orient themselves and tour the new facility. He remained with the Lions throughout the 1970s. Death Smith died of heart failure in 1991 at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.

He was elder than Ramakrishna, and took monastic vows at an advanced age. He played a crucial role during the early years of Ramakrishna Mission. Biography =Pre monastic days= Gopal Chandra Ghosh was born on 28 August 1828 in Rajpur (Jagaddal) village in 24 paraganas, a few miles from Calcutta, to Govardhan Sur (Ghosh). He lived in Sinthi in Calcutta. Little is known about his early life and education. He was an employee in a shop in Chinabazar, which belonged to Beni Madhav Pal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, whose name appears in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Gopal was married and at the time of meeting Ramakrishna for the first time he was more than 50 years old. At the death of his wife he was taken by a friend to Ramakrishna to assuage his grief.The Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, 1943, pages 134-135 On his first visit Gopal was not very impressed with Ramakrishna, but after a few more visits he became devoted to him, and served him in various ways, by buying provisions and running errands. Gopal distributed the twelve ochre clothes in the presence of Ramakrishna to the first bunch of monks of Ramakrishna order, which included Vivekananda. After death of Ramakrishna, the \\"Baranagar Math\\" was started with Gopal as the first inmate. He was soon joined by Narendra Nath Dutta (later Vivekananda), Rakhal (later Brahmananda), Kali (later Abhedananda), Latu (later Adbhutananda) and other direct disciples of Ramakrishna. =Monastic life= In 1887 Gopal along with other disciples took up the monastic life and came to be known as Advaitananda (Advaita - Monism, ananda - bliss). After staying for a few years in Baranagar Math, Advaitananda travelled to Benaras where he stayed for around 5 years. Here he stayed in a small room, where he rose at 4 AM every day and bathed in the Ganga river, after which he did his spiritual practices for the day. He lived on madhukari i.e. begging small quantities of cooked food from various places, as per the injunctions of the scriptures. He spent time mostly in contemplation. When Vivekananda returned to India after his visit to the west, Advaitananda returned to Alambazar, where the Ramakrishna Math had moved to. Afterwards, when the new monastery in Belur Math was established, he used to stay mostly there and looked after gardening and other managerial affairs. Even in his old age he was self-sufficient. After his return to the monastery, Advaitananda's special duty was to look to the levelling of the newly purchased land at Belur and the repair of the old structures there. The land had been in use for repair of steamers etc. and was hence full of pits and canals. All this meant strenuous work. When the monastery became fully established there, he took up the duty of looking after the comforts of the monks and producing food. He sometimes expressed disappointment that he fell so short of the ideal.Swami Advaitananda He was very old and did not take up any public activity; his monastic life was quite simple. However he lived austerely and practiced meditation till his last days. He travelled extensively and visited at one time or other sacred places including Kedarnath, Badrinarayan, and Hardwar in the north, Dwaraka in the west, and Rameswaram and other places in the south. He was in sound health throughout his life, even at an advanced age. He accompanied Sarada Devi in some of her travels. After suffering for some time from stomach trouble, he died on 28 December 1909, at the age of 81.

It was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site and also added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1986. History Almont was first settled in 1834, when Daniel Black built a log tavern in this area. By 1838, the settlement had a school, store, blacksmith shop, shoe shop, and grist mill. In 1843, the local logging industry was picking up, and the firm of Beach, Imlay and Morse built a sawmill in Imlay City and a connecting plank road to Mt. Clemens running through Almont. The access to reliable transportation was a boon to the local economy, and a pearlash factory, fulling mill, and foundry opened in the next few years, with a sawmill, fanning mill, and another foundry following close behind. With the boom in industry, the town prospered, with new commercial buildings being constructed. At the same time, new Greek Revival and Italianate houses were being built for the town'e newly prosperous and prominent citizens; many of those were in the district along West Saint Clair Street. By 1865, Almont had over 800 citizens, and in 1866 a local bank was formed, and a number of factories using the still-abundant local lumber were established in the area. By 1882, the lumber industry was slowing, but the Port Huron and Northwestern Railway built a line through the village, which gave the area easy access to cheap transportation for agricultural goods. Later introduction of the automobile in the twentieth century shifted the output of local factories to make automotive parts. Description Located just west of Almont's central business district along M-53, the district consists of 15 residential houses and one library located along a single stretch of West Saint Clair Street that intersects with Church, Cherry, and Day Street‚Äîalthough the district contains no properties along these side streets. The district contains a variety of architectural styles, including Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, Italianate, Late Victorian, and Queen Anne. The district also contain the Henry Stephens Memorial Library, which is a contributing property that was listed in its own right as a Michigan State Historic Site on May 16, 1991. Located at 213 West Saint Clair Street, the Colonial Revival structure was funded and built in 1918 by Albert Stephens, who was the son of one of Lapeer County's earliest settlers and lumber pioneers, Henry Stephens.

She began her activism in 1985 by providing food and meals to home-bound AIDS patients in San Francisco who were too ill cook or shop. Brinker was born Ruth Marie Appel on May 1, 1922, in Hartford, South Dakota. She moved to San Francisco, California, during the mid-1950s, where she married her husband, Jack Brinker, in 1957. They had two daughters, Lisa and Sara, but later divorced in 1965. By the mid-1980s, the AIDS epidemic was sweeping through San Francisco. One of Brinker's friends, who had AIDS and corresponding malnutrition, became too weak to cook or leave his home to go grocery shopping. Brinker, who was a grandmother at the time, and a group of her friends collaborated to provide the man with meals by dividing up the month to delivering them to his home. Unfortunately, some of the volunteers went on vacation and the man died by the time they returned to San Francisco. Ruth Brinker vowed not to allow the same fate happen to others in San Francisco. She had previously worked in the food service industry and as a volunteer for Meals on Wheels, a similar predecessor which provides meals to people who cannot purchase or prepare meals. She began organizing volunteers on a larger basis to deliver hot meals to AIDS patients in the city. This led to the establishment of her nonprofit, Project Open Hand, which was founded in summer of 1985 by Brinker and seven of her friends. The organization began with a small grant of $2,000 dollars from a Zen study group and donated cookware. Project Open Hand has since expanded to provide meals and other services to the elderly and people with other chronic illnesses. In 1987 and 1988, Project Open Hand served 300 AIDS patients using an annual budget of $500,000. As of 2011, Project Open Hand provides 2,600 meals a day using $5.6 million in public and private donations. Brinker's nonprofit has been copied by \\"dozens\\" of organizations throughout the United States, according to the New York Times. Ruth Brinker died from complications of vascular dementia at her home in San Francisco on August 8, 2011, at the age of 89.

Lee Heath served as Chief of Police of the Los Angeles Police Department from August 1, 1924 to March 31, 1926. Heath had joined the L.A.P.D. in 1904 and was reputed to be the most adroit politician in the department, eventually rising to the level of top cop. He was a police captain when he was appointed chief, replacing Chief August Vollmer, the former Police Chief of Berkeley, California who had served as interim chief for exactly one year. Five new police stations were constructed while Heath was chief. To battle bootleggers and rum-runners during Prohibition, Heath had the L.A.P.D. purchase ten 30.06 Browning Automatic Rifles to enable his police force to counter the gangsters firepower. He declined to purchase .30-caliber Browning machine guns. Innovations During his tenure as chief, the Chemical Lab and Photo Lab were created. Both served as forerunners to the L.A.P.D.'s Scientific Investigation Division. A separate division overseeing police training was first implemented in 1925. Before he was appointed chief, Heath became intrigued by the possibilities of radio in law enforcement when he attended the Amateur Radio Show in Los Angeles in May 1924. The show featured hand-made radio receivers that could be mounted in an automobile and put to use for police work. At the 1925 National Radio Exposition, Heath demonstrated that an airplane equipped with a radio could follow an automobile and broadcast the vehicle's movements via radio station KRCA.

Like in all subsequent editions, only countries of Continental Europe ever took place. A \\"challenge\\" format was chosen: France, winner of the last tournament in 1938, advanced directly to the final, where it met the winner of the preliminary tournament, which was played by four teams: Belgium, West Germany, Italy and Romania.Volpe-Pacitti p.291  Results  { width=100% align=left width=60% style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" Point system: try 3 pt, conversion: 2 pt., penalty kick 3 pt. drop 3 pt, goal from mark 3 pt.

(1675?‚Äì1740) was an English Presbyterian minister. Life William Harris was born in about 1675, probably in Southwark, where his mother was living as a widow in 1692. Walter Wilson, following Josiah Thompson, thinks he was educated at Timothy Jollie's Attercliffe Academy, near Sheffield (opened in 1689). Records of the presbyterian board show that in 1692‚Äì6 he studied successively in the academies of John Southwell at Newbury, Berkshire, and James Waters at Uxbridge, Middlesex. He began early to preach, and was some time assistant (unordained) to Henry Read at Gravel Lane, Southwark. On Read's death (1698) Harris was called to succeed Timothy Cruso at Crutched Friars, in spite of some opposition, and received presbyterian ordination. He became a hoarse-voiced leader of liberal dissent. For over thirty years (from 1708) he acted as one of the Friday evening lecturers at the Weighhouse, Eastcheap. He was one of the original trustees (1716) of Daniel Williams's foundations. At the Salters' Hall debates in 1719, he sided with the non-subscribers. In 1723 he was one of the original distributors of the English regium donum. On 12 April 1727 he succeeded William Tong in the merchants' lecture at Salters' Hall. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh on 8 November 1728; and a similar honour from the University of Aberdeen. Nathaniel Lardner was his colleague in his pastoral charge from 1729; an earlier colleague was John Billingsley the younger (1657‚Äì1722). Harris died, following a short illness, on 25 May 1740, and was buried (in 30 May) in Dr. Daniel Williams's vault at Bunhill Fields burial ground. Funeral sermons were preached by his friend Benjamin Grosvenor and by Lardner. He left nearly 2,000 volumes to Dr Williams's Library. His portrait was also presented to the library by Lardner's executor in 1768: an engraving based on it is published in Wilson's Dissenting Churches. Works Harris published much, and, according to Walter Wilson, ranked as \\"the greatest master of the English tongue among the dissenters\\". Among his works are: * Exposition of the Epistles to Philippians and Colossians, in the continuation of Matthew Henry's \\"Exposition\\", 1710 * Practical Discourses on ‚Ä¶ Representations of the Messiah, throughout the Old Testament, 1724; intended as a reply to Anthony Collins * Memoirs of ‚Ä¶ Thomas Manton, D.D., 1725 * Funeral Discourses, 1736 * Four Discourses upon ‚Ä¶ the Lord's Supper, 1737 Besides other writings, Wilson gives a list of 38 individual sermons, the earliest in 1702, including 11 funeral and three ordination sermons.

His wife Frederica, Lady Rose (1910‚Äì2002) became a well known travel writer, notably on Corsica, under the name of Dorothy Carrington. Rose was born at Moor Park, Hertfordshire, England. He took up residence as an expatriate in Paris between 1929 and 1936, where he trained under Francis Picabia and Jos√© Maria Sert. Francis Rose got his beginning as a set painter for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. He occasionally collaborated in his work with another English painter, and his sometime lover, Christopher Wood. In the 1930s he travelled with his future wife, Dorothy Carrington, in France, Italy, and North Africa. In France, Rose became an intimate acquaintance of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, the former helping to launch his painting career by commissioning several of his works (most notably a portrait of herself) for her own notable art collection. Her memorable utterance, \\"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose\\" dates from 1913; however, long before her acquaintance with the artist, who would go on to have exhibits in Paris, London, and New York. He also worked as an illustrator for a cookbook by Toklas, The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook. Rose married the writer Dorothy Carrington in 1942. Toklas was greatly enthusiastic about Rose's marriage to \\"Frederica\\" (Carrington), noting that the marriage had done Rose \\"a world of good.\\"Justin Spring. 2010.

Note Elements of the PTCS are external surface materials, insulation such as Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI), or Heat Pipes. The EATCS provides heat rejection capabilities for all the U.S. pressurized modules, the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), the Columbus Orbital Facility (COF), and the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 Trusses. The EATCS consists of two independent Loops (Loop A & Loop B), which both use mechanically pumped fluid state ammonia in closed-loop circuits. The EATCS is capable of rejecting up to 70 kW, and provides a substantial upgrade in heat rejection capacity from the 14 kW capability of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss. There are two independent Loops (Loop A & Loop B) that combined make up the EATCS. The EATCS Loops perform three primary functions: * Heat Collection - Each Loop draws heat from five Heat Exchangers (HXs) mounted on the Destiny Laboratory, Node-2 & Node-3 as well as cold plates under three DC- to-DC Conversion Units (DDCUs) (one DDCU each on each Loop on the P1/S1 Trusses and two DDCUs each on each Loop on the S0 Truss) and two Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs) on each Loop on the S0 Truss (see schematic below and Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) for design of these units); * Heat Transportation - The Pump Module (PM) provides flow and accumulator functions and maintains proper temperature control at the pump outlet for each Loop. The PM consists of a single pump, a fixed charge accumulator, a Pump & Control Valve Package (PCVP) containing a firmware controller, startup heaters, isolation valves, and various sensors for monitoring performance. The Nitrogen Tank Assembly (NTA) controls the flow of ammonia out of the Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA). The ATA contains two flexible, chambers incorporated into its ammonia tanks that expand as pressurized nitrogen from the NTA expels liquid ammonia out of the ATA. The major components in the ATA include two ammonia storage tanks, isolation valves, heaters, and various temperature, pressure, and quantity sensors; * Heat Rejection - Ammonia passes from the ATA through a two way path of the Flex Hose Rotary Coupler (FHRC) where heat captured while passing through the Heat Exchangers is directed to be expelled through the Heat Rejection System Radiators (HRSRs). The radiators are rotated by the Thermal Rotary Radiator Joint (TRRJ) which continually rotates the radiator wing for optimum cooling.

This order of battle includes all combat units, including engineer and artillery units, but not medical, supply, signal, border guard and garrison units. Background During First Balkan War Bulgaria mobilized 599,878 men out of a total male population of 1,914,160.Hall (2000),p. 22 Final victory over the Ottoman Empire however came at the cost of some 33,000 killed and 50,000 wounded soldiers while many others were affected by the spread of cholera and dysentery.Hall (2000),p. 135 With the end of the war the relations between the members of the Balkan League deteriorated rapidly due to the unresolved problem of the division of the conquered lands which forced Bulgaria to transfer its armies from Thrace to Macedonia. On the eve of the outbreak of the Second Balkan War the field forces of the Bulgarian Army were deployed in five armies along a 500 kilometer front from the Danube to the Aegean Sea. Despite all the measures taken by the military authorities, including the drafting of young Bulgarian men aged 20‚Äì26 years living in the newly occupied territories in Thrace and Macedonia, the number of mobilized personnel reached a total of 500,491 men.–ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ (1941), page 161 Thus for the war against its former allies Bulgaria could rely on manpower that was about 83% of the one available during the First Balkan War. The Bulgarian command deployed five field armies against Serbia and Greece while it kept minimal forces near the Ottoman border and no forces at all on the Romanian border. Besides the 11 infantry division, 1 cavalry division and the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps the high command also raised two additional infantry divisions(12th and 13th) and one independent infantry brigade. Many of the old divisions however had at least one of their infantry brigades taken away and attached to the field armies as independent units which created logistical difficulties. Thus it seemed the Bulgarian GHQ was attempting to provide greater numbers of available units while disregarding the quality of some of those units.–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ (1924),p. 30 As a result, the total strength of the field forces was increased to around 297 infantry battalions, 47 cavalry squadrons and 186 artillery batteries.–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ (1924),p. 43 The material situation of the armed forces was improved compared to the first war. The number of available horses was increased by 12,594 to 97,456 while the number of rifles increased by 44,561 to 378,996 and artillery guns by 112 to 1228. Still according to the mobilization plans of the General Staff the army was supposed to have 483,674 rifles and 117,733 which showed that, like the manpower deficit, the material shortages had not been dealt with by the time the war began. GHQ The nominal commander in chief of the Bulgarian Army was Tsar Ferdinand I but de facto its control and leadership were initially in the hands of his deputy Lieutenant-General Mihail Savov. The Chief of the General Staff Major-General Ivan Fichev opposed the war and was officially in resignation, though de facto he was never dismissed, while his functions were carried out by the Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Stefan Nerezov . Other notable changes in the command structure took place almost immediately after the outbreak of the war when General Savov was fired as deputy of the commander-in-chief, although he latter returned to take command of the combined 5th, 4th and 2nd armies.Hall (2000),p. 110 Ferdinand chose the Russophile General Dimitriev as his deputy while General Racho Petrov assumed command of the 3rd Army.

1987 Australian TV mini-series, directed by Chris Noonan and John Duigan. It stars Barry Otto, Nicole Kidman and Nicholas Eadie. The series won the Logie Award for Most Popular Single Telemovie or Miniseries. Plot Set in the 1960s through to the early 1970s, Vietnam is a mini-series about Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. The Goddard family live in Canberra - Public servant Douglas, Evelyn (Veronica Lang) and their son Phil and daughter Megan. Aged 15, Megan is now a rebellious teenager, infuriating her conservative parents whilst her older sibling Phil is a budding photographer. Australia joins the war in Vietnam and the strains and stresses it places on the Goddard family mirror the political and social upheavals the country experiences in the 1960s. Phil is called up in the national draft and he reluctantly goes to do his duty with Australian army forces in Vietnam. He encounters the harsh realities of the war when the platoon walks into a minefield in a rice paddy, losing several men including Phil's friend Ritchie. Phil is horrified as his unit is ordered to assist South Vietnamese forces to forcibly evacuate and destroy a peasant village. Phil and his best mate Laurie become romantically involved with Vietnamese sisters Lien and Le. Back home, Douglas' workaholic lifestyle is straining his marriage and both parents are growing distant from their increasingly headstrong daughter Megan. The latter begins a relationship with an older boy Serge and she has to, at first, pretend to be a fellow university student to become involved with him. Serge goes away to University in Sydney and Megan later runs away from home to join him. Phil comes home on leave but the traumatic experiences of the war weigh heavily on him and he can no-longer adjust to normal life. Phil and Laurie return to the war which is growing ever more bloodier and cruel. Le is gang- raped by a squad of US soldiers who have been brutalised by their experiences of combat. The youngest American soldier is left behind to execute her but he cannot bring himself to do it, instead he cuts off one of her ears and fires a shot into the dirt, in order to convince his comrades that he had killed the woman and taken a 'souvenir'. Outraged by the sufferings of her people, Lien joins the Viet Minh. During the Tet Offensive, her group ambushes an Australian truck, wiping out the occupants including Laurie who is left permanently disabled by his injuries. Phil, increasingly disillusioned with the conduct of the war, enlists in a renegade special forces unit. After taking part in an ambush of a group of guerrillas Phil is horrified to discover that one of the dead is Lien. Unbalanced by his discovery he later endangers his fellow soldiers with a grenade during target practice and is thrown out of the unit as a result. Back in Australia, the Goddard family begins to be torn apart. Douglas has become a key figure in the political decisions behind Australia's involvement in the war and he serves under all four prime-ministers who hold office during the Vietnam era, the demands of his job absorbing all of his time and energy. Fed up with the lack of attention from her husband and the unfulfilling existence as a housewife, Evelyn throws Douglas out. Megan goes to live with Serge and both become heavily involved with the anti-war movement. Evelyn later joins the movement, feeling happier in her newfound independence and she and Megan become close again. Serge is called up by the draft but he conscientiously objects, going to prison for his stance. Phil returns to Australia for good, as does Laurie who is joined by Le who emigrates to become the latter's wife, doing her best to care for her disabled and traumatized husband. Phil grows more isolated, not even seeing his family and he becomes self-centred and bitter. He cannot understand nor accept the anti-war movement and free-wheeling youth culture he sees around him. Megan has become a leading figure in the anti-war protests and whilst answering questions on a talk-back radio show, her confidence and self-righteous composure is shattered by a surprise call from Phil whose voice she recognises. Phil's resentment and bitterness makes Megan regret her movement's lack of support for returning soldiers. Le tells Phil about her rape and torture and why her sister joined the Viet Minh and he finally breaks down in tears, Le's story putting his own sufferings into perspective, jolting him out of his isolation. Douglas, Evelyn and Megan have a reunion dinner and afterwards as they are saying goodbye to each other outside, Megan notices some-one watching them from a nearby parked Holden Pick-up. It is Phil. He says 'It's me.....sort of' The series concludes with Megan greeting Serge as he is released from prison and the two walk away arm-in-arm to face their future and adulthood together.

Kidman was just 19 years old at the time, and Kennedy-Miller, the producers of the series, would later cast her in Dead Calm. Vietnam features a host of high calibre Australian television actors. Veronica Lang, Barry Otto and Nicholas Eadie (aged 27 at the time) made up the Goddard family, playing Megan's mother Evelyn, father Douglas and older brother Phil, respectively. Barry Otto is a 5-times nominated Australian Film Institute actor, who built up a solid body of work since his debut in the mid 1970s. He was recently seen in Australia in the small role of Administrator Allsop. Playing Evelyn is Veronica Lang, an English actress who was a familiar face on TV screens in England and Australia from 1965. She starred in Winners alongside Kidman in 1985, playing Alison Trig. Both Barry Otto and Veronica Lang also starred in Aussie soap A Country Practice, in which Kidman also appeared. Playing the pivotal role of Phil, Megan's older brother who gets drafted into the army, is Nicholas Eadie. Reception The first episode of Vietnam was broadcast in Australia on 23 February 1987, and received some positive reviews from the Australian press. Reviews praised the show's accuracy in portraying society's changing attitudes towards the war, as well as the family dynamic and character development. \\"There is much to admire and little to criticize in Vietnam. Personal relationships inside and outside the family and the shift in society's attitudes have been penetratingly and evocatively observed. All the characters, including the South Vietnamese for once, have been given an empathetic point of view,\\" wrote The Age on the day of the show's premiere.

His feud with the artist Banksy was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary called Graffiti Wars, first shown in August 2011. Early works Robbo painted his first train in 1985 and the ‚ÄòMerry Christmas‚Äô train of 1988, a joint piece created with \\"Drax WD\\", receiving national coverage on ITV News and in The Independent newspaper. Feud with Banksy Graffiti in Camden after modification by Banksy and Robbo In 1985 15 year old King Robbo painted a graffiti work under the British Transport Police Headquarters on a wall beside Regent's CanalEvans, Daniel Banksy calls for graffiti show inquiry Western Daily Press 7 September 2011 in Camden, London which was only accessible by water. A large full colour graffiti piece, called \\"Robbo Incorporated\\", it had over the years become the oldest piece of graffiti in London. Over time, virtually all of his works had been gradually removed from London's trains and walls by authorities, except for this piece. In 2009 however, the English stencil artist Banksy destroyed most of it with a stencil of a workman pasting wallpaper. King Robbo has stated that Banksy was introduced to him for the first time in the 1990s, commenting: \\"I was at a place called the Dragon Bar on Old Street. I was introduced to a couple of guys who were like 'whoa it's nice to meet you!'. When I was introduced to Banksy, I went 'Oh yeah I've heard of you mate, how you doing?' and he went 'well I've never heard of you'...he dismissed me as a nobody, as nothing. So with that I slapped him and went 'oh what you ain't heard of me? you won't forget me now will you?' and with that he picked up his glasses and ran off.\\"Marcus Williamson, \\"Life in Brief: King Robbo Graffiti Artist\\". i, 21 Aug, 2014. 12. On Christmas Day 2009 Robbo reclaimed his piece from Banksy's defacing by covering the work so the workman appeared to be painting \\"KING ROBBO\\" in silver letters. Three days later the letters \\"FUC\\" appeared before the word \\"KING\\". Tit-for-tat overpainting continued at the site with artwork and insults including a picture of Top Cat leaning on a gravestone with the words \\"R.I.P. Banksy's career\\". This incident led to online arguments and a graffiti war with many of Banksy's other works being altered by \\"Team Robbo\\" - notable ones including the piece Hitchhiker to Anywhere where the \\"anywhere\\" was changed to \\"going nowhere\\". In 2014 LDNGraffiti published an illustrated timeline of the feud. In 2015 Banksy included a piece dedicated to Robbo in the Dismaland exhibition. Injury and coma On 2 April 2011 King Robbo sustained a life-threatening head injury 5 days prior to his exhibition at the Signal Gallery, Shoreditch: 'Team Robbo - The Sell Out Tour'. It is believed the injury happened as a result of an accidental fall. Robbo was found in a pool of blood at the bottom of 10 stairs outside his flat in King's Cross. In November 2011, three months after the airing of the Channel 4 documentary Graffiti Wars, the Camden Robbo mural was painted over with a black and white depiction of the original with the additions of a crown and a can of spray paint with a hazard symbol of a flame above it. It was done by Banksy as \\"a tribute to him and as an effort to end the feud in a sense of lighting a candle for Robbo who was still in comatose condition\\". The mural was restored to its original form with slight changes by the other members of \\"Team Robbo\\" on 24 December 2011, Christmas Eve. The restoration has since peeled away to leave the black and white tribute to Robbo, as of September 2012. Death Robbo never emerged from the coma, and died on 31 July 2014, aged 44. He left a son and two daughters.

Although he could neither sing nor dance,\\"The Comedy Old Man and His Troubles\\". The New York Times, 3 February 1907 he became a leading comedian in musical comedies, adapting the French and Viennese op√©ra- bouffe style of light comic relief into a broader comedy popular with English audiences of the period. His comic portrayals did much to ensure the West End success of V√©ronique (1904) The Little Michus (1905; for which he invented the Gazeka), and The Merry Widow (1907). In addition to musical comedy, operettas and revues, Graves specialised in pantomime and music hall. Later in his career, he was a frequent broadcaster and made several films, always in comic roles, but continued to perform on stage. His last stage success was in Me and My Girl (1937). Early life and career Graves was born in London and made his stage debut at the age of 19 in an Edwardian musical comedy in Portsmouth. In its obituary notice, The Times wrote, \\"from the line then chosen [he] deviated during the next 40 years only into pantomime and music hall sketches.\\"\\"Obituary, Mr. George Graves\\", The Times, 5 April 1949, p. 6 Although he could neither sing nor dance, he made his career in comic parts in musical pieces.

This species has both insect (Culicoides species) and vertebrate (birds) hosts. Description =History= This species was originally described by Mathis and Leger in 1909. The species was also described by Akiba in Japan in 1958. A second species - Leucocytozoon schufneri - was described by Prowazek in 1912 also in the chicken. This is now considered to be a synonym. This species has been classified into the subgenus Akiba because of its vector: other species in the genus are transmitted by species of the genus Simulium. =Life cycle= The parasite is transmitted by the bite of its vector. On infection of a vertebrate host, the parasites enter the blood stream and spread through the body. They invade the endothelial cells in a number of organs. These grow into multinucleated masses - megaloschizonts. This first round of schizonts give rise to the first generation of merozoites. This first generation of merozoites invade new endothelial cells and give rise to a second generation of schizonts. After a number of cell divisions these in turn give rise to the second generation of merozoites which in their turn infect erythrocytes and leukocytes. Within the erythrocytes or leukocytes, the merozoites develop into gametocytes. Once ingested by a vector male and female gametocytes fuse and give rise to a zygote. The zygote invades the body of the vector, undergoes a series of cell divisions resulting in motile sporozoites that invade the salivary glands of the vector. Early schizonts are spherical or ovoid and 30-35 micrometers (¬µm) in diameter.Isobe T, Akiba K (1900) Early schizonts of Leucocytozoon caulleryi. J Parasitol 76(4):587-589 Gametocytes are round and measure 15.0 to 15.5 ¬µm in diameter. Geographic distribution This species is found in Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Clinical features and host pathology This species infects chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), guinea fowl and pheasants. After infection schizongony occurs in the adrenals, brain, intestine, kidneys, liver, muscles, ovaries, pancreas, spleen, thymus and trachea. Typical pathology includes the presence of the schizonts and the surrounding granulomata, haemorrhages, oedema and pressure atrophy in the oviducts. Infected chickens are anaemic, have pale combs and diarrhoea. Egg production may be reduced and the egg shells may be softer than normal. Chickens who survive the infection appear to be resistant to re infection. A vaccine based on a recombinant protein is available.Ito A, Gotanda T (2004) Field efficacy of recombinant R7 vaccine against chicken leucocytozoonosis. J Vet Med Sci 66(5):483-487 This disease is also known as Bangkok haemorrhagic disease. Vectors Known vectors of this parasite include Culicoides arakawae Arakawa 1910. Diagnosis Blood smears can be performed to identify the parasite in the red blood cells. ELISA testing can be used for antigen or antibody testing.Leucocytozoon caulleryi reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 12 October 2011. Treatment and prevention Treatment is usually ineffective. In-feed pyrimethamine and sulfadimethoxine can help prevent the disease. Prevention is by control of the infecting vectors but is often difficult to implement.

This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction: : hydrogen sulfide + 2 ferricytochrome c rightleftharpoons sulfur + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H+ These enzymes are heterodimers of a flavoprotein (fccB ) and a dihaem cytochrome (fccA; ) that carry out hydrogen sulfide-dependent cytochrome C reduction. The dihaem cytochrome folds into two domains, each of which resembles mitochondrial cytochrome c, with the two haem groups bound to the interior of the subunit. The flavoprotein subunit has a glutathione reductase-like fold consisting of a beta(3,4)-alpha(3) core, and an alpha+beta sandwich. The active site of the flavoprotein subunit contains a catalytically important disulfide bridge located above the pyrimidine portion of the flavin ring. The flavoprotein contains a C-terminal domain required for binding to flavin, and subsequent electron transfer. Electrons are transferred from the flavin to one of the haem groups in the cytochrome.

He decided not to go into the family business and worked as a telegram boy and at a floor manager at Crystal Palace skating rink. At age fifteen he went into vaudeville as a tambourine player and vocalist at Canterbury Music Hall in George Street, Sydney. In 1889 he joined the touring theatrical company of Edmund Duggan, playing a wide variety of roles throughout Australia. In 1900 he and Duggan joined the company of noted theatre producer William Anderson, who was Duggan's brother-in-law. Playwriting career In 1907 Bailey and Duggan wrote a play together under the joint pseudonym of \\"Albert Edmunds\\", The Squatter's Daughter (1907). This was produced by Anderson to great success and was adapted into a film in 1910, which Bailey directed as well as appeared in. He and Duggan collaborated on a number of follow up plays (with both men also acting in the productions), including The Man from Outback (1909), On Our Selection (1912), an adaptation of the stories of Steele Rudd and The Native Born (1913). Of these the most popular was On Our Selection which became an Australian theatrical phenomenon, with over hundreds of productions through to the present day. Bailey would perform the role of Dad Rudd on and off for the rest of his career.

He and Grant did suffer some commercial failures, such as a season of plays by William Shakespeare and a 1920 production of On Our Selection in London. After touring in the Barry Conners play The Patsy for 23 weeks in 1929, Bailey retired from performing, believing that talking films were making theatre unprofitable. Film career Bailey was brought out of retirement in 1932 by Stuart F. Doyle to play Dad Rudd in a film version of On Our Selection, which he also co-wrote. He received ¬£400 plus 60% of the profits which, for that movie, came to an estimated ¬£14,000 by the end of 1934.\\"Counting the Cash in Australian Films\\"', Everyones 12 December 1934 p 19-21 Bailey played Dad Rudd in three more films, contributing to the script as well for each film.

(1679‚Äì1740) was an English clergyman and academic. Life Felton was born in the London parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 3 February 1679. His earliest education was at Cheney's School in Buckinghamshire; he moved to Westminster School under Richard Busby, and then to Charterhouse School, where he became a private pupil of Dr. Thomas Walker, the head-master. He entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where John Mill was then principal, and where he had for his tutor Thomas Mills, later bishop of Waterford. He proceeded to his degree, taking his M.A. in June 1702; and in December of the same year was ordained deacon in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, by William Lloyd, bishop of Worcester. In June 1704 he was admitted to priest's orders by Henry Compton, bishop of London. According to Thomas Hearne he then left the university and became a preacher in and about London. In 1708 Felton undertook the care of the English church at Amsterdam, but returned to England in the following year, and became domestic chaplain to John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland, an office which he retained under three successive dukes. On 11 July 1709 he took the degree of B.D. In 1711 he was presented to the rectory of Whitwell in Derbyshire by John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland. On 5 July 1712 he proceeded to the degree of D.D. On 20 April 1722 he was elected principal of St Edmund Hall. In 1736 Felton's patron and former pupil John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland, then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, presented him to the rectory of Barwick-in-Elmet, Yorkshire. He died on 1 March 1740, and was buried in the chancel of the church of Barwick. Works On 7 July 1706 Hearne heard a sermon delivered by Felton at St Mary's on an Act-Sunday; and added that \\"Mr. Felton lately put out a sixpenny pamphlet against the presbyterians of Colebrooke.\\" This pamphlet, Felton's first publication, may have appeared in the early part of 1706. In 1711 he published his Dissertation on Reading the Classics, and forming a just Style, a work that he had written for his pupil, John, Lord Roos, later the 3rd Duke of Rutland. It was popular in its day, and passed through several editions. In 1725 Felton preached before the university on Easter day a sermon on The Resurrection of the same numerical body, and its reunion to the same soul, against Mr. Locke's notion of personality and identity. This sermon went through three editions, the last of which was in 1733, in which year he preached a second on the‚ÄòUniversality and Order of the Resurrection, being a Sequel to that wherein the Personal Identity is asserted; it was dedicated to Richard Smalbroke. In 1727 he issued a tract entitled The Common People taught to defend their Communion with the Church of England against the attempts and insinuations of Popish emissaries. In a Dialogue between a Popish Priest and a Plain Countryman. In 1730 appeared the Character of a Good Prince. A Sermon before the University of Oxford, 11 June 1730, being the day of His Majesty's Inauguration. In 1728‚Äì9 he preached the Lady Moyer lectures at St Paul's, which he published at Oxford in 1732, under the title of The Christian Faith asserted against Deists, Arians, and Socinians, &c.; To which is prefixed a very large Preface concerning the Light and Law of Nature, and the Expediency and Necessity of Revelation. This, his major work, was dedicated to Edmund Gibson, bishop of London. In 1735 he published at Oxford The Scripture Doctrine of the Resurrection as it stood before the Law, and in 1736 The Scripture Doctrine in the Books of Moses and Job. His son, the Rev. William Felton, in 1748 published a set of his sermons, on the creation, fall, redemption, and other topics. They had been preached in Whitwell and Barwick churches. William Felton prefixed a sketch of his father's life and character.

He also encouraged Eucharistic Congresses, established the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, and presided over several developments of St. Dunstan's University. He was appointed Archbishop of Kingston in Ontario on February 26, 1944. He attended all four sessions of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council. He both retired as archbishop of Kingston and was named Titular Archbishop of Maraguia by Pope Paul VI on December 14, 1966; he resigned this title on November 23, 1970. O'Sullivan died at age 85, and is buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Hamilton.

Whilst there are a number of areas of research that can come under this broad description (Marks, 2004) some specific research projects have been closely associated with the label. A prominent example is the project that developed in the mid 1970s with the goal of applying sociobiological perspectives to explain patterns of human social relationships, particularly kinship patterns across human cultures. This kinship-focused Darwinian anthropology was a significant intellectual forebear of evolutionary psychology, and both draw on biological theories of the evolution of social behavior (in particular inclusive fitness theory) upon which the field of sociobiology was founded. Overview In 1974 the biologist Richard D. Alexander published an article The Evolution of Social Behavior which drew upon W.D.Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness and kin selection and noted that: Amongst other suggestions, Alexander suggested that certain patterns of social cooperation documented by ethnographers, in particular the avunculate ('mother's brother') relationship, could be explained in reference to individuals pursuing a strategy of individual inclusive fitness maximization under conditions of low certainty-of-paternity. This hypothesis was subsequently taken up and elaborated in a series of studies by other Darwinian anthropologists: Ultimately these analyses were considered unsuccessful, and were specifically criticized by other sociobiologists on a number of grounds. One problem was said to be that interpreting inclusive fitness theory to imply that individuals have evolved the characteristic of pursuing strategies to maximize their own 'inclusive fitness' is erroneous; the theory should instead be interpreted to describe selection pressures on genes: A related problem was that, in assuming that individuals simply operate as inclusive fitness maximizing agents, any investigation of the proximate psychological mechanisms that mediate social behaviors was ignored. Symons made this observation in his 1989 Critique of Darwinian Anthropology: Symons, along with Tooby and Cosmides, were amongst the founders of the emerging school of evolutionary psychology, whose aim has been to focus more on these hypothesized proximate psychological mechanisms. Theoretical background Darwinian anthropology was critiqued by Symonds for its agnosticism as to the psychological mechanisms governing how social behavior is actually expressed in the human species, and its reliance on interpreting inclusive fitness theory to simply imply that humans have evolved to be inclusive fitness maximizers. This section will review some of the relevant background discussion in inclusive fitness theory to clarify why this position was considered untenable. =Evolutionary versus proximate explanations= Inclusive Fitness theory has often been interpreted to mean that social behavior per se is a goal of evolution, and also that genes (or individual organisms) are selected to find ways of actively distinguishing the identity of close genetic relatives ‚Äòin order to‚Äô engage in social behaviors with them. The apparent rationale for this common mis-interpretation is that organisms would thereby benefit the ‚ÄúInclusive Fitness of the individuals (and genes) involved‚Äù. This approach overlooks the point that evolution is not a teleological process, but a passive, consequential and undirected biological process, where environmental variations and drift effects are present alongside random gene mutations and natural selection. Inclusive fitness theory takes the form of an ultimate explanation, specifically a criterion (br>c), for the evolution of social behaviors, not a proximate mechanism governing the expression of social behaviors. What forms of social behavior might meet this criterion are cannot be a priori specified by the theory, nor can it shed light on whether the life history of a species provides opportunities for social interactions to occur. Thus, strictly speaking, the interpretation that organisms ‚Äòhave evolved to‚Äô direct social behavior towards genetic relatives is not implied by the theory (see also inclusive fitness). Investigating how inclusive fitness theory might apply to the potential emergence of social traits in any given species must begin with an analysis of the evolutionarily typical ecological niche, demographics, and patterns of interaction of that species. Where significant interaction between individuals is not present in the life history of a species, the theory is necessarily null regarding social behaviors between individuals. As Silk (2001) put it; Consideration must thus be given to whether the ecological niche leads to the clustering of individuals in groups or whether individuals are typically solitary. Socioecology research, for example, suggests that fundamental influences on demographic patterns are the distribution/fecundity of primary food sources as well as patterns of predation. When considering social behavior traits of a given species, consideration of these influences is in a sense, logically prior to analyses of inclusive fitness pressures on the species. =Selection pressure on genes or strategy of individuals= Darwinian anthropology, following R. D. Alexander, used the notion of the inclusive fitness of individuals rather than the inclusive fitness of genes. Dawkins (above) pointed to this as an error. The source of the confusion can be traced to discussions in Hamilton's early papers on inclusive fitness. In his 1963 paper Hamilton refers, unambiguously, to selection pressures on genes; However, in his paper published in 1964, actually written before the 1963 paper (Hamilton 1996), Hamilton had included a subsidiary discussion on what the genetic theory might imply for how we look at the fitness of individuals: It is clear here that the formal treatment is of the selection pressures on types (genes or traits), whilst the notion of individual inclusive fitness may serve as a guide to the adaptiveness of the trait; just as consideration of effects of a trait on an individual's fitness can be instructive when considering classical selection on traits. At the same time, it is understandable that Alexander took the inclusive fitness of individuals as a heuristic device. =Context-based or discrimination-based expression mechanisms= In his 1964 paper, Hamilton 'hazards' ‚Äúthe following unrigorous statement of the main principle that has emerged from the model‚Äù; He uses the terms 'hazards', 'unrigorous', and 'will seem' deliberately, since his formal analysis makes clear that the model specifies the evolutionary selection pressure, rather than specifying what mechanisms govern the proximate expression of social behaviors. He also clearly points to social behaviors being evoked in distinct situations, and that individuals may encounter potential social recipients of different degree of relationship in different situations. If one ignores the cautious qualifying words however, the passage might readily be interpreted to imply that individuals are indeed expected to make an active assessment of the degree of relatedness of others they interact with in different situations. Later in the paper, Hamilton again discusses the issue of whether the performance (or expression) of social behaviors might be conditional on; (a) discriminating factors which correlate with close relationship with the recipient, or (b) actually discriminating which individuals 'really are' in close relationship with the recipient: For certain social behaviors, Hamilton suggests there may be selection pressure for more discerning discrimination of genetic relatedness, were the mutation to occur. But 'in fact' the same net result of accurately targeting social behaviors towards genetic relatives could be achieved via a simpler mechanism of being expressed in proximity to the actor's 'home'. Hamilton is thus agnostic as to whether evolved social behaviors might be expressed via straightforward proximate mechanisms such as location-based cues, or whether more specific discriminatory powers might govern their expression. He does suggest that the distinct social contexts within which various social behaviors are expressed are factors to consider. Other theorists have discussed these questions of whether proximity, context or more discriminatory expression may govern behaviors: Dawkins believes social behaviors will in practice be governed by context-based expression. Maynard Smith is, like Hamilton, agnostic, but reiterates the point that context-based cues might well govern their expression and that actively distinguishing relatives is not necessarily expected for the expression of those social traits whose evolution is governed by inclusive fitness criteria. In sum, inclusive fitness theory does imply that; the evolutionary emergence of social behavior can occur where there is statistical association of genes between social actors and recipients; but that the expression of such evolved social behaviors is not necessarily governed by actual genetic relatedness between participants. The evolutionary criterion and the proximate mechanism must thus not be confused: the first does require genetic association (of the form br>c), the second does not. Darwinian anthropology's central premise that human behavior has evolved to maximize the inclusive fitness of individuals is thus not a logical derivative of the theory. Also, the notion that humans will discriminate social behaviors towards genetic relatives is again not entailed by the theory. Reception by anthropologists Before the questions raised within anthropology about the study of ‚Äòkinship‚Äô by Schneider and others from the 1960s onwards, anthropology itself had paid very little attention to the notion that social bonds were anything other than connected to consanguinal (or genetic) relatedness (or its local cultural conceptions). The social bonding associated with provision of and sharing of food was one important exception, particularly in the work of Richards, but this was largely ignored by descriptions of ‚Äòkinship‚Äô till more recently. Although questioning the means by which ‚Äòkinship bonds‚Äô form, few of these early accounts questioned the fundamental role of ‚Äòprocreative ties‚Äô in social bonding (Schneider, 1984). From the 1950s onwards, reports on kinship patterns in the New Guinea Highlands added some momentum to what had until then been only occasional fleeting suggestions that living together (co-residence) might underlie social bonding, and eventually contributed to the general shift away from a genealogical approach. For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested: Similarly, Langness' ethnography of the Bena Bena also emphasized a break with the genealogical perspective: By 1972, Schneider had raised deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and 'kinship' was a natural category built upon genealogical ties (for more information, see kinship), and especially in the wake of his 1984 critique this has become broadly accepted by most, if not all, anthropologists. The darwinian anthropology (and other sociobiological) perspectives, arising in the early 1970s, had not unreasonably assumed that the genealogical conceptions of human kinship, in place since Morgan's early work in the 1870s, were still valid as a universal feature of humans. But they emerged at precisely the time that anthropology, being particularly sensitive about its own apparent 'ethnocentric' generalizations about kinship (from cultural particulars to human universals) was seeking to distance itself from these conceptions. The vehemence of Sahlins' rebuttal of sociobiology's genetic relatedness perspective in his 1976 The use and abuse of Biology, which underlined the non-genealogical nature of human kinship, can be understood as part of this 'distancing' trend. Alternative approaches The lack of success of darwinian anthropology created space for alternative approaches to analyzing human social behaviors from a biological perspective. Alexander's initial point (above) that the inclusive fitness framework had been scarcely applied to human kinship and social patterns has remained largely valid. But the move away from genealogical kinship in anthropology has continued to be a major barrier to any potential resolution. This section reviews a range of approaches to synthesizing ideas from evolutionary biology to observations and data about human social behaviour across contemporary human populations. Whilst some of these approaches include the inclusive fitness approach, others may seek to demonstrate fit to other theories from evolutionary biology, or to demonstrate that certain proximate mechanisms of social behaviour are both compatible with the inclusive fitness approach, and also with the broad variety of ethnographic data on human kinship patterns. =Evolutionary psychology= =Human behavioural ecology= =Nurture kinship= Criticism Theories in evolutionary biology relevant to understanding social behavior may not be limited to frameworks such as inclusive fitness theory. The theory of reciprocal altruism may have equal or greater explanatory power for some forms of human social behavior, and perhaps kinship patterns. Other approaches may maintain that human behavior is less amenable to biological analysis due to the prominent influence of social learning and cultural transmission in the human species, and instead advance ideas based on the role of e.g. culture, historical contingencies or economic/environmental conditions. All or any of these may or may not contribute valuable insights to our understanding of social behavior and social patterns in humans.

It features an early screen performance by Peter Finch. Plot In Europe, a peaceful Czech scientist, Professor Marnelle, has unintentionally developed a nerve gas while working on a new fuel. Marnelle doesn‚Äôt want to use his invention for evil but he's threatened by his Nazi masters, including Von Schweig with a concentration camp. Marnelle destroys his lab and manages to escape with his daughter Elsa ‚Äì but is then recaptured. We then meet two members of the British secret service who are in a caf√© ‚Äì when another man is arrested the two of them flee. They trick a passing German car into stopping and knock them out ‚Äì to discover Marnelle and his daughter are in the back seat, prisoners. They take the Germans uniforms, drive the prisoners to the airport and manage to escape in a plane. The Marnelles go to Australia but the Nazis find out about it and decide to track him there. Marnelle starts working for the Australian air force and meets pilot Frank Miller. Nazi officer Von Schweig arrives in Australia and meets up with local fifth columnists who are planning sabotage on Australian planes ‚Äì Miller's ends up crashing and he winds up in hospital. By this stage the war has started and there is a scene where Von Schweig and a fifth columnist, Dr Vass, look at some Australian soldiers marching past. Von Schweig says \\"we did not expect the enthusiasm of the dominions\\" for the war. Dr Vass says that he has been in Australia for a number of years and still does not understand them, adding that \\"you expect from their interest in sport that nothing else matters, but in war the greater the danger the harder they fought\\". Miller and his friend Ted Jackson visit the Marnelles in their rural hideaway, where they are looked after by a comic Chinaman; Ted has fallen for Elsa. The fifth columnists and Von Schweig meet up with a spy who is revealed to be Frank Miller. Miller tells them where to find the scientist; they capture and start torturing him to find the formula. The Germans are about to take the Marnelles back to Europe but Mack manages to sneak off and inform the authorities. Ted Jackson rescues Marnelle but Miller's treachery enables the Germans to take off with the formula. Jackson hops in a plane and flies after Miller and Von Schweig, shooting them down in a dog fight. A German U-boat is also destroyed.

Filming commenced in June 1940. Shooting took place at Fig Tree Studios in Hunters Hill, Sydney with additional scenes shot at Camden. Financing was made possible by an overdraft guaranteed by the New South Wales government. The female star, Katrin Roselle, was an Austrian migrant who married an Australian then moved to Hollywood after the film was made. Finch was injured during filming when wind filled an open parachute he was holding and pulled him off his feet at the RAAF base at Camden. The freighter Turkana which appears in the movie was sunk soon after filming by a German raider. Release Distribution was done through MGM, the first time that company had handled an Australian feature film. The Chief Films Censor, Cresswell O'Reilly, ruled that the film was not suitable for general exhibition (i.e. for adults and not children) but this was overturned on appeal. The movie received generally positive reviews. However Monkman directed no further feature films. The movie was re-released in 1952 as The Invaders.

They boast to three strangers, Long Bill (Chips Rafferty), Jim (John Fernside) and Blue (Stan Tolhurst), about the mare belonging to the father of one of them. The next day the mare has gone.

In August 1945 it was announced that Ralph Smart would write and direct Bush Christmas for exhibition in the cinema clubs. Smart was an Englishman who had worked in Australia during the war. He wanted to make a children's film but had been unable to find a suitable story so decided to write one himself. He wrote the script so it had maximum action and minimum dialogue. It was to be the first in a series of children's films set in the Empire. The film was financed by the Rank organisation, who had also financed The Overlanders (1946) in Australia. Smart had worked on that film, which made a star of Chips Rafferty who signed on to star in Bush Christmas. He also assisted in casting. Bush Christmas was originally planned as a serial, but it was then decided to turn it into a feature. Several cast members from The Overlanders appear, including Chips Rafferty, John Fernside and Helen Grieve. Grieve was the first choice for her role. Michael and Nick Yardley were brothers who had worked in radio. Neza Saunders came from a mission station near Rockhampton and was discovered by Chips Rafferty. Morris Unicomb was a veteran of stage and radio. Shooting The film was entirely shot on location in March 1946. Filming took place in the Capertee Valley and at Kanangra Tops and Burragarong Valley, in the Blue Mountains.Bush Christmas at Australian Screen Online They also did a week's work at Carr Park, Kogarah. Neza Saunders fell off a horse while filming but had recovered within two days. Post production was completed in Sydney by June 1946. Smart left Australia in October, promising to be back in a few months to make more movies; he took four scenarios with him. Release Reviews were positive. Rank were so happy with the movie that instead of just playing it in cinema clubs they released it as a support feature for Frieda. =Box office= The film was very popular in Britain and Australia and was seen in 41 countries. Variety said it did \\"solid biz\\" in Australia.https://archive.org/stream/variety168-1947‚Äì12#page/n260/mode/1up It was reportedly among the most popular films of the year in Britain in 1947, along with Courtneys of Curzon Street, Great Expectations, Duel in the Sun, Odd Man Out, Jassy, The Upturned Glass, Black Narcissus, Holiday Camp, They Made Me A Fugitive and The Jolson Story. By February 1948 the film had screened on American television. Spin Offs It was serialised in children's magazines and a novelisation of the script was published. The film was also adapted for radio with a young John Meillon. Follow Up When Smart returned to Australia in January 1947 he announced plans to ¬£150,000 worth of children's films in Australia, including a feature set on a Northern Territory outback station, a serial, and a series of documentary films. Yardley signed a contract to appeear in the territory film and also the serial, which was to be about buckjumping. These films did not come to fruition. Smart made Bitter Springs with Raffety (1950). Helen Grieve retired from acting to study science. Child actor Nick Yardley later had his face smashed by a boomerang.

It consisted of a Columbus module docked to a service module containing solar power collectors, communications and other services. The program ran from 1986 to 1991, was expected to cost $3.56 billion including launch and utilization, and was cancelled while still in the planning stage. Aspects of the program were later realised in the Columbus science laboratory attached to the International Space Station (ISS). History ESA's Board of Directors approved the Columbus program in 1985. Like the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLMs) and the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) resupply craft, Columbus traces its origins to Spacelab. The Columbus program was intended to supplement NASA's Space Station Freedom. Initially the Columbus program included three flight configurations: * A Man-tended Free-Flyer (MTFF), as a space station element * An Attached Pressurized Module (APM),as a manned space station component * An unmanned Polar Platform (PPF) for remote sensing and data return The entire Columbus package (MTFF, APM, PPF) was expected to cost $3.56 billion including launch and utilization. The estimated costs of the MTFF alone were $160‚Äì180 million in 1986. The MTFF element would be serviced by the Hermes mini-shuttle launched atop the Ariane 5, flying periodically to the station for maintenance and reconfiguration. NASA approved the MTFF although it would require additional communications, docking facilities, data processing and other Station resources. Hermes would dock with the man-tended free-flyer to retrieve microgravity experiments. Since the initial plans, numerous studies and proposals were made. For development cost saving and optimization of spares provisioning during the operational phase commonality was foreseen between the flight configurations and to the space station (e.g. same computers used for all three elements, video and comms units identical to station equipment). When the complete phase C/D proposal (fixed price) was delivered end 1989 by the prime contractor MBB-ERNO it turned out that the costs were much higher than expected by ESA. The Columbus budget was trimmed slightly by canceling the smaller $145-million Eureca B platform. Hermes and Columbus would receive final approval in 1991. By this time, the cost of German unification had forced Germany to demand a 15-20% reduction in ESA 1990-2000 spending and it was becoming increasingly clear either the German-led MTFF, Italian-led APM or French-led Hermes projects would have to be cancelled. After several budget cuts, the CNES-led Hermes program was cancelled and the polar platform was contracted separately with commonality to the French satellite Helios. All that remained in the Columbus program was the APM, which was first renamed to \\"Columbus Orbital Facility\\" and later to just \\"Columbus\\". It would later be redesigned to fit with the International Space Station (ISS). When only the APM was left in ESA's Columbus program, there were not enough tasks for the two main contributors Germany and Italy represented by MBB-ERNO and Alenia respectively. As compromise the Pre Integrated Columbus APM (PICA) - principle was invented meaning a split systems engineering responsibility where Alenia as a co-prime is responsible for the overall Columbus configuration, the mechanical and thermal/life support systems, HFE and harness design/manufacturing whereas EADS Astrium Space Transportation is responsible for the overall Columbus design and all Avionics systems including electrical harness design and software.MBB-ERNO was renamed Deutsche Aerospace, then Daimler-Benz Aerospace, then DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, then Astrium, then EADS SPACE Transportation and finally EADS Astrium Space Transportation. Splitting off systems engineering responsibility and harness design under separate fixed-price contracts was found not to be advantageous with respect to efficiency and fast decision making as financial reasonings were pre-dominant in the last phase of development and verification. Columbus module launches aboard the Space Shuttle in 2008 ESA's Columbus module for the International Space Station (ISS) was based on the APM. It was eventually launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on February 7, 2008 on flight STS-122.

Its common names include the otter shell and the common otter shell. It occurs in coastal regions of the north east Atlantic Ocean where it lives buried in the sand. Taxonomy Lutraria lutraria is the type species of the genus Lutraria, the name Mya lutraria being the basionym used by Carl Linnaeus when he described the species in 1758. It was later determined that there were sufficient differences between it and other Mya species for the otter shell to be placed in its own genus.AnimalBase The similarity between Mya and Lutraria is due to convergence due to exploitation of the same habitat rather than a close phylogenetic relationship.Cleansing mechanisms and the function of the fourth pallial aperture in Spirula subtruncata and Lutraria lutraria Description Interior and exterior of valve L. lutraria has a pair of large, elongated oval valves up to long. They are smooth, glossy and fairly thin. They are a creamy colour and the periostracum is olive brown. This layer gets worn away over time and is often completely missing in shells found on the beach. There are concentric sculptured lines showing periods of growth and a few faint radial lines near the hinge. The left valve has two cardinal teeth with a third small one behind. The right valve has two small cardinal teeth and a small lateral one. The flesh of the animal is white. The foot is thick and protrudes through the pedal gape at the posterior end. The mantle edges are fringed with white and are fused together. The massive siphons can be extended to two or three times the length of the shell and are joined together for their entire length. They are streaked with brown and purple and are housed in a transparent, gelatinous sheath composed of protein and chitin. The siphons are outgrowths of the mantle while the sheath is a continuation of the periostracum. There are two rings of tiny tentacles round the orifice of the inhalant siphon and a single ring and a membrane round the exhalant one.Barrett, J. H. and C. M. Yonge, 1958. Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore. P. 163. Collins, LondonThe British species of Lutraria (Lamellibranchia), with a description of L. angustior The mantle has a fourth pallial opening near the base of the siphon. Distribution L. lutraria is found off the coasts of north west Europe from Norway south to the Mediterranean Sea and also in West Africa. It is found in soft substrates from the low tide mark down to about one hundred metres. The largest individuals with the longest siphons bury themselves at the greatest depths.Marine Species Identification Portal Biology L. lutraria is a filter feeder. It draws in water through one siphon and expels it through the other. Respiration takes place as the water current passes over the gills. Waste is periodically expelled through the fourth pallial opening which can also be used for expulsion of water from the mantle cavity. Trawling may damage or remove the tips of the siphons and bottom feeding fish may nip them off but the animal can regenerate the inner layers over the course of a few days. Hydraulic blade dredge fishing takes place for razor clams, Ensis spp., in Scotland and the process was studied to examine its impact. Bottom trawling of the seabed is often preceded by a sand fluidation process designed to loosen the sediment. Dredging damages a considerable portion of the benthic megafauna including L. lutraria, however this species tends to live at greater depths than is reached by the process. Nevertheless, between 20% and 100% are damaged in a single dredge haul. Some individuals are undamaged but left lying on the surface and it has been found that their ability to rebury themselves is limited. Unlike razor clams, they normally spend their lives in one spot and the foot is relatively small and mainly used for anchorage rather than digging. Any animal unable to rebury itself rapidly is likely to fall prey to the scavengers that move in after a trawl has passed. Such studies are of importance in assessing the ecological consequence and sustainability of fisheries.

Linear optics includes most applications of lenses, mirrors, waveplates, diffraction gratings, and many other common optical components and systems. If an optical system is linear, it has the following properties (among others): * If monochromatic light enters an unchanging linear-optical system, the output will be at the same frequency. For example, if red light enters a lens, it will still be red when it exits the lens. * The superposition principle is valid for linear-optical systems. For example, if a mirror transforms light input A into output B, and input C into output D, then an input consisting of A and C simultaneously give an output of B and D simultaneously. * Relatedly, if the input light is made more intense, then the output light is made more intense but otherwise unchanged. These properties are violated in nonlinear optics, which frequently involves high-power pulsed lasers. Also, many material interactions including absorption and fluorescence are not part of linear optics. Linear versus non-linear transformations (examples) As an example, and using the Dirac bracket notations (see bra-ket notations), the transformation krangle rightarrow e^{iktheta}krangle is linear, while the transformation alpha_00rangle + alpha_11rangle + alpha_2 2rangle rightarrow alpha_00rangle + alpha_11rangle - alpha_2 2rangle is non-linear. In the above examples, k = 0, 1, ldots is an integer representing the number of photons. The transformation in the first example is linear in the number of photons, while in the second example it is not. This specific nonlinear transformation plays an important role in optical quantum computing. Linear versus nonlinear optical devices (examples) Phase shifters and beam splitters are examples of devices commonly used in linear optics. In contrast, frequency-mixing processes, the optical Kerr effect, cross-phase modulation, and Raman amplification, are a few examples of nonlinear effects in optics. Connections to quantum computing One currently active field of research is the use of linear optics versus the use of nonlinear optics in quantum computing. For example, one model of linear optical quantum computing, the KLM model, is universal for quantum computing, and another model, the boson sampling-based model, is believed to be non-universal (for quantum computing) yet still seems to be able to solve some problems exponentially faster than a classical computer. The specific nonlinear transformation alpha_00rangle + alpha_11rangle + alpha_2 2rangle rightarrow alpha_00rangle + alpha_11rangle - alpha_2 2rangle, (called \\"a gate\\" when using computer science terminology) presented above, plays an important role in optical quantum computing: on the one hand, it is useful for deriving a universal set of gates, and on the other hand, with (only) linear-optical devices and post- selection of specific outcomes plus a feed-forward process, it can be applied with high success probability, and be used for obtaining universal linear- optical quantum computing, as done in the KLM model.

A friend, Mr. Aungier, taught him Latin, and he learnt Greek by his own perseverance. Forde very soon displayed a talent for art, and though Cork did not offer much to inspire a youthful artist, his taste for literature helped to nourish and foster the high aspirations which distinguished, even in his schoolboy days, the numerous sketches on which he employed himself. Art career He became a student in the Cork Academy, drawing from the collection of casts which Lord Listowel had obtained for that institution. The master, Chalmers, was also a scene painter, and taught Forde distemper painting, so that he was able to be employed at the theatre. He had an intention of becoming a mezzotint engraver, and taught himself the art with materials roughly made by his own hands, but soon relinquished any further practice, becoming an art teacher, and subsequently master in the Cork Mechanics' Institute. Among his fellow-students and intimate friends was Daniel Maclise. As well as Maclise, Forde's contemporaries include John Hogan and George Petrie.Lordan, Shane and Michael Waldron. \\"Samuel's Contemporaries.\\" The Samuel Forde Project. Wordpress. Web. 11 Aug 2013. Up to about twenty years of age, Forde was principally engaged on works of a decorative character painted in distemper. In 1826 he was able to execute works of his own invention, and give expression to the grand projects which his poetical mind conceived. His first picture was the Vision of Tragedy, the idea taken from John Milton, which was painted in distemper, in grey and white. A cartoon for this subject was in the possession of Mr. Justice Willes, and was presented by his nephew to the South Kensington Museum. Forde was continually occupied in projecting pictures of an ambitious nature. In November 1827 he painted in two days a Crucifixion for the chapel of Skibbereen. In October 1827 his lungs first became affected. Death Early in 1828 he commenced a large picture of the Fall of the Rebel Angels, but although he was able to dispose of the picture, he was not destined to complete it. He slowly sank under the increase of his consumptive symptoms, and died on 29 June 1828, at the age of twenty-three. He was buried in St. Finn Barr's churchyard at Cork.

At their N-terminus they contain a dtxR-type HTH domain. This is a DNA-binding, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain of about 65 amino acids present in metalloregulators of the dtxR/mntR family. The domain is named after Corynebacterium diphtheriae dtxR, an iron- specific diphtheria toxin repressor, and Bacillus subtilis mntR, a manganese transport regulator. Iron-responsive metalloregulators such as dtxR and ideR occur in Gram-positive bacteria of the high GC branch, while manganese- responsive metalloregulators like mntR are described in diverse genera of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also in Archaea. The metalloregulators like dtxR/mntR contain the DNA-binding dtxR-type HTHdomain usually in the N-terminal part. The C-terminal part contains a dimerisation domain with two metal-binding sites, although the primary metal-binding site is less conserved in the Mn(II)-regulators. Fe(II)-regulated proteins contain an SH3-like domain as a C-terminal extension, which is absent in Mn(II)-regulated mntR. Metal-ion dependent regulators orchestrate the virulence of several important human pathogens. The dtxR protein regulates the expression of diphtheria toxin in response to environmental iron concentrations. Furthermore, dtxR and ideR control iron uptake. Homeostasis of manganese, which is an essential nutrient, is regulated by mntR. A typical dtxR-type metalloregulator binds two divalent metal effectors per monomer, upon which allosteric changes occur that moderate binding to the cognate DNA operators. Iron-bound dtxR homodimers bind to an interrupted palindrome of 19 bp, protecting a sequence of ~30 bp. The crystal structures of iron-regulated and manganese-regulated repressors show that the DNA binding domain contains three alpha-helices and a pair of antiparallel beta-strands. Helices 2 and 3 comprise the helix-turn-helix motif and the beta-strands are called the wing. This wHTH topology is similar to the lysR-type HTH. Most dtxR-type metalloregulators bind as dimers to the DNA major groove. Several proteins are known to contain a dtxR-type HTH domain. These include: Corynebacterium diphtheriae dtxR, a diphtheria toxin repressor, which regulates the expression of the high-affinity iron uptake system, other iron-sensitive genes, and the bacteriophage tox gene. Metal-bound dtxR represses transcription by binding the tox operator; if iron is limiting, conformational changes of the wHTH disrupt DNA-binding and the diphtheria toxin is produced. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ideR, an iron-dependent regulator that is essential for this pathogen. The regulator represses genes for iron acquisition and activates iron storage genes, and is a positive regulator of oxidative stress responses. Bacillus subtilis mntR, a manganese transport regulator, binds Mn2+ as an effector and is a transcriptional repressor of transporters for the import of manganese. Treponema pallidum troR, a metal-dependent transcriptional repressor. Archaeoglobus fulgidus MDR1 (troR), a metal-dependent transcriptional repressor, which negatively regulates its own transcription.

It rises on the European Watershed, which is only a hint in this area, from the Mindersdorfer Aach in the municipality of Hohenfels in the Landkreis of Konstanz. It is about long.  Geology  During the Riss ice age, about 120,000 years ago, the Ablach flowed into the Danube at Engelswies, because its original valley was covered by the ice. The ice blocked the Danube, and the Danube formed a lake between Geisingen and Spaichingen. When the water level of this lake reached above mean sea level, it overflowed into the Neckar valley at Spaichingen. About 100,000 years ago, the ice melted and the Ablach took its current course.Irgendwann auch ohne Eingriff dem Rhein zu, in: S√ºdkurier of 3 August 2003 Before it was straightened, the Ablach meandered through its valley. The Ablach Valley in the broadest sense is the area between the Gro√üer Heuberg in the north and the Linzgau in the southCf. Menningen, in: S√ºdkurier of 25 August 2008  Course  The confluence of the Andelsbach (front) and Ablach (rear) The upper reaches of the Ablach flow through the Schwackenreute Plateau, past the towns of Bichtlingen and Schnerkingen. In Me√ükirch, the Grabenbach joins from the left. the Ablach then flows past Igelsweis and Menningen, where, in the Middle Ages, the Ablach fed the moat around the water castle. Before G√∂ggingen, the Ringgenbach joins from the right and some of the Ablach's water is diverted into a mill channel. Past G√∂ggingen, this channel joins the Ablach again. The Ablach then flows past a village named after it, Ablach, and then towards Krauchenwies and through the local royal park. After Krauchenwies, it flows in a graded bed past Zielfingen, amidst a collection of water-filled gravel pits. A weir near the S√ºdsee III restaurant diverts some the Ablach's water into a channel where it drives a water mill and a saw mill. Past this sawmill, the water is led back to the Ablach, only to be diverted again for the next saw mill. The diverted water then flows through Mengen, while the original course flows through Ennetach. The two streams are reunited south of Blochingen, shortly before the Ablach flows into the Danube. The last of the Ablach flows along a former bed of the Danube. This arm of the Danube was cut off when the Danube was straightened.See: , published by the K√∂nigliche Statistisch topographischen Bureau, sheet V, 1830  The Mindersdorfer Aach, watershed and bifurcation  Upper Ablach valley The headwaters that are currently the upper part of the Mindersdorfer Aach were originally the headwaters of the Ablach. The Stockacher Aach had a favourable gradientThe Stockacher Aach falls from its source to Lake Constance; the Ablach falls only from its source to its confluence with the Danube for use in a hydropower plant and to drive several sawmills and a forge. However the Stockacher Aach does not naturally carry enough water to drive all of these, which is why as early as 1699, a canal was dug across the European Watershed to divert the water of the upper Ablach into the Mindersdorfer Aach. A canal of only across the Schwackenreute Plateau was all that it took to accomplish this. This effectively moved the European watershed, annexing the upper Ablach into the catchment area of the Rhine. Strictly speaking, the weir at the start of the canal creates an artificial bifurcation: most of the water is diverted via the Stockacher Aach to Lake Constance, but in times of heavy rainfall, the excess water follows the original course of the Ablach to the Danube.  History  People settled early in the fertile lands bordering the Ablach, in which traces of Celtic, Roman and Alamanni villages have been found. The name Ablach is probably derived from the Celtic Abela, which means something like \\"brook\\".Gustav Kempf: Das G√∂gginger Dorfbuch, Radolfzell, 1969 In the fifth and sixth century, the Alamanni established villages in the more suitable places. These villages can be recognized by the fact that they have names ending in \\"-ingen\\": G√∂ggingen, Menningen, Schnerkingen, Bichtlingen.Armin Heim: Ergebnis der ersten Welle des mittelalterlichen Landesausbaus, in: S√ºdkurier of 14 August 2003 Later the Ablach Valley gained importance because of its supply of wood and because the soil quality made it suitable for growing cereal. The annual spring floods ensured adequate fertilization. In the past century, the Ablach Valley became an important center for gravel mining. The course of the Ablach has been adjusted several times. A few kilometers of the headwaters have been diverted into the Stockacher Aach, reducing the catchment area of the Ablach by about . Curiously, the upper part of the Ablach as it flows through Zizenhausen was still called Ablach as late as 1857.Gregor Moser: Der Weg f√ºhrt zur Peter-Klink-Plastik, in: S√ºdkurier of 9 August 2011 The course of the river was again altered during construction of the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway line, between 1866 and 1870 from Stockach to Me√ükirch and between 1870 and 1873 from Me√ükirch via Krauchenwies to Mengen. The line runs along the Ablach and crosses it several times. Room for the Ablach was further restricted by road construction, in particular the construction of Federal road 311. Road construction and the alteration of the habitat for agricultural purposes gave the landscape in the valley its current shape. The section of the Ablach between Menningen and G√∂ggingen was improved after repeated flooding; in 1910 it was widened to , at a cost of .Einstmals, in: S√ºdkurier of 24.

The reserve is situated west of the central business district, approximately north-east of and located near the townships of and . In 1960, was reclaimed for use as a Child Welfare Training School, and in 1971, was reclaimed for the establishment of a liquid waste disposal facility. The boundary of the reserve is marked by The Northern Road to the west, by Llandilo Road to the east, rural properties to the south and by the Castlereagh Waste Management Centre to the north. The nature reserve was formerly Castlereagh State Forest and was managed as a production forest from 1917 to 1988, then as a demonstration forest from 1988 to 1995.  Features  = Geology = The Castlereagh Nature Reserve contains a geographically restricted substrate of Tertiary alluvials producing clays, sand, gravel and shales at depth. Parts of the reserve support Cumberland Plain Woodland vegetation. The nature reserve is between above sea level and is predominately flat with broad, shallow depressions forming a sparse drainage network. Small, shallow lakes form after wet weather to the north of the reserve where gravels and other alluvials have been extracted when the reserve was a production forest. = Flora = Open forest occurs on clay soils and is dominated by broad-leaved ironbark Eucalyptus fibrosa sap. Fibrosa with occasional mugga ironbark Eucalyptus sideroxylon, thin-leaved stringybark Eucalyptus enugeniodes, woollybutt Eucalyptus longifolia and Scribbly Gum Eucalyptus sclerophylla. Threatened plant species found in the nature reserve include Dillwynia tenuifolia, Pultenea parviflora, Acacia bynoeana, dwarf casuarina Allocasuarina glareicola, nodding geebung Persoonia nutans and Micromyrtus minutiflora. The reserve is relatively free of significant weed infestations. A few slash pines Pinus elliotti are found in the northern section of the reserve from when of Castlereagh State Forest was used for trial plantings of pines in the 1920s and 1930s. Heavy harvesting of ironbark during the Second World Ware, illegal timber collection and numerous fires generally thinned the forest, resulting in no mature trees in some areas. = Fauna = The nature reserve is home to a diverse range of mammals including sugar gliders, Petaurus breviceps; brush- tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecular; and eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus. The eastern brown snake, Pseudonaja textilis; red-bellied black snake, Psuedechris porphriacus; lace monitor, Varanus varius; and a number of frog species including the endangered green and golden bell frog, Litoria aurea; also reside within the reserve.  Environmental impacts  In 1987 the area around the old gravel pits was planted with over 3,000 seedlings but ultimately the plantings were unsuccessful. Due to past logging and other plantings, parts of the reserve are dominated by immature regrowth and has modified species composition and abundance. An area of to the north western boundary of the nature reserve adjacent to the Castlereagh Waste Management Centre was previously used as an area for the disposal of heavy metals including zinc, cadmium and lead. The contaminated soil was removed in 1996 and replaced with clean local fill. Groundwater quality is monitored at six sampling stations by Waste Services. Fire has been a major factor in shaping the flora in the reserve. The last major fire occurred in 1982 and burnt over 75 percent of the reserve, which has altered the understory of the forest and woodland communicates. Subsequently, a fire in November 2016 that started near The Northern Road Londonderry burnt through 336 ha of the nature reserve and was contained at Government Road, Berkshire Park.

Origins Flakefield was, it is said, son of a native (named Wilson) of Flakefield, in the parish of East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, who became a merchant in Glasgow about 1650. He was called Flakefield in order to distinguish him from another merchant named Wilson. However this may be, Richard Fleckfield was deacon of the incorporation of weavers of Glasgow in 1640, John Fleckfield in 1670, and Robert Fleckfield in 1673, 1675, and 1676 (James Cleland, Annals of Glasgow, p. 425). William Flakefield may probably have been the son of John or Robert Fleckfield. Military service After having learned the art of weaving, he enlisted about 1670 in the Cameronian regiment; from this he was afterwards transferred to the Scots guards. While on service abroad he came across a blue and white check handkerchief of German make. He resolved immediately to imitate it when he returned to Glasgow, and when he obtained his discharge in 1700 he carried out his intention. Checked linen With some difficulty he got together the means for making a web of two dozen handkerchiefs. The novelty of the blue and white check and the unusual fineness of the texture made the article so popular that it was soon very largely manufactured in Glasgow and its neighbourhood. As late as 1771 striped and checkered linen cloth and handkerchiefs were among the most important textile manufactures of Glasgow. Probably in consequence of being outstripped by imitators with larger means of carrying on the new manufacture, Flakefield himself seems to have obtained no benefit from the success of his scheme, for in his old age he was made town-drummer of Glasgow, and died in that office.

He later collected Norfolk folk songs. Military career He was the eldest son of Charles Annesley and Mary Augusta Hamond, of Twyford Hall, East Dereham. He was commissioned in the 4th (Militia) Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment, and served in the Second Boer War where he was dangerously wounded at the Battle of Rooiwal in early April 1902. Following the battle, he was mentioned in despatches, and created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the youngest regular officer - at 18 - to that date to earn a DSO. He was also, on 23 April 1902, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, nominated by the General Officer Commanding-in- Chief, South Africa. The commission was cancelled, however, when on 7 May 1902 he instead joined a regular battalion of the Norfolk Regiment. Following the end of hostilities, he left Cape Town for England in early June the same year. He rejoined the Norfolk Regiment in 1914. He was awarded the Military Cross in the 1916 Birthday Honours and (as a major), a second DSO in 1918. He was attached to the Tank Corps, commanding F battalion at the Battle of Cambrai (1917). Late on the morning of 20 November 1917, his battalion of twelve Mark IV tanks entered the town of Masni√®res. On reaching the St Quentin Canal, it was found that the only bridge had been partially destroyed by the Germans. F22 Flying Fox II was ordered to attempt to cross but the weight of the tank caused the bridge to collapse further. The crew escaped but the tank blocked the progress of other tanks and cavalry units that were attempting to cross the canal in order to exploit the British breakthrough.Cambrai 1917: The Myth Of The First Great Tank Battle by Bryn Hammond (2008) quotes extensively from Hamond's letters In 1918 he was sent to the USA as British Liaison Officer to teach tank warfare at Camp Colt, Pennsylvania with Major Dwight D.

Family On 25 August 1909, he married Rita Gladys Ethel Hammond. They leased Morston Hall in 1914. Between 1924 and 1928, he built Scaldbeck House, Morston almost entirely from reclaimed materials retrieved from local properties; much of the timber for the house came from a French schooner, Guenowle, which had grounded at Blakeney in August 1921. After Rita's death in 1926, he married Emily Diana Helen Walton (1899-1982) in 1928. Rector of Stiffkey affair As a prominent landowner and churchwarden, he clashed with the Rector of Stiffkey-with-Morston, Harold Davidson. In 1930, Davidson missed the Remembrance Day service; Hamond was furious and accused the priest of insulting the war dead. His complaints initiated investigations which led to the Rector's trial on charges of immorality and his eventual defrocking in 1932. Hamond was convicted of assault in 1932. After his last service at Stiffkey, Davidson had called at Hamond's house, apparently to ask for a church key, but Hamond refused to speak to him and told him \\"Clear out, or I'll kick you out!\\". Hamond then kicked the Rector off the step, stating at the Magistrates' court that it was \\"a kick of finality and contempt\\". Hamond also kicked a companion of Davidson, Clinton Gray-Fisk.

MBD has negligible non- specific affinity for unmethylated DNA. In vitro foot-printing with the chromosomal protein MeCP2 showed that the MBD could protect a 12 nucleotide region surrounding a methyl CpG pair. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides, the most common DNA modification in eukaryotes, has been associated with various phenomena such as alterations in chromatin structure, genomic imprinting, transposon and chromosome X inactivation, differentiation, and cancer. Effects of DNA methylation are mediated through proteins that bind to symmetrically methylated CpGs. Such proteins contain a specific domain of ~70 residues, the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), which is linked to additional domains associated with chromatin, such as the bromodomain, the AT hook motif, the SET domain, or the PHD finger. MBD-containing proteins appear to act as structural proteins, which recruit a variety of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and chromatin remodelling factors, leading to chromatin compaction and, consequently, to transcriptional repression. The MBD of MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD4 and BAZ2 mediates binding to DNA, and in cases of MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2, preferentially to methylated CpG. In human MBD3 and SETDB1, the MBD has been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions. MBDs are also found in DNA demethylase. The MBD folds into an alpha/beta sandwich structure comprising a layer of twisted beta sheet, backed by another layer formed by the alpha1 helix and a hairpin loop at the C terminus. These layers are both amphipathic, with the alpha1 helix and the beta sheet lying parallel and the hydrophobic faces tightly packed against each other. The beta sheet is composed of two long inner strands (beta2 and beta3) sandwiched by two shorter outer strands (beta1 and beta4). The structure of the MBD domain bound to methylated DNA has been solved (). It recognizes the hydration of the major groove at methylated sites.

Flattisbury was from a prominent Irish family: members of the family, from the thirteenth century, held important positions as landowners in County Kildare, and occasionally filled legal offices under the English government there. Flattisbury appears to have been a retainer of Gear√≥id M√≥r FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, deputy-governor of Ireland under Henry VII and Henry VIII. In 1503 Flattisbury made for FitzGerald a compilation styled the Red Book of the Earls of Kildare. This volume consists mainly of documents connected with or bearing upon the lands and possessions of the Geraldine house of Kildare. This volume was sought for eagerly, but in vain, by the governmental agents at the time of the attainder of the heads of the house of Kildare in 1537.

Flattisbury also transcribed for Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, in 1517, a collection of Anglo-Irish annals in Latin, terminating in 1370 (linked by the DNB to the chronicles of John Pembridge). To them he appended at the end a few lines of additional matter, with a brief panegyric on the Earl of Kildare.

Edmund Campion, in his History of Ireland, written in 1571, and Richard Stanihurst, somewhat later, referred erroneously to Flattisbury as the author of the annals of which he was the transcriber. Stanihurst did not record the date of Flattisbury's death, but mentioned that it took place ‚Äòat his town styled Johnstown,‚Äô near Naas, in Kildare, and observes that he was a ‚Äòworthy gentleman and a diligent antiquary.‚Äô The original annals, from which Flattisbury transcribed, were printed for the first time in 1607 by William Camden, in his Britannia, from a manuscript lent to him by Lord Howard of Naworth Castle, and subsequently presented by Archbishop Laud to the Bodleian Library, where it is now preserved.

The original Wand duplicated the functionality of the Wii Remote, while the updated Wand+ added internal replication of the Wii MotionPlus for more advanced motion sensing, similar to Nintendo's later Wii Remote Plus. The Wand series also adds additional functionality through the use of a proprietary extension of the standard Wii Remote expansion port. Overview The design of the Wand is largely similar to Nintendo's Wii Remote. Like the official controller, it has been made available in multiple colors, and features seven digital buttons and a D-pad on the face, a trigger button on the reverse; an infrared sensor for pointer controls; and motion sensing hardware. The latter was improved in the updated Wand+, which internally replicates the functionality of the Wii MotionPlus. The Wand expansion port also includes additional pins dubbed \\"Trans-Port Technology\\" by their creator, which allow Wand-specific accessories to digitally activate the controller's buttons and receive haptic feedback information, features not available on the Wii Remote. History Development on the Wand was first revealed publicly at the January 2009 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where it was given a CNET Best of CES award in the Gaming category for \\"[improving] on the original Nintendo Wii remote\\". Coverage of the device's unveiling noted that the Wand was the first third- party Wii Remote alternative to be developed, and the controller was released to retail on May 21, 2009. At CES 2010, Nyko displayed an updated version of the Wand with integrated MotionPlus support, dubbed the Wand+. At the time of its January unveiling, it was the only Wii controller with internal MotionPlus capability--Nintendo's Wii Remote Plus would not be announced until late in the year--and the Wand+ was nominated by CNET for Best of CES, in addition to being voted among the Best of CES 2010 by the editors of CrunchGear. The Wand+ became available on September 2, 2010. Accessories The Wand's design makes it compatible with most standard Wii Remote accessories, including controller shells such as the Wii Wheel and Zapper, and expansion port devices like the Nunchuk and Classic Controller. Released prior to Nintendo's MotionPlus, the Wand was not initially compatible with the accessory, however a firmware update was made available to Wand owners, and future shipments supported the device. =Kama= The Kama is Nyko's alternative to the official Nunchuk, and can be used with Wands as well as Wii remotes and other alternatives. It is produced in both wireless and wired models. The wireless Kama uses two AAA batteries for power, while the wired version (which is powered via the expansion port) uses this space to include a rumble motor for haptic feedback when used with Wands, via Trans-Port. =Pistol Grip= barrel. The Pistol Grip is a gun shell for Wands, similar in design to Nyko's (mechanical) Perfect Shot, with digital inputs using Trans-Port. It is intended for use with light gun games, and features digital hammer and trigger buttons mapped to the Wand's A and B buttons, with a switch allowing their functions to be inverted depending on the game's controls. It also includes a rumble motor for haptic feedback, and a pass-through port for attaching other accessories to the Pistol Grip. Due to its reliance on features of the Wand, it is not compatible with other devices. =Type Pad Pro= The Type Pad Pro is a QWERTY keyboard shell for the Wand and other Wii Remote-compatible devices. It connects wirelessly to the Wii via a USB dongle, and is powered by the remote's expansion port. When used with a Wand, buttons on the Type Pad are able to activate the A and B buttons digitally via Trans-Port. Reception Reviews of Wand controllers have been moderate to positive. In their review of the original version, the Wand was described by Destructoid as being \\"as good as and in some ways superior to the original\\", with \\"better\\" buttons, improved grip and otherwise \\"identical\\" functionality, concluding with a \\"Buy it!\\" rating. IGN preferred the Wand's buttons to the Wii Remote, noting that \\"the 1 and 2 buttons are much easier to get a firm grip and mash mercilessly on,\\" the B trigger had \\"improved tactile response,\\" and their responsiveness was \\"exceptional\\", while the Wand's motion controls were comparable with Nintendo's controller. UGO felt the larger buttons were \\"much more inline with a classic NES controller than the tiny Wii buttons\\", describing the controller as being superior to the Wii Remote for \\"more hardcore gamers\\". Other reviewers had more mixed feelings on the Wand. Nintendojo said the third-party controller was \\"a good alternative\\" but had \\"a few issues\\" when used with extension controllers, ultimately rating it a 7.5/10. CNET, while speaking positively about the motion controls, internal speaker and buttons, felt the redesigned D-pad was \\"clunky and cumbersome\\", and were disappointed by the lack of Trans-Port accessories at launch, giving it 3/5. Much criticism has been directed at the Wand's aesthetics. Reporting on the device's unveiling at CES, Destructoid called it a \\"twisted brainwrong\\" which \\"looks a bit like it was designed by half-crazed, starving Oompa Loompas on the back of a thirty day coke binge.\\" Joystiq noted that \\"the defining characteristic of the Nyko Wand is its ugliness.\\" Reception for the Wand+ in particular has been positive. Engadget felt that including MotionPlus support in a stock-sized controller was \\"as it should have been in the first place\\", preferring it over the dongle solution, ending by \\"shockingly [having] to conclude it is equal to or superior to the stock Wiimote.\\" GeekDad appreciated the use of \\"a newer, more muted color palette\\" over the \\"garish\\" original Wand, adding that it featured \\"functionality that the Nintendo product should have rightly delivered from the get-go\\" and was overall \\"as responsive as [a] first-party product\\".

Kastner was one of the most popular leading men in German films during his career's peak in the 1920s. Early life Richard Otto Bruno Kastner was born in Forst (Lausitz), Brandenburg, Germany in 1890. His father was a forestry tax minister. Kastner attended schools in F√ºrstenwalde and afterward served a short, seventeen-day stint in the military before being relieved of his duties due to an injury.Bruno Kastner profile , Filmportal.de; retrieved 15 August 2011. He subsequently travelled to Berlin and took acting lessons from stage actor Paul Biensfeldt and then relocated briefly to Hamburg where he performed at the Harburger Theater. After a brief period in touring companies he worked as a choral singer and actor at the Meinhard-Bernauer B√ºhnen in Berlin. Career rise During World War I Kastner avoided military service, assessed as unfit for service due to his prior injury while serving before the war's outbreak. Discovered by Danish film actress Asta Nielsen, he made his film debut opposite her in the 1914 Urban Gad-directed comedy short Engelein (Little Angel), with Fred Immler and Hanns Kr√§ly. He followed the success of this film with the sequel Engeleins Hochzeit (Little Angel's Wedding) in 1916. In the interim, Kastner quickly became a matinee idol in Germany, especially popular with female fans. The German press commented on Kastner's rise to stardom and how vexed postmen were having to transport love letters from fans to Kastner in laundry baskets. Kastner cemented his romantic image by appearing as the ardent suitor to popular actress Dorrit Weixler in a number of films of the era. Male filmgoers were less fond of Kastner's image of a handsome dandy and gave him the nickname \\"Kleiderb√ºgel\\" (\\"coat hanger\\") - a reference to his slim build and fashionable wardrobe.Waldemar Kamer, A Family Chronicle waldemar.kamer.fr Retrieved 15 August 2011. Although he didn't carry much clout with many male filmgoers, his popularity with female fans grew momentum. In 1921, Kastner was voted \\"The Best German Actor\\" in a magazine poll and he began appearing that year in a film serial called Der Silberk√∂nig (The Silver King) opposite leading lady Ossi Oswalda. The following year, he founded his own film company. Other popular films of the era included roles in Fritz Lang's Hilde Warren und der Tod (1917), Erik Lund's Das Herz des Casanova (1919) and Georg Jacoby's Das Paradies im Schnee (1924). Kastner wrote the screenplays for four films that he would produce and star in: Nur ein Diener, Das Herz des Casanova, Der letzte Sonnensohn and Der Weltmeister, all directed by Erik Lund and released in 1919. Kastner's career was almost cut short in 1924 when he was involved in a serious motorcycle accident in Lugano, Switzerland, which left him with permanent pain. He never fully recovered, but after a year of rest and recuperation, he returned to the screen in 1925. Career decline and death Bruno Kastner ca. 1920. By the late 1920s, Kastner's career began to falter. No longer able to play the young, seductive bon vivant type which had made him famous, his roles in films grew smaller, although he still had a measure of success in such films as Karl Grune's 1926 drama Die Br√ºder Schellenberg with Conrad Veidt, Lil Dagover and Liane Haid and the Jacob Fleck and Luise Fleck-directed Der Orlow with Iv√°n Petrovich and Hans Junkermann in 1927. Bruno Kastner The onset of sound films proved disastrous to Kastner's career in 1930 upon the release of his first talkie titled Das Land des L√§chelns (The Land of Smiles) when filmgoers discovered that he stammered. He would only make one more film, 1930's unsuccessful Tingel-Tangel. After failing to garner any more film roles because of his speech impediment, he tried to revive his career by touring German theatres and permitting female members of the audience to get onstage and have their photograph taken with their past idol. Kastner suffered from depression after his rapid career decline. After two years of struggling to regain his public popularity, he rented a hotel room in Bad Kreuznach and committed suicide by hanging himself in June 1932. He was 42. Personal life Kastner was married to German actress Ida W√ºst from 1918 to 1924. The union ended in divorce and produced no offspring. In 1925, he married actress Lisl Tirsch-Kastner. The couple were still married at the time of Kastner's death.

He was educated at The Queen's College, Oxford, which he entered in 1650, and Gray's Inn. By the death of his father in 1653 Fleming inherited considerable estates in the neighbourhood of Rydal, for which he paid heavy fines to the parliament. At the Restoration he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland. He was a constant correspondent of Secretary Joseph Williamson: his letters, which went to the Public Record Office, afford a lively picture of the state of affairs in Cumberland and Westmorland during the latter half of the 17th century. They exhibit him as a staunch supporter of the Church of England, and enemy alike of the Protestant dissenter and the Roman Catholic. He regretted the release of George Fox in 1666 as likely to discourage the justices from acting against the Quakers, and gave credence to reports of their burning \\"steeple houses\\". He was knighted on 15 May 1681 at Windsor, and in the parliament of 1685‚Äì1687 sat as member for ; he opposed the Declaration of Indulgence.

Lake Kozhozero is the source of the river Kozha, which is a left tributary of the Onega and thus belongs to the White Sea basin. The lake is located in the remote area and is not connected to the outside world by any all-season roads. It is notable as a location of the Kozheozersky Monastery, known since 1560. The basin of Lake Kozhozero comprises areas in the south of Onezhsky District as well as in the north-west of Plesetsky District, also in Arkhangelsk Oblast. The lake is elongated from the north-west to the south- east, and approximately in the middle is crossed into two parts by a peninsula attached to the eastern shore. The Kozheozersky Monastery is located at the neck of the peninsula. The Kozha River flows out of the northern part of the lake. Lake Kozhozero is the biggest from the system of connected freshwater lakes, which also include Lake Vingozero to the north-west and Lake Kurusskoye to the east. The peninsula originally was an island, known as Kozheostrov. Nikon, the future patriarch of Moscow and reformer of Russian Orthodox Church, was a hegumen of the monastery from 1643 to 1646. During his tenure, the island was connected by a dam with the shore and became a peninsula. The monastery was closed down in 1918, and for some time its ruins hosted resettled peasants. This settlement was known as Kozhposyolok. In 1954, Kozhposyolok was abandoned, and the monastery was repopulated in 1997 and consecrated in 1999. There are no other settlements on Lake Kozhozero.

Life The eldest son of John Nichols, by his second wife, Martha Green (1756‚Äì1788), he was born at Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, London, 15 July 1779. He spent his early years with his maternal grandfather at Hinckley, Leicestershire, and was educated at St Paul's School, London, which he left in September 1796 to enter his father's printing office. He had a part in the editorship of the Gentleman's Magazine, and contributed under the initials J. B. N., or N. R. S. (the final letters of his name). He became the sole proprietor of the magazine in 1833, and in the following year transferred a share to William Pickering of Piccadilly. This share he subsequently repurchased, and in 1856 conveyed the whole property to John Henry Parker of Oxford. The printing firm became J. Nichols, Son, & Bentley, with an office at the Cicero's Head, Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, as well as at 25 Parliament Street, Westminster. Nichols had become one of the printers of the votes and proceedings of the Houses of Parliament, an appointment in which he followed his father and William Bowyer (1699‚Äì1777). For a short time he was printer to the corporation of the city of London. In 1821, after the resignation of his father, he became one of the three registrars of the Royal Literary Fund. He was master of the Stationers' Company in 1850, having served all the annual offices. Towards the end of his life he became blind. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society (1812) and of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1818), and was appointed their printer in 1824; he was an original member of the Athen√¶um Club, the Royal Archaeological Institute, the Numismatic Society, and the Royal Society of Literature. He also filled various public offices in Westminster. He died at Ealing on 19 October 1863, aged 84, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. There are portraits of Nichols by J. Jackson, in watercolour, about 1818; by F. Hopwood, in pencil, 1821; by John Wood, in oil, 1836; and by Samuel Laurence, in chalks, 1850. The last was lithographed by J. H. Lynch. W. Behnes exhibited a bust of him at the Royal Academy in 1858. Works He superintended the passing through the press of major county histories. These included George Ormerod's Cheshire, Robert Clutterbuck's Hertfordshire, Robert Surtees's Durham, James Raine's North Durham, Colt Hoare's Wiltshire, Joseph Hunter's South Yorkshire, George Baker's Northamptonshire, Thomas Dunham Whitaker's Whalley and Craven, and George Lipscomb's Buckinghamshire. He left large printed and manuscript collections on English topography. His last literary undertaking was the completion (vol. vii. in 1848 and vol. viii. in 1856) of his father's Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, the sequel to the Literary Anecdotes. William Bray refers to the accuracy of Nichols in revising the proof-sheets of the second volume of his edition of Owen Manning's History of Surrey. Nichols circulated proposals in 1811 for printing the third and fourth volumes of John Hutchins's Dorset, of which the stock of the first three volumes had been lost in the fire on his father's premises in 1808. The fourth volume appeared in 1815, with his name on the title-page jointly with that of Richard Gough. In 1818 he published the autobiography of the bookseller John Dunton, which had furnished materials for the Literary Anecdotes of his father. Other works were: * A brief Account of the Guildhall of the City of London, London, 1819. * Account of the Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of St. Katharine, near the Tower, London, 1824,(based on the history of Andrew Ducarel, 1782, with additional plates). * Historical Notices of Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire, London, 1836, (based on the publications of J.

It has also tried to explain that Li√ºntika/Levente lost his life during the campaign and had no descendants. This seems to contradict the aforementioned place name of Laventenburch.

Such photography was a fad in the 1920s. The practice derives its name from the Headless Horseman, an evil character from Washington Irving's short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". Horsemaning saw a revival in 2011, along with other photo fads such as planking and owling. All three were considered among the top 10 Facebook sensations of 2011 and a series of horsemaning photos began trending on sites like BuzzFeed as people were inspired to recreate the original fad. Description The objective of horsemanning is to make it appear that the photo's subject has been beheaded. Horsemanning requires two individuals, one situated with one's head hidden (e.g. tilted backwards) with the other hiding his or her body and exposing only his or her head. The resulting photo appears to show a headless body with a disembodied head lying beside it; in fact, it consists of one person's body and a different person's head.

Pfistermeister entered history not only in the domain of politics but also in the domain of music, when in his first official administrative function he was ordered by King Ludwig II to find the composer Richard Wagner and bring him to Munich. Life and work Franz Seraph Freiherr von Pfistermeister was born on 14 December 1820 in Amberg, Germany. After attending the gymnasium in Amberg, Franz Pfistermeister began his career in the Royal Bavarian governmental service as military fiscal adjunct. In 1849 he was appointed to the Court Office in Munich, and by the year 1866 he then began working as Cabinet Secretary to Kings Maximilian II and Ludwig II. Because of his opposition to Richard Wagner,Wagner was drawn into a plot conceived by Prince Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis to found a new kingdom for his eldest son Maximilian Anton Lamoral Erbprinz von Thurn und Taxis consisting of Rhineland- Westphalia and approximately half of Belgium. In order to succeed, a bank should have to be found, and indeed the Landgrand-Dumonceau agricultural Bank in Antwerp was created. Councillor Georg Klindworth from Brussels and Baron Franz Josef von Gruben from Regensburg, the Thurn und Taxis estate manager and a prominent figure in the Bavarian Catholic Party, offered Wagner capital in the form of bonus share in the recently formed bank to finance his plans. All that Wagner had to do was to use his influence with the king and persuade him into firing the hated ministers Pfistermeister and Karl Ludwig Freiherr von der Pfordten.Westernhagen, Curt von (1978), Wagner: A Biography, Vol. 2, Cambridge University Press, pp. 359-360, Pocknell, Pauline (2000), Franz Liszt and Agnes Street-Klindworth: A Correspondence, p. lii, Pendragon Press, Saffle, Michael (2003), Liszt and the birth of modern Europe: music as a mirror of religious, Political, Cultural, and Aesthetic Transformations, p. 85, Pendragon Press, and his costly promotion by King Ludwig II in 1866, his dismissal from the 1866 service was \\"the highest immediate service\\".

The south facade faces Grimburgwal, the west facade faces Oudezijds Voorburgwal and the east facade faces Oudezijds Achterburgwal. The address is Oudezijds Voorburgwal 249. The Huis aan de Drie Grachten is a double house in Dutch Renaissance style. A stepped gable crowns each of the three facades.

He aimed to restore the building to its original 17th-century state, basing himself on a contemporary painting of the house by Gerrit Berckheyde which is now in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum. During the renovations, the building was given new stepped gables, kruiskozijnen (windows that are divided into four smaller windows by crossbeams), and a sandstone entrance gate. These replaced the original elements which had been demolished in the 18th century. The renovation also stripped the interior of the house of elements which had been added over the centuries. In 2005, the building underwent a second renovation. There are two large 17th-century mantelplaces within the house. However, it is not known whether these were added during the 1909 renovations, or whether these are original elements of the house. August Aim√© Balkema opened a bookstore in the building in 1936. During the Second World War, the bookstore was used to clandestinely print and publish works of poetry and other literature. A hidden compartment over one of the mantelpieces was uncovered during the renovations in 2005.

From the age of 14, he attended the academies of Breda and T√ºbingen. As part of his training, he undertook extensive travels to France, Switzerland, Italy and England. In 1658, he returned to the court of his brother Prince Enno Louis at Aurich. After Enno Louis's sudden death in March 1660, Ferdinand Edzard demanded that power be shared between himself and his brother George Christian. He could not prevail. His request to have his share of the inheritance paid out, did not succeed either. On 18 January 1661 the brothers came to an agreement. Ferdinand Edzard dropped his request for a share of power in return for an annual sum of money and an apanage consisting the town of Norden. Ferdinand Edzard took up residence in Norden with a small court, and was henceforth known as the \\"Count of Norden\\". On 22 July 1665 he married Anna Dorothea of Criechingen and P√ºttingen, with whom he had two sons.

The Paris based Soci√©t√© des √âtudes Automobiles M. A. Julien presented its first prototype in 1946 and automaking activities came to an end in 1949, probably without any of the developments having progressed beyond the prototype stage. History The company presented its first prototypes at the Paris Motor Show in October 1946. These were the Julien MM5 and the Julien VUP. During the ensuing twelve months Julien negotiated successfully with the government, who controlled the necessary materials supplies, for permission to put the MM5 into production. The car The open-topped two-seater car featured a single-cylinder two- stroke engine of 310 cc which for 1947 was increased to 325 cc with a maximum power output of 10 hp. The rear track was strikingly narrower than that at the front, but the car did have four wheels and power was delivered via a three- speed manual transmission to the rear axle. The 1840 mm wheelbase supported an overall body length of 2870 mm and the weight of just over 300 kg allowed for an acceptable performance level. For 1949 a Julien MM7 appeared with engine capacity increased to 368 cc and power to 13 hp. However, 1949 was the company‚Äôs last year as an aspiring auto-maker. References * G.N. Georgano: Autos.

Biography  Photograph by Hila Lulu Lin Hila Lin (later Lulu Lin) was born on Kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. When she was two years old, her parents were sent to Qazvin, Iran for three years as aliyah emissaries. When the family returned to Israel they moved to Kfar Bilu. Lulu Lin studied at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem in 1986-1989.Information Center for Israeli Art She lives and works in Tel Aviv. Her partner is the artist Hanna Farah-Kufer Bir'im. Art career Lin works in various artistic areas in local culture and her works has had a remarkable effect in Israeli art. Until Lin, in Israeli art, it was rare to deal with internal organs of body or connect them to architecture or transformation processes as they performed. She continually deals with body, sexuality, alienation, and detachedness, and the body of her works are sculpture, poetry, drawings, photographs, video works, and her later works - express a personal aesthetic that breaks normative boundaries. Her artistic-surrealistic language is expressed in crossbreeding and manipulations that she creates in her body in front of a camera, processes computer simulations or expresses words in her poems, with rhetoric that combines erotica, fear, distress and rejection. Her work echoes the trend of surrealism and Dada of the first half of the 20th century, but at the same time her artistic language speaks out beyond the trends of the era. Lynn emerged in the scene in the late 1980s, with self-documentation video art including brusque images. She used her body as a way of presenting a body that is an infinite creative space that allows us to point to 'polar' tension between strangers and sellers, clean and impure, life and death, external and internal, large and small. Her first solo, \\"The Voice of the Right\\" (1992), Lin presented sculptural objects made of various items, it was not conventional leave, but rather interrupting breaks between organic and synthetic, concrete and fictional, pleasurable and delightful. Her aesthetics get deeper into more physical direction later on, which already used as objects. In \\"No More Tears\\" (1994), video work which was shown in the exhibition \\"Metasex 94: Identity, Body and Sexuality\\" (1994) sensuously expressed the experience of female embodiment in an erotic way. Lin manipulated an egg yolk on her body: the artist slowly rolls an egg yolk along her arm and into her mouth; then, gently easing it out of her mouth and repeated on other side. \\"Cold Blood\\" (A Poem in Three Parts), in 1996 created a moment before of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. The hedonistic character of Tel Aviv's seashore was juxtaposed with the sacredness of the Dome of the Rock, the most sacred Muslim site in Jerusalem. Both iconic landscapes were depicted under raw, bloody skies. At that time, Lin refused to give any interpretation to her work, and insisted on her right of movement and definition of identity without belonging to any art group. Nevertheless she was characterized as: \\"A provocative challenge to the limited notion of women as mothers and nurturers, this sensuous back-and-forth demonstrated an embodied continuity between inside and outside, linking the passions and pleasures of food with those of sex.\\" Around the year 2000, Lin expanded the range and size of her works which also became more political, with materials from the public sphere entering and affecting her style. In her art and poetry, Lin uses her own designed font for her work.

Biography Kanne was born on 8 March 1778 in Delitzsch, Saxony. He studied theology and medicine in Leipzig and Wittenberg, then literature and composition in Dresden. At the end of 1804, he moved to Vienna and worked briefly as a music tutor to Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz of the House of Lobkowicz. He met Joseph Haydn and became a friend of Beethoven whom he assisted to understand the text of the Tridentine Mass when Beethoven worked on his Missa solemnis. He lived for a while in the inn (The Black Camel) in Vienna's Innere Stadt. From 1820 until 1824 he edited the Vienna Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (general musical newspaper)not to be confused with the better known Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in Leipzig following Ignaz and Joseph von Seyfried. In 1829 he edited with Ignaz Franz Castelli the Vienna Allgemeine musikalische Anzeiger (general music bulletin). Kanne wrote more than a dozen operas and works of incidental music to plays, including La fedelt√† (1803), Sappho (1805), Die Elfenk√∂ningin (1805), Orpheus und Eurydice (1807), Fernando und Miranda (1808), Mirandola oder Das Schwert der Rache (1811), Die Belagerten (1813), Deutscher Sinn (1813), Die gute Nachricht (1814), Das Schlo√ü Theben oder Der Kampf der Flu√üg√∂tter (1817), Die eiserne Jungfrau (1822), Malvina oder Putzerls Abenteuer (1823), Lindane oder Die Fee und der Haarbeutelschneider (1824), Die Zauberschminke oder das Land der Erfindungen (1825), Der Untergang des Feenreiches (1826), Philipp und Suschen oder Der falsche Jupiter (1832), Die Mainacht oder Der Blocksberg (Berlin, 1834),\\"Kanne, Friedrich August\\", operone.de partly to his own libretto. His patriotic play to which he also wrote incidental music, \\"Die Spinnerin am Kreuz\\" (1822), was for many years in repertory on Vienna stages. It has been suggested that the slow movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 is a piece of program music closely based on the finale of act 1 of Kanne's Orpheus.Jander, Owen (1985) \\"Beethoven's 'Orpheus in Hades': the Andante con moto of the Fourth Piano Concerto\\", in 19th-Century Music, vol. 8, no. 3, April 1985, pp. 195‚Äì212; quoted in \\"The Plot's The Thing ‚Äì Again\\" by Donal Henahan, The New York Times, 24 April 1988. Beethoven used a text by Kanne for his aria with chorus, \\"Germania\\", WoO 94. Kanne's further works include some symphonies, masses, piano works, and songs written to poems by Goethe, Schiller and Schlegel. Kanne died on 16 December 1833 in Vienna and is buried in St. Marx Cemetery there. Legacy In 1912, the lane Kannegasse in Vienna's Rudolfsheim-F√ºnfhaus was named after him.

Van Landingham (born September 10, 1937) is American community leader, politician and artist. She served in the Virginia House of Delegates for 24 years and spearheaded the transformation of a decrepit former military storage building into the Torpedo Factory Art Center, in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2006 she was designated a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. Personal life Marian Van Landingham was born in Albany, Georgia and graduated from Druid Hills High School in Atlanta in 1955. She received her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in political science at Emory University. In 1967 she moved to Arlington County, Virginia to work as an information specialist for the National Air Pollution Agency before moving to Alexandria to work under Phil Landrum. She is a member of her local Methodist church, is involved in numerous local neighborhood associations, served as vice chairman as the Alexandria Democratic Committee and is a Delta Kappa Gamma. In December 2004, she was diagnosed with cancer, which led to her retirement in 2005. A painter, she lives and works in Alexandria, Virginia with her two dachshunds. In 2010 Van Landingham was honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\" because of her contributions to the arts. Torpedo Factory The Torpedo Factory Art Center In 1973 Van Landingham proposed that a 20th-century, \\"leaky, drafty, pigeon infested\\" former military factory, located in Alexandria, Virginia, be transformed into an artist studio space and art center. The space would also provide regional artists an affordable option to the overpriced rental spaces of the area. She served as the volunteer president for Alexandria's Art League, and she succeeded in convincing the city to fund the $140,000 for the renovation. Artists volunteered and cleaned out the building and creating studio spaces. The Torpedo Factory Art Center opened in 1974 with 140 artists. The Factory's renovation also helped trigger the revitalization of the city's waterfront along the Potomac River, housing 150 artists. By 2017, the art center had become the top tourist attraction in the city. Virginia House of Delegates and community service The Torpedo Factory Art Center was Van Landingham's first political campaign, which helped launch her political career in the Virginia House of Delegates, serving parts of Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax. In 1980 she established Volunteer Alexandria, and in 1982 became a delegate. As a delegate, she has supported education and community based legislature to teach English as a second language, reduce class sizes and fund public schools with money from the lottery, and she has sought funding for the handicapped, homeless, and for poor families to obtain child care. Van Landingham was the first woman to chair the Privileges and Elections Committee, and served as chair of the transportation and public education subcommittees. She retired in 2005, leaving as Virginia's most senior female delegate and the 11th most senior member of the house. Mark Warner, who then served as Governor of Virginia, described her work in the house as being \\"the voice that would step up and argue for what was right,\\" in a conservative legislature, \\"even those that didn't agree with her views had a great respect for her.\\" Van Landingham was an elector for Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

FERM domains are found in a number of cytoskeletal-associated proteins that associate with various proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. The FERM domain is located at the N terminus in the majority of proteins in which it is found.  Structure and function  Ezrin, moesin, and radixin are highly related proteins (ERM protein family), but the other proteins in which the FERM domain is found do not share any region of similarity outside of this domain. ERM proteins are made of three domains, the FERM domain, a central helical domain and a C-terminal tail domain, which binds F-actin. The amino- acid sequence of the FERM domain is highly conserved among ERM proteins and is responsible for membrane association by direct binding to the cytoplasmic domain or tail of integral membrane proteins. ERM proteins are regulated by an intramolecular association of the FERM and C-terminal tail domains that masks their binding sites for other molecules. For cytoskeleton-membrane cross- linking, the dormant molecules becomes activated and the FERM domain attaches to the membrane by binding specific membrane proteins, while the last 34 residues of the tail bind actin filaments. Aside from binding to membranes, the activated FERM domain of ERM proteins can also bind the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of Rho GTPase (RhoDGI), which suggests that in addition to functioning as a cross-linker, ERM proteins may influence Rho signalling pathways. The crystal structure of the FERM domain reveals that it is composed of three structural modules (F1, F2, and F3) that together form a compact clover-shaped structure. The N-terminal module is ubiquitin-like. The C-terminal module is a PH-like domain. The FERM domain has also been called the amino-terminal domain, the 30kDa domain, 4.1N30, the membrane- cytoskeletal-linking domain, the ERM-like domain, the ezrin-like domain of the band 4.1 superfamily, the conserved N-terminal region, and the membrane attachment domain.  Examples  FERM domain containing proteins include: *Band 4.1, which links the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton of erythrocytes to the plasma membrane. *Ezrin, a component of the undercoat of the microvilli plasma membrane. *Moesin, which is probably involved in binding major cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane. *Radixin, which is involved in the binding of the barbed end of actin filaments to the plasma membrane in the undercoat of the cell-to-cell Adherens junction. *Talin, a cytoskeletal protein concentrated in regions of cell-substratum contact and, in lymphocytes, of cell-cell contacts. *Filopodin, a slime mould protein that binds actin and which is involved in the control of cell motility and chemotaxis. *Merlin (or schwannomin). *Protein NBL4. *Unconventional myosins X, VIIa and XV, which are mutated in congenital deafness. *Focal-adhesion kinases (FAKs), cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases involved in signalling through integrins. *Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs), cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are non-covalently associated with the cytoplasmic tails of receptors for cytokines or polypeptidic hormones. *Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2. *Protein- tyrosine phosphatases PTPN3 and PTPN4, enzymes that appear to act at junctions between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. *Protein-tyrosine phosphatases PTPN14 and PTP-D1, PTP-RL10 and PTP2E. * Caenorhabditis elegans protein phosphatase ptp-1.

Word of thunder), 168' in Leipzig for the ninth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 29 July 1725. Bach set a text by Salomo Franck, a librettist with whom he had worked in Weimar. The text, which Franck had published in 1715, uses the prescribed reading from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Unjust Steward, as a starting point for thoughts about the debt of sin and its \\"payment\\", using monetary terms. He concluded the text with a stanza from Bartholom√§us Ringwaldt's hymn \\"\\". Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it intimately, as he did for many of Franck's works, for four vocal parts, combined only in the chorale, two oboes d'amore, strings and basso continuo. It is the first new composition in his third year as ' in Leipzig.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the Ninth Sunday after Trinity as the first cantata of his third cantata cycle, being the first new composition in his third year as ' in Leipzig. The libretto is by Salomon Franck who was a court poet in Weimar. Bach had often set Franck's texts when he was Konzertmeister (concertmaster) there from 1714 to 1717. Franck published the text of in 1715 as part of the collection , and Bach would probably have used at the time had it not been for a period of mourning for Prince Johann Ernst of Saxe-Weimar. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans, a warning of false gods and consolation in temptation (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Unjust Steward (). Franck's text is closely related to the Gospel, beginning with a paraphrase of verse 2 in the opening aria. The situation of the unjust servant is generalized; he is seen wanting mountains and hills to fall on his back, as mentioned in . Franck uses explicit monetary terms to speak about the debt, such as \\"\\" (capital and interest). A turning point is reached in the fourth movement, referring to the death of Jesus which \\"crossed out the debt\\". The cantata is concluded by the eighth stanza of Bartholom√§us Ringwaldt's hymn \\"\\" (1588). Bach had treated the complete chorale a year before in his chorale cantata Herr Jesu Christ, du h√∂chstes Gut, BWV 113, for the eleventh Sunday after Trinity. Bach first performed the cantata on 29 July 1725.  Music  = Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it intimately, as he did for many of Franck's works. The singers consist of four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass) (B) plus a four-part choir only in the chorale. The instrumental parts are for two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo (Bc). The title of the autograph score reads: \\"9 post Trinit. / Thue Rechnung! Donner Wort / a / 4 Voci / 2 Hautb. d'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / di / J.S.Bach\\". The duration is given as 17 minutes. In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements =  1  The work opens with a bass aria, accompanied by the strings, \\"\\" (Settle account! Word of thunder). Christoph Wolff notes:  2  The recitative, \\"\\" (It is only an alien good) is the first movement with the full orchestra. The oboes first play long chords, but finally illustrate the text figuratively, speaking of toppling mountains and \\"the flash of His countenance\\". The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Bach's recitative is \\"both melodic and dramatic throughout\\", showing his familiarity with \\"the best contemporary operatic styles\\".  3  A tenor aria with the oboes in unison develops \\"\\" (Capital and interest). Klaus Hofmann calls the movement dance-like.  4  A secco recitative for bass demands: \\"\\" (Nevertheless, terrified heart, live and do not despair!).  5  A duet of the upper voices, only accompanied by the continuo, reflects \\"\\" (Heart, rend the chains of Mammon). Hofmann notes the dotted rhythm of the dance Canarie to the often canonic imitation of the voices. The word \\"zerrei√ü\\" (tear asunder) is depicted by a rest afterwards. The fetters (Kette) are illustrated with \\"slurred coloraturas\\", the term \\"Sterbebett\\" (deathbed) appears in \\"darkening of the harmony.\\"  6  The closing chorale, \\"\\" (Strengthen me with Your joyful Spirit), is a four-part setting.

The storms occurred over the span of a few weeks, beginning on 25 July 2011 in the North Island and subsequently spreading to the South. The storms subsided in late July and returned in August. It was the worst winter storm to hit New Zealand in seventy years. The heavy snowfalls caused widespread closures in many cities, including Christchurch, Wellington and Dunedin. The South Island was the hardest hit, although the North Island was significantly affected, with the climatically mild cities of Auckland and Wellington reporting the first notable snowfall in over twenty years. The storms caused chaos around the country, leaving people stranded at airports, blocking state highways and resulting in entire regions, particularly Canterbury and Otago, being completely closed. The initial storm of July was relatively short lived, only to return again in August. The winter storm also caused mixed precipitation. The snowfall was caused by Antarctic storms which moved northward. A large high pressure system had developed and stretched from Antarctica to the subtropics, where it had then merged with three neighbouring low pressure systems, causing cold temperatures and heavy snowfall. 25 July 2011 Woolston. On 25 July 2011, New Zealand was gripped by its coldest winter snap in fifteen years. The lowest temperature set during the month was at Manapouri (in the southwest corner of the South Island) on 26 July, which was a new all-time record for the town. Christchurch Airport recorded its second-coldest day on 25 July. The severe winter storm was well predicted, with forecasters warning of the potential of heavy snow down to sea level in south and east of the South Island and to low levels in the North Island. This snowstorm was especially threatening as it was the school holidays, and many people were travelling. Up to of snow was recorded in parts of Christchurch, the heaviest recorded there in sixteen years. The snowfalls also flattened sand dunes in Brighton and completely coated nearby Sumner Beach 1,700 homes within the Christchurch metropolitan area were without power. The city's bus service was also shut down for almost two days. Various highways were closed, including parts of State Highway 1 between Invercargill and Dunedin and State Highway 94, the road from Te Anau into Milford Sound. The storms lasted for roughly three days, before subsiding and returning early in the following month. 14 August 2011 Snow-covered Dunedin Botanic Gardens on 14 August A few days prior to this date, forecasters were warning of a severe snowstorm heading for New Zealand, even going as far as calling it the \\"perfect snowstorm\\". Snow fell consistently down to sea level in Wellington for the first time since the 1976, and snow even fell for a brief time in Auckland for the first time in 80 years. Much of the South Island was heavily blanketed, with schools closed in Queenstown, Dunedin, and Christchurch. The heavy snow also disrupted flights in and out of these centres, and also in and out of Wellington. Schools were also closed there due to the snow. Power was also lost to around 4,000 homes in South Taranaki, Manawatu, Whanganui, and Wairarapa. The storms caused airport closures in Christchurch, Queenstown and Dunedin. The Christchurch and Dunedin Donor Centres were closed and Westport and Mosgiel mobile collections were cancelled as a result of bad weather. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) closed access to the Christchurch's earthquake-damaged red zone due to potential safety hazards. The snow caused power outages in rural areas of Canterbury, namely Rakaia, Westmelton, Leeston and Greendale due to fallen tree branches. Although Wellington received its largest snowfall in 30 years, the South Island received the most during the storms, with some regions receiving snowfall of up to 20‚Äì30 cm. The storms was reportedly the worst of its since 1939, when snow fell on the top of Maungawhau / Mount Eden and outer suburbs of Auckland, a city which does not generally receive any snowfall. Impact =Power outages= Many homes around the country were without power, due to trees falling on power lines. =Road closures= Widespread road closures occurred across the Otago region on the South Island. =Ski resorts= Many ski resorts were completely closed due to being covered in dangerous amounts of snow and damage to infrastructure.

Deming added that, although lead vocalist Pat DiNizio's \\"deep, moody tone\\" doesn't match Roger Daltrey's singing style, the songs suit \\"the dark, dramatic feel of DiNizio's instrument, and Babjak and Diken contribute lead vocals on a few tunes that demand something lighter\\". However, Deming concluded that the album is \\"little more than an oddity for Smithereens completists and Who fans obsessive enough to want every cover version of their favorite band's work. In short, this gets an A for effort but a C- for practical utility\\".

In this method, the rod is oriented perpendicular to the interface, and the force exerted on it is measured. Based on the work of Padday,Padday, J. F., Pitt, A. R., Pashley, R. M.,1974, \\"Menisci at a free liquid surface: surface tension from the maximum pull on a rod\\",J. Chem. Soc., Far. Trans. I, 71(10), 1919‚Äì1931 (1974) this method finds wide use in the preparation and monitoring of Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett films, ink & coating development, pharmaceutical screening, and academic research. Detailed description The du No√ºy Padday rod consists of a rod usually on the order of a few millimeters square making a small ring. The rod is often made from a composite metal material that may be roughened to ensure complete wetting at the interface. The rod is cleaned with water, alcohol and a flame or with strong acid to ensure complete removal of surfactants. The rod is attached to a scale or balance via a thin metal hook. The Padday method uses the maximum pull force method, i.e. the maximum force due to the surface tension is recorded as the probe is first immersed ca. one mm into the solution and then slowly withdrawn from the interface. The main forces acting on a probe are the buoyancy (due to the volume of liquid displaced by the probe) and the mass of the meniscus adhering to the probe. This is an old, reliable, and well-documented technique.Fischer, H., Gottschlich, R., Seelig, A., \\"Blood-Brain Barrier Permeation: Molecular Parameters Governing Passive Diffusion\\" J.Membrane Biol. 165, 201‚Äì211 (1998)Christian, S. D., Slage, A. R., Tucker, E. E., and Scamehorn, J. F., \\"Inverted Vertical Pull Surface Tension Method\\", Langmuir, 14(X), 3126‚Äì3128 (1998)Harkins, W. D., and Jordan H. F., \\"A method for the determination of surface and interfacial tension from the maximum pull on a ring\\", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 52(5), 1751‚Äì1772 (1930)Freud, B. B., and Freud H. Z., \\"A theory of the ring method for the determination of surface tension\\", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 52(5), 1772‚Äì1782 (1930) An important advantage of the maximum pull force technique is that the receding contact angle on the probe is effectively zero. The maximum pull force is obtained when the buoyancy force reaches its minimum, The surface tension measurement used in the Padday devices based on the du No√ºy ring/maximum pull force method is explained further here: The force acting on the probe can be divided into two components: : i) Buoyancy stemming from the volume displaced by the probe, and : ii) the mass of the meniscus of the liquid adhering to the probe. The latter is in equilibrium with the surface tension force, i.e. ::tau_p gamma cos theta = m_m g where :* tau_p is the perimeter of the probe, :* m_m is the surface tension and the weight of the meniscus under the probe. In the situation considered here the volume displaced by the probe is included in the meniscus. :* theta is the contact angle between the probe and the solution that is measured, and is negligible for the majority of solutions with Kibron‚Äôs probes. Thus, the force measured by the balance is given by ::F_p = m_m g + F_{buoyancy} = tau_pgamma + F_{buoyancy} where :* F_p is the force acting on the probe and :* F_{buoyancy} is the force due to buoyancy. At the point of detachment the volume of the probe immersed in the solution vanishes, and thus, also the buoyancy term. This is observed as a maximum in the force curve, which relates to the surface tension through ::gamma = frac{F_{max}}{tau_p} The above derivation holds for ideal conditions. Non- idealities, e.g. from defect probe shape, are partly compensated in the calibration routine using a solution with known surface tension. Advantages and practice Unlike a du No√ºy ring, no correction factors are required when calculating surface tensions. Due to its small size the rod can be used in high throughput instruments that use a 96-well plate to determine the surface tension. The small diameter of the rod allows its use in a small volume of liquid with 50 mul samples being used in some devices.Suomalainen, P., Johans, C., S√∂derlund, T., and Kinnunen P. K.J., ‚ÄúSurface Activity Profiling of Drugs Applied to the Prediction of Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability,‚Äù J. Med. Chem., 47(7), 1783‚Äì1788 (2004) In addition, the rod also allows use for the Wilhelmy method because the rod is not completely removed during measurements. For this the dynamic surface tension can be used for accurate determination of surface kinetics on a wide range of timescales. The Padday technique also offers low operator variance and does not need an anti- vibration table. This advantage over other devices allows the Padday devices to be used in the field easily. The rod when made of composite material is also less likely to bend and therefore cheaper than the more costly platinum rod offered in the du No√ºy method. In a typical experiment, the rod is lowered using a manual or automatic device to the surface being analyzed until a meniscus is formed, and then raised so that the bottom edge of the rod lies on the plane of the undisturbed surface. One disadvantage of this technique is that it can not bury the rod into the surface to measure interfacial tension between two liquids. Practical uses The practical uses of an instrument that uses a single probe are that it allows for the developing of a high throughput device. A high throughput surface tension device can be used for formulation in real time for understanding the penetration of drugs in the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB), understanding the solubility of drugs, development of a screen to test a drugs toxicity, determining the physicochemical properties of oxidized phospholipids, and development of new surfactant/polymers. = Penetration of drugs in the BBB = The physicochemical profiling of poorly soluble drug candidates performed using a HTS surface tension device. Allowed prediction of penetration through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. = Development of a screen to test a drugs toxicity = A correlation with drug-lipid-complexes were correlated with high-throughput surface tension device to predict phospholipidosis in particular cationic drugs. = Understanding the solubility of drugs = Drug solubility has previously been done by the shaker method. A 96-well high throughput device has allowed development of a new method to test drugs. = Oxidized Phospholipids = The physicochemical properties of oxidized lipids were characterized using a high throughput device. Since these oxidized lipids are expensive and only available in small quantities a surface tension device requiring only a small amount of volume is better. = Development of new surfactant/polymers = The surface tension profiles of the branched copolymers solutions were performed using a HTS surface tensiometer as a function polymer concentration to produce pH-triggered aggregation emulsion droplets.

It belongs to the South-West Bohemian group of Czech dialects, but it is more different from the other dialects in this group. The speakers of the dialect have traditionally been called the Chods (Czech: Chodov√©). The Chod dialect is among the most well-preserved regional dialects in the Czech Republic. Features * d changes into r between vowels: standard Czech dƒõdek > dƒõrek, \\"old man\\". * prothetic h before some vowels, especially u: hu≈æ (standard Czech u≈æ, \\"already\\"), huk√°zat (standard Czech: uk√°zat, \\"to show\\").

Today the \\"bul\\" forms are rarely heard, though the vowel sound in these forms is often still reduced or omitted. * Possessive forms of animate nouns (otc≈Øv, matƒçin) have only one form, otcovo / matƒçino, regardless of case, gender or number. * The ending -ovi to denote \\"the family of...\\" is -ouc in the Chod dialect (Nov√°kovi > Nov√°kouc, \\"the Nov√°ks\\"). * Plural nouns in the dative case all have the ending -om (as opposed to standard Czech -≈Øm or -√°m). * The cluster kd in pronouns and adverbs (such as kdo, kdy≈æ) is realised as hd (hdo, hdy≈æ). Diachronic development A 1976 study by Jaroslav Vor√°ƒç showed that among younger speakers with varying academic qualifications, the only features listed above which are still retained fully are the lack of declension in possessives, the -ouc ending for families, and the long vowels in n√°≈°e and v√°≈°e. All other defining grammatical and phonological features in the dialect were by that time largely restricted to the older generation. Folklore and literature Monument to Jind≈ôich ≈†imon Baar in Doma≈ælice The music and folklore of the Chodsko region gave the dialect a literary presence. Chod folk music was collected and archived by the folklorist Jind≈ôich Jind≈ôich, while the author Jind≈ôich ≈†imon Baar published Chodsk√© pov√≠dky a poh√°dky (Chod stories and tales) in 1922. The local culture of the region also influenced other writers including Alois Jir√°sek with his novel Psohlavci, in which most of the dialogue is in the Chod dialect.

Playlouder.com claimed that \\"North Sea Radio Orchestra splash colour into every corner of the speakers with a regal splendour and effervescent celebration of God, Nature or whatever it is you may wish to call it.\\"Playlouder.com review of NSRO debut album , retrieved 20 October 2008 In the underground press, Art Rocker praised the NSRO for \\"doing something really quite special.....in their ability to ebb and sway and permeate through styles without erring away from the constant series of lush orchestrations\\", and hailed the record as \\"the most beautiful album of the year‚Ä¶ could surely sway even the most ardent distortion-pedal freak to step back and open their minds and hearts to this.\\" Foggy Notions called it \\"an everchanging trip, blooming with melody and twinkling beauty from start to finish\\". Subba Cultcha commented that the ensemble‚Äôs music was \\"stepping easily between genres, sometimes classical, sometimes indie; inspired and compelling and often magical, like the soundtrack to a film that hasn‚Äôt been made yet. It‚Äôs a thoughtful, melodic and calming record that is sure to attract fans way beyond its classical base.\\" A review in Boomkat, while drawing attention to the NSRO‚Äôs \\"idiosyncratic bombast\\", \\"cartoonishly baroque melodies\\" and \\"unbridled eccentricity\\", praised the orchestra's \\"considerable performance skills and elegant arrangements\\", and concluded that the album was \\"a fairly surreal experience all round\\".Boomkat review , retrieved 20 October 2008  Track listing  All music written by Craig Fortnam except where noted: all arrangements by Craig Fortnam.

Commenting on the case, CAUT's representative Jim Turk claimed that the tribunal's process was fatally flawed and added: \\"This was a staged trial ordered by the university under rules that violated every concept of natural justice in this country‚Ä¶It had some of the character of a show trial, except it was in secret.\\" For instance, none of the three academics on the panel had any training in law and the University's policies allowed no right of appeal, leaving an application for judicial review as the only available response..

Siwan is the main railway station of this village. History This village has a history of two princes Hari Singh and Hans Singh. These two princes were the King of Cheeroo dynasty and were living majestically. They had built a strong forte, Long Deep trench of water canals were constructed in the East called jamunia and in the North Barracks were made for protection. There was a thick dangerous forest on the west inhabited by lions and other beasts which served the natural protecting boundary for the forte. This was the ruling era of Feroz Shah Tughlaq. They were given Jagirs of 52 villages by Delhi King. So they tried to expand their area and annexed the villages of weaker Rajas and Tallukdars. Their men also became independent and started looting and plunder of agricultural crops in their neighborhood. On receipt of intelligence information about the area, the king reprimanded several times to the Raja Hari Singh & Hans Singh but they did not change their attitude and neither could control their man to stop their misdeeds. When reports against them continued despite of several serious warning, the king decided to change the management of the state run by Hari Singh & Hans Singh.http://panchayatdirectory.gov.in/adminreps/viewGPmapcvills.asp?gpcode=245353&rlbtype;=V Rulers Sheikh Azimullah Siddiqui a.k.a. Shaikh Pahar (Mountain) arrived in Delhi from Hijaz with his family in 744 AH 1325 AD in search of better opportunities, on the request of Syed Mohammad Ibrahim Saheb alias Syed Saheb while Syed Saheb met Sheikh Saheb during his previous Hajj pilgrimage in Makkah. That was the time when the raja (A prince, chief, or ruler in India) of Sheeroo Dynasty was disobeying the authority of King of Delhi, King Feroz Shah Tughlaq. When King Feroz Shah ascended the throne in 752 AH 1351 AD, Sheikh Pahar was well known as a man of sword with Arab blood, a warrior and a strategist. When the King came to know the extraordinary qualities of Sheikh Pahar, he awarded the Hari Sing & Hans Singh District to Sheikh Saheb through an edict or decree in 762 AH/1362 AD. Further the king wrote to Raja of Majhauli to arrest Hari Singh & Hans Singh and present them in Delhi Court with the help of Sheikh Pahar. Raja Majhauli sent his commander with his army along with the royal forces under the command of Sheikh Pahar to dislodge the Talukdars (Landholders) of Harihans Taluka (District). The Caravan headed towards the fort of Hari Singh and dislodged Hari Singh & Hans Singh after a fierce fighting and Sheikh Azimullah was recognized as the new Landholder of Harihans village in addition with the administration of 52 neighbouring villages. The present residents of village Harihans are the descendants of Shah Imam Jafri And Zafri.

It catalyzes the following reaction: ::: 2 reduced ferredoxin + thioredoxin disulfide rightleftharpoons 2 oxidized ferredoxin + thioredoxin thiols + 2 H+ Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin reductase (FTR) converts an electron signal (photoreduced ferredoxin) to a thiol signal (reduced thioredoxin), regulating enzymes by reduction of specific disulfide groups. It catalyses the light-dependent activation of several photosynthesis enzymes and constitutes the first historical example of a thiol/disulfide exchange cascade for enzyme regulation. It is a heterodimer of subunit alpha and subunit beta. Subunit alpha is the variable subunit, and beta is the catalytic chain. The structure of the beta subunit has been determined and found to fold around the FeS cluster. Biological Function Major groups of oxygen-producing, photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, C4, C3, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants use Ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase for carbon fixation regulation. FTR, as part of a greater Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin system, allows plants to change their metabolism based on light intensity. Specifically, the Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin system controls enzymes in the Calvin Cycle and Pentose phosphate pathway - allowing plants to balance carbohydrate synthesis and degradation based on the availability of light. In the light, photosynthesis harnesses light energy and reduces Ferredoxin. Using FTR, reduced Ferredoxin then reduces Thioredoxin. Thioredoxin, through thiol/disulfide exchange, then activates carbohydrate synthesis enzymes such as chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase, and phosphoribulokinase. As a result, light uses FTR to activate carbohydrate biosynthesis. In the dark, Ferredoxin remains oxidized. This leaves Thioredoxin inactive and allows carbohydrate breakdown to dominate metabolism. Structure Ferredoxin-Thioredoxin Reductase is an Œ±-Œ≤ heterodimer of approximately 30 kDa. FTR structure across different plant species include a conserved catalytic Œ≤ subunit and a variable Œ± subunit. The structure of FTR from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has been studied in detail and resolved at 1.6 √Ö. FTR resembles a thin concave disc, 10 √Ö across the center where a [4Fe-4S cluster] resides. One side of the cluster center contains redox-active disulfide bonds that reduce Thioredoxin while the opposite docks with reduced Ferredoxin. This two sided disc structure allows FTR to simultaneously interact with Thioredoxin and Ferredoxin. [4Fe-4S] cluster in the Ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase catalytic Œ≤ subunit is surrounded by several Cysteine residues. The variable Œ± subunit has an open Œ≤ barrel structure made of five antiparallel Œ≤ strands. Its interaction with the catalytic subunit occurs mainly with two loops between Œ≤ strands. The residues in these two loops are mostly conserved and are thought to stabilize the 4Fe-4S cluster in the catalytic subunit. Structurally, the Œ± subunit is very similar to the PsaE protein, a subunit of Photosystem I, though the similarity is not seen in their sequences or functions. The catalytic Œ≤ subunit has a general Œ±-helical structure with an [4Fe-4S center]. The FeS center and redox- active Cysteine residues are located within the loops of these helices. Cysteine-55, 74, 76, and 85 are coordinated to the iron atoms of the cubane- type cluster. Enzymatic Mechanism FTR is unique among thioredoxin reductases because it uses an Fe-S cluster cofactor rather than flavoproteins to reduce disulfide bonds. FTR catalysis begins with its interaction with reduced Ferredoxin. This proceeds with the attraction between FTR Lys-47 and Ferredoxin Glu-92. One electron from Ferredoxin and one electron from the Fe-S center is abstracted to break FTR's Cys-87 and Cys-57 disulfide bond, create a nucleophilic Cys-57, and oxidize the Fe-S center from [4Fe-4S]2+ to [4Fe-4S]3+. The structure of this one-electron (from Ferredoxin) intermediate is contested: Staples et al. suggest Cys-87 is coordinated to a Sulfur in the Fe-S center while Dai et al. argue Cys-87 is coordinated to an Iron. Next, the nucleophilic Cys-57, encouraged by an adjacent Histidine residue, attacks a disulfide bridge on Thioredoxin, creating a hetero-disulfide Thioredoxin intermediate. Lastly, a newly docked Ferredoxin molecule delivers the final electron to the FeS center, reducing it to its original 2+ state, reforming the Cys-87, Cys-57 disulfide, and fully reducing thioredoxin to two thiols.

The site of the attack was chosen in order to cause a maximum number of casualties. Seven people were killed in the attack, and 35 were injured. The Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack took place only a day after the deadliest bombing attack in Jerusalem in six years occurred, in which a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 19 people on a crowded bus in southern Jerusalem. According to the Daily Telegraph, both of the attacks were timed to disrupt an expected announcement by U.S. President George W. Bush regarding a future Palestinian state, and Bush did in fact delay his speech.  The attack  On Wednesday, shortly after 7:05 pm, a Palestinian suicide bomber got out of a red Audi vehicle next to a bus station in Jerusalem's French Hill neighborhood. Because the bus stop had been targeted by assailants in the past, the bus stop was heavily guarded.Eyewitness: Jerusalem bus blast 19 June 2002, BBC Two Border Police patrolmen, who were securing the site, chased the suspect to try to stop him, but the suicide bomber managed to run past them◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ 2 - ◊õ◊ï◊™◊®◊ï◊™ ◊î◊¢◊ë◊®: ◊§◊ô◊í◊ï◊¢ ◊î◊™◊ê◊ë◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô-◊ù straight into the middle of a crowd of people waiting for the bus in one of the busiest bus stops in Israel. The suicide bomber detonated the explosive device that he was holding in a bag, killing seven people. About 50 additional people were injured from the force of the blast and by shrapnel that was packed around the explosive device. Eight of the wounded sustained severe injuries. The force of the blast completely destroyed the bus station, which was made of concrete, and many body parts were scattered over a large area throughout the street near the bus station. Later, a bulldozer dismantled what was left of the concrete bus station. The two Border Police patrolmen at the scene were wounded in the attack, one of them seriously.  The perpetrators  Shortly after the attack, the Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which publicly identifies itself as the military wing of Fatah (led at the time by Yasser Arafat), claimed responsibility for the attack during a broadcast on Lebanese television.  Aftermath  According to the Daily Telegraph, both attacks carried out in Jerusalem on the 18th and 19 June 2002 were timed to disrupt an expected announcement by U.S. President George W. Bush regarding a future Palestinian state, provided that the Palestinian Authority first met a series of strict conditions. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated that Bush would delay the plan as such, because \\"It's obvious that the immediate aftermath is not the right time.\\" = Israeli response = In response to the attack, three hours after the attack took place, Israeli Air Force helicopters fired rockets at metal workshops in the Gaza Strip which were used to manufacture weapons. According to Reuters, at least five rockets were shot in Gaza City and Khan Yunis.  Official reactions  ;Involved parties : * Israeli government spokesman Arye Mekel referred to the attack, noting that \\"It is another carnage, another brutal attack on innocent people who were standing, waiting for a bus\\". : * The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. An official statement issued said, the PA \\"reiterates its condemnation and denunciation\\" of \\"all operations against Israeli civilians.\\" * Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat released a statement after the attack, which he wrote in Arabic, in which he called on Palestinians to completely stop attacks against Israelis, noting that \\"Targeting civilians, whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, is a deplorable act\\" and noting that these attacks are not a \\"legitimate resistance\\" to Israeli occupation and that Israel uses them as an excuse to invade the Palestinian territories.

The N-terminal regions of these sequences are less conserved than the C-terminal regions, and are highly acidic. The Caenorhabditis elegans homologue, UNC-76, may play structural and signalling roles in the control of axonal extension and adhesion (particularly in the presence of adjacent neuronal cells) and these roles have also been postulated for other FEZ family proteins. Certain homologues have been definitively found to interact with the N-terminal variable region (V1) of PKC-zeta, and this interaction causes cytoplasmic translocation of the FEZ family protein in mammalian neuronal cells. The C-terminal region probably participates in the association with the regulatory domain of PKC-zeta. The members of this family are predicted to form coiled- coil structures which may interact with members of the RhoA family of signalling proteins, but are not thought to contain other characteristic protein motifs.

Life Erskine was born at Dryburgh, in the parish of Mertoun, Berwickshire, one of the younger sons of Ralph Erskine of Shielfield, a cadet of the family of the Earl of Mar. Henry was brought up under the ministry of Mr. Simpson, minister of Dryburgh. Erskine's first charge was at Cornhill-on- Tweed, in Northumberland. According to Robert Wodrow he was ordained in 1649, but according to others this occurred ten years later. From this charge he was ejected by the Act of Uniformity 1662. The revenues of his charge not having been paid to him, he went to London to petition the king; but after a delay he was told that unless he would conform he should have nothing. On his voyage home he was driven by a storm into Harwich, and preached there. But his wife could not be prevailed on to settle in the town. On leaving Cornhill Erskine went to Dryburgh, where he lived in a house of his brother's. From time to time he exercised his ministry in a quiet way, till arousing the suspicion of Urquhart of Meldrum, one of those soldiers who scoured the country to put down conventicles, he was summoned to appear before a committee of privy council. Being asked by Sir George Mackenzie, Lord Advocate, whether he would engage to preach no more in conventicles, he refused. He was ordered to pay a fine, and to be imprisoned on the Bass Rock till he should pay the fine and promise to preach no more. Being in poor health he petitioned that the sentence might be changed to banishment from the kingdom. This was allowed, and he settled first at Parkridge, near Carlisle, and then at Monilaws, near Cornhill, where his son Ralph was born. Apprehended again, Erskine was imprisoned at Newcastle, but after his release in 1685 the king's indulgence (1687) enabled him to continue his ministry without molestation. He preached at Whitsome, near Berwick, and after the revolution was admitted minister of Chirnside, where he died in 1696, at the age of 72. It is said that when he could not give his children a dinner he would give them a tune on his zither. Thomas Boston of Ettrick testified to the profound impression made on him in his boyhood by hearing Erskine preach at Whitsome. Family Erskine was twice married: first, in 1653, to a lady of whom little is known, and again to Margaret Halcro, a descendant of an old family in Orkney. His two distinguished sons, Ralph and Ebenezer, were children of the second marriage.

Background Erskine was the eldest son of David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross, by his first wife, Anne, who was fifth daughter of Sir Thomas Hope, king's advocate. The title of Lord Cardross was originally conferred on the first Earl of Mar, and, in accordance with the right with which he was invested of conferring it on any of his heirs male, it was granted by him to his second son Henry, along with the barony of Cardross. By his father young Erskine had been educated in the principles of the covenanters, and at an early period distinguished himself by his opposition to the administration of Lauderdale. In this he was strongly supported by his wife, Catherine, youngest of the two daughters and coheiresses of Sir William Stewart of Kirkhill. On account of his wife's determination to have a Presbyterian chaplain to perform worship in her own house he was fined 4,000l. of which he paid 1,000l., and after an attempt to obtain a remission for the balance he was, 5 August 1675, committed to the prison of Edinburgh, where he remained for four years. In May of the same year, when, during his absence in Edinburgh, conventicles were being held near Cardross, a party of guards in search of a covenanter named John King entered his house at midnight, broke into his chests, and after acting with great rudeness towards his wife placed a guard on it. Complaints To The King Their complaints that the conventicles then being held had his encouragement were the chief causes why his fine was not relaxed. On 7 Aug. 1677, while still in prison, he was fined in one half of his rent for permitting his two children to be christened by unlicensed ministers. In 1679 the king's forces in their march westwards went two miles out of their way to quarter on his estates of Kirkhill and Uphall, West Lothian. He obtained his release from prison, 30 July of that year, on giving bond for the amount of his fine, and early next year went to London, where he laid before the king a narrative of the sufferings to which he had been exposed. This proceeding gave great offense to the Scottish privy council, who sent a letter to the king accusing Cardross of misrepresentation, the result being that all redress was denied him. Thereupon he emigrated to North America, where he established a plantation at Charlestown Neck, South Carolina. On 28 October 1685 his estate in Scotland was exposed to sale by public roup, and was bought by the Earl of Mar at seventeen years' purchase. Cardross, having been driven from the settlement in Carolina by the Spaniards, went to Holland, and in 1688 he accompanied the Prince of Orange to England. In the following year he raised a regiment of dragoons and served under General Mackay against Dundee. An act was passed restoring him to his estates, and he was also sworn a privy councilor and constituted general of the mint. In July 1689 the Duke of Hamilton, the king's commissioner, at a meeting of the council, fell ‚Äòwith great violence‚Äô on Lord Cardross, asserting that it was by his dragoons that the episcopal minister of Logie had been prevented from entering his church; but Cardross denied all knowledge of anything asserted to have happened. Service Of The King Cardross was engaged in the Battle of Killiecrankie, of which he sent an account to Lord Melville in a letter of 30 July. When the Duke of Hamilton proposed a new oath to the council, Cardross objected to it as contrary to the instrument of government, and also ‚Äòbecause the maner of swering by the Bible is nether the Scottish nor the Presbiterian forme, and seems to raise the Bible as more than God‚Äô. In the instructions sent by King William on 18 Dec. 1689 to ‚Äòmodel three troops of dragoons,‚Äô Cardross was proposed as lieutenant-colonel and captain of the first troop. In 1690 he was appointed one of a commission to examine into the condition of the universities. In October 1691 he went to London along with the Earl of Crawford to support the proceedings of the Scotch council against the episcopalians. He died at Edinburgh on 21 May 1693. He had four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, David Erskine, 4th Lord Cardross, succeeded to the earldom of Buchan in 1695. Family His granddaughter Katherine Erskine, married Gilbert Laurie of Polmont (1729-1809), twice Lord Provost of Edinburgh.http://www.thepeerage.com/p52421.htm#i524204 References 1650 births 1693 deaths Members of the Convention of the Estates of Scotland 1689 Henry ","title":"Henry Erskine, 3rd Lord Cardross"},{"id":"32753577","text":"Azygophleps simplex is a moth in the family Cossidae found in Nigeria.
