Toxicity  It took considerable time before it was recognised as the plant which gave horses the \\"Birdsville\\" disease (a disease of horses in arid and semi-arid Australia), with the causal agent being suspected by Everist as being indospicenePubChem:Compound Summary for CID 108010 Indospicine. Retrieved 20 November 2018. or possibly cavananine. However, current research indicates that the neurotoxic effects on horses with Birdsville disease are due to the neurotoxin 3 nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), with horses less susceptible than cattle to the hepatotoxic effects of indospicene. The neurotoxic effect on horses generally occurs just after the rains, because I. linneai responds more quickly to moisture than other species. Nonetheless, Indospicine accumulates in the tissues of grazing livestock after ingestion of Indigofera, causing both liver degeneration and abortion across animal species but the degree varies considerably between species. The magnitude of sensitivity in dogs is such that consumption of indospicine-contaminated horse and camel meat has caused secondary poisoning of dogs. Livestock grazing Indigofera have a chronic and cumulative exposure to this toxin, with such exposure experimentally shown to induce both hepatotoxicity and embryo-lethal effects in cattle and sheep.

NASA has been stricter about alcohol consumption than the Roscosmos, both according to regulations and in practice. Astronauts and cosmonauts are restricted from being intoxicated at launch. Despite restrictions on consumption, there have been experiments in making and keeping alcoholic drinks in space. Drinking in space The effects of alcohol on human physiology in microgravity have not been researched, though because medications can differ in their effects NASA expects that the effects of alcohol will also differ. Beer and other carbonated drinks are not suitable for spaceflight as the bubbles cause 'wet burps'; also, a foamy head cannot form as the bubbles do not rise. =United States= On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin drank some wine when he took communion while on the Moon in the Lunar Module Eagle. The ceremony was not broadcast following earlier protests against religious activity that were perceived to breach the separation between church and state. In the 1970s, NASA's Charles Bourland planned to send sherry with the astronauts visiting Skylab, but the idea was scrapped because the smell was found to induce a gag reflex in zero-gravity flight tests, there was ambivalence among the astronauts, and angry letters were received after plans were discussed in public by Gerry Carr. Alcohol is prohibited aboard the International Space Station due to the impact it can have on the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). A 1985 NASA report on extended spaceflight predicted that alcohol would be missed, but would only become common in stable settlements. = Russia = The Russian state media Russia Beyond says drinking has been officially banned, but the first alcoholic drink sent into space by cosmonauts was a bottle of cognac, to the Salyut 7 in 1984. Cosmonaut Igor Volk said they would lose weight and hide alcohol in their spacesuits or hide bottles inside book covers, and Georgy Grechko discussed the difficulties of drinking in space as the liquid and air would mix to form froth. Cosmonauts aboard Mir were allowed alcoholic drinks including cognac, vodka, and \\"ginseng liquer\\", supposedly for health reasons, according to comments made by former cosmonaut Alexander Lazutkin to the Interfax news agency in 2010. Cosmonaut Alexander Poleshchuk said bottles of cognac would be hidden behind panels on Mir. American astronauts on Mir watched while their Russian colleagues drank; NASA tried to block the release of photographs of a 1997 \\"cognac party\\" onboard Mir, but James Oberg of NBC News obtained them via a freedom of information request. In 2006, the ban on cosmonauts drinking on the International Space Station (ISS) was proposed to be lifted, though champagne was still regarded as too dangerous. Crew care packages cannot contain any alcohol, even in aftershave or mouthwash. Pre- flight In July 2007, following a scandal in which astronauts were alleged to have flown while drunk, NASA admitted that its rules around alcohol were vague and introduced a new rule prohibiting astronauts from being 'under the influence' and consuming alcohol within 12 hours of launch, based on the rules for T-38 training jets. Alcohol industry A 3D-printed plastic whisky glass was designed for spaceflight in 2015, and whisky was sent to the ISS for four years to study the effect on its flavor. One beer company sponsored a graduate student's research into brewing beer in space, and in 2017 another planned to sponsor research on the ISS with the aim of serving beer on Mars. Making alcohol in space would be difficult, for example conventional distillation would be impossible in zero gravity and the volumes of liquid required are high.

This distinctive morphology has resulted in several unique forms of locomotion. Most Batoids exhibit median paired fin swimming, utilizing their enlarged pectoral fins. Batoids that exhibit median paired fin swimming fall somewhere along a spectrum of swimming modes from mobuliform to rajiform based on the number of waves present on their fin at once. Of the four orders of Batoidae this holds truest for the Myliobatiformes (rays) and the Rajiformes (skates). The two other orders: Rhinopristiformes and Torpediniformes exhibit a greater degree of body caudal fin swimming.  Mobuliform swimming  A manta ray executing several different turns. By varying the shape of its fins asymmetrically it is able to be quite maneuverable for its size and rigidity. Mobuliform swimming is common in pelagic Myliobatiformes species such as manta rays and is characterized by a flapping motion of the pectoral fins. It is very similar in appearance to flight in birds. Batoids that utilize mobuliform swimming can be identified by their high aspect ratios, thicker pectoral fins that taper to a point and a lateral profile that resembles a hydrofoil. They are highly efficient open water swimmers capable of traversing great distances at high speeds. The pectoral fins of a mobuliform swimming ray experience a spanwise dorsoventral deformation that is highest at the tip and a chord-wise traveling wave. Kinematically mobuliform swimming consists of low frequency, high amplitude fin flapping. with less than one waveform present on the fin at a time. In order to increase speed pelagic rays will increase the frequency of pectoral flaps. Rays are at a disadvantage compared to other fish when it comes to maneuverability. Their rigid body gives them a high moment of inertia and their dorsoventrally flattened shape makes it difficult to maintain turns because they are unable to provide the lateral forces necessary to prevent slip. Banking during a turn has been exhibited across both types of median paired fin swimming and it allows them to compensate for the lack of control surface that they would have in an unbanked turn. Mobuliform swimmers tend to be just as maneuverable as rajiform swimmers, even though their turning mechanics are different; the former move with gliding turns while the latter move through asymmetrical undulations of the fins. However, some species like the Pelagic Stingray are more maneuverable because they are able to reverse the wave along their fins and even swim backwards. In a pelagic environment rays will encounter surface waves. Experimental interactions with incoming waves for Cownose rays has shown that rays will cease swimming and form a positive dihedral with their pectoral fins allowing them to maintain their position in the water column. When travelling in the same direction of a wave it has been shown that they will increase their speed while reducing the amplitude of their fins which indicates that they may use travelling waves to increase their swimming efficiency.  Rajiform swimming  An example of a rajiform myliobatoid. Notice that the movement is restricted to the distal part of the fin unlike mobuliform swimming. Rajiform swimmers move by undulating the distal parts of their pectoral fins with multiple waveforms present on the fin at a time. This mode of swimming is utilized by demersal Batoids, which includes skates as well as some rays. They share a common morphology of a low aspect ratio and thin pelvic fins. They are slower than mobuliform swimmers but they are some of the most metabolically efficient elasmobranch swimmers at slow speeds. There are differences between the ways skates and benthic rays utilize rajiform swimming. Rajiformes do not always utilize rajiform swimming. They have a second set of pelvic fins called crura on the ventral side near the base of their tale that they use to in tandem to push along the substrate while their disk remains inactive. This style of locomotion is known as punting and is very similar to walking as the force appears to be generated from direct contact with the ground. They are able to execute asynchronous movements with their crura to make turns which negates the need to bank during turns, which may provide stealth benefits in addition to the reduced water movement. From muscle fiber analysis it appears that punting may be a primary mode of transportation at low speeds (about 1/3 Body lengths per second) in some skates and rajiform locomotion may be used when for specific situations. Benthic rays rely entirely on rajiform locomotion. Another difference between the two is the role of the tail. Skates have larger tails with fins on them and they use them during turns. The tails of rays appear to serve no function in swimming. Some rays, known as stingrays have a venomous barb on their tail that they whip around to defend themselves. The distribution of pectoral thin thickness is such that rajiform swimmers benefit passively from hydrodynamic interaction between the substrate and their fins. As such swimming away from the substrate for extended periods is unsustainable. The thickness of the pelvic fins is highest at the anterior part of fin and lowest at the distal parts of the fin and the posterior fin, generally less than a millimeter. These thinner areas deform passively at normal speeds and must be kept rigid at higher speeds serving to limit maximum sustainable speed in rajiform swimmers. Body caudal fin swimming=Torpediniformes= pacific electric ray (torpedo californica) The majority of electric rays have a distinctive style of low speed swimming that consists of periodically moving up in the water column then gliding back down. Unlike Rajiformes and Myliobatiformes their propulsion comes solely from the movement of their caudal fin, which is much more developed than in skates and rays. The disc portion of their bodies is used to increase their efficiency during the gliding portion of their swimming. =Rhinopristiformes= An example of a Rhinopristiform, the guitarfish relies on undulation of its caudal fin for propulsion Rhinopristiformes are an intermediate group between sharks and rays. There has been little study into their swimming characteristics but it can be assumed from their morphological similarity to sharks that they rely primarily on body caudal fin swimming and the pectoral fins do not generate thrust. Batoid inspired designs Batoids have certain characteristics that would be desirable in an underwater unmanned vehicle. The nature of their movement makes them stable platforms to carry payloads. They tend to be incredibly efficient swimmers many pelagic ray species and even some benthic species undertake very long yearly migrations. Pelagic species tend to be more efficient high speed swimmers while benthic ones are efficient at lower speeds. Many Benthic rays have adapted to be incredibly stealthy, they have a low profile and create very little disturbance when they move. They have the potential to generate large thrust; this is what allows giant manta rays to completely clear the surface of the water. The variations in performance capabilities of each species lead to the development of a variety of different biomimetic automated underwater vehicles (BAUVs). There are a multitude of designs based on pelagic and benthic batoids, there are even some based on more obscure aspects of batoid swimming such as one based on the unique body caudal fin propulsion of the electric ray or another that utilizes the punting seen in skates. One thing that really sets the performance of the biological and artificial versions apart is the nuanced flexibility and actuation of the disc. Different parts of the disc are considerably more flexible than others and some parts are designed to passively deform. It is especially hard to mimic the mixture of passive and active interactions of the disc of a rajiform and the ground. The complex actuation of the wings has been mimicked successfully through a variety of means including tensegrity structures, electroactive polymers, and fluid muscles. However, these technologies are not developed to the point where they can fully imitate actual muscles. To this aim, actual muscles have been used in a tissue engineered ray less than 20 mm in diameter. It was produced using rat myocardial cells that mimicked the pattern of a rajiform swimmer through the use of patterned muscle junctions.

During the 1880s he formed friendships with, amongst others, Lord Randolph Churchill, Charles Russell and Leopold Maxse. He campaigned for Irish Home Rule and was the private secretary to the poet and writer Wilfrid Blunt when he stood in the 1888 Deptford by-election. His writings caused the rift between his friends Oscar Wilde and James NcNeil Whistler. In the 1890s, Vivian was a leader of the Neo-Jacobite Revival, a monarchist movement which aimed to restore a member of the House of Stuart on the British throne, in place of the parliamentary system. In the decade before the First World War, he was a friend of Winston Churchill, and was the first journalist to interview Churchill. He stood, unsuccessfully, as the Liberal candidate for Deptford in 1906. Vivian was an extreme monarchist throughout his life, and in the 1920s he became a supporter of fascism. Vivian published several books, including the novel The Green Bay Tree with W. H. Wilkins. He was a prominent British Serbophile and his writings about the Balkans, notably Servia: The Poor Man's Paradise and The Servian Tragedy: With Some Impressions of Macedonia, remain influential.  Early life and education  Herbert Vivian was born on 3 April 1865 in Chichester, the only son of the Reverend Francis Henry and Margaret Vivian. He was baptised by his father on 11 May 1865 at the church of St. Peter the Great in Chichester. He had one sister, Margaret Cordelia Vivian. His grandfather John Vivian was the Liberal MP for Truro, and owned Pencalenick House in St Clement, Cornwall; Herbert recalled shooting his first rabbit there as a child. He always glossed over his grandfather's political role, for example, writing: \\"None of my immediate relatives have ever troubled their heads in politics...\\" in his newspaper The Whirlwind. Herbert studied at Harrow School from 1879 until 1883. When he was 14, he was introduced to an old friend of his father's, Thomas Hughes, the author of Tom Brown's School Days. The meeting had a strong impact on the young Vivian, who wrote about it later in his memoirs. In 1881, his grandfather introduced him to Thomas Bayley Potter, the member of parliament for Rochdale. Potter was impressed by Vivian and often took him into Parliament during his holidays. There Vivian met many of the MPs, and was particularly impressed by Charles Warton, the MP for Bridport. Potter also introduced him to Lord Randolph Churchill, who greatly inspired Vivian towards Tory democracy. Vivian exchanged letters with Lord Randolph during his school days and continued to correspond with him for many years afterwards. Vivian later became friends with his son, Winston Churchill. Vivian studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1886 with a degree in History, and subsequently being promoted to a Master of Arts. During his student years, Vivian and his friend Edward Goulding were the President and Vice-President respectively of the University Carlton Club and they invited Lord Randolph to become the club president. Never shy of using his connections, Vivian dropped Churchill's name to arrange a meeting in Vevey with Nubar Pasha, the first Prime Minister of Egypt. After spending several hours discussing politics with Pasha, he returned to London and reported his conversation to Churchill. Churchill introduced Vivian to Charles Russell--who later became Baron Russell of Killowen and the Lord Chief Justice of England--and the two became friends. Around 1882, Vivian attended a lecture given by Oscar Wilde at which James NcNeil Whistler was also present and which Vivian would later write about . At Cambridge, Vivian struck up friendships with students who would go on to be prominent politicians and businessmen. Austen Chamberlain was involved in Cambridge Union politics when Vivian arrived, and the two bonded over a shared interest in Radicalism. He was a close friend of Leopold Maxse--later the editor of the National Review. Another friend was Ernest Debenham, who went on to lead the family business Debenhams to its greatest commercial success. Vivian recalled Debenham overdosing on hashish during his experiments in Buddhism at Cambridge.  Private secretary to Wilfrid Blunt  Vivian and Chamberlain organised speaking events at the Union. In 1886, they invited the English anti-imperialist writer and poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt to speak on the subject of Irish Home Rule, and Vivian and Blunt became friends. Later that year, Vivian visited Blunt at his home, Crabbet Park and accepted a position as Blunt's private secretary. Vivian spent most of his weekends at Crabbet during his final year of studies, and continued to work for Blunt after he graduated. During this employment he met influential politicians, as Blunt prepared to stand for Parliament. Amongst those that Vivian established a relationship with was Anglo-French historian Hilaire Belloc. Blunt was a cousin of Lord Alfred Douglas and was a friend of Oscar Wilde's. 1887 saw Blunt becoming more vociferous in favour of Irish Home Rule. In November, Lord Randolph wrote to Vivian advising him to distance himself from Blunt, advice Vivian did not take. At this time, Blunt was also developing his interest in the Jacobite cause - the restoration of the House of Stuart to the British throne - which Vivian was to develop a passion for during his life. In late 1887, Vivian left the Conservative Party and joined the Home Rule Union between the Liberal Party and the Irish Parliamentary Party. At the end of the year, he toured Ireland with the leading Irish politician Michael Davitt and Bradford Central MP George Shaw-Lefevre. Shortly after Vivian returned from Ireland he met with the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party Charles Stewart Parnell and then with the MP for East Mayo, John Dillon. In October 1887, Blunt gave a speech at a meeting in Woodford, County Galway protesting against the mass evictions of tenant families. The meeting had been banned by Arthur Balfour, the Chief Secretary for Ireland and Blunt was arrested, tried and imprisoned. While Blunt was serving his sentence in Dublin, Vivian worked closely with William John Evelyn to promote Blunt in the February 1888 Deptford by-election--which had been caused by Evelyn's resignation as the Conservative MP. Blunt lost the by-election by 275 votes. Despite this loss, in March 1888, Blunt and Vivian were approached by a committee from Parnell's Irish National League, asking Blunt to stand as their candidate for Deptford at the next general election, but by the time the election was called in 1892, Blunt's enthusiasms had moved on. For a while, Vivian contributed to Evelyn's Abinger Monthly Record, a magazine that Vivian later described as \\"[in] part... really scurrilous attacks on the Vicar\\". The Vicar was the Reverend T.P. Hill, the incumbent of Abinger who had fallen out with Evelyn. The Record was also noted for its campaign against compulsory vaccinations and its support of Irish Home Rule.  Oscar Wilde  During the late 1880s, Vivian was a friend of Oscar Wilde, and they dined together on several occasions. It was at one of these dinners that Vivian claimed he witnessed a famous exchange between Wilde and James NcNeill Whistler. Whistler said a bon mot that Wilde found particularly witty, Wilde exclaimed that he wished that he had said it, and Whistler retorted \\"You will, Oscar, you will\\". In 1889, Vivian published this anecdote in his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life which appeared in The Sun. The article alleged that Wilde had a habit of passing off other people's witticisms as his own--especially Whistler's. Wilde considered Vivian's article to be scurrilous and a betrayal, and it directly caused the broken friendship between Wilde and Whistler. The Reminiscences also caused great acrimony between Wilde and Vivian, Wilde accusing Vivian of \\"the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer\\" and banishing Vivian from his circle. Following this incident, Vivian and Whistler became friends, exchanging letters for many years.  Newspaper publishing and the Neo-Jacobite Revival  The title illustration of the first issue of The Whirlwind Portrait of Charles Bradlaugh MP, by Walter Sickert, from the first issue of The Whirlwind Wreath laying at the statue of Charles I by The Legitimist Club in 1897 The late 1880s and 1890s saw a Neo-Jacobite Revival in Britain, which started in 1886, when Bertram Ashburnham founded the Order of the White Rose. The Order embraced causes such as Irish, Cornish, Scottish and Welsh independence, Spanish and Italian Legitimism, and particularly Jacobitism. Its members included Frederick Lee, Henry Jenner, Whistler, Robert Edward Francillon, Charles Augustus Howell, Stuart Richard Erskine and Vivian. The Order published its own paper, The Royalist, from 1890 to 1903. Vivian had first met Erskine when they were enrolled in a journalism school together. In 1890, Vivian and Erskine founded a weekly newspaper The Whirlwind, A Lively and Eccentric Newspaper, with Vivian as editor. The Whirlwind was noted for publishing illustrations by artists including Whistler and Walter Sickert; Sickert was also the art critic of The Whirlwind, and wrote a weekly column. It also carried articles about Oscar Wilde at the height of his fame and notoriety. The paper espoused an Individualist and Jacobite political view, championed by Erskine and Vivian. One of the notable illustrations produced by Sickert for The Whirlwind was a portrait of Charles Bradlaugh. Bradlaugh also wrote an article on \\"practical individualism\\" for the paper. The Whirlwind was criticised by Victor Yarros for its anti-semitic stance, which was primarily espoused by Vivian in his editorials. In the 23 August 1890 edition, he wrote: \\"The Jews are a race rather than a religious body, and, like the Chinese, are often obnoxious to their neighbours. By their financial craft they have acquired a dangerously extensive power, not merely over individuals, but even over the policy of states... the proper way to deal with Jews is a rigorous boycott... What should be aimed at is the return of the whole Jewish race, as speedily as may be, to Palestine... the countries of their adoption would assuredly have no difficulty in sparing them\\". Vivian used his editorship to promote his political and social views, including an individualist philosophy for women (though he was against Women's suffrage), the menace of London's tramways and repeated attacks on the journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley and other popular figures of the age. He also published a series of autobiographical articles under the title Reminiscences of a Short Life which later formed the basis of his 1923 memoirs Myself not least, being the personal reminiscences of \\"X.\\" The paper went on hiatus in early 1891, when Vivian stood for election, and did not restart publication. The Order of the White Rose split in 1891. It had always been a primarily nostalgic and artistic organisation. Vivian and Erskine wanted to pursue a more militant political agenda, and together with Melville Henry Massue--who styled himself the Marquis of Ruvigny--they founded the rival Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland, sometimes using the name the White Rose League. The Central Executive Committee of the League were: Walter Clifford Mellor, Vivian, George G. Fraser, Massue, the Baron Valdez of Valdez, Alfred John Rodway, and R.W. Fraser, with Erskine as President. Pittock described the League as a \\"publicist for Jacobitism on a scale unwitnessed since the Eighteenth Century\\". The League organised a series of protests and events, often centred on statues of Jacobite heroes. In late 1892, they applied to the government for permission to lay wreaths at the statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, on the anniversary of his execution. Permission was refused by Prime Minister Gladstone, and it was George Shaw-Lefevre, Vivian's onetime travelling companion and now the First Commissioner of Works, who enforced the order. The League attempted to lay their wreaths anyway on 30 January 1893. Police were dispatched to stop the League and after a confrontation, Vivian and other League members were allowed to complete their ceremony. The League obtained significant coverage in the press. The political reporter for the Lancashire Evening Post wrote: \\"Mr. Herbert Vivian has been successful at last in placing a wreath upon the Statue of Charles the First....We trust all parties will feel the better for the operation--especially the bronze statue\\". An article in the Western Morning News said: \\"A bold and daring man is Mr. Herbert Vivian, Jacobite and journalist... He announces to all and sundry that, law or no law, he will... attempt to lay a wreath on the statue. I have not heard whether special precautions have yet been taken to cope with this new force of disorder though, perhaps... one constable may be set apart to overawe Mr. Herbert Vivian\\". In June 1893, there was a split between Ruvigny and Vivian, and Vivian attempted to continue to League with the support of Viscount Dupplin, Mellor and others. Vivian left the Jacobite League in August 1893, but continued to promote a strongly Jacobite political philosophy. In 1892 and 1893, Vivian worked as a journalist for William Ernest Henley at the National Observer. In 1894, he published The Green Bay Tree with his college friend and anti-immigrant writer William Henry Wilkins. Vivian also contributed to Wilkin's monthly periodical The Albermarle, which was co-edited by their mutual Cambridge friend Hubert Crackanthorpe. He spent the winter of 1894/5 in France, discussing Jacobite and Carlist politics with the poet Fran√ßois Copp√©e, and contemporary literature with the novelist √âmile Zola. Vivian continued to write political journalism after The Whirlwind closed. In 1895, he was editor of another newspaper, The White Cockade, whose principal purpose was to put forward the Jacobite argument. It received poor reviews, and was not a success. Vivian was described in the Bristol Mercury as a \\"volatile young gentleman [who] enjoys a European reputation in the spheres of politics and literature\\". By 1897, Vivian was the President of the Legitimist Club, another Neo-Jacobite organisation. In 1898, Vivian published letters he had exchanged with the Office of Works demanding that the Club be allowed to lay a wreath at the Statue of James II, Trafalgar Square on 16 September, the anniversary of James' death. Vivian's wreath laying, tactics and use of the press to publicise his cause, remained the same. Vivian remained president of the Club until at least 1904.  Writing career  The Bystander Following his departure from the Jacobite League in 1893, Vivian became the travel correspondent of Arthur Pearson's paper Pearson's Weekly. In February 1896, he launched and was editor of a new weekly newspaper called Give and Take, which was noted for offering its readers coupons for \\"a selected set of tradesmen\\". In 1898, Vivian returned to the profession of travel correspondent, first for the Morning Post (1898-1899) and then for Pearson's newly-founded Daily Express (1899-1900). In 1901 and 1902, he produced a magazine called The Rambler with Richard Le Gallienne, intended to be a revival of Samuel Johnson's periodical of the same name. After the turn of the twentieth century, Vivian wrote a number of novels, some anonymously or using pseudonyms, which were met with mixed reviews. The Master Sinner was described in The Publisher's Circular as \\"unpleasant but clever\\", and in The Literary World as having a \\"style [which was] jerky and overladen with adjectives\\", but still \\"a readable book\\". Vivian wrote a number of travel books, the most well- known being Servia: The Poor Man‚Äôs Paradise, published in 1897, which was widely quoted in newspapers, including The New York Times, the Morning Post and Pearson's Weekly. In 1901, he wrote a book on European religious rituals with his wife Olive, which was described in the Sheffield Independent as \\"well written, curious and readable, and marred only by a singularly fatuous surrender to any form of superstition however grovelling\\". In 1902, Vivian interviewed the French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans. Frontispiece of Herbert Vivian's book The Servian Tragedy, published in 1904 In 1903, Vivian returned to the subject of Serbia, writing The Servian Character for the English Illustrated Magazine. He followed this with his second book on the region, The Servian Tragedy: With Some Impressions of Macedonia published in 1904, which detailed the coup d'√©tat against the Serbian royal family. The book was reviewed in the Sheffield Daily Telegraph: > The author has a thorough personal knowledge of the country, was received in > audience by the late King and Queen, and is personally acquainted with all > the statesmen. The Belgrade catastrophe is minutely described from full > particulars obtained first hand. It received a less positive review in the London Daily News: > Mr. Herbert Vivian's new book...presents many interesting chapters on the > events leading up to the recent tragedy, but can hardly be looked upon as an > authoritative history. The matter is thin, the author does not quote his > authorities; and he is too evidently willing to accept hearsay in place of > evidence. Vivian was a personal friend of Winston Churchill, and met with him several times in the 1900s, seeking political gossip and advice. In 1905, Vivian published the first interview given by Churchill, published in The Pall Mall Magazine, which received attention in the press. Vivian also interviewed David Lloyd George, the President of the Board of Trade for The Pall Mall Magazine and wrote for The Fortnightly Review. In 1904, Vivian made a political speech containing pointed remarks about George Bernard Shaw. Shaw and Vivian exchanged letters on the matter, which Vivian then published, much to Shaw's chagrin: > The publication of my letter to Mr. Vivian was a piece of humourous cruelty > in which I had no part. I honestly gave Mr. Vivian the best advice I could > in his own interest in a letter obviously not intended for publication; and > if he had acted quietly upon it, instead of sending it off to the papers... > he might still have a chance at a seat in the next Parliament.... I shall > not pretend to be sorry that I have helped Mr. Bowerman, the accredited > Labour candidate, to disable an opponent who, if he had played his cards > skilfully, might have proved very dangerous... Yours, G. Bernard Shaw He continued his keen interest in the Balkan states. In 1907, he was part of a conspiracy to put Prince Arthur of Connaught onto the throne of Serbia. A year later, the Montenegro government considered appointing him their Honorary Consul in London, and Vivian wrote to his friend Winston Churchill, asking for an exequatur for his appointment. In 1908, he proposed a gambling \\"system\\" for roulette, published in The Evening Standard. His system relied on the gambler's fallacy and it was thoroughly debunked by Sir Hiram Maxim in the Literary Digest in October 1908. Frontispiece of Herbert Vivian's book Italy at War, published in 1917 Vivian continued to publish books during the First World War, notably his 1917 volume Italy at War, which despite its title was largely a travelogue. He attempted to join the Ministry of Information and met with both Lord Beaverbrook and John Buchan as part of these efforts, but his services were not required, though Buchan admitted to Jacobite sympathies during their meeting. Vivian instead returned to the Daily Express as their travel correspondent for 1918. In the 1920s, he worked as a travel journalist for newspapers including The Pall Mall Magazine and The Yorkshire Post. In 1927, he wrote Secret Societies Old and New, which received mixed reviews; The Spectator described it as \\"well-written and extremely readable\\", while Albert Mackey noted \\"the author does not possess sufficient knowledge for his task\\". In 1932, he returned to the subject of European political history and Legitimism, publishing The Life of the Emperor Charles of Austria. This was the first biography of Charles published in English, and it received a positive review in the Belfast News Letter. He also continued to write about the Balkans, publishing an article in The English Review in 1933 about racial tensions in Yugoslavia. Vivian's writing was noted during his lifetime, and afterwards; he is listed in the 1926 edition of Who's Who in Literature, and the 1967 New Century Handbook of English Literature.  Political candidate  In 1889, Vivian attempted to stand as a candidate in the Dover by-election. He withdrew and later alleged that the Irish journalist and candidate for Galway Borough, T. P. O'Connor, had stepped in to prevent his candidacy. In April 1891, Vivian announced he was standing in the East Bradford constituency, for the Jacobite \\"Individualist Party\\" of which he was the sole member. By May 1891, Vivian was claiming to be the Labour candidate for the seat, though this was denied by the Bradford Trade and Labour Council. During the campaign he was named as a co-respondent in a divorce case which was gleefully reported by the local press. He duly lost the 1892 election to William Sproston Caine. In 1895, he stood for the North Huntingdonshire constituency, on an explicitly Jacobite platform. The seat was comfortably held by A.E. Fellowes. Undeterred by his failures, Vivian again sought election after the turn of the century. He was interested in the Deptford constituency where he had helped Wilfrid Blunt's campaign fifteen years earlier. He began to campaign there at the end of 1903, and spoke at a free trade meeting in December, reading letters of support he had received from Winston Churchill and John Dickson-Poynder, the MP for Chippenham. Churchill joined the Liberal party in 1904, and Vivian followed him. He was selected as the Liberal candidate to fight the 1906 election, and Churchill spoke in his support at two meetings. Vivian met with serious opposition to his candidacy, and only received 726 votes, losing heavily to Labour party candidate C. W. Bowerman. In 1908, Vivian investigated standing as a candidate in the Stirling Burghs constituency, following the death of the former Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman who had held the seat for the Liberal Party. Vivian again espoused Legitimist views in support of the restoration of the House of Stuart. In the end, he did not stand and the seat was won by Arthur Ponsonby.  Fascist sympathies  In 1920, Vivian met Benito Mussolini and Gabriele D'Annunzio in Italy and became an admirer of fascism, particularly Italian Fascism. In 1926, he wrote about his visits to Mussolini's Italy: > I find most useful, instead of a passport, is a copy of the first Fascist > newspaper, for which I wrote an article in 1920... These fascist syndicates > everywhere are not unlike the Soviets, and Fascism is very like Bolshevism > in many ways. Except that one means well, and the other not. Fascism is > certainly succeeding... All the public services go like clockwork, trains > arrive to the tick. In May 1929, Vivian and Hugh George de Willmott Newman founded the Royalist International, a group with the stated aims of opposing the spread of Bolshevism and the restoration of the monarchy, but with a clear pro-fascist agenda. Vivian was the General Secretary, and the editor of the league's publication, the Royalist International Herald. Newman was 24 at the time; he went on to be ordained a Bishop in the independent Catholic church and an Archbishop in the Catholicate of the West, and was involved with Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis. In 1933, Vivian wrote: > \\"Monarchy...[is] a more satisfactory form of government than the insidious > poisons of a plutocracy [and] the distorted democracy of Parliaments... the > world's galloping consumption will not be arrested until... Kings forget > their ancient animosities to unite in a Royalist International > uncontaminated and unhampered by the lying, cowardly, malignant Spirit of > the Age.\\" In 1936, he published Fascist Italy, in which he openly expressed his admiration for the Italian fascist regime. The book received a scathing review in the Nottingham Journal: \\"A facile writer of travel guides... Herbert Vivian must be read as an amusement of a rather grim sort than as an education... This is a book which need to be taken too seriously, but which may be worth reading with no more attention than is given to works which claim, as this one does not, to be mainly fiction\\". The Dundee Evening Telegraph review noted: \\"[Vivian] writes with rapturous enthusiasm. Mussolini is to him a \\"saviour\\", who \\"restored order and glory and pride, cured his country in her calenture, create an imperial future with traditions of ancient Rome\\"...Inasmuch as it is a mouthpiece for crude propaganda, Mr. Vivian's book is regrettable\\".  Political views  Vivian's political views varied over his lifetime, embracing at times one-nation Toryism, free-trade liberalism and open fascism. Indeed, he often seemed more interested in the mechanisms of power and the power of persuasive political speech than in consistent policies or positions. During his failed campaign for the 1891 Bradford East by-election he wrote: > I preach fanatically the gospel of individualism according to John Stuart > Mill and Herbert Spencer. The first principle of this gospel is that > everyone must be allowed to do whatever he pleases so long as his doing so > does not interfere with the liberty of others to do the same. I am a staunch > free trader, desiring the abolition of that curse of civilisation, the > custom house. I protest against all monopolies, whether exercised by un- > wieldy State departments, or by grasping individuals, and I support the > claims of all nationalities to the management of their own affairs. Some of his beliefs were consistent: he held racist views from the early days: He was noted for his \\"extreme monarchist views\\" throughout his life, and became antagonistic towards democracy. His 1933 book Kings in Waiting--in which he wrote \\"Democracy, liberty, and prosperity had been the mirages that had attracted the nations to their shambles\\"--was noted for its passionate pro-Monarchist and anti-Democratic stance. He was a prominent British Serbophile, and an early proponent of a Greater Serbia that encompassed most of the territory of Macedonia.  Modern perceptions  Vivian's books and articles on Serbia remain widely quoted in modern histories of the region. Slobodan Markovich, writing in 2000, describes Servia: A Poor Man's Paradise' as: > a rather sympathetic account of the Serbian King Alexander and the Serbian > Army... although biased, the book has an abundance of facts and confirms the > extent to which British knowledge on Serbia had accumulated in previous > decades. Markovich says that Vivian was \\"among Britons who took part in the creation of the image of Serbia and the Balkans, [the] one person should be given a special attention\\". He also noted that Vivian and anthropologist Edith Durham were \\"among [the] prominent actors of the 'balkanisation' of the Near East\\" and they greatly influenced the British perception of the Balkans after the First World War. In 2013, Servia: The Poor Man's Paradise was described by Radmila Pejic as: > A major contribution to British travel writing about Serbia with its in- > depth analysis and rather objective portrayal of the country‚Äòs political > system, religious practices and economic situation Although Vivian's Neo-Jacobite views are now largely forgotten, his 1893 wreath laying earned him the epithet of \\"political maverick\\" from Smith, who summed-up the impact of the event: > The affair enjoyed publicity out of all proportion to the latter-day > significance of the Jacobite cause, which had long been effectively extinct, > but as one man's crusade against an aspect of state bureaucracy, it acquired > contemporary meaning\\" Miller and Morelon describe him as a \\"monarchist British historian\\" and ascribed his interest in Emperor Charles of Austria to his uncritical admiration of kings.  Personal life  When Vivian was 27, he was named as co-respondent in a divorce case. In 1891, he had met Henry Simpson and his wife, Maud Mary Simpson, in Venice and became a frequent visitor to their home. Henry Simpson was an artist and a friend of Whistler. The Simpsons travelled on to Paris, where Mrs. Simpson confessed that Vivian had proposed to her. The Simpsons then returned to London, and Mrs. Simpson left her husband and demanded a divorce, as she and Vivian were living together in Bognor Regis under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. Selwyn. The Simpsons' divorce was granted in December 1892, one of only 354 divorces granted in England and Wales that year. On 22 June 1893, Vivian married Maud Mary Simpson. Maud pursued her ambition to become an actress, and in 1895 she travelled to Holland, where she abandoned Vivian for a Mr. Sundt, of the Norwegian Legation in Amsterdam. The marriage ended in divorce in 1896. On 30 September 1897, Vivian married Olive Walton, the daughter of Frederick Walton the inventor of linoleum. Herbert and Olive were well known on the London social scene in the years immediately after the First World War and are mentioned in Anthony Powell's memoir Infants of the Spring as throwing a lavish luncheon in honour of Aleister Crowley. Powell notes that their \\"marriage did not last long, but was still going at this period\\". Olive maintained a lively correspondence with Powell's father for many years after the divorce.

He started a local newspaper, the Kona Echo.  Early life and education  Hayashi was born in Fukushima, Japan in 1867 to a samurai family in the Aizu-Wakamatsu clan. He graduated from Aomori Prefectural Medical School in 1884, then moved to America, where he was a migrant worker until he saved up enough money for medical school, since he came to America against his father's wishes and therefore didn't have financial support. Hayashi studied at the Hahnemann Medical College in San Francisco. During medical school he was nicknamed \\"Harvey\\" after William Harvey, because his professors had a hard time with \\"Saburo\\". After he graduated in 1891, Hayashi opened up a practice in Sacramento. In 1893, he moved to Honomu in the Big Island of Hawaii's Kona district at the invitation of Jiro Okabe. In 1895, he married Matsu Kawarada, and during their lives they had twelve children.  Kona  Hayashi opened a practice in Honomu when he first arrived in Hawaii, but he soon moved it to Kailua-Kona. In 1897, Hayashi started the Kona Echo , Kona's first newspaper and Hawaii's second Japanese language newspaper. He and his family worked together to publish it twice a week, though its publication decreased in frequency until it published bimonthly for the last ten years of its existence. The Japanese section was discontinued in 1940, and the entire newspaper folded in 1941. Hayashi was a major figure in the Kona Japanese community. He helped to establish the Japanese cemetery in 1896, then he founded the Japanese language school in Holualoa in 1898. It was an independent language school that wasn't affiliated with a religion, as many Japanese language schools were at the time. Hayashi's wife, Matsu, taught at the school until a full-time teacher (Sukezo Takeda) was hired. He later also founded the Kona Japanese Benevolent Association. Hayashi died on June 1, 1943, and was buried at Central Kona Union Church.

Career Her work includes installations, sculptures, textiles and fashion objects which consistently reference art, fashion and design of the 20th century. In combining traditional handicrafts such as fashion and textiles with masculine- dominated ones such as fine arts and object design, Siem questions the role of the creator by insisting on the role of the woman not just as maker but also as author. Her works, often sewed or carved, are intensively labour-based and often deal with themes of domesticity and the elaborate function which women perform in the social sphere. The majority of Siem's early work made use of the preceding German artistic generation as source material by consistently quoting and borrowing aesthetic elements albeit in a satirizing and ironic manner. Over the course of her career, Siem has also drawn from a wide variety of ethnographic sources including puppets, traditional furniture design, and European folk costumes as well as elements of anthropology and sociology The artist lives and works in Berlin.  Education  From 1979-1984 Siem studied at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg. Siem herself was appointed Visiting Professor from 2000-2001 and Professor of Sculpture from 2002 to 2008. During this time Siem was also a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund.  Work  Siem developed her first artworks in the form of dresses, murals and hats during and after her studies in Hamburg between 1983 and 1988. In these works, Siem makes use of 'traditional' female domains such as sewing and fashion to satirize and critically evaluate the influences of the influential artistic generation which preceded her. For example, her 'clothes-works' of the early 1980s are an answer to the textile works of the German artist Franz Erhard Walther by means of the designation \\"objects for use\\", a term which Walther himself used in describing some of his wearable fabric sculptures. Using eye- catching patterns partly offset on the surface of the dress, as if the parts had been carelessly sewn together, Siem creates a sense of formal alienation which visually lifts clothes designed for everyday use. Similarly, murals which were created by Siem in the same period reference the large-scale wall paintings by the German artist Blinky Palermo. Instead of composing a monochrome painting as Palermo would have done, Siem paints a marble imitation stone, as one would in a theater set. These wall works were placed in the public space such staircases, office halls, or caf√©s and remained there without being marked as a work of art, in some cases for years. Siem's 'hat works', on the other hand, are wearable objects which are not discernable as artworks apart from their uniqueness. In fact, Siem's textile works were only exhibited as art objects some years later, in the gallery Chantal Crousel in Paris in 1995. = The Four Workgroups = From 1989 to 1997, Siem created four groups of works which occupy a central place in her oeuvre. The first group of works, created from 1989 to 1993, is composed of dresses, hats, bags, and shoes. As in her previous works, the artist's objects blur the line between art and fashion since it is both possible to wear them and consider them under objective aesthetic terms. As potential prototypes, they are normally exhibited in the style of a merchandise presentation one would find in a fashion store. The objects of the second group of works (1991-1994) are more ambivalent. The terms used to describe the objects - clothes, hairstyles, shawls, trolleys - suggests fashion or lifestyle objects, but the group of works itself resembles the collection of a cultural-historical museum. The 'clothes' are hard, like armor, and the 'hairstyles' (made of stone) are not actually possible to wear or even carry unassisted. The 'trolleys' are heavy wooden models similar to ones that might be found in an agricultural museum. The 'shawls' are thick tapestries made of felt. Hence the understanding of the female role is subverted and rehashed in the form of 'superficial' feminine objects ever which present themselves as increasingly absurd. Similarly, the third group of works (1993-1997) is also reminiscent of a museum collection. Untitled (6 Masks) is made up of six large furry outfits resembling traditional costumes of folk characters from the Alpine regions of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. In the group Untitled (7 Masks) the artist has reproduced her own face in seven different facial expressions in reference to the 18th century German-Austrian sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt. The group Untitled (42 Stones) ironically performs the formal canon of modernist sculptures in papier-m√¢ch√© (visually referencing figures such as Hans Arp and Henry Moore) in 42 individual examples. The fourth group of works (1995-1997) consists of an installation which creates the appearance of a huge room. A group of life-size dolls, figurines and wooden objects appear comically small, like toys, in the center of an oversize carpet. The dolls reference classical European doll forms as well as the sculptures and theater costumes of the Dadaist Oskar Schlemmer. = Rustic Furniture (\\"Bauernm√∂bel\\") = Wiebke Siem developed the series 'Rustic Furniture' during her first residency in the UK. All objects are 1:1 copies of existing German farm furniture of the 18th and 19th centuries in various private and public European collections. The objects create a sense of alienation due to the fact that the replica furniture has been painted brand new. They seem strange to the viewer, despite being lifted from a familiar cultural-historical background. This commentary on political and sociological framework raises the question of what can be considered strictly 'foreign' within the public sphere and what can be considered culturally one's own. = Costume Masks (\\"Maskenkost√ºme\\") = The mask costumes (2000/2001), mostly created during Siem's second stay in England, refer to objects of non-European cultures in preserved European museum collections, such as mask costumes of the African or the Pacific region. The carved masks, however, also make clear references to European modernism. (Modigliani, Schlemmer). Siem points out that the art of non-European space is a resource of European modernity. = The Counterfeiter (\\"Die F√§lscherin\\") = Between 2005 and 2009, Siem worked on a group of larger installations that were shown in 2009 at the Neues Museum N√ºrnberg under the exhibition title Die F√§lscherin. In pre-and post-war room furnishings and furniture, large fabric sculptures are placed as actors in surreal domestic scenes. Anxiety, vision and comedy are central elements of the main installation, which consists of an \\"Africa collection\\" made up of household items obsessively occupying the entire room. = Hot Skillet Mama = With the sculptures that have been created since 2010, Wiebke Siem freed her practice from the intricately crafted sculptures that have characterized her work for decades. She began to assemble her sculptures from simple household objects before working on them to give them a uniform surface. As disembodied sculptures they are not unlike skeletons and hang like puppets from the ceiling. As with many of Siem's works, the sculptures also express themes of alienation - the transformation of something familiar into something foreign. In the studio installation Der Traum der Dinge - The Dream of Things (at the K20 ‚Äì Collection Nordrhein- Westfalen in D√ºsseldorf) Siem invited the visitors to assemble and hang household appliances into new figures, effectively creating new artwork out of common domestic tools by means of audience participation.

Life  Born in Brussels, a chemist by training, he and his brother Jacques were involved in the founding of the Com√©diens routiers, the precursors of the established in 1945. When in 1959 he succeeded Joseph Rogatchewsky at the head of La Monnaie, he developed a policy of international exchange and public outreach, with a particular focus on youth. That same year, he brought some of his dancers and the ballet troupe of La Monnaie to create the highly successful Rite of Spring. Following this, Huisman and B√©jart founded the Ballet of the 20th Century in 1960. Wishing to broaden the company's audience, they brought out the dance from the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie to present Les Quatre Fils Aymon at the Cirque Royal in 1961, the choreographer's first major popular success. This ballet was followed by many others, which made La Monnaie one of the first choreographic scenes in Europe But Huisman did not abandon the lyrical productions. He involved renowned directors such as Franco Zeffirelli (Rigoletto and Falstaff), Jean-Pierre Ponnelle (several operas by Rossini), and Wieland Wagner (Tristan und Isolde, which premiere took place in Brussels before Bayreuth). Although he preferred to give young artists and original productions a chance, Huisman nevertheless invited many stars, such as Victoria de los √Ångeles, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Mario Del Monaco, Jos√© Carreras and Jos√© van Dam. In 1968, he hiredJacques Brel for the first French version of Man of La Mancha, an adaptation of Dale Wasserman's musical theatre Man of La Mancha, played in Broadway in 1965. The premiere took place at La Monnaie on October 4, 1968 and then in Paris in December. Huisman also paid attention to the renewal of Baroque music, staging performances of works by (Rameau, Cavalli, Monteverdi) and to 20th century works (Jan√°ƒçek, Alban Berg, Dario Fo, Philip Glass, Bob Wilson).

The wikalah was responsible for the relations between imams and Shia Islam as well as collecting religious taxes. Terminology Wikalah is an Arabic word describing a person who performs duties on behalf of someone else. It is similar to the English terms agent or power of attorney. A wikalah is a second in command, trusted with acting on behalf of a principal. Wikalah (plural) is used when a person is unable to perform a task directly. History Shia imams frequently had to deal with persecution and sometimes - in order to protect themselves - resorted to the practice of taqiya, a form of religious dissimulation. Because of the critical situation of the imams in this era, they were looking for a way to connect with Shia Islam. Often deputies acted secretly on behalf of the Abbasid Caliphs and, in some cases, it was not known that they were imam's deputies. =Formation= The network of agents (Wikalah) was established during the sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq. It peaked in the time of the eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari. The network of agents was especially important during the minor occultation, because Imam Mahdi only contacted his followers through the agents. The function of this system is shown in letters of instruction of the Al-Hadi. According to Jassim M. Hussain and Abdulaziz Sachedina, deputies were responsible for managing the society. Jassim M. Hussain said: \\"Gradually the leadership of the Wikalah became the only authority which could determine and prove the legitimacy of the new Imam.\\" For example, the ninth Imam, al‚ÄëJawad said to the head of his deputies about installing Al-Hadi as next Imam. =Minor occultation= The Four Deputies or Gates ()Encyclopaedia Iranica (2011). BƒÄB (1), in Twelver Shia Islam, were four individuals who served as intermediaries between the community and the twelfth and final Imam upon his entering the Minor Occultation. The deputies are referred to by the Arabic terms Safir (emissary), Na'ib (deputy) or Wakil (advocate). Twelver tradition holds that four deputies acted in succession to one another from 873‚Äì941 CE: # Uthman ibn Sa‚Äôid al-Asadi (‚Ä† 873-80) # Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman ibn Sa‚Äôid al-Asadi (‚Ä† 917) # Abul Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti (‚Ä† 938) # Abul Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri (‚Ä† 941) The Major Occultation began following the death of the last deputy and, according to the Shia doctrine, will continue until the return of the Mahdi.

Background Since the loss of Kh√¢m ƒê·ª©c to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) during the Battle of Kham Duc from 10-12 May 1968, the PAVN had used the area as a base for operations in Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province. It was decided that US forces should sweep the area to disrupt the PAVN logistics buildup and forestall a PAVN offensive in the autumn and winter. Operation On 12 July 1970 elements of the 196th Infantry Brigade launched the operation by securing Kh√¢m ƒê·ª©c airfield. After securing the airfield and establishing a firebase for A Battery, 1st Battalion, 82nd Artillery there, the 196th Infantry proceeded to patrol the surrounding area meeting limited opposition, while suffering several casualties in small skirmishes and mortar attacks. While they occupied Kh√¢m ƒê·ª©c U.S. forces conducted searches for the remains of the Americans missing in the battle two years earlier. The operation concluded on 26 August with the US forces evacuated by helicopter to Landing Zone Judy (), 32km to the southeast. As one of the CH-47s (#67-18445) carrying personnel and munitions came in for landing at Judy it was hit by PAVN fire and crashed in flames killing 30 onboard and 1 soldier on the ground. Operation Elk Canyon II began on 26 August and continued until 19 September. Its objective was to disrupt the PAVN's Dak Rose supply route.

This was passed in the 2016 budget and implemented immediately. Prior to this doctors in Fiji were underpaid and frequently worked many hours over the 76 hours per fortnight without compensation. Fiji constantly suffered from an exodus of highly trained medical professional leaving to work in New Zealand and Australia, citing remuneration as one of the major factors. Having experienced the better work conditions of doctors in New Zealand, he is an advocate on safety, well being and preventing burnout of doctors in Fiji. = Pacific Island Surgeons Association (PISA) = In 2018, at the combined GSA/PISA meeting, the Pacific Islands Surgeon Association held its Annual General Meeting (AGM) and elected the board of executives.

All three females successfully completed general surgery training and are now branching out into surgical subspecialties in Peadiatric Surgery (Dr Annette Chang), Plastic surgery (Dr Rachna Ram) and ENT (Dr Fane Lord). Since then, more women have joined the surgical training program in Fiji, leading to the first combined sub-meeting of Pacific Women in Surgery and Royal Australasian College of Surgeon's women in surgery delegates at the GSA//PISA meeting in Denarau, Fiji 2018.  Public health campaigns  Working as a general surgeon in Fiji, Dr Waqainabete some of the surgical load of complications related to non-communicable lifestyle disease especially Diabetes. After performing unprecedented number of lower limb amputations due to Diabetic Foot sepsis, he is frequently in the media to raise awareness on this issue.

It was founded by James Yenbamroong in 2017 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the goal to research and develop space technology and applications for use in urban and rural areas. Initially focused on the implementation of a nationwide broadband project using satellite technology, Mu Space in 2018 started doing activities and research of technology related to space. In July 2018, the company sent micro-gravity experiments into space aboard the New Shepard rocket of Blue Origin, and in September 2018, it released a 3D image of their own spacesuit version for use by astronauts and space tourists. In April 2019, mu Space submitted a proposal to a NASA project to build a lunar landing system. The company has satellite launch contracts with Blue Origin, using the New Glenn rocket, and with Relativity Space using Terran 1, the world's first 3D-printed rocket.  History  mu Space founder James Yenbamroong had been interested in space from an early age. He studied aerospace and mechanical engineering degrees at University of California, Los Angeles, and learned about satellite systems while working with Northrop Grumman on unmanned vehicle systems. Yenbamroong then went back to Thailand after years of living in the US and founded mu Space in June 2017. The company is based in Bangkok and had 30 staff. The company started with a registered capital of US$3 million. In December 2017, Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission granted mu Space a 15-year license to provide satellite services in the country.  Technology projects = Satellite = The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Communication had awarded mu Space a license until 2032 to operate a satellite and provide services in Thailand. In October 2017, the company signed a contract to lease a satellite ground system or teleport of CAT Telecom. Mu Space is temporarily using the satellites of another company SES to provide broadband services in Thailand, pending the development of the company's own satellite in 2021. mu Space's satellite will be worth up to US$150 million and have a lifespan of up to 15 years. It will use the 50.5 degree East orbital slot to provide coverage over Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand. Mu Space has satellite launch contracts with Blue Origin, using the New Glenn rocket, and with Relativity Space, using the 3-D printed Terran 1 rocket. = Smart City = mu Space partners with tech company Qualcomm to deploy smart city applications and services in Thailand. In Thailand, smart city is part of the government's Thailand 4.0 initiative. The first pilot project on smart city was initiated in Phuket in 2016, where the public sector allocated US$11 million to develop the city's digital economy and transform it into an international tourism hub. This was followed by Chiang Mai with an initial US$1 million fund to implement smart agriculture, and Khon Kaen with over US$400,000 to focus on becoming a medical, transportation and exhibition hub. = Internet of Things (IoT) = mu Space has started developing a smart apparel that can be worn and record health data for use in medical diagnosis. Product tests will be carried out at the IoT Institute in Thailand Digital Park, scheduled to be completed in 2020. Mu Space is also operating a lab at True Digital Park in Bangkok, Thailand to research and showcase their products to the public. 3D image of Mu Space's spacesuit = Space Tourism = In 2021, the company plans to offer space tourism service to customers in Asia-Pacific. mu Space in September 2018 revealed the 3D image of spacesuit their customers will be wearing during spaceflight. = Space Payload Launch= As a part of the company's space program, in July 2018, mu Space sent experimental payload into space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepherd space rocket to test how materials react in micro-gravity environment. The payload included a silicon bleeding-prevention device used in hospitals, a carbon nanotube and a vacuum- sealed food product. mu Space had four times successfully sent payload to the boundary of space with the intention of raising public awareness, in the micro-gravity stages with Blue Origin New Shepard flight. In the mid 2020, mu Space will send an extra enormous payload cooperating with TOT Public Company Limited which incorporates a wide scope of electronic devices, and sensors for the estimation. Apart from that, mu Space also coordinates with a group of scientists, biologists, young students and famous Thai artists to send anti- disciplinary experiments for studying the effect of weightlessness and understanding of DNA Storage Preservation. = Autonomous Robots = Recently mu Space focuses on enhancing new innovations such as robots for small unmanned ground vehicles which are under the process of prototyping models. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems to benefit the automation systems in massive data consumption from unlimited sources, easy spam detection, simplifies time-intensive documentation in data entry as well as rapid analysis prediction and processing to enrich navigation systems. After the AI and ML systems are enhanced and completed, they will be used to build a small autonomous space vehicle regarding the future mission of Lunar exploration.thumb  Collaborations  Tham Luang cave = Tham Luang cave rescue = mu Space assembled a team of engineers to help in the rescue mission to save the 12 boys and their football coach trapped inside Tham Luang cave in Thailand.

The Forum aims to be a platform for public and private sector leaders to develop future strategies, particularly with a focus on the coming year.  Launch  Launched in 2004, originally as a biennial three-day event titled the Dubai Strategy Forum, the Forum was conceived to promote debate on policy in the Arab world. It was renamed the Arab Strategy Forum in 2006. The keynote address at the inaugural forum was given by former US President Bill Clinton. It was relaunched in 2009 under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation. Currently managed by The Executive Office of the Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the event sets out to enable leaders to make strategically informed decisions, navigate risks and exploit opportunities. A one-day event, its theme is typically set by examining predictions for the year ahead both in the Arab and wider world.  Content  The Forum has frequently provided headline-grabbing insights. In 2015 it published a report costing the Arab Spring at $833.7 billion (attributing this to losses in GDP, drops in tourism; stock and financial market losses and drops in Foreign Direct Investment). In 2016, addressing the forum, Leon Panetta, former director of the CIA and former US Secretary of Defence, together with former British Prime Minister David Cameron, jointly called for a regional alliance against terrorism. Panetta asserted such a coalition ‚Äúcould be a powerful signal to Iran that it can‚Äôt go into countries as it did in Yemen and Syria.‚Äù The Forum has often hosted contradictory views. In 2015 former British Foreign Secretary William Hague pointed to the growing threat of Daesh, while in 2014 Francis Fukuyama claimed the threat posed by the group had been overblown by media and the US. In 2018 both former French President Francois Hollande and former US Defense Secretary Robert Gates used the Forum as a platform to roundly condemn the US decision to open an embassy in Jerusalem. The Forum also produces a number of reports annually.

The constituent carbonate mud is a type of automicrite, or authigenic carbonate mud, and therefore it precipitates in situ instead of being transported and deposited. Been formed in situ, a microbialite can be seen as a type of boundstone where reef builders are microbes, and precipitation of carbonate is biotically induced instead of forming tests, shells or skeletons. Bacteria can precipitate carbonate both in shallow and in deep water (except for cyanobacyeria) and so microbialites can form regardless of the sun light. Microbialites were very important to the formation of Precambrian and Phanerozoic limestones in many different environments, marine and not. The best age for stromatolites was from 2800 Ma to 1000 Ma where stromatolites were the main constituents of carbonate platforms  Classification  Microbialites can have three different fabrics: Classification of microbialites (redrawn and simplified from Schmid, 1996). * Stromatolitic: microbialite layered, laminated or agglutinated to form a stromatolite. * Thrombolitic: microbialite with a clotted peloidal fabric if observed with a petrographic microscope. The density of peloids is variable. At the scale of the hand sample, the rock shows a dendritic fabric, and can be named thrombolite. * Leiolitic: a microbialite with no layering nor clotted peloidal fabric. It is only made of a dense automicrite. Stromatolites are laminated microbialites (in this figure, a Precambrian silicified stromatolite from the Strelley Pool Chert (SPC) (Pilbara Craton) - Western Australia)  Microbes that produce microbialites  Microbes that precipitate carbonate to build microbialites are mostly prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea. The best known carbonate-producing bacteria are Cyanobacteria and Sulfate-reducing bacteria. Archaea are often extremophiles and thus live in remote environments where other organisms cannot live, such as white smokers at the bottom of the oceans. Eucaryote microbes, instead, produce less carbonate than prokaryotes.

It precipitates on the sea floor or within the sediment as an authigenic mud thanks to physicochemical, microbial, photosynthetic and biochemical processes. It has peculiar fabrics and uniform mineralogical and chemical composition.  Environments where automicrite is formed  Automicrite deposits are found in different environments, as lakes, tidal flats, or the aphotic zone of marine slopes and basins. However, the environment where automicrite is most common is in carbonate mud mounds, a type of carbonate platform. In this kind of carbonate platform, common in the geological past but nearly absent today, automicrite deposits made carbonate structures of many tens to hundreds of metres of relief called \\"mud mounds\\". Automicritic mud mounds seemed to form more easily in areas of low sedimentation rate of siliciclastic extrabasinal sediment. Usually, the presence of mud in sedimentary rocks is an indicator of low-energy conditions in a depositional system, so in high-energy conditions it is nearly impossible to find mud. Instead, automicrite can precipitate internally in cavities and sediment pores below the sediment‚Äìwater interface, also in sediments that are formed in high-energy condition. Automicrite can also crystallize in suspension within cavities and then deposit on the cavity bottom. Usually, this process forms peloids, a kind of carbonate grains make by automicrite.  Features  In present carbonate platforms, automicrite is composed by aragonite needle-shaped crystals which have dimension of 1- 5 Œºm. Instead, in old limestones micrite is composed by Œºm-size calcite crystals.  Formation  Knowledge of the automicrites generation processes allow to make paleo- environmental interpretations, so it can become good instrument for basin analysis. Carbonate mud or micrite may originate through several processes, including the abiotic precipitation from highly supersaturated seawater or precipitation induced by microbial activity. = 1. Abiotic micrites precipitation = There are two kinds of ‚Äúinorganic‚Äù micrite:  Internal micrite which precipitates inside cavities and inter-granular pores of sediments. It is a pore-filling micrite which has peloidal or clotted textures, and when it is found in limestones it may prove that marine lithification occurred.  Seafloor micrite which precipitates at the sediment‚Äìwater interface. The equilibrium relationship for CO2, CaCO3 in water is: H2O + CO2 + CaCO3 (solid) <-> Ca2+ (aq) + 2HCO3- (aq) Through temperature increase, pressure decrease, or a decrease in pH, the loss of CO2makes the reaction shift to the left. While CaCO3should precipitate spontaneously from seawater, which is supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate, calcite precipitation is inhibited by the presence of Mg in seawater and aragonite crystallization is inhibited by organophosphatic molecules. In modern environments, carbonate mud seems to form spontaneously in seawater in whitings. Whitings are clouds of suspended carbonate crystals (aragonite and Mg-calcite) that make the sea white. This phenomenon is common in tropically environments such as the Great Bahama Bank. Some attribute the formation of whitings to resuspension of carbonate sediment from sea bottom by waves. = 2. Precipitation induced by microbial activity = Precipitation of carbonate mud from seawater may be triggered by biological activity as photosynthesis. In fact, the metabolism of some organisms remove dissolved CO2 from seawater and thus promotes the precipitation of carbonate. In present sedimentary environments, the production of carbonate mud by cyanobacteria is known to occur in peritidal environments (Bahamas, Florida Bay, Persian Gulf) and in highly saline lakes (Coorong, Australia; Lake Tanganyika, eastern Africa). In this process is relevant the rule of filamentous cyanobacteria, in fact the calcite crystals formed within the organic filaments of cyanobacteria are retained after the death of the organism and consequently end up in the formation of layered carbonate mud rocks, the stromatolites. Micritic rocks of the geological past, e.g., the stromatolites of the Late Triassic Hauptdolomit of the Alps, may have had a similar origin. In many Jurassic micritic and peloidal limestones, remains of benthic coccoid cyanobacterial mats have been found. Also bacterial sulfate reduction may promote carbonate mud precipitation from seawater. Bacterial sulfate reduction may be represented by the simplified reaction: 2CH + SO42‚àí ‚Üí HCO3‚àí \\\\+ HS‚àí \\\\+ H2O This process has the potential to promote precipitation by producing hydrogen carbonate ions, which are one of the reactants in the precipitation of carbonate from seawater.

History The company was established with the capital of Rs 50000 by Mustafa. Mustafa holds 50 percent share in the company, and his four cousins hold the rest. The company has supplied ten packets of one-kilogram batter to 20 stores in Bengaluru under the brand name ‚ÄòID‚Äô(Idly, Dosa) ‚Äì operating from a 550 square feet space with two grinders, a mixer, and a sealing machine. The company made a profit from day one. Soon, Mustafa invested more INR 6 lakh to add more machines. At the same time, They also moved to a bigger space of 800 sq ft. As the demand for their product increased, Mustafa invested another Rs 40 lakh in 2008 and bought a 2,500 square feet shed in the Hoskote Industrial Area at Bangalore. In 2009, he sold his property in Kerala that he had purchased while working in Dubai and pumped in an additional Rs 30 lakh into the business. In two years, By 2010 the company was started making 2000 Kg of batter daily. And also, the number of stores partnered with them was increased to 300. In 2014, ID Fresh foods raised Rs 35 crore in the first round of funding from Helion Venture Partners. It was the first venture capital deal in the country to adhere to strict Shariah Islamic Law as per the request of the management of ID Foods. They utilized the funds to add more products and scale-up the business. In 2016, ID Fresh foods manufacture around 50,000 kg of batter daily from their units across the country and one in Dubai, which converts into a million idlis. Growth and profitability The company has achieved a turnover of Rs 100 crore in 2015-16. ID Fresh Foods expects to end this fiscal with Rs 286 crore turnover from 182 Crore in 2017-18.

Biography  Townsend E. Gidley was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, on July 20, 1805, the son of Daniel Gidley, a hatter who had retired to his farm. Gidley attended the area schools and worked on the farm until the age of 15, when he was went away to an academy in Bethlehem, Connecticut, to study, focusing on business and mercantile matters. He then spent another year at an academy in Poultney, Vermont, then returned home and became an apprentice under an area merchant named Walter Cunningham. He stayed with Cunningham until he was 21, then went into the mercantile business with a partner, Stephen Frost, doing business as Frost & Gidley for the next eight years. Gidley had reached the rank of second lieutenant in the area militia by the age of 19, and later often told the story of being introduced to the Marquis de Lafayette when he reviewed the troops during his visit to Poughkeepsie in 1824. In the spring of 1834, Gidley sold his share of the business and used the proceeds to buy several hundred acres of fertile land in Jackson County, Michigan. He moved his family first to Detroit to purchase supplies, then to the lands in Jackson. He began farming on a larger scale than the area was used to, planting of wheat in his first year; within a few years he was also the largest fruit grower in the state. = Political career = He was elected as the youngest of the 88 delegates to the state constitutional convention that began on May 11, 1835, and was appointed to a committee of 19 charged with drafting the constitution in an attempt to speed up its slow progress over its first four days. He was one of an even smaller group of five delegates who worked in secret to write a draft that was presented on May 19 to the rest of the convention, which then used it as the basis for further work. Gidley was one of two votes against the final version of the proposed constitution, on the grounds that it granted voting rights to non-citizens, which he opposed. Gidley was one of the organizers of the Whig Party in Jackson County. His property in Parma, Michigan, was a stop on the Underground Railroad. In the election held in October 1835, which also approved the constitution, he was elected to the newly-created Michigan House of Representatives. He was re- elected multiple times over the next 28 years, serving in both the house and the Michigan Senate for a total of eight terms. He was the Whig candidate for governor in 1851, losing to Robert McClelland. = Later years = He suffered from a throat disease in 1863 that forced his retirement from politics, and he sold his farm in Jackson and purchased near Grand Haven, Michigan, in order to take advantage of the lake breeze that he felt alleviated his symptoms. He died there on October 8, 1888. = Family = At age 25, Gidley married Emily Power, refers to her as Mary, but she is named as Emily in , and the tombstone of Emily Gidley refers to her as T. E. Gidley's wife . White may be confusing her with his second wife, Mary Henderson. of Poughkeepsie. They had a son, Sands, and a daughter, Isabella.

He is best known for creating The Shed at Dulwich, a fictional restaurant which became the top- rated venue in London on TripAdvisor in 2017, despite having never served a dish. In April 2019, Butler's debut book How to Bullsh*t Your Way To Number 1 was published. It became a #1 USA Today bestseller in humor in May 2019 and a Los Angeles Times #8 best-seller in July 2019. Career Butler began writing for Vice Magazine in October 2015 after successfully pitching an article in which he challenged himself to be a more successful door-to-door salesman than one of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Over the next two years, he regularly contributed articles to Vice (including a story in which he created a \\"DIY sex robot\\" from household items and fruit) and eventually started making short films that were shared on the site's social media channels. = The Shed at Dulwich = In April 2017, inspired by a belief he'd developed while being paid to write false positive reviews for restaurants on TripAdvisor years before, Butler came up with an idea to try and get a restaurant that doesn't exist verified on the travel website. After making a website for his fake restaurant, The Shed at Dulwich, which featured plates of food created using household products including shaving foam and dishwasher tablets, and buying a phone, it was officially accepted and listed on the site. From there, Butler spent six months asking friends to post fake reviews hoping to place the restaurant as high on TripAdvisor's list of 18,149 restaurants in London as possible. On November 1, 2017, the restaurant got to number 1 in the whole of London. It was open for one night on the 17th of the same month, serving ten guests including a couple from California thinly-disguised microwaveable meals. The customers are said to have been so blown away that some tried to book again. Following the release of both his article and documentary, How to Become TripAdvisor‚Äôs #1 Fake Restaurant, about the process, the story became a viral success. To date, Vice claims it has received 100 million views worldwide. Butler found himself at the centre of a media storm, appearing on popular television stations around the world. The reactions to the story were diverse, with Singaporean parliament using it as a vehicle to inform new laws on fake news and The Washington Post referencing Butler as \\"the Donald Trump of TripAdvisor\\". After conducting many interviews, Butler became convinced that it didn't need to be him being interviewed. \\"Whether it's the segment on Brazil's Globo TV, or the hour-long documentary on Japanese TV, every interviewer has asked me the same questions about the shed. It's not really me being interviewed; what I did has some recognition, but I don't.\\" he said. From there he successfully sent different lookalikes of himself in his place to conduct interviews on Breakfast Sunrise in Australia, WION TV in India, NOVA television in Bulgaria and BBC Radio 2 with Vanessa Feltz (who was standing in for Jeremy Vine on his lunchtime show). They all successfully passed as Butler, as documented in his film, I Sent Fakes of Myself to Be on TV Around the World. = Book = In June 2018, Butler released a third film entitled How I Faked My Way to The Top of Paris Fashion Week. It was well received, being viewed over 30 million times worldwide and being included in the official selection at the 2018 LA Fashion Film Festival. He also received three awards in 2018 - one from the British Society of Magazine Editors for Best Content Idea 2018, Video Project of the Year from the British Media Awards, and another from the DRUM Agency for Content Creator of the Year 2018, which he sent a Norwegian stand-in to accept, and nobody realised. In December 2018, he announced his debut book How to Bullsh*t Your Way To Number 1 in an interview with Forbes. After completing a Reddit Ask Me Anything shortly afterwards, the book shot to #1 on Amazon through pre-orders. On the date of the book's release, Oobah said in an interview with Robin Young on NPR that the book was less about success and more about helping people to not be inhibited.

Gaughran (born January 5, 1957) is an American attorney and politician from Suffolk County, New York, currently serving as a member of the New York State Senate from the 5th district. The district is located around the border of Nassau County and Suffolk County, encompassing the town of Huntington and the northern part of the town of Oyster Bay. Gaughran is a member of the Democratic Party. Gaughran served as the chair of the Suffolk County Water Authority from 2010 to 2018. He previously served as a member of the Suffolk County Legislature from 1988 to 1993 and as a member of the Huntington Town Board from 1984 to 1987. In 2018, Gaughran was elected to the New York State Senate from the 5th district, defeating the long-time Republican incumbent, Carl Marcellino. He took office on January 1, 2019.  Early life and education  Gaughran was raised in Dix Hills, New York, and attended Half Hollow Hills High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stony Brook University, where he majored in political science. Subsequently, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Hofstra University School of Law.  Early political career = Huntington Town Board (1984-1987) = Gaughran was elected to the Huntington Town Board in 1983, at the age of 26. He became the youngest member of the Town Board in the history of the town. During his tenure, Gaughran was the lone Democrat on the Town Board. He authored bills creating municipal solid waste districts and enacting environmental protections. = Suffolk County Legislature (1988-1993) = In 1987, Gaughran was elected to the Suffolk County Legislature from the 17th legislative district. Gaughran authored a \\"Charter Amendment\\" which reduced the Legislature's authority to increase spending by adding \\"pet projects\\" to the budget; the amendment was approved by voters in a referendum. He also co- sponsored a water-protection bill preserving numerous critical areas in the county, a \\"crack-house\\" law targeting drug dealers, as well as reforms to the Suffolk County Police Department. = Suffolk County Water Authority (2008-2018) = Gaughran was confirmed by the Suffolk County Legislature to the Suffolk County Water Authority (SCWA) for a five-year term in March 2008. He was re-appointed by the Legislature in March 2013 and March 2018. Following the retirement of SCWA chair (and former interim Suffolk County Executive) Michael A. LoGrande in May 2010, Gaughran was appointed as the new SCWA chair. As chair, he implemented reforms emphasizing accountability and transparency. He also reduced the payroll of the SCWA by 6% over four years. After his election to the New York State Senate in 2018, Gaughran resigned as SCWA chair. He was succeeded by fellow SCWA board member (and former Suffolk County Executive) Patrick G. Halpin. = Suffolk County Comptroller election (2014) = Gaughran ran for Suffolk County Comptroller in 2014, losing the general election to John M. Kennedy, Jr. (then a member of the Suffolk County Legislature) by six points.  New York State Senate (2019-present) = Elections = 1992 election  Gaughran first ran for the New York State Senate from the 5th district in 1992; his opponent in the general election was the long-time Republican incumbent, Ralph J. Marino (who was the senate majority leader at the time). The 5th district \\"straddles the Nassau- Suffolk border\\", and includes the town of Huntington and the northern part of the town of Oyster Bay. Thus, the district includes all or parts of the hamlets of Glen Cove, Syosset, Jericho, Northport, Commack, Dix Hills, Melville, and Plainview. In December 1991, Marino, as the senate majority leader, became known for his \\"budget-wrangling\\" which led to the infamous \\"Hamlet on the Hudson\\" incident, in which then-Gov. Mario Cuomo kept a plane bound for New Hampshire idling on a tarmac on the last day to file for the 1992 first-in-the-nation presidential primary in that state, while he tried to negotiate a state budget with the Republican-controlled senate. Although he had been perceived as a front-runner for the 1992 Democratic nomination, Cuomo declined to run for president, saying that he was \\"willing\\" but not \\"able\\" to campaign due to the unresolved state budget crisis. The 1992 campaign was extremely bitter, with Marino accusing Gaughran of improperly conspiring with a fiscally conservative group called Pack-Up (an acronym for \\"Political Action Committee to Kick Out Unproductive Politicians\\"), and Gaughran accusing Marino of using state funds to finance the distribution of his campaign mailings. The campaign was the most expensive state senate campaign up to that point, eclipsing the previous record of $910,000 set in 1990, and took place concurrently with a similarly rancorous 1992 U.S. Senate campaign between the Republican incumbent, Sen. Al D'Amato, and the Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Robert Abrams. In the campaign, Gaughran drew a surprising contrast between himself and Marino: he charged that Marino symbolized \\"clubhouse politics\\" and big government in Albany, and that Marino \\"voted for every state tax increase and every mandate on localities passed by the Legislature\\", while Gaughran himself signed a pledge to vote against any tax increase. Gaughran also chose environmental protection as a signature issue of his campaign, highlighting Marino's opposition to a state environmental trust fund and saying that Marino was \\"selling Long Island out on the environment\\". Ultimately, Marino defeated Gaughran with a larger-than-expected margin of over twenty points.  2016 election  Gaughran ran against Marino's successor, Carl L. Marcellino, in 2016. Marino had resigned from the state senate in February 1995 following his defeat in a senate-caucus vote for another term as senate majority leader by Joseph Bruno, an ally of Marino's intra-party rival Gov. George Pataki. Marcellino had won the special election on March 14, 1995, to replace Marino, and had been re-elected to ten full two- year terms, remaining in office since then. Gaughran was unopposed in the Democratic primary. The general election was closer than expected, but Marcellino defeated Gaughran by 1,761 votes out of almost 160,000 votes, or about one percentage point.  2018 election  Gaughran announced in February 2018 that he would seek a re-match with Marcellino, who was seeking his twelfth full two-year term. Gaughran was again unopposed in the Democratic primary. An analysis, conducted by Politico, of state senate election results on Long Island from 1984 to 2016 found that, of the seventy-two mid-term year senate elections during that period, Democrats did not win a single one. Gaughran was endorsed by The New York Times, Newsday, and numerous local labor unions and activist groups. Campaign spending on behalf of both Gaughran and Marcellino was unusually prolific, reaching at least $2.8 million. Outside spending on behalf of Gaughran included $494,000 from the New York State United Teachers, $136,000 from the Communications Workers of America, and $15,000 from the New York State Nurses Association. An advisory from the political blog Daily Kos to left-leaning small donors included Gaughran among eight state legislature candidates across the country; according to Gaughran's campaign, this \\"shout-out\\" attracted more than $47,000 in individual contributions from about 4,000 donors. Gaughran won the 2018 election, defeating Marcellino by almost ten thousand votes out of about 118,000 votes, or about eight-and-a-half percentage points. Gaughran's victory formed part of the successful campaign by the Democratic Party to re-take the majority in the New York State Senate for the first time in a decade (and just the fourth time in eighty years). = Committee assignments = *Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse (2019-2020) *Committee on Commerce, Economic Development, and Small Business (2019-2020) *Committee on Higher Education (2019-2020) *Committee on Local Government (Chair, 2019-2020) *Committee on Racing, Gaming, and Wagering (2019-2020) = Tenure = Gaughran took office on January 1, 2019. On January 6, 2019, Gaughran held an in-district inauguration ceremony. In January 2019, Gaughran and state Assemblyman Charles D. Lavine organized a food-and-supplies drive for \\"the thousands of [federal] workers across Long Island\\" during the U.S. federal government shutdown, which began on December 21, 2018, and ended on January 25, 2019. On January 9, 2019, Gaughran introduced a bill to \\"require propeller guards on instructional vessels\\". Described by Gaughran as a \\"common-sense boating safety bill\\", the bill is nicknamed \\"Ryan's Law\\" after twelve-year-old Ryan Weiss, who died in July 2017 during a boating lesson, in an accident that would likely not have been fatal had propeller guards been in place. The bill is simultaneously sponsored in the state Assembly by Andrew Raia, who first introduced the legislation in September 2017. On January 17, 2019, Gaughran introduced a bill to make permanent the property tax cap of 2% enacted in 2011. Gaughran said the following about his rationale for introducing the bill: > \\"I ran for State Senate on the promise that I would fight tirelessly for > overburdened and overtaxed Long Islanders. Today I took the first step and > introduced vital legislation to make the property tax cap permanent. No more > temporary extensions. A permanent tax cap for permanent relief.\\" \\"We're > beginning to feel the devastating effects of the federal limit on State and > Local Tax deductions. We cannot let Long Islanders be taxed out of their > homes. It is critical that New York State takes steps to providing real tax > relief to Long Islanders, while the federal government continues its attack > on New York taxpayers. The Democratic Senate Majority is going to provide > local municipalities and school districts with mandate reform and increase > state aid to our region to help lower local tax levies. It's a new day in > Albany and we're done with the same old games that have cost Long Island for > decades. I am proud that my first bill to pass as a State Senator will be > legislation to make the tax cap permanent.\\" Gaughran's bill was passed by the senate almost unanimously on January 23, 2019; state Sens. Gustavo Rivera and Julia Salazar, both Democrats, were the only two votes against Gaughran's bill.  Political positions  In his endorsement by Newsday, which is the largest newspaper on Long Island by circulation (and the largest suburban newspaper in the United States), Gaughran is described as a \\"moderate and suburbanite ... who would protect Long Island against a New York City-centric agenda\\". = Corruption = Gaughran supports \\"simple remedies\\" which would reduce corruption in Albany, such as: *prohibiting outside income for legislators, *closing a loophole that allows large political donors to hide their identities and to legally exceed campaign finance limits via shell corporations, *requiring legislators to reveal conflicts-of-interest, *banning the personal use of campaign funds, *allowing for the recall of elected officials via public petition. = Environmental policy = Gaughran touts his experience with environmental policy as the chair of the Suffolk County Water Authority. He supports a ban on off-shore drilling, and a reduction in fossil-fuel usage by 40% by the year 2030. He also favors measures targeting food waste, both for its effect on the environment and its effect on food-insecure households. = Gun policy = Gaughran believes that the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 should be expanded; he favors banning bump stocks and extending the background check waiting period from three to ten days. In January 2019, Gaughran was amongst nearly the entire Democratic caucus in the New York State Senate in co-sponsoring gun legislation to expand background checks and to ban bump stocks. Following the successful passage of the legislation through the state senate, Gaughran praised the efforts of activist movements such as March for Our Lives and other 2018 protests which raised awareness of gun violence in the United States, saying: > \\"Last year young people across the country mobilized in a transformative > movement to march for their lives. One year later New York stands to make > history again with common sense gun reforms such as Extreme Risk Protection > Order and expanded background checks. Today I have the great honor of > hosting Linda Beigel Schulman and Michael Schulman, parents of the late > Scott Beigel, who was tragically gunned down in the Parkland massacre last > year while heroically saving the lives of his students. I thank them for > their tremendous bravery and courage in turning their tragedy into advocacy. > It shouldn't take a tragedy to spur action. Never again.\\" The legislation was passed by the state legislature on January 29, 2019, and are pending signature from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. = Healthcare = Gaughran intends to vote for the New York Health Act, which will establish a single- payer universal healthcare program in New York. After Gaughran was elected, thanks mostly to a progressive grassroots campaign, he reneged on his promise to support the New York Health Act. = LGBT and reproductive rights = Gaughran supports classifying gender identity and expression as \\"protected classes\\", meaning that existing state laws prohibiting discrimination would then apply (viz. forbid discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression). Gaughran also supports a state-wide ban on conversion therapy. In January 2019, each of the thirty-nine members of the Democratic caucus in the New York State Senate, including Gaughran, co-sponsored the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA), alongside a conversion therapy ban. The bills were passed by the state legislature on January 15, 2019, and were signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on January 25, 2019. In a statement issued following the successful passage of GENDA through the state senate, Gaughran said: > \\"Years of dysfunction in Albany have blocked the passage of critical > legislation like GENDA. This week we broke the logjam and passed historic > protections to root out discrimination with the passage of GENDA and end > cruel, barbaric practices like conversion therapy. As a conference, we've > promised one of the most productive sessions in decades; we're just getting > started.\\" Whereas the Democratic-controlled state Assembly has consistently passed GENDA in every legislative session since 2013, the 2019 bills became the first significant LGBT bills passed by the senate since the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in June 2011. Gaughran is pro-choice and supports codifying a woman's right to an abortion into state law, citing the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court as a threat to reproductive rights established in the landmark Roe v. Wade case in 1973. In response to his vote in favor of the Reproductive Health Act in 2019, which expanded late term abortion and codified abortion rights statewide, the Huntington chapter of Ancient Order of Hibernians asked Gaughran to resign as a member and barred him from participating in the St. Patricks's Day parade. = Schools = Gaughran favors overhauling the Common Core State Standards Initiative, which New York has formally adopted, saying, \\"this time we need to listen to our teachers, our parents, and our children about what works\\". He opposes funding private for-profit charter schools with the public education budget. He supports repealing the 2015 law establishing \\"Annual Professional Performance Reviews\\" (APPRs), which measure the effectiveness of teachers by the performance of students on standardized tests. In January 2019, each of the thirty-nine members of the Democratic caucus in the New York State Senate, including Gaughran, along with two Republican members, co-sponsored a bill to repeal the APPRs. In a statement issued following the successful passage of the legislation, Gaughran said: > \\"Public school teachers are the cornerstone of New York's excellent public > school system. Teachers and students deserve fully funded public schools, > not over-testing or the arbitrary linkage of test scores to teacher > performance. We don't need annual tests to know how our students are > progressing, we need to maintain local control. Our teachers are already > evaluating student achievements every day in their classrooms, and > perpetually modifying their lesson plans to provide the best education > possible. I am proud to cast my vote to repeal the ineffective APPR > evaluation system and look forward to fighting for increased education aid > to Long Island public schools.\\" The bill was passed by the state legislature on January 23, 2019, and are pending signature from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Gaughran advocates for legalizing, regulating, and taxing sports betting, and using the tax revenue to help fund school districts in order to alleviate the trend of rising property taxes. = Tax policy = Gaughran opposes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in late 2017) due to its cap on the state-and-local-tax deduction, known as the SALT deduction. This cap raises the effective tax rate on many Long Island residents (300,000 households by Gaughran's estimation) since the state and local taxes are much higher on Long Island than they are on average nation-wide. = Voting reform = Gaughran supports expanding early voting and facilitating voter registration. He opposes requiring a reason to request an absentee ballot. He supports appointing an independent re-districting commission to prevent gerrymandering,  Personal life  In 1987, Gaughran married his wife, Carol, who works as a library media specialist. They reside in Northport, New York, and have two children, Kaitlin and Michael.

Lagergrens's 1898 article \\"Zur Theorie der Sogenannten Adsorption Gel√∂ster Stoffe\\" (To the theory of the so-called adsorption of dissolved materials) brought him a lasting fame. In 2018, 120 years after its publication, the paper was cited more than 800 times according to Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, making its total number of citation above 6000. In addition, his name became an eponym in the form of Lagergren equation or Lagergren kinetics occurring several thousand times in the literature. BiographySources of biographical data: https://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/√ñstg√∂tars_minne/1894; https://forum.genealogi.se/index.php?topic=71999.10;wap2=Early life= Sten Lagergren was born in Ramn√§s, Sweden on 6 May 1876. His father, Per Henrik Lagergren, was a commercial agent, his mother was Hilda Amalia Vistrand. =Education and professional career= Lagergren attended to the university college Stockholms H√∂gskola (Stockholm Highschool; the predecessor of the present Stockholm University), and studied there between 1894‚Äì1899. He wrote the paper that made him famous as a university student. Apparently, it made him a \\"one hit wonder\\", since no other notable scientific paper have been written by him anymore. He became a secondary school teacher, and was the rector of the Sofi Almquists samskola from 1902 and of the Beskowska skolan between 1905‚Äì1913. He was the author of several secondary school textbooks in geometry. =Marriage and children= Lagergren married Alfhild Lindstr√∂m (born in 1877) in 1906. They had one daughter. =Death= Sten Lagergren died on 4 April 1922 in Liding√∂, Sweden.  His classic work and its aftermath  In his perennial 1898 paper, Lagergren formulated a so-called pseudo-first- order model for adsorption kinetics based on an extensive body of experimental measurements. Both the empirical data and the model were highly acclaimed by the contemporaries. In 1900, Wilhelm Ostwald (Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry in 1909) wrote an unusually extensive review of the paper in his Zeitschrift f√ºr physikalische Chemie. Beyond words of recognition, Ostwald also drafted some ideas to further develop the model. Actually, having abandoned research, Lagergren could not give thought to these advises. The path was followed, instead, by Herbert Freundlich. His paper based on his habilitation lecture heavily relies upon Lagergren's results. They were also included in his classic book, in its later editions, and since then, in all standard treatises of surface chemistry and related areas. The first occurrence of the eponymic use of Lagergren's name can be traced back to an article of Dietl (\\"Lagergren'sche Formel\\" on p. 800). The use of Lagergren's model gained a new impetus in the beginning of the 21st century largely with the advent of sorption-based technologies of water desalination. A citation review of Lagergren's equation counted about 170 papers citing Lagergren's original paper until 2004. Within 10 years, this number exhibited a twentyfold increase.

It grows in tropical North Queensland and New Guinea.Lewis Roberts  Description  Dendrobium carronii is an epiphytic herb that has cone-shaped to onion-shaped pseudobulbs long and wide, each with between two and four leaves on the top. The leaves are green to purplish, fleshy and channelled, long and wide. The flowering stem is long and bears between two and twelve resupinate pink flowers with dark brown and purple markings. The flowers long and wide. The sepals are long and about wide. The petals are lance-shaped, long and about wide with their tips twisted. The labellum is yellow, about long and wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe is pointed with three ridges. Flowering occurs between August and October. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium carronii was first formally described in 1982 by Bill Lavarack and Phillip Cribb and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (carronii) honours William Carron (1823 - 1876), botanist on the ill-fated 1848 expedition of Edmund Kennedy. Distribution and habitat The pink tea tree orchid usually grows in stunted open forest usually near areas that are flooded in the wet season and often on Melaleuca viridiflora trees. It is found from Bamaga on the tip of the Cape York Peninsula to the McIlwraith Range in Queensland and on the southern coast of New Guinea. Conservation This orchid is classed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

Early life and career  Brunner completed a carpentry apprenticeship in his father's company in Mettmenstetten. From 1918 he went on a walking tour. From 1923 to 1925 he attended the Schreiner- Fachschule in Nuremberg and the class for interior design at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich. In 1929 he left the carpentry trade and moved to Lucerne, where after having been influenced by the ideas of the Bauhaus, Brunner worked as an interior designer at Theiler + Helber. During the Depression he lost his job. Photographer In 1936 Brunner worked on an inventory of historical monuments in the context of a public employment program for the unemployed. He put to use his skills as a photographer which he had taught himself in the 1920s. By chance he showed his avocational photography to publisher 'Regina Verlag' in Zurich and was soon photographing for the influential national magazines Schweizer Heim and Schweizer Familie from 1936 until the 1950s. His main subject matter was everyday life in traditional rural Switzerland, focusing particularly on agriculture and craft. Brunner experienced a rapidly changing rural Swiss life and he wanted to preserve this world and the inherited knowledge of farmers who worked hard without mechanical help, with few resources and close to Nature in glorious alpine regions.Peter Pfrunder, Ernst Brunner. Photographien 1937-1962 (Monograph), Offizin, Z√ºrich 1995. Brunner was systematic as a photographer, using the camera to document his subjects objectively. He composed his photos with strong and simple forms, often shooting from above or below his subjects, seeking more effective descriptive visual information. He made photo sequences on the same subject, or to document a work or social process, as he wanted to capture the rural world accurately. Longer sequences of images document workflows and put great emphasis on the involvement of the historical, geographic and social environment, for example, when he photographed craftsmanship. Typically he made between ten and twenty photos, and sometimes as many as one hundred separate images, like frames of an ethnographic film (for example in his series on charcoal burning). These sequences show all the relevant details of a process, while the aesthetic impact of individual photos is of secondary importance. As an archivist, he kept a careful filing system in which his images were gathered under keywords such as 'work', 'architecture', or 'customs', and within each of these, the subjects were separated geographically. Ernst Brunner (1945-1946) Photograph of sign protesting the construction of an hydroelectric reservoir at Urseren.Leading up to and during WW2 Das Schweizer Heim used Brunner‚Äôs imagery to serve a conservative and nationalist agenda, removing them from the sequences and contexts of his anthropological studies, often by cropping the images, to isolate imagery of the heroic, traditional and quintessentially Swiss, alpine farm worker. Incidental to his imagery of traditional lifestyles, and as evidence of his own conservationist values, was his deliberate recording of the conflicting reactions to hydroelectric schemes in Switzerland which were to bring cheap electricity, but with the consequence of flooding of pastures and relocation of historic villages and their populations, as well as the industrialisation rural areas.Sunken valleys - new landscapes: History of reservoirs in Switzerland (in German)  International recognition  In 1952 Edward Steichen visited Switzerland to collect photographs for the show The Family of Man, and there he was introduced to photographers by Robert Frank.Kristen Gresh (2005) The European roots of The Family of Man , History of Photography, 29:4, 331-343 He selected a photograph by Brunner, probably shown to him by Swiss editor Arnold Kubler from Du magazineBachmann, D. 1996. \\"Der geduldige Planet.

The project was supported by the Aktion Bauernhaus ForschungWebsite for the Swiss Institute for Dwelling and Community Research the Institute which in 1944 initiated the project \\"Farmhouse Research in Switzerland\\", a postwar employment program for unemployed architects and technicians, to document the principal rural buildings of Switzerland using finances provided by the cantons. Comprehensive scientific evaluation was only possible from 1960 when financial support of the Swiss National Foundation for the Promotion of Scientific Research was secured. Brunner was to document all farmhouses in a Swiss district, and his photography for the huge project took twenty years, during which time he was not obliged to publish anything. It was completed only two years before he died in 1979. These photos are straightforward documentation, so his method is still more methodical, and more objective, eschewing the unusual angles of view in the earlier series for an analytic and exact rendering of the traditional buildings. Brunner also co-founded of the Swiss Agricultural Museum Burgrain in Alberswil. Before his death in 1979, he bequeathed his archives to the society of Swiss anthropology, where they are still available in his original archival system.Steiger, R. (1998).

The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent. The Apadana hoard is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis. The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by Erich Schmidt, in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard, which was visibly part of the foundation ritual of the Apadana, is dated to circa 515 BCE. Foundation tablets The gold and silver tablets retrieved from the stone boxes contained a trilingual inscription by Darius in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian, which describes his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription: Foundation hoard The coins found in the hoard were: * Northeastern deposit: Four gold lightweight Croeseids (Sardis mint), a tetradrachm of Abdera, a stater of Aegina. * Southeastern deposit: Four gold lightweight Croeseids (Sardis mint), three double-sigloi from Cyprus (one attributed to Lapethus, one to Paphos, and one to an uncertain mint). The Croesids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule. The deposit did not have any Darics and Sigloi, which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of Achaemenid coinage only started to be minted later, after 515 BCE. ;Symbolism According to numismat Martin Price, the coins in the hoard were probably selected not for the location they represented, but for the symbolic significance of their type. The lion attacking the bull in the Lycian coinage of the Croeseids had obvious symbolism for the Achaemenids, the griffin on the coin of Abdera may have been used as the symbolic guardian of gold, and the turtle of the coin from Aegina may have been chosen as a symbol of maritime power. ;Other coin types of the Apadana hoard File:CYPRUS, Lapethos.

The song was released by Darkroom and Interscope Records on a 7-inch vinyl as the seventh and final single from the EP on Record Store Day, along with a cover of \\"Hotline Bling\\". It was written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, with the latter solely handling the song's production. Musically a folk track, the lyrics of \\"Party Favor\\" address Eilish breaking up with her boyfriend. The song was ultimately certified gold in the United States and Canada by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Music Canada (MC), respectively. It was performed live by Eilish during her 2019 When We All Fall Asleep Tour. Background and composition \\"Party Favor\\" was released on a pink 7-inch vinyl as the seventh and final single from Don't Smile at Me on April 21, 2018, coinciding with Record Store Day for that year, along with a cover of \\"Hotline Bling\\", written by Canadian rapper Drake, as the B-side, by Darkroom and Interscope Records. The song title was also stylized in all lowercase. The cover version was later released for digital download and streaming in June 2018 by the aforementioned labels. \\"Party Favor\\" was written by Eilish and Finneas O'Connell, her brother and the track's sole producer and mixer. Kirsten Spruch of Billboard described the track's genre as \\"quirky adjacent\\" folk. According to Musicnotes.com, \\"Party Favor\\" is played in the key of C major, while Eilish's vocals span a range of A3 to A4. It is the only song on the EP that includes Eilish playing the ukelele. In the lyrics, the song starts with a phone ringing and someone saying, \\"Hey, leave a message.\\" It then slowly formats to a voicemail with Eilish explaining that she is leaving a boy who has become too possessive over her, and trying everything to get him out of her life: \\"Look, now I know, we coulda done it better/But we can't change the weather/When the weather's come and gone/Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards/You'll single out the wrong words/Like you mishear all my songs.\\" Eilish warns her lover that she is done. Halfway through the song, Eilish then reveals that she's dumping her boyfriend on his birthday: \\"You just want what you can't have/No way/I'll call the cops/If you don't stop, I'll call your dad.\\" Sam Moore of NME described the genre of Eilish's cover of \\"Hotline Bling\\" as \\"delicate indie pop\\" compared to the original version. Reception Thomas Smith from NME said the song was \\"a far cry from her now-relentless and brooding productions, but still irresistibly catchy.\\" Insiders Claudia Willen placed the song at number 29 on her Every Billie Eilish song, ranked list, with Willen calling it \\"a creative and brutal portrayal of just how ruthless breakups can be,\\" though stated that \\"the song doesn't beg to be listened to on loop as some of Eilish's other breakup songs do, like 'Watch' and 'Bitches Broken Hearts'. Spruch commented that \\"Party Favor\\" can \\"be easily overlooked when standing next to early hits 'Bellyache' and 'Ocean Eyes',\\" but that it \\"still has a whole lot of that Eilish persona.\\" Commercially, the track has been certified gold in the United States and Canada by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Music Canada (MC), respectively.

The bill would establish a Copyright Claims Board within the Copyright Office to hear these claims. The Librarian of Congress would appoint three Copyright Claims Officers to preside over the tribunal. The bill limits damages to 15,000 per work, and $30,000 total per claim. If copyright owners do not register the work in accordance with Section 412 of the Copyright Act, \\"statutory damages may not exceed $7,500 per work infringed, or a total of $15,000 in any one proceeding.\\" The measure was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on May 1, 2019, and was passed on October 22, 2019. An identical version was introduced in the United States Senate on May 1, 2019.  History  In March 2006, the House Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property held a hearing titled ‚ÄúRemedies for Small Claims Copyright.‚Äù The Copyright Office subsequently published a report on alternatives to federal litigation for copyright claims. Previously, Hakeem Jeffries introduced the CASE Act in 2016 and 2017. The House Committee on the Judiciary held a legislative hearing on the 2017 version of bill on September 27, 2018. Judy Chu (D-CA) and Lamar Smith (R-TX) introduced similar legislation on December 8, 2016, titled the Fairness for American Small Creators Act. Congressional Action The CASE Act of 2019 was introduced on May 1, 2019, in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 2426)H.R. 2426, U.S. Congress. by Representatives Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Doug Collins (R-GA); and for the first time in the Senate (S. 1273)S. 1273, U.S. Congress. by Senators John Kennedy (R-LA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI). Original House co- sponsors include: House Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and House Committee on the Judiciary Intellectual Property Subcommittee Chairman Hank Johnson (D-GA), as well as Martha Roby (R-AL), Judy Chu (D-CA), Ben Cline (R-VA), Ted Lieu (D-CA), and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA). On October 22, 2019, the House passed H.R. 2426 by a vote of 410-6. Fifteen Members of Congress did not vote. The six \\"no\\" votes were: Justin Amash (I-MI), Warren Davidson (R-OH), Greg Gianforte (R-MT), Trent Kelly (R-MS), Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Ralph Norman (R-SC). On September 12, 2019, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary approved the measure without amendment. Support On June 26, 2019, in a statement to the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Register of Copyrights Karyn A. Temple expressed the U.S. Copyright Office‚Äôs support for a small claims tribunal system. In her statement, she noted that ‚Äú...low-dollar but still valuable copyrighted works are frequently infringed with impunity, and individual creators and small businesses often lacking [sic] an effective remedy... For this reason, the Copyright Office strongly supports a small claims tribunal structured along the lines of the proposal detailed in the Copyright Office‚Äôs 2013 report.\\" The bipartisan legislation is also supported by groups such as the Copyright Alliance, Professional Photographers of America, American Society of Media Photographers, International Authors Forum, the Authors Guild the Graphic Artists Guild, the NAACP, AFL-CIO, the American Conservative Union, and the American Bar Association,The Case for the CASE Act - The Hill as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and thousands of independent creators and small businesses across the United States. Proponents of the bill support the Copyright Office‚Äôs findings that the small claims tribunal will provide a more financially accessible alternative to federal court, and will enable creators to protect their copyrighted material more effectively. Additionally, the small claims court would be able to pass judgement on whether or not use of a copyrighted work constitutes fair use, protecting good-faith users from litigious retribution. In response to criticism concerns, a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Intellectual Property on July 30, 2019, Register Temple said, ‚ÄúI am pleased to note that the legislation that was recently passed out of the full Senate Judiciary Committee contains several provisions to help address these concerns... These provisions, combined with the extensive notice requirements and due process safeguards for respondents, would provide important safeguards against the use of the CCB by bad faith claimants.‚Äù  Criticism  Public interest groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Public Knowledge, and the Authors Alliance have opposed the bill, claiming that the CASE Act is still not enough to appropriately protect individuals from \\"sophisticated actors\\" (corporations, copyright \\"trolls\\" and similar abusers). These critics argue that: * a copyright office tribunal established outside of the judicial system will be unconstitutional * an opt-out system from this tribunal will open up unknowing parties to be blindsided with little recourse * the tribunal's statutory limits allows for much too steep of penalties ReferencesFurther reading External links * Full text of House bill 3945 * Full text of House bill 2426 * Full text of Senate bill 1273 United States copyright law Proposed legislation of the 115th United States Congress Proposed legislation of the 116th United States Congress Copyright infringement ","title":"CASE Act"},{"id":"59111076","text":"John Minet Henniker-Major, 3rd Baron Henniker, born John Minet Henniker, (20 November 1777 ‚Äì 22 July 1832) was a British peer and barrister.

It was written by showrunner, head writer and executive producer Chris Chibnall, directed by Wayne Yip, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 1 January 2019. The special follows the eleventh series as a New Year's Day special episode, instead of the traditional annual Christmas special. \\"Resolution\\" is the only episode of Doctor Who to air in 2019, preceding the twelfth series in 2020. The episode stars Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, alongside Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, and Mandip Gill as her companions, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan, respectively. The episode also sees the return of the Daleks. The episode was watched by 7.13 million viewers.  Plot  In the 9th century, three opposing factions narrowly succeeded in defeating a seemingly unbeatable enemy and hacked its body into three pieces to be hidden away in farthest corners of the Earth. The holder of the last piece is killed before he can bury the piece; which is subsequently discovered by Lin and Mitch, two archaeologists, in Sheffield on New Year's Day 2019. The last piece is unintentionally revived as it remotely summons the other two fragments to become whole. Whilst watching New Year's Day fireworks from different time periods, the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions are alerted to this alien presence, arriving in the present day and meeting the two archaeologists. Lin reveals that she saw a large squid-like creature on a wall; the Doctor finds only a blob of slime. Unbeknownst to the others, the creature has attached itself to Lin's back and has taken control of her mind and body. Returning to Graham and Ryan's home, the crew discover that Ryan's hitherto absent father, Aaron, has returned, and wishes to make amends with his son for not being there, especially since Grace‚Äôs death. Graham is sceptical but supports Ryan when he decides to go with Aaron to a local cafe so the two can talk. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Yasmin try to follow the creature, which has made Lin steal a police car and uniform. After examining the slime, the Doctor discovers that she is following a scout Dalek. The Dalek, still controlling Lin, arrives at an archive base, killing its guard and using his fingerprints to access to the archives. Recovering a Dalek ray gun from the archive, she then travels to a rural warehouse, killing the owner and constructing a makeshift Dalek casing out of scrap metal. Eventually, the Doctor and company find Lin freed from the now-rebuilt Dalek's control. After killing a military patrol, the Dalek flies to Government Communications Headquarters, massacring the staff, and attempts to summon the Dalek fleet in order to conquer the Earth. The Doctor, her TARDIS crew, Aaron and the two archaeologists immediately go to GCHQ and scupper the fleet- summoning signal, destroying the Dalek's casing in the process. However, the mutant survives and possesses Aaron, threatening to kill him unless the Doctor takes it to Skaro to rally the fleet. The Doctor agrees, but instead takes the Dalek mutant to a supernova. Ryan saves Aaron at the last moment as the Dalek mutant is cast into the supernova. Back in Sheffield, Ryan offers Aaron the chance to travel in the TARDIS, but Aaron declines. The TARDIS crew bid farewell to Aaron and the archaeologists and depart.

Biography William Synge was born in 1826 to the Rev. Robert Synge, M.A. (d. 1862), by his first wife, Anne (d. 1844), daughter of William Follett. After being educated almost entirely abroad, he joined the Foreign Office on 26 June 1846. He served in the British legation at Washington from 15 September 1851 to 1 July 1853, during the presidency of Millard Fillmore. Whilst there he married, on 27 January 1853, Henrietta Mary, youngest daughter of Robert Dewar Wainwright, colonel in the United States army. Returning to the UK, he began his literary career in his leisure time, writing in a journal called The Press. His contributions to Punch began during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), and include a well-received poem, Sursum Corda (Lift up your Hearts - Punch, November 1854) which reflected on the bloody Battle of the Alma (20 September 1854). On 26 July 1856 he was appointed secretary to Sir William Gore Ouseley‚Äôs special mission to Central America, which sought to resolve Britain's interests in Central America, particularly the Bay Islands off Honduras, the Mosquito Coast and Greytown, and during his absence on that mission obtained the rank of assistant clerk at the Foreign Office on 7 December 1857. While with Ouseley, in 1859, he met Anthony Trollope, who describes Synge as 'a very prince of good fellows ... as pleasant a companion as a man would wish to meet', albeit perhaps disapproving of Synge's Tory politics. Synge returned to work in London on 28 February 1860. He was appointed commissioner and consul-general for the Sandwich Islands (nowadays the Hawaiian Islands) on 27 December 1861, and in that capacity stood proxy for the Prince of Wales at the christening of Albert Kamehameha, the prince of Hawaii. In 1865 he escorted Queen Emma of Hawaii to England. On 30 October 1865 he became consul-general and commissary judge in Cuba; but here his health, already impaired, gave way, and he retired from the foreign service on 31 October 1868. Settling first at Guildford, and then in 1883 at Eastbourne, Synge gave himself up to literature. He wrote regularly for The Standard. In 1875 he published his first novel, Olivia Raleigh, which was well-received in a Spectator review; in 1883 he began to contribute to the Saturday Review. Synge was a friend of William Makepeace Thackeray, and shared with him an interest in nonsense verse, which later gave rise to Synge's Bumblebee Bogo‚Äôs Budget, a book of rhymes for children. Synge was also acquainted with many of the writers of his time, both in England and America. Besides his contributions both in prose and verse to periodicals, the more notable of which are Sursum Corda and A Patriot Queen (Blackwood's Magazine, February 1878), he published two novels and a book of children's verse. William and Henrietta had four sons and a daughter, one of whom, Robert, went on to serve in the Foreign Office, rising to Assistant Master of the Ceremonies before his untimely death. * Robert Follett Synge - b. 8 December 1853 * Francis Julian Synge - b. 2 July 1856 * Gilbert Hugo Follett Synge - d. 18 March 1868 * William Makepeace Thackeray Synge - b. 5 August 1860 * Maria Montresor Auchmuty Synge William Synge died at Eastbourne on 29 May 1891.

MFM is a kind of functional modeling employing the concepts of abstraction, decomposition, and functional representation. The approach regards the purpose, rather than the physical behavior of a system as its defining element. MFM hierarchically decomposes the function of a system along the means-end and whole-part dimensions in relation to intended actions. Functions are syntactically modeled by the relations of fundamental concepts contributing as part of a subsystem. Each subsystem is considered in the context of the overall system in terms of the purpose (end) of its function (means) in the system. Using only a few fundamental concepts as building blocks allows qualitative reasoning about action success or failure. MFM defines a graphical modeling language for representing the encompassed knowledge.  History  MFM originated as a modeling language for capturing how human operators identify and handle unknown operation situations in order to improve the design of human-machine interfaces.  Syntax  MFM concepts for functions and relations MFM describes the function of a system as a means for a specific end in terms of mass and energy flow. The flow is the defining element for the underlying function concepts. The concepts of transport and barrier play the most important role, as they connect pairs of the other function types, reflecting the physical flows in the system. Sink and source functions mark the boundary of the considered system and the end or beginning of a flow. Storage and balance concepts can both be collection or splitting points for multiple flow paths. Accordingly, valid MFM syntax requires a transport or a barrier linking two functions of the remaining four types. In addition to the flow within one perspective (mass or energy) MFM connects the influence between mass and energy by the means-end relations (mediate and producer-product) as well as the causal links introduced by the way the system is controlled by using separate control flow structures. Diagnostic information about the causality between abnormal states through the system is inferred from the physical effect between the functions. Petersen distinguishes direct and indirect influence between functions: * Direct influence is the effect of a transport taking in mass or energy from the upstream function and passing it on to the downstream function. * Indirect influence, on the other hand, is derived from different physical implementations and represented by influence or participate relation of another function toward the transport. The state of transport can be affected e.g. by an abnormal state of influencing downstream storage, while the state would not be affected by a participating one. According to the underlying physical interpretation inference rules for all possible patterns of flow functions have been established. Zhang compiled these patterns and the implied causality.  Example  The MFM diagram of a heat pump reflects the overarching objective (cob2) of maintaining the energy level on the warm side constant. The energy flow structure efs2 shows the system function from the most prevalent (energetic) perspective which is further decomposed in the mass flow of coolant (mfs1) as the means for the desired energy transport. Further hierarchical analysis produces efs1 that represents the energy needed for the pump as a means to produce a part of the mass flow. The operational constraints introduced by control systems such as a water flow controller are modeled by cfs1 and a temperature controller cfs2. { alt= alt= }  Application  MFM based solutions for many aspects of industrial automation have been proposed. Research directions include: * Plant wide diagnosis * Alarm Management * Risk Assessment * Automatic procedure generation  References  Automation software Knowledge engineering ","title":"Multilevel Flow Modeling"},{"id":"59111249","text":"Vecna Robotics, Inc. is an American robotics and technology company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Incorporated in 2018 as a spin-off from Vecna Technologies, the company specializes in automated material handling, hybrid fulfillment and workflow optimization for industrial applications. In December 2017, the firm won the DHL & Dell Robotics Innovation Challenge for developing the Tote Retrieval System (TRS), an automated guided vehicle (AGV) capable of warehouse navigation and mobile piece-picking from conventional shelves. History Vecna Robotics originated as a division of Vecna Technologies, which had been founded in 1998 by MIT engineering alumni, Daniel Theobald. According to a December 2017 profile of Theobald by Forbes contributor, Frederick Daso, the company name ‚ÄòVecna‚Äô is derived from the Czech word vƒõƒçn√Ω, fem. vƒõƒçn√°, meaning ‚Äòeternal‚Äô. Vecna Technologies focused primarily on health-care software development, while the robotics division engaged in research for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The company was later based in Cambridge, MA and supported efforts to build the Massachusetts Robotics Cluster. In the mid-2000s era, Vecna Robotics received funding from the U.S. Army, DARPA and other government agencies to develop the Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot (BEAR). The humanoid robot was originally designed to rescue wounded soldiers from the battle field, but as the company refined and adapted its robotics software, other commercial applications became evident. In turn, Vecna Robotics abstracted its autonomy software or \\"brain\\" from the BEAR's physical hardware and utilized the same methodology to develop a range of logistics robots. In April 2012, the QC Bot, a robotic courier, was piloted in hospitals to distribute medicine and food. The company's product expansion continued in April 2017 when additional logistics robots became generally available to the industrial sector. Concurrently, Vecna Robotics was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Vecna Technologies. The separation positioned Vecna Robotics to seek outside investment as well as specialize in autonomous mobile solutions for manufacturing and warehouse applications. In January 2018, Daniel Patt, the former Deputy Director of DARPA's Strategic Technology Office (STO), joined as CEO. The same year, Vecna Robotics spun out from former parent, Vecna Technologies. 60 existing employees transferred to positions in the new company. According to a filing with the SEC, Vecna Robotics reincorporated in Delaware and raised $13.5 million in a funding round that began August 14, 2018. The round was led by Columbus, Ohio-based venture capital firm, Drive Capital, and marked the first outside equity investment in the new company Vecna Robotics. In January 2020, an additional $50M in investment was announced along with a change of leadership as Theobald took over as CEO. Technology Vecna Robotics‚Äô automated material handling product line includes the RC20 Conveyor, RC500 Conveyor, RL350 Lifter, RL3600 Pallet Truck, RT4500 Tugger and the Tote Retrieval System (TRS). As of October 2018, the company's RL3600 Pallet Trucks were deployed at Milton CAT's Milford, Massachusetts distribution center to increase fulfillment speed. The RL3600 addressed the problem of retrieving slow-selling items stored at long walking distances. In March 2018, a fleet of six RT4500 Tuggers were profiled by Cade Metz in The New York Times as new ‚Äúrobotic colleagues‚Äù at the FedEx industrial shipping hub in Kernersville, North Carolina. In this warehouse application, the tuggers pull trains of carts with bulky goods such as car tires or canoes to manage a growing percentage of eCommerce orders for items unable to fit on conveyor belts. In addition to Vecna Robotics‚Äô hardware line, the company also developed artificial intelligence (AI) software designed to integrate warehouse management systems, robotics and human workflow.

A precondition for the new tank is the development of a new main cannon with better performance. German defence company Rheinmetall joined the program and will develop a new cannon Rheinmetall Rh-130 L / 51 with better performance than the Rheinmetall L/55 cannon which was introduced on the Leopard 2A6. Rheinmetall demonstrated a 130mm L51 at Eurosatory military trade fair in 2016. The first step in the MGCS program was a Franco-German technology demonstrator, to show that the two countries could jointly develop a next generation tank.

It was built from 1885. It is also known as Stafford Apartments and 75 Harrington Street; Clocktower Development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Between 1788 and 1816, the site which is now 67 Harrington Street formed part of the garden of the Colony's Hospital. When the hospital was moved in 1815, and development occurred around the property, this site remained undeveloped until the late 1880s, apart from a stable and other out buildings. By contrast, other blocks along the street, such as the adjacent block to the north (now 61-65 Harrington Street) were built on. The site had formerly been part of a large allotment extending to Cumberland Place granted to Thomas Weedon. Weedon continued as landlord until a date between 1867 and 1871, when Fredrick Oatley purchased the allotment. Around 1885, a two-storey rendered brick terrace was erected. This terrace adjoined numbers 61-65 Harrington Street. At this time, 67 Harrington Street was known as number 17 Harrington Street. In 1889 the number was changed to 29 Harrington Street. In 1891 the site was owned by Oatley and Cahill and is recorded as having six rooms with a slate roof. Oately remained the owner until when E. B. McKenny became the proprietor. In December 1900, Harrington Street was resumed by the NSW NSW Government as part of a Section 8 Observatory Hill lands, component of section 79 City of Sydney. In 1924 the numbering was changed to 67 Harrington Street; and it remained in residential use until 1978. The building is now part of the Clocktower Development designed by Michael Dysart, Architects, which comprises 55 serviced apartments, 35 shops, commercial office space and a car park constructed in 1986-89. The apartments are known as the Stafford Apartments.  Description  No 67 Harrington Street is a two-storey Victorian house, plastered and painted, set high on a rock base above the street and adjoins the terraces at Nos 61-65 Harrington Street. The detailing is simple, with moulded arches and label stops to windows and doors. The first floor windows rest on corbels. The steeply pitched roof is covered with corrugated iron.National Trust 1978 Style: Victorian Terrace; Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick, cement render; Roof Cladding: Iron. Potential archaeological resource. = Modifications and dates = *1986/87: The facades of the building was restored as part of the Clocktower development. The iron on the roof was replaced by slate, thought to be the original roofing material. Further research should be undertaken on the date of construction of the building and the extent of original fabric remaining. There is no evidence to suggest that the underfloor deposits for this building have been disturbed, leaving a possible archaeological resource.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, this terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has historical significance as part of the Colony's hospital site in 1807, and the building as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks. It has aesthetic significance as part of a strong visual precinct of buildings with Nos. 55-65 & 71 and Nos. 42-52 Harrington Street and the Harbour Rocks Hotel on the other side of the street, and also relates to the buildings at 39-47 Argyle Street. There is a potential archaeological resource remaining in the underfloor area of this site with significant research value into the hospital garden and subsequent site development. This has the potential to add to knowledge about the history of settlement in this area, the earliest European settlement in Australia.

When music is heard in the distance announcing the arrival of Leda, with her attendants, he drives away the nymphs, dryads, and faun, and conceals himself among the flowers. Leda prepares for her morning bath, expressing the hope that she will again meet the beautiful swan ‚Äì Zeus in disguise ‚Äì who often meets her at this spot. She and her women undress and plunge into the river; the swan appears, gliding towards Leda. The attendants raise their cloaks to hide from view the embrace with which the queen welcomes the bird; but Pierrot has seen all, and, furious with jealousy, he strikes the swan with his stick, inflicting a mortal wound, from which the bird soon dies, singing before he expires.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 29 April 1899, p. 13 Struck with remorse, Pierrot runs to hide himself in the laurel grove, but Leda wounds him with an arrow. She then orders her attendants to place the swan on a litter of branches and flowers; the funeral procession moves off, leaving Pierrot alone, weeping despairingly. The faun returns and advises him to impersonate the swan. He is white like his dead rival, and his wide sleeves resemble wings. If the moon goddess Selene would only bring on a momentary eclipse of the sun the deception could be easily carried out. The sky darkens; Leda and her women return, and are astonished when another swan comes gliding on the river towards the queen. Night comes on suddenly, but soon daylight returns, and in a final apotheosis there appear huge eggs, from which hatch three little Pierrots with swans' wings on their backs.

It was built from 1870 to . It is also known as Stafford Apartments and 75 Harrington Street; Clocktower Development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Between 1788 and 1816, the site which is now 61-65 Harrington Street formed part of the garden of the Colony's Hospital. When the hospital was moved in 1815, this opened up the land for development. The site appears to have been built on by 1822 and by 1835 according to Russell's Survey, it contained an L shaped building, which is also evident on a sewerage survey from . In 1845, one building was recorded on this site by Council, described as a four-room stone house with a shingled roof in \\"bad repair\\". The land was a Town Grant made to William Young; and Young is recorded as the owner by Council in 1851. From 1851-to the site changed hands on several occasions. Between 1867 and 1871 however, the earlier house was demolished. In 1871 the site is recorded as containing three two storey brick terrace houses with slate roofs. These are the terraces which remain on the site. Behind each of the houses was a divided yard which contained single storey buildings which abutted the main buildings. Behind these in the two northernmost yards were additional sheds and outhouses, though the exact form of these buildings is no known. In 1876, the buildings currently known as 61-65 Harrington St were numbered as 17-21 Harrington Street. The numbering again changed in 1889 to 23-27 Harrington Street. In 1900 the NSW Government resumed the site and buildings which were tenanted as residential units until the 1970s. The current numbering was brought into effect in 1924. The terrace is now part of the Clocktower development designed by Michael Dysart, Architects, which comprises 55 serviced apartments, 35 shops, commercial office space and a car park, constructed 1986-89. The apartments are known as the Stafford Apartments.  Description  61-65 Harrington Street is a mid-Victorian terrace, built , of three houses of two storeys raised from the road on a stone wall. The brickwork has been painted. The group forms a complement to Nos 42-52 Harrington Street, almost directly opposite, with the same flattened arch decoration above the windows and doors. The window pattern varies in each house, twelve pane double hung being the most common. The steeply pitched roof is covered with corrugated iron.National Trust, 1978. Style: Mid Victorian Terrace; Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick; Roof Cladding: Iron (probably slate originally). Potential Archaeological Resource. = Modifications and dates = *1986/87: The facades of the terrace were restored as part of the Clocktower development. The iron on the roofs was replaced by slate, thought to be the original roofing material. Further research should be undertaken on the date of construction of the building and the extent of original fabric remaining. There is no evidence that the underfloor deposits have been disturbed, leaving a possible archaeological resource.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, These terraces and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has historical significance as part of the Colony's hospital site in 1807, and as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks. The terrace has aesthetic significance as part of a strong visual precinct of buildings with Nos. 55-59 & 67-71, and Nos. 42-52 and the Harbour Rocks Hotel on the other side of the street, and also relates to the buildings at 39-47 Argyle Street. There is a potential archaeological resource remaining in the underfloor area of this site with significant research value into the hospital garden and subsequent site development. This has the potential to add to knowledge about the history of settlement in this area, the earliest European settlement in Australia.

It connects Winterthur with Romanshorn, where it formerly connected to train ferries over Lake Constance. It is the fourth oldest internal railway in Switzerland.The older lines are the Z√ºrich-Baden, Basel‚ÄìLiestal and Bussigny‚ÄìYverdon lines Its construction was to be funded by the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway (Z√ºrich- Bodenseebahn), but during the construction the company was merged with the Swiss Northern Railway (Schweizerische Nordbahn) to form the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB). The Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway was opened on 16 May 1855 and the line from Winterthur to Oerlikon was opened on 27 December 1855. Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof was reached on 26 June 1856 and the two existing NOB lines were connected. The Lake Constance train ferries on the Romanshorn‚ÄìFriedrichshafen and Romanshorn‚ÄìLindau routes were established to connect with this line.  History The line's genesis goes back to one of the oldest Swiss railway projects: an Eastern Railway (Ostbahn, Z√ºrich‚ÄìLake Constance) project was developed as early as 1836. This project, like the Northern Railway (Nordbahn, Z√ºrich‚ÄìBasel) and the Southern Railway (S√ºdbahn, Z√ºrich‚ÄìChur) was developed by Alois Negrelli and was to run from Winterthur via Frauenfeld to Romanshorn, while a slightly different route was proposed between Z√ºrich and Winterthur. in Z√ºrich for example, a separate station was planned in the Oberstrass area. From there, the line ran around the Z√ºrichberg to Stettbach, to cross the Glatt at D√ºbendorf. Then it went via Hegnau and Kindhausen to Rikon, now a district of Effretikon. After that, the line would have largely followed the route of the current railway. Negrelli himself gave this the least chance of financial success of the three projects he had designed. Any chance of the project proceeding ended with the political change of 1839 when the liberal forces in the canton of Z√ºrich were ousted by the conservatives. Negrelli left Z√ºrich in 1840 and worked in Austria at the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway as Inspector General. He later came back to Switzerland, but he was only involved in the construction of the Northern Railway. The political situation in Switzerland at that time was not favourable for the building of railways, but it was dominated by the conflict between the Catholics and Protestants, which culminated in the Sonderbund War of 1847. The situation changed fundamentally only with the new national constitution and the abolition of domestic tariffs. Alfred Escher, who was at the centre of Swiss politics and would have a major influence on the railway history of Switzerland, was elected to the first Swiss parliament in 1848. His political philosophy was usually described as a legalradikal (legal radical), but this is an inaccurate description of his politics: he was a supporter of what we understand today as a free market economy. He knew that healthy financial growth was only possible through improved transport links with other markets, and for that the railway was the tool of the times. He is considered one of the main advocates of the 1852 Railway Act (Eisenbahngesetz), which put the construction of railways in private hands. The Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway was his first major project and the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway was authorised to build it on 28 February 1853. The first president of the Z√ºrich-Bodenseebahn-Gesellschaft, Melchior Ziegler, was soon replaced by Escher. An agreement for the Swiss Northern Railway to merge with the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance railway to form the Swiss Northeast Railway was signed by Escher on behalf of the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway, as newly appointed director of the Northeastern Railway and as the president of the canton of Z√ºrich. While the determination of the final route had begun in 1850, the final alignments for all sections were not determined until 1853, meaning that in some places construction began immediately after the determination of the route. In addition to the terminuses in Romanshorn and Z√ºrich the plans included the following stations: Amriswil, Riedt, B√ºrglen, Weinfelden, M√§rstetten, Felben, Frauenfeld, Islikon, Ruchegg, Winterthur, Rikon (Effretikon), Wallisellen and Oerlikon. Two of these stations were relocated: Wiesendangen replaced Ruchegg and Sulgen replaced Riedt. The local authorities have called for additional stations, but only the two requests that promised additional freight traffic were acted on. It was agreed to build industrial connections from the line to the copper mill in Kupferhammer near Kemptthal and at Haslim√ºhle in M√ºllheim-Wigoltingen. Stations at Oberach, H√ºttingen, Oberwinterthur and Baltenswil, which were primarily intended to benefit the local population, were all rejected. The Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway was built as a single track and opened on 16 May 1855. Preparations for duplication had been made during the planning, but duplication did not begin until the line was taken over by the SBB. The two parallel tracks between Winterthur and Oberwinterthur, which were built separately by the NOB and SNB, were merged in 1903 to form a double-track line. The foundation for the second track had to be built on the rest of the line first. The sections of double-track were opened in the following order: * Frauenfeld‚ÄìM√ºllheim on 1 October 1905 * Oberwinterthur‚ÄìWiesendangen on 1 May 1906 * Islikon‚ÄìFrauenfeld on 1 May 1906 * M√ºllheim‚ÄìSulgen on 1 May 1907. * Sulgen‚ÄìAmriswil on 1 July 1907 * Wiesendangen‚ÄìIslikon on 4 July 1907 * Amriswil‚ÄìRomanshorn on 30 September 1907 The line was used by the world's first diesel-powered locomotive (a diesel-mechanical locomotive) in the summer of 1912, but it was not a commercial success. As a main line, it was quickly electrified by the SBB with its normal power system of 15 kV AC 16.7 Hz. Electrical operations on the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn line commenced on 4 May 1928.  Route and stations Winterthur station Winterthur station was built west of the Altstadt (old town). Running towards Romanshorn, the Thur valley line curves to the right, while the line to Schaffhausen branches off to the left. The Winterthur depot was built in the resulting triangle, but it now has only minor importance apart from the stationing of a fire and rescue train. The work of the depot has been outsourced to the S-Bahn depot in Oberwinterthur. The line on the exit from Winterthur station along the Stadtrain has been quadrupled. The former track of the Z√ºrich-Lake Constance Railway is now the second northernmost. After completing the four tracks to Oberwinterthur and Gr√ºze, a separate track was created for each rail company and line. In 1903, the two adjacent track tracks between Winterthur and Oberwinterthur were merged to create a genuine double-track line. After it has separated with a left turn from the lines to St. Gallen and to the T√∂ss valley, the Romanshorn line reaches Oberwinterthur station. This was built in 1875 by the National Railway; its line from Etzwilen used the Lake Constance Railway‚Äôs route from here to Winterthur. The Baroque Revival station building was built by the Swiss Federal Railways (Schweizerische Bundesbahnen, SBB). With the opening of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn in 1990, the seven-hectare Oberwinterthur maintenance facility was opened south of the line towards Romanshorn. On the other side of the track is the Swiss Science Center Technorama. Wiesendangen station came to public notice in 1975 when the SBB had the unique and valuable building in the Swiss chalet style demolished at 5 AM on a Monday. The high-point of this section is reached between Wiesendangen and Rickenbach. The Rickenbach-Attikon station building dates back to 1907, this station was only opened on 15 October 1907. After Attikon, the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn line runs over a three kilometre-long embankment while descending 85 metres to the Thur valley. Islikon station is now operated on the Stationshalter (station holder) modelThis refers to abandoned station buildings being run as small businesses that also sell train tickets as agents for the SBB and still has the station building of 1873. After Islikon station, a siding branches off to the north to the Frauenfeld sugar factory, the large- scale facilities of which are built next to the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn line until shortly before the town of Frauenfeld. Frauenfeld station Frauenfeld station, which serves the capital of the canton of Thurgau, has a large and stately entrance building. Trains on the Frauenfeld‚ÄìWil railway have departed from the station forecourt since 1887. The station was extensively expanded with the establishment of the place-of-arms and rebuilt under the Rail 2000 program, but it was one of the last major stations with ground-level passenger access to the platforms. During the renovation, an underground roundabout was built under the station forecourt, the neo-classical entrance building built in 1859 was carefully renovated and a 420 metre-long island platform was built, which is covered by Switzerland's second longest platform canopy. While the goods shed was demolished, the neo-classical military warehouse building was converted into a park-and-ride garage. The locomotive shed built in 1890 is now used by the SBB construction service. A siding connects to the Frauenfeld parcel post centre, which was opened in 1999 on the northern side of the line. Felben-Wellhausen station probably has the first goods shed on the line, with parts of it built in 1855. The present entrance building was built in 1873. H√ºttligen-Mettendorf station developed from a halt to a station and has been downgraded to a halt again. The line crosses the Thur before M√ºllheim-Wigoltingen station. The Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn line makes an S-curve, in the middle of which is the Eschikof bridge. The initially single-track covered bridge was replaced during the duplication of the track in 1903 by a new bridge that consists of two adjoining 174 metre-long steel truss bridges. M√ºllheim-Wigoltingen station was built with a medium-sized entrance building. A goods shed was added to this in 1862 and it was extended in 1871. A waiting room annex was built on the other side in 1894. On 19 May 1863, there was a collision between a passing express train with a stopping passenger train in the station due to wrongly-set points. Two railway employees were injured so severely that they died and another survived seriously injured. An unspecified number of passengers were slightly injured, although their carriages were smashed. M√§rstetten station received a shelter in 2001 under the Facelifting Stationen program. Weinfelden station Weinfelden station has been a railway junction since 1911, when, the Mittelthurgaubahn company opened the Wil‚ÄìKreuzlingen railway. The company established its depot here and its line crosses the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn line. B√ºrglen station received a medium- sized entrance building with a gable that faced the track in 1866. Sulgen station has been a junction station since 1876. The Bischofszellerbahn company, which opened the Sulgen‚ÄìGossau railway on 1 February between Sulgen and Bischofszell-Stadt, also built a locomotive shed at the station. This is now the home of a branch of Eurovapor. Erlen station has a converted station building that was originally built in 1873 and the goods shed built in 1859 still exists. Oberaach station still has a station building built in 1907, but it has been privatised. The station itself was only opened on 1 February 1908. The station was closed for passenger traffic in 2001 and replaced by a new station of the same name a few hundred metres to the east. This avoided the need to construct a passenger underpass, because the road overpass can be used for access. Amriswil station was already equipped in 1855 with a freight yard and in 1867 with a stately station building. The station building was demolished in modern times and the freight tracks were dismantled. Since 2004, it has only been a halt from a railway technical point of view. The station building is now a functional, single-storey building with a flat roof, but it is still occupied commercially and still includes a travel agency and money transfer service. Romanshorn station Romanshorn station is a terminus at a port and has an extensive track layout and a train depot. The Romanshorn marshalling yard, which is located on the line to Romanshorn and was opened on 15 October 1869, was closed in 1997. Trains from the line from Winterthur gained access to the yard via a connecting loop; the depot is located in the triangle of tracks thus formed. This single-track line is still used today by the freight trains from the upper Rhine Valley and Rorschach towards the Limmattal marshalling yard, but not by scheduled passenger trains. The passenger station was completely renewed in 2004, while the entrance building, which was built between 1853 and 1855, has been preserved.  Operations The Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway has always been used by fast trains on the Z√ºrich‚ÄìRomanshorn route (in 2010, InterCity trains ran between Romanshorn and Brig) and Regional trains on the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn route. Since the introduction of Rail 2000, an express has run on the Z√ºrich‚ÄìWeinfelden‚ÄìKonstanz route (in 2010, an InterRegio service had run on the Konstanz‚ÄìBiel/Bienne route) has been added. Both services are occasionally run as tilting train (ICN) services with RABDe 500 sets, but are usually run as commuter trains with Re 460 locomotives and Einheitswagen IV or IC2000 coaches. Regional services have terminated in Weinfelden since the introduction of the St. Gallen S-Bahn: since then the regional trains designated as the S7 have run from Romanshorn to Weinfelden, while the regional services of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, now called the S30, run only between Weinfelden and Winterthur. For this purpose, the S30 is supplemented during the day from Monday to Friday by the extended S8 (Z√ºrich S-Bahn) service running on a fairly irregular half-hourly pattern. S5 (S-Bahn St. Gallen) services were also added between Sulgen and Weinfelden, continuing on the Sulgen‚ÄìGossau railway. There are additional night S-Bahn services during the nights from Friday to Saturday and from Saturday to Sunday. The Thur valley line has lost some importance for freight transport since the closure of the marshalling yard in Romanshorn. Nevertheless, freight trains from the Rhine Valley and from Lake Constance are routed to Limmattal marshalling yard, as Buchs marshalling yard serves only as a distributing point, but not as a collecting point for national single-wagon traffic. As a transit route, it is only used by trains destined to Wolfurt marshalling yard. Freight trains across the Arlberg usually use the border crossing at Buchs. In addition, several parcel post trains run to the parcel post centre in Frauenfeld and every autumn many sugar beet trains run to the Frauenfeld sugar factory. The Thur valley line is often used by experimental trains and new trains being tested because it has enough capacity and enough alternative tracks and sidings that can be easily used outside the sugar beet season.  Modernisation  At the moment (2015‚Äì2017), the Winterthur‚ÄìRomanshorn railway is being modernised from Winterthur to Weinfelden in order to increase the maximum speed from 125 km/h to 150 km/h. The travel time should be shortened by five minutes. The straightening of a section of track that was originally planned was omitted for cost reasons.

The main difference between the Renown and its predecessor was the chassis design, the Renown was designed as a complete chassis, rather than integral construction adopted by the Bridgemaster, thus the Renown could be suited to different body designs. The design, like the Bristol Lodekka and the Dennis Loline meant this double-decker could travel under low height bridges, whilst maintaining near-full-height standing room. After Leyland acquired 25% stake of Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works in late 1965, Leyland had three different front-engined low-height double-deck designs: AEC Renown, Bristol Lodekka and Albion Lowlander. Leyland quickly decided to cease taking orders for the Renown and Lowlander. The last AEC Renown was delivered in 1967, with a total of 251 buses built.

He was one of the leaders of National communism's movement. Shumskyi actively supported Ukrainization. He was one of the victims of the Soviet regime. He was followed, arrested and then killed by NKVD in 1946. A few years later in 1958 he was rehabilitated. Biography=Earlier period and 1905 Revolution= Shumsky was born in the village of Turchynka, Volhynian Governorate (today Zhytomyr Oblast) in a family of foresters.Papakin, H. Alexander Shumsky (–®–£–ú–°–¨–ö–ò–ô –û–õ–ï–ö–°–ê–ù–î–† –Ø–ö–û–í–ò–ß). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine.

In his article Yuriy Shapoval indicates that Shumnsky was not fully truthful about his origin possibly due to the practice of posing oneself in early Soviet history as of lower class. In reality father of Shumsky Yakiv Danylovych worked as a forester for the landowner Mikhail Muravyov. Muravyov was the one established the train station in Nova Borova which originally was known as Turchynka. The State Archives of Zhytomyr Oblast showed that Yakiv Danylovych was married to his wife Yeva. Further study of archives discovered that his grandfather Danylo Yakovych was a second generation of priests and in 1862 he was specifically assigned to the village of Turchynka. In 1906 he finished a five-year public school in a village Saly. There is also information that Shumsky finished only two-year church parish school. After the school, he worked at sawmills, in land improvement (amelioration), as a surveyor assistant. In 1908 he joined workers' movement and the Ukrainian Social Democratic League (\\"Spilka\\"). In 1909 he participated in a strike at local sawmill. Since 1911 Shumsky attended the Shanyavsky Moscow People's University, but never finished. During that period he joined the Ukrainian socialist club in Moscow. In 1915 Shumsky received the certificate of matura through expedited testing and enrolled in the Moscow veterinary school. Since 1914 he was a member of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries (UPSR) and participated in \\"revolutionary activities\\". In 1916 Shumsky was arrested for spreading \\"revolutionary literature\\" and sent to serve military duty at the South Western Front (World War I). =Ukrainian revolution and war with Soviet Russia= At the frontlines Shumsky continued his revolutionary activity and after the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, he was elected as a delegate of soldiers' congress at various levels, corps, army, and front. In April 1917 Shumsky already was in Kiev where he became a member of the Kiev Governorate Land Committee (in preparation to upcoming land reform). At the 3rd Congress of UPSR (November 1917), he was coopted to the Central Committee of UPSR as one of leaders of the party's left wing and on the party list of UPSR he entered the Ukrainian Central Council (Ukrainian parliament). In the parliament he advocated left radical views on social and agrarian matters similar to those of the Bolsheviks. In 1918 Shumsky was elected to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly from the Volhynian Governorate. He also became one of authors of the Law of Ukraine about land adopted by the Ukrainian Central Council on 18 January 1918. On Shumsky was arrested after he with a group of left Ukrainian SRs and Social-Democrats attempted a coup-d'√©tat to dissolve the parliament (see January Uprising), but was freed by advancing Red Russian detachments of the Muravyov's troops which eventually sacked Kiev. At the 4th Congress of UPSR (May 1918) after his active support, the party's left wing announced liquidation of the party and transferring it underground. Shumsky defended the course to unfold the struggle against Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, and later the Direktoria, rapprochement with Bolsheviks, establishing in Ukraine Soviet in its form, but nationalist in its composition state. During 1918 he headed Volhynian Governorate Land Committee, member of the UPSR gubernatorial committee, member of underground revolutionary committee that was preparing anti-Hetman uprising in Zhytomyr. In the beginning of 1919 after his speech at the Labor Congress of Ukraine, Shumsky was arrested again, sentenced to death, but escaped out of escort. =Soviet regime and Russian civil war= From Spring of 1919 to March 1920 Shumsky was a leader of the Ukrainian Communist Party (Borotbists). His initiated attempt to created national communist party that would have been associated with Russian Bolsheviks through Communist International and become alternative to Party-Soviet system that was developing, failed because of its rejection by leadership of RKP(b) and personally by Lenin. Following establishment of the Soviet regime in Ukraine, Shumsky was added to collegium of People's Commissariat of Education of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (headed by Hnat Mykhailychenko). Soon in the summer of 1919 after the occupation of Ukraine by the Armed Forces of South Russia he had taken part in underground struggle against the Russian Whites and was a member of Galician Bureau at the Central Committee of the Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) of Ukraine. From under the pressure of Bolsheviks, the Ukrainian Communist Party (Borotbists) was dissolved and in March 1920 Shumsky was added to the Central Committee of the Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) of Ukraine as well as its Political and Organizational bureaus where he headed department in people relations with rural areas. In March 1920 he also was added to the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik). In May ‚Äì June 1920 Shumsky was a governor of Poltava region (head of Poltava gubernatorial committee and presidium of Poltava gubernatorial executive committee), in July ‚Äì August 1920 he was a head of Odessa gubernatorial revkom. In September 1920 Shumsky was in political administration and the Revolutionary Military Council of the 12th Army. After defeat of Pyotr Vrangel, Shumsky was a head of Kiev gubernatorial revkom, member of the Soviet delegation at the Riga talks with Poland. In April 1921 ‚Äì February 1923 he was plenipotentiary representative of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic to Poland (he left for Warsaw in October 1921). At that position Shumsky was actively requesting liquidation of Ukrainian emigrant organizations and internment camps for the Ukrainian People's Republic Army detachments. He was let go after separate embassies of Ukraine were replaced with one of the Soviet Union. Soon after being appointed to the position of ambassador, in May 1921 Shumsky also participated in show trials that took place in Kharkiv against the Central Committee of Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries where he served as a witness.Movchan, O. 1921 process of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist- Revolutionaries (–ü–†–û–¶–ï–° –¶–ö –£–ö–†–ê–á–ù–°–¨–ö–û–á –ü–ê–†–¢–Ü–á –°–û–¶–Ü–ê–õ–Ü–°–¢–Ü–í-–†–ï–í–û–õ–Æ–¶–Ü–û–ù–ï–†–Ü–í 1921). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. Since 1922 Shumsky was a member of the Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. =Commissar of Education and conflict with Kaganovich= Following return to Kharkiv (then, capital of Ukraine), Shumsky is at party work and at trade union work. On 29 September 1924 ‚Äì February 1927 he served as People's Commissar of Education of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. About that time he also served as a chief editor of a political magazine Chervonyi Shlyakh. At his commissariat position he actively was implementing reform of system of education institutions, policy of revival of national culture (Soviet policy of \\"Korenizatsiya\\") in educational institutions and state offices, supported development of Ukrainian culture and literature, particularly writer Mykola Khvylyovy. On the issue there took place a conflict with general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine Lazar Kaganovich who was appointed back in April 1925; Shumsky was requesting to replace him with Vlas Chubar. The argument was intervened by general secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Joseph Stalin who in his letter to members of Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine laying on Shumsky responsibility for spreading anti- Russian sentiments in Ukraine. In May 1926 at a plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine, Shumsky was forced officially recognize his mistake, but it did not save him. In 1927 he was removed from office in accusation of disruptive activities in the People's Commissariat of Education of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. In February‚ÄìMarch 1927 the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine ascertained existence of the Shumsky's \\"national deviation\\" (Shumkism). In protection of Shumsky reacted leading representatives of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine which led to the party's split and later its liquidation. After that, Shumsky was forced to leave Ukraine. =Exile and further persecution= In 1927‚Äì33 he was a rector of the Leningrad Institute of National Economy, Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, a deputy head of mass agitation department of the Central Committee of All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), a head of the Central Committee of Trade Union of Education officials, a Presidium member of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. Shumsky expected to return to Ukraine, but in Ukraine he continued to be persecuted; in 1930 at the 11th Congress of CP(b)U it was mentioned about defeat of Shumskism, in November 1933 at plenum it was talked about anti-party Shumsky group and \\"counterrevolutionary\\" essence of its national deviation. On 13 May 1933 he was arrested on charges in fabricated \\"UVO case\\" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After spending 2 years in Solovki prison camp of special assignment by decision of Special meeting at the NKVD of the Soviet Union on 10 December 1935 he was sentenced on charges in leadership of \\"counterrevolutionary borotbist organization\\" to 10 years exile to Krasnoyarsk. In 1936, demanding acquittal, Shumsky announced a hunger strike. In October 1937 he was accused in belonging to another nationalist organization of former Borotbists and was arrested in place of exile. Only in November 1939 the case due to lack of evidences was closed which did not become a reason for his acquittal. After the end of his sentence term (13 May 1943), Shumsky was left in Krasnoyarsk \\"on a treatment\\". Throughout his time of imprisonment, he did not stop fighting for his public rehabilitation, did not admit to any of allegations, repeatedly was appealing to the Central Committee of VKP(b). In his letter to Joseph Stalin on 18 October 1945 Shumsky sharply criticized the national policy of the Soviet Union, in particular exaltation of the Russian people as \\"senior brother\\". In the exile he was writing a monograph \\"Malorosy\\" (Little Russians), but destroyed it because of the impossibility of publishing. =After release= In 1946 Shumsky twice unsuccessfully tried to end his life in suicide. In September 1946 on his way to Ukraine, he was killed by special group of the Ministry of State Security of the Soviet Union on personal order of Joseph Stalin. On 11 September 1958 Shumsky was rehabilitated. NotesReferencesExternal links * Alexander Shumsky (–®—É–º—Å–∫–∏–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –Ø–∫–æ–≤–ª–µ–≤–∏—á). * Papakin, H.

Built at a time in which transatlantic crossings were risky, it acquired popularity during colonial times as a temple dedicated to travelers and navigators. Travelers and especially sailors would visit before leaving on a journey, and to pay their respects upon arriving back on land. Later during Cuba's republican era, the devotion to Santa Rita was added to the church. History Iglesia Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje. 1839 In the place that today occupies the church, in 1604 the congregants of the Third Franciscan Order, erected a modest hermitage called \\"Ermita del Humilladera\\" and had as its function the twelfth or final station of the Via Crucis. This ceremony started from the Convento de San Francisco and crossed the city from east to west along Calle de Las Cruces or Calle de la Amargura. Only the enclosure and cover of the central nave remain from that building. In 1640 the current Plaza del Cristo was built next to the church, which was then known as Plaza Nueva and the chapel became Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Viaje, replacing the one that existed from the previous century in the neighborhood of Campeche. In 1693 the temple was enlarged, rebuilt and converted into auxiliary of the Parochial Major Church by Bishop Diego Evelino de Compostela, who later elevated it to a parish in 1703. In 1899 the church was given to the parishioners of the Order of San Agust√≠n, who restored it. It was the second parish of the city, after the Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo. Architecture Iglesia Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje. Floor Plan The Augustinians began restoration efforts of Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje following the hurricane of 1926 when the architectural firm of Leonardo Morales y Pedroso, architects of the El Colegio de Belen, was contracted to renovate Santo Cristo. The original stone walls were demolished so as to expand the transept; new stonework replaced the original parts of the church, and decorative elements were modified. The aisles were enlarged and Tuscan columns were added; nine stone altars were added each devoted to a particular saint who had not previously been worshipped in at Buen Viaje. The crucifix of the original hermitage was hung on the church's back wall. In 1993 the ceiling of the presbytery collapsed. The wood ceiling has been restored since then. The Iglesia Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje is distinguished for its simplicity, symmetry and baroque fa√ßade; it is also notable for its twin hexagonal towers, the tower of the Epistle and the tower of the Gospel. The latter contains four bells, the oldest was cast in the year 1515. There is an outward flaring arch over the entryway. The nave has a Hispano-moorish Mud√©jar wood ceiling and an ancient crucifix which is over three centuries old. The Iglesia Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje was the last station on the Stations of the Cross, a procession that started at the old St Francis church and proceeded to el Santo Cristo through Calle Amargura. The church and its Plaza have received penitents in need of spiritual rest and comfort for centuries. Plaza de las Lavanderas Iglesia Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje_c 1930 In the mid-17-century, three blocks southeast of Parque Central and two blocks south of Calle Obispo, the small plaza takes its name from the Iglesia del Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje. Plaza del Cristo was created in 1640 when the square was first known as Plaza Nueva. The hermitage was the twelfth station of the V√≠a Crucis (Procession of the Cross), which took place annually during Lent and led along Calle Amargura from the Plaza de San Francisco. The Baroque Iglesia del Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje now covers the site of the old hermitage on the north-western side of the plaza. Of the original building, only the enclosure and painted wood ceiling still remain. Later, the square was briefly known as Plaza de las Lavanderas; ‚ÄúPlaza of the Washerwomen‚Äù, named because of the large number of Afro-Cuban washerwomen that met to attend mass. Graham Greene's used this small plaza for the setting of his protagonist Wormold (the vacuum-cleaner salesman-secret agent) was ‚Äúswallowed up among the pimps and lottery sellers of the Havana noon‚Äù in his film Our Man in Havana. Wormold and his daughter Milly lived at Lamparilla #37‚Äîa fictional address (one block west of the plaza) occupied by a small plaza. As in most of Navana, the predominantly residential 19th-century buildings surrounding the dilapidated square have fallen into a sad state of disrepair (even Wormold had sensed ‚Äúa slow erosion of Havana‚Äù); several have collapsed, while others threaten to do so. In 2014, a comprehensive restoration was initiated by the City Historian's Office.

The building was completed and opened in 1953, and was still being used as a cinema. History=Concept and construction= In March 1938, the City of Ufa accepted an initial general development plan stipulating that a two-hall cinema for 600 persons be constructed in the historical center of the city, at the intersection of Lenina and Chernyshevsky Streets. The following year, the Council of People's Commissars of the Bashkir ASSR approved the construction of the cinema, and engineering and geological surveys of the site were carried out. Soon afterwards, however, the government of the Republic issued a decree to construct a new cinema in the northern industrial district of Ufa, and then, following the intervention of World War II, the revised cinema construction plans were cancelled. In 1944, the central city cinema project was revived, when funds for a two-hall cinema were included the budget of the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the Bashkir ASSR. Further conceptual and design machinations ensued. Ultimately, the architect Semyon Yakshin designed a new project of a two-hall cinema for 700 persons. Although that design was based on Yakshin's own Udarnik Cinema project in Stalingrad (now Volgograd), it was modified by the transformation of the main fa√ßade into an eight-column Corinthian order portico modelled on that of another cinema in Stalingrad. The hybrid design was promptly approved, and in the summer of 1949 the construction plan completed. A single-storey pre-revolutionary L-shaped house occupying the site was then demolished to make way for the new cinema. As it was assumed that the staff of the nearby old –ö–∏–Ω–æ—Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä –û–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—å / Kinoteatr Oktyabr ('Cinema October') would transition to the new building, the director of the Oktyabr, Gabdrakhman Fattakhutdinov, supervised the construction of the new cinema from the outset, and then became its first director. On his initiative, part of the new cinema's basement was equipped as a documentary film hall with 60 seats. The construction work was also closely monitored by the architect, who made his final design and construction proposals in March 1953, only three months before the cinema was opened on 30 July 1953. =Operations= On opening day, thousands of Ufa residents visited the new cinema, and watched the movie \\"–ù–µ–∑–∞–±—ã–≤–∞–µ–º—ã–π 1919-–π –≥–æ–¥\\" / Nezabyvaemyy 1919 god (The Unforgettable Year 1919). The new cinema's two main auditoriums, each with 350 seats, were named \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\", respectively, and the small documentary hall was named \\"Green\\". Initially, the foyer was fitted with a stage on which pre-session jazz or classical concerts were played. Patrons could arrive early and enjoy ice cream at the cafe, ‚Äúplop‚Äù cologne from a vending machine, or admire locally drawn posters depicting new films; parents could leave their child in the children's playroom. During its early years, the cinema was surrounded by shabby low-rise houses. By the 1970s, the houses had been demolished, but they were replaced by tall buildings that overshadow the cinema. In the 1990s, the \\"Green\\" room was transformed into a music cafe, then a \\"Yellow Submarine\\", and later a blues club. It has since reverted to being a cinema. In the 21st century, the foyer has been used for personal appearances by film directors, and for art exhibitions; ice cream is still served there. Meanwhile, the auditoriums have hosted such attractions as theatre performances, film festivals, arthouse film shows, and movie marathons. Since 1996, the cinema has been a Center for Russian Cinematography. In 2003, a festive program was held to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The cinema now has a Dolby Digital Surround EX format sound system, comfortable soft seating, and, since December 2009, the \\"Red\\" room has been equipped to show films in 3D. The cinema's owner, State Unitary Enterprise \\"Cinema Rodina RB\\", was founded in 1992. On 13 March 2018, the Head of the Republic of Bashkortostan, Rustem Khamitov, issued a decree adding the Unitary Enterprise to the list of strategic enterprises of the Republic.

Her compilation of experimental data of the rates of nuclear reactions was instrumental in establishing the theory of nucleosynthesis that led to a Nobel Prize for William A. Fowler. Life Georgeanne Robertson was born on 25 October 1916, the fourth of five children of George Duncan and Anna (McLeod) Robertson, in Montesano, Washington. She attended the University of Washington where she received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1937. She married Charles Caughlan, a chemist, in 1936, with whom she had four children. She and Charles divorced in the early 1970s. After her children grew up, she started her doctoral studies at the University of Washington, receiving her PhD in 1964. She died on 3 January 1994. Career Caughlan joined Montana State University in 1957 as an instructor. Between 1961‚Äì63, she was a summer research fellow at Caltech, working with William A. Fowler on stellar energy generation. She became an assistant professor at Montana State University in 1961, proceeding to a full professorship in 1974. Upon her retirement in 1984, she was made Professor Emerita. =Energy and nuclear generation in stars= In the early 1960s, Caughlan began to collect experimental data on stellar nuclear reactions as part of Fowler's researches into energy generation. She transmitted them in handwritten letters to Fowler. Along with Fowler, Caughlan developed a standard format for the presentation of proton, deuteron and alpha particle reaction rates with nuclei from hydrogen to silicon. Fowler, in particular, recognised Caughlan's studies of stellar structure and the theoretical impetus from her that led to his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983. The compilations of astrophysical nuclear data by Caughlan (along with Barbara Zimmerman and Fowler) were published periodically, and were considered the 'bible' of nuclear astrophysics. During Caughlan's stint at Caltech, the first computations of the structure and evolution of stars became possible as computers developed to sufficient power. A computer program developed by Robert V. Wagoner to simulate the synthesis of 41 nuclei in stars required astrophysical rates from Caughlan's work. =CNO cycle= The carbon-nitrogen- oxygen (CNO) cycle is a process in stellar fusion that converts hydrogen to helium. In 1965, Caughlan computed that if a star exceeds thirty solar masses, the CNO cycle would result in nitrogen atoms outnumbering carbon and oxygen by a factor of 100. The star eta Carinae was determined to be in its final stages of life based on the observation of such nitrogen excess: its spectrum shows nitrogen lines but no oxygen lines.

It is the only Hebrew immersion camp in Western Canada. The camp attracts campers from Winnipeg, other parts of Canada and various cities in the United States. Camp Massad is a registered charity and an accredited member of the Manitoba Camping Association. History The camp was founded in 1953 by members of Habonim under the leadership of Soody Kleiman, supported by the Keren Hatarbut. Eddie Yuditsky, principal of the Winnipeg Hebrew School, served as Massad's first director and Leona Billinkoff as the first 'camp mother' (a position she would keep until 1978). The camp was officially incorporated as a branch of the Hebrew Camps Massad of Canada, Massad Gimmel, in 1962. The Hebrew Congregation of Winnipeg Beach synagogue, founded in 1950, moved to the site of Camp Massad in 1998.

Microphone blockers won't operate on smartphones or laptops because the microphone is controlled with software rather than a physical switch. Safety test Hardware devices should always be tested if it is controlled by software which renders a microphone blocker useless. This can simply be done by plugging a headset or a microphone to the jack try to activate the internal microphone (eg with speaker mode on smartphones or feature phones and speak near the phone while keeping the microphone at distance or plugged), or any program that always will use the internal microphone for other hardware devices like laptops. Working alternatives for modern hardware devices * Hardware kill switch (HKS): Some hardware devices can physically disconnect and/or cut power to integrated components with security switches. * Hacking of consumer electronics: Whistleblower Edward Snowden showed Wired correspondent Shane Smith how to remove the cameras and microphones from a smartphone. The only practical ways are to physically removing all the internal microphones (there can be more than one, like a noise cancellation mic) and only plug headsets and using the headset microphone to record when needed. * Modular hardware: Cameras and microphones can be physically removed from modular hardware. Smartphone incompatibility Microphone blockers, including commercial microphone blockers with a integrated circuit marketed to provide \\"extra security\\", are not useful for smartphones because it is controlled entirely by software. It can be demonstrated by connecting a microphone blocker to a smartphone, and make a phone call with speaker mode which will also active the internal microphone. However, although they would work, there are further problems: * Since Apple started to exclude the headphone jack in 2016 from iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and later versions, more and more phone companies are eliminating it. 3.5 mm TRRS male microphone blocker adapters with connectors to Lightning cables exist, and cables with USB-C connectors can be produced. Apple has filed dozens of wireless patents, and there are rumors that they are planning to produce products without lightning ports in the future to make them completely wireless. Bluetooth vendors advise customers with vulnerable Bluetooth devices to either turn them off in areas regarded as unsafe or set them to undiscoverable.Fuller, John, How Bluetooth Surveillance Works, http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/bluetooth- surveillance1.htm Portable Bluetooth adapters for wired headsets, can be used as workaround to connect the microphone blocker to wireless hardware devices with Bluetooth connectivity, however while making them susceptible to bluesnarfing. * Some hardware devices (eg some Google Nexus smartphones) have in addition to the internal recording microphone an internal noise cancellation microphone that may be on all the time, or that may be on in a way that is independent from what is plugged into the audio jack connector. Feature phone compatibility 3.5mm TRRS phone connector with CTIA standard A phone connector without a microphone channel cannot be used as a microphone blocker because it will not deactivate the external microphone. Three- or four-conductor ( or ) 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm sockets are common on older cell phones and newer smartphones respectively, providing mono (three conductor) or stereo (four conductor) sound and a microphone input, together with signaling (e.g., push a button to answer a call). =Older hardware devices= CTIA/AHJ is the de-facto TRRS standard. OMTP was mostly used on older hardware devices. However, the old mobile phones have a 2.5 mm jack connectors socket and cannot be used with modern microphone blockers that are typically 3.5 mm, but old mobile phones are notorious for their low security of the hardware itself. If a CTIA headset is connected to a mobile phone with OMTP interface, the external microphone will stay active. There, internal microphone will only be active when holding the microphone key on the headset. A standard TCIA/AHJ TRRS microphone blocker cannot be used with OMTP socket hardware devices and it is recommended to test all microphone blockers to make sure they really work. Operation Microphone blockers disable the internal microphone by tricking the device into believing an external microphone is connected. A 3.5 mm microphone blocker with just channel is enough to disconnect the internal microphone, but most commercial microphone blockers have connections which in theory makes them headset blockers that in smartphones also disconnect the internal speaker in media player software because they will try to connect to the headphones, while ringtones, and alarms, will functioning as normal because they will use both the internal speaker and the external speaker(s). Successful operation of a microphone blocker depends on the internal scheme of the mobile device, which may fully block the microphone without possibility of recovering data, or just disregard the signal from internal microphone with the possibility of recording if needed. =Issues= Some devices allow internal and external microphone works simultaneously or may not recognize when an external microphone is connected. Types=Microphone blocking plug= A microphone blocking plug. A microphone blocking plug is a phone connector with a microphone channel that cannot be used due to the plugged end. Some products are shipped with a female connectors (with a keychain hole, or a small strap attached directly to smartphone cases) to prevent loss when the male connector is detached. A mobile phone charm (especially with TRS connector instead of a rubber plug) can be used to conceal a dummy blocker. A microphone blocking plug can be used to debug software-defined radio that demands a connector to be plugged but they cannot be used to stream radio due to its low antenna efficiency. Life hack Common products that can be used as microphone blockers: * A soldering jack plug (TR, TRS, or TRRS), with metal or plastic base - A slim plug with right angle is recommended to fit the jack plug hole in smartphone cases and to not cause frictions in the socket. * A TRRS male-male jack plug cable - Another cheap solution that provides two microphone blocking plugs, the cost per plug is usually cheaper than commercial microphone blocking plugs. The cable can either be cut to provide two separate plugs or be left intact to allow plugging into two mobile phones. * A headphone cable with microphone, a wired headset, or a wired microphone - More expensive and will provide just one blocking plug. It's possible that microphone connectors without a microphone circuit like the above solutions offer low security, because when you plug a connector that has no microphone or microphone circuit, software has the ability to override the default behavior. =Microphone blocking adapter= Headset with an integrated microphone blocker also exist, allowing users to use the headphones (ie. for listening to music) without risking being eavesdropped. Microphone blocking adapters are phone connectors adapters with a microphone channel and a mechanism that produces a false positive signal simulating a connected microphone. This mechanism cannot be built by pairing multiple connectors: a headset connected to a 3.5 mm TRRS headset extension cable adapter further connected to a 3.5 TRS headphone cable adapter won't trick a connected mobile phone to disconnect its external microphone. Applications This section describes use for both microphone blocking plugs and adapters. =Use=Eavesdropping protection for feature phones A microphone blocker is a cheap, simple accessory that provides countersurveillance against eavesdropping, for example recording eavesdropping from interception (like cellphone surveillance), or phone hacking, but it doesn't work on smartphones because they are controlled by software. However, there are a variety of computing vulnerabilities like proprietary software and firmware, backdoors, hardware security bugs, hardware backdoors, hardware Trojans, spyware, and malware programs that can turn on a mobile device's microphone remotely, and the vast majority of devices do not have internal hardware protection to prevent eavesdropping. Most antivirus software, and anti-spying software does not guarantee that the microphone will be fully blocked or disabled and can even be prevented doing so by spyware and malware that are constantly changing and improving. Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed Vault 7 and dated from 2013 to 2016, described the capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare, including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones, turning them into permanent listening devices. Millions of smartphones could also be vulnerable to software cracking via accelerometers. A new acoustic cryptanalysis technique discovered by a research team at Israel's Ben-Gurion University Cybersecurity Research Center allows data to be extracted using a computer's speakers and headphones. Forbes published a report stating that researchers found a way to see information being displayed, by using microphone, with 96.5% accuracy. Pocket dialing protection A microphone blocker is useful to prevent a mobile phone against audio interception from pocket dialing. =Abuse=Social engineering A person can wiretap conversations from persons they with social engineering have deceived that microphone blockers are safe to use with smartphones. This can in theory be exploited by companies that manufacture and sell commercial microphone blockers if they require a mobile phone number when people order their products or ask for support. Marketing ethic issue Manufacturers of commercial microphone blockers with 3.5 mm phone jacks intended for smartphones, sometimes claim that they their blocker has an inbuilt semiconductor integrated circuit (sometimes patented form marketing purpose) that will offer superior security but doesn't give any security at all, they just deceive people to make money on them. This has raised questions about marketing ethics.

Altogether, Dark Harbor consumes one-quarter of the land in Islesboro. Many prominent families from New York, Philadelphia, and Boston took summer residency in Dark Harbor.  History  Dark Harbor, named for the synonymous meaning of obscure or hidden, was noted in the turn of the century for its picturesque summer cottages. Following the founding of the Islesboro Land and Improvement Company, the Dark Harbor summer resort began in 1888. The village was the third summer resort location to be built in Islesboro. Organized in 1902, The Dark Harbor Association was formed mostly of summer residents whose main goal was to improve and beautify the village. The association was responsible for installing and maintaining things like flower boxes, benches, and for mowing lawns. Since transportation was so limited in the early years, the summer resort built an entire community within the village. Vacationers on Dark Island had access to all of the normal luxuries like a grocery store, stables, blacksmith shops, other types of various shops, a Christ Church, a library, and even their own post office. Tennis, golf, and yacht racing were popular forms of entertainment for Dark Harbor's summer residents. Founded in 1896, The Tarratine Yacht Club provided the residents with a central place for all three sports. Throughout the years, Dark Harbor has been visited by various famous people such as former United States President, Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt visited his daughter, who vacationed on the island, in 1917. Mary Mallon, infamous for being the first named asymptomatic Typhoid carrier in the United States, also visited Dark Harbor in the early 1900s. Accompanying the family of J. Coleman Drayton, Mallon stayed on the island as a cook in 1902, infecting seven members of the family. Typhoid Fever was otherwise rare in the village of Dark Harbor.

Dollar had already agreed that in the event of the burgh adopting the Free Libraries Act that his library could be transferred to the town and the use of the premises be granted free of charge. In 1897 philanthropist and businessman Andrew Carnegie pledged ¬£2,500 to build a new library in the town, asking for the public to match his donation to fund the building of the a new premises.

As of 2018, WBG supports 25 active projects with funding of more than $3.95 billion. The WBG provides analytical and technical assistance in coordination with these projects. From 2007-2018 Tanzania maintained real GDP growth averaging 6.8% a year. Growth concentrated in the agricultural and transportation sectors. Complementing this growth, the poverty rate in Tanzania fell from 28.2% in 2012 to 26.9% in 2016. Debate exists over the validity of this growth as development may be unevenly dispersed among different geographic and income groups.  Strategy  The World Bank's 2017 Systematic Country Diagnostic Report identified multiple development barriers. These challenges include slow growth in per capita income, access to quality services, pervasive gender disparities, water depletion and weak governance of natural resources. The report identifies climate change as possibly leading to changes in rain patterns and rising sea levels, particularly affecting energy and agriculture. The World Bank's Country Partnership Framework 2018-2022 targeted three areas for improvement; * structural transformation to leverage Tanzania natural assets and capitalize on its comparative advantage to create new jobs; * spatial transformation to build on the country's geographic advantage and maximize benefits from spatial integration and agglomeration; * improving public infrastructure by expanding human capital, gender equity and macroeconomic stability.  Strategic Partnerships = International Development Association = Highway in Tanzania The International Development Association (IDA) offers concessional loans and grants to developing countries. IDA funds 24 projects in key sectors of the Tanzanian economy including transport (28%), social development (22%), energy (9%), education (8%), social protection (9%), water sanitation (5%). IDA commits approximately $393 million to Tanzanian participation in five regional projects. In 2017, the IDA provided a $225 million concession credit for the development of an interchange in Dar es Salaam to ease transportation bottlenecks and aid local businesses. IDA supports projects that benefit government processes. In 2006, the IDA assisted in the development of the Tax Modernization Project with the goal of improving the country's tax infrastructure and providing educational programs to tax administrators and taxpayers. = International Finance Corporation = Breakdown of Tanzanian Exports The International Financial Corporation (IFC) offers investment, advisory and asset management services to developing countries. IFC supports infrastructure projects in the power, oil, and telecommunication sectors. In 2016, IFC released a web portal to improve the rate at which mini grids are developed in order to support small-renewable power producers. IFC aims to bolster developing financial markets by increasing the availability of financing for micro, small and medium-size enterprises. In 2013, IFC provided a loan of $3 million to FINCA Tanzania, a micro-finance institute, to expand micro financial services with a focus on women, young people and rural populations.

She works primarily with the mediums of photography, video, tapestry, sculpture, watercolour and uses money in her works.  Early life and education  After completing her service in the Israeli Defence Forces, Michal left Israel in the mid 1990s and travelled to Paris to take foundational art courses, while being homeless for a period of time. She settled in London in 1997, where she pursued her Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art from Central Saint Martin‚Äôs College of Art & Design. While attending university she created a number of works in which she used fragments of real money. A group of bankers were interested in buying many of her works and ended up becoming inappropriately sexual in their language with her. After they gave her their ties after believing she was flirting with them, she used them as inspiration and materials for her 2017 Venice Biennale Pavilion of Humanity exhibition Top Gun. Cole later completed her Master of Art in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Arts at the University of the Arts London in 2013.  Artistic career = Textiles = In Michal Cole‚Äôs textile pieces Inferno, 2013 and Clamare, 2013, Cole referenced famous art pieces such as Sandro Botticelli's Mappa dell‚ÄôInferno and Edvard Munch's The Scream with lavish colours and cheerful compositions through textiles. She attempted to bring religious figurative paintings back to life through the more contemporary medium of tapestry that more accurately depicted current views and beliefs as a reflection of society. Exhibited at the 2017 Venice Biennale, Michal Cole created a work titled Top Gun in the Pavilion of Humanity, which was made of tens of thousands of used men‚Äôs ties including those of men she knew and men who had either harassed her or her friends. The ties were strenuously tied together to cover the floor, walls, a fireplace, a sofa, a pipe, a mounted moose on the wall and a rifle which all encompass a traditionally masculine styled living room. Ties were specifically chosen as they represent a piece of clothing typically worn by men for historically masculine activities such as boardroom and workplace life, witnessing business deals, hiring employees, and winding down at a pub. Cole‚Äôs intention of the subject was to comment on the oppression of women that is more apparent under Donald Trump‚Äôs government than ever before; including issues such as the gender pay gap, sexual harassment and a predominantly male political office. The piece similarly spoke to personal inequalities that were apparent in Cole‚Äôs life, such as her being a victim of sexual abuse, serving mandatory time in the military where hundreds of cases of sexual assault are disregarded, and her grandmother being a child bride. Michal Cole‚Äôs use of textiles has been exhibited in pieces such as After Caravaggio and Roses in a process where she replicated famous paintings and destroyed them before the paint had dried. The pieces were later transformed in to fabric textiles, which involved mapping out and recreating the paintings with materials such as Tibetan highland wool, Bikaner wool, Chinese silk and nettle. = Installation art = Mute-Ululation  Michal Cole exhibited a site-specific video installation at Ex Bazzi Gallery at the 2015 Venice Biennale‚Äôs Pavilion of Humanity titled Mute-Ululation. This work addresses Cole‚Äôs identity as a resident of England who is of Sephardi ethnicity. For this installation, Michal travelled to Morocco and Israel and filmed women‚Äôs mouths while performing the traditional celebratory ululation: a long, repetitive, high- pitched vocal sound that involves the rapid movement of the tongue side to side in the mouth. On three walls in a darkened room, the videos of these women assemble frame-by-frame until there are hundreds of mouths simultaneously performing the ululation at a loud volume. This work was used to showcase a unifying bond amongst women that transcends geographical borders, religions and ideologies, while empowering these women and showcasing their poetic happiness and expression. It similarly is a piece in which Cole grapples with her own identity as having significant elements of her life that are tied in Middle-Eastern and Moroccan culture while having adopted aspects of Western culture due to living in the United Kingdom.  Objection  After numerous visits to Istanbul, Michal Cole met Ekin Onat, a Turkish Muslim artist who addresses female and political issues of contemporary Turkey. The two staged their joint project Objection in the Pavilion of Humanity at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The project revolved around the notion of the home, based on their independent yet complementary artistic interpretations. The exhibition, which featured a number of rooms in an artificial home included Cole‚Äôs textile room Top Gun and raised the question of the role of arts and culture in times of crisis, political upheaval and change while uniformly making an argument of compassion and non-violent protest. Both women transformed the Venetian villa ‚Äúto give an artistic home to women‚Äôs rights and free speech.‚Äù Through the numerous rooms in the home, both artists contemplate with political oppression and the power of speech, which is shown in Cole‚Äôs Domestic Godless, a video installation in the kitchen which showcased different videos coming from screens inside cups, bowls and teapots, in which the subject is shown to be screaming. The videos are meant to be representative of a time in Cole‚Äôs life where she was left ‚Äòhowling like an injured dog‚Äô and addresses the role of women across all planes of human existence. Specifically it showcases how inner frustrations at unrealistic pressures are universally placed upon women, such as being beautiful, smart, maternal, and sexual. In the traditionally feminized location of the kitchen, the screams and female outrage can be heard coming from the videos, giving the voice to the woman, where she would have traditionally taken on a role of servitude. The upper floor of the home held collaborative works by the two artists titled The Journey Between Human Being and Being Human. Voices could be heard coming from behind a locked door and when the listener approached the keyhole in an attempt to get the clearest sound, the voices became increasingly overlapped making it apparent that different languages were being spoken between the women. The themes of speaking and silence continued in the master bedroom, where Absent Presence is a lifelike model of the artist sitting with their backs facing one-another on the bed.  Awards and honours  Apart from showcasing work twice at the Venice Biennale, in 2015 and 2017, as well as exhibiting in Sotheby‚Äôs Michal Cole has exhibited her work worldwide to much acclaim. She is the winner of the My Art Space Scope Miami competition, the 2011 Signature Art Awards, the Saatchi Gallery‚Äôs Showdown competition award in London.  Personal life  After visiting London as a teenager, Cole built a group titled the Heavy Metalists in Tel Aviv which took over nightclubs and formed a mini revolution of anarchy and mayhem. The intention of the group was to challenge existing local beliefs, views, fashion and musical tastes by communicating new ideas of freedom, specifically artistic freedom, atheism and passion for challenging conformity. The group, led by Cole until the age of 18, grew in popularity and was featured in mainstream media. After running away to Paris when she was 17 in an attempt to avoid recruitment, Cole was recruited at age 18 to the Israeli Defense Forces to serve mandatory military service. Michal Cole‚Äôs parents are Moroccan Jews who trace their roots back to the Jews of Spain who migrated to Morocco after the Spanish Inquisition. Her parents left Morocco in the early 1950s, being deported by sea to Israel where they were placed in refugee camps and suffered poverty and racial discrimination as a new minority in Israel. Much of Cole‚Äôs work involves the notions of displacement and exile ‚Äì both internal and external. Due to the merging of her Moroccan-Israeli ethnicity and adopted Western cultural aspects, she explores the collisions of tradition and modernity while similarly delving in to the roles of women and the absurdity of global inequality in her work. Michal Cole uses her artworks as a form of celebration and examination of the human condition while inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty, joy, and humour of life set against the uncontrollable social, economic, political and religious injustices and hypocrisies that inevitably affect us. She is specifically fascinated by moments of transition ‚Äì economical transitions, religious shifts, the collapse of beliefs and infrastructures and loss of faith. Cole attempts to envision the possibility of order born from chaos and mayhem, creativity out of destruction and inspiration derived from man‚Äôs fallibility and stupidity. The artist Cole is most inspired by is Caravaggio due to his rebelliousness and insanity, and the eroticism, drama and violence of his work. She spent a summer touring Italy in search of his original artworks.

It was taken from their 1992 album Pure and saw release as a radio promo and music video in the same year. The track's title is derived from 1961 Japanese film of the same name by Ishir≈ç Honda. Musically, \\"Mothra\\" is a grinding, mechanical song with shouted vocals and heavily distorted instruments. Composition \\"Mothra\\", the second track on 1992's Pure, is a weighty industrial metal song. Ned Raggett of AllMusic described the track as \\"surprisingly commercial for the band\\" and highlighted its \\"memorable main riff and drumming\\" as pleasingly listenable; he selected the song as one of his favourites from Pure. Joseph Schafer of Decibel agreed with Raggett, considering \\"Mothra\\" one of Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick's most accessible songs, but added that \\"it still sounds like getting crushed by a ton of lead\\". Mike Gitter of Spin and RIP Magazine described hearing \\"Mothra\\" by writing, \\"It's as if your whole body is made to serve as a giant ear, as you are beaten upon by a low-level shock wave. You lose all defenses and filters against the world\\". He also wrote that the song is \\"the sound of rock taken to its bleakest and slowest extremes\\". As is the case with most Godflesh songs, \\"Mothra\\" was recorded with a drum machine, which, according to Shawn Macomber of Decibel, \\"really hammers the [Steve] Albini vibe\\" in allusion to the band Big Black. Macomber also recognised \\"Mothra\\" as a fan favourite song. Writing for Melody Maker, Sharon O'Connell also noted the song's grinding, deliberate repetition in a favourable light. The Quietus' Noel Gardner wrote that the various machine, guitar and bass elements of \\"Mothra\\" seem incongruous from a distance, but in practice they work well. In their book The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, Ira A. Robbins and David Sprague characterise \\"Mothra\\" as having a memorable and definite groove. \\"Mothra\\" derives its title from Ishir≈ç Honda's 1961 film Mothra, which features the fictional giant monster Mothra. Some of the song's lyrics are borrowed from \\"Avalanche\\" by Leonard Cohen, a track off of his 1970 album Songs of Love and Hate (a title that Godflesh later borrowed). Release \\"Mothra\\" released as a promotional maxi single in 1992. Though licensed from Earache Records (who, at the time, managed Godflesh), the promo was distributed by Relativity Records. Pure's introductory track, \\"Spite\\", it also included on the release as a B-side. \\"Mothra\\" is one of the few Godflesh songs to feature a music video. Directed by Barry Maguire in 1992, the video was described by the band as \\"a curious affair that mixed David Lynch-style cinematography and concepts with performance shots of Godflesh in a dodgy- looking disco\\".

As a juvenile in 2016 he was undefeated in three races including the Grade 2 Hopeful Stakes and was rated one of the best two-year-old colts in Japan. In the following year he won the Tokyo Yushun and Kobe Shimbun Hai and finished second in the Japan Cup. At the end of the season he was rated one of the best three-year-old colts in the world and took the JRA Award for Best Three-Year- Old Colt. As a four-year-old in 2018 he won the Sankei Sho All Comers and took the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. Background Rey de Oro is a bay horse with a white star bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During his racing career he carried the green, white and pink colours of U Carrot Farm and was trained by Kazuo Fujisawa. He has been ridden in most of his races by Christophe Lemaire. His sire, King Kamehameha was one of the best Japanese colts of his generation, beating a field including Heart's Cry and Daiwa Major in the 2004 Japanese Derby. His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Rose Kingdom, Leontes, Apapane and Duramente. Rey de Oro's dam La Dorado showed some racing ability, winning four of her eighteen races between 2009 and 2011 and was a half-sister to the Grade 3 winner Gold Blitz. She was a granddaughter of the Irish-bred mare Wind In Her Hair, the dam of Deep Impact. Racing career=2016: two-year-old season= Rey de Oro made his debut in a contest for previously unraced two-year-olds over 2000 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 9 October and won by a length. He followed up on 3 December when he won the Habutan Sho over the same distance at Nakayama Racecourse. The colt was then moved up in class for the Grade 2 Hopeful Stakes over the same course and distance on 25 December. He started the 1/2 favourite in a fourteen-runner field and won by one and a quarter length from Meiner Sphene. Rey de Oro finished runner up to Satono Ares in the voting for the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Colt. =2017: three-year-old season= On his first run of 2017 Rey de Oro started at 9.4/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the Grade 1 Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama. He was towards the rear in the early stages before finishing well and came home fifth behind Al Ain, Persian Knight, Danburite and Clincher. On 28 May Rey de Oro was on of eighteen three- year-old colts to contest the 84th running of the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. He was made the 4.3/1 second favourite behind the Aoba Sho winner Admirable while the others included Suave Richard, Al Ain, Satono Arthur, Persian Knight, Danburite and Clincher. With Lemaire in the saddle he raced towards the rear before moving up into second place behind the front-running My Style approaching the final turn. He took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from Suave Richard, with Admirable a length and a quarter back in third. Lemaire reportedly commented \\"We had no specific tactic, but we were forced to travel toward the rear after a slow start and the pace was slow, so I decided to move forward in the backstretch. He was very relaxed and was responding well in the homestretch so I knew we will win in the last 100 meters.\\" After a summer break, Rey de Oro returned for the Grade 2 Kobe Shimbun Hai (a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2400 metres at Hanshin Racecourse. Starting the 1.2/1 favourite he tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the furlong and won \\"readily\\" by two lengths from Kiseki. On 26 November Rey de Oro was matched against top class older horses to contest the Japan Cup over 2400 metres at Tokyo and started 2.8/1 second favourite behind the five-year-old Kitasan Black. After racing in mid-division he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish second to Cheval Grand with Kitasan Black in third. The other beaten horses included Idaho, Makahiki, Soul Stirring and Satono Crown. In January 2018, Rey de Oro won the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt, taking 289 of the 290 votes. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Rey de Oro was given a rating of 121, making him twenty-ninth best horse in the world, the third best horse in Japan, and the fifth best three-year-old. =2018: four- year-old season= At Kyoto Racecourse on 11 February, Rey de Oro began his third campaign in the Grade 2 Kyoto Kinen over 2200 metres. He started the odds-on favourite but was beaten a length and a neck into third place by Clincher and Al Ain. He was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Sheema Classic on 31 March and stayed on in the straight to come home fourth of the ten runners behind Hawkbill, Poet's Word and Cloth of Stars. Lemaire later reported that he had problems settling the horse in the race. Rey de Oro was off the track for almost six months before returning for the Grade 2 Sankei Sho All Comers at Nakayama on 23 September. He started favourite and won by a neck from Al Ain, with the pair finishing three lengths clear of the other ten runners. Five weeks later, with Lemaire in the saddle, the colt started the 2.1/1 second favourite behind Suave Richard for the autumn edition of the Grade 1 Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo. The other ten runners included Sungrazer (Sapporo Kinen), Makahiki, Kiseki, Al Ain, Vivlos and Mikki Rocket (Takarazuka Kinen). After racing in sixth place, Rey de Oro moved into contention on the outside on the final turn before taking the lead from the front-running Kiseki in the straight. He won by one and a quarter lengths from Sungrazer, with Kiseki a nose further back in third. Lemaire commented \\"I knew I had a good chance to win. The colt's condition and the race development were perfect. The pace was just right and the colt was relaxed so everything went smoothly. He showed good long-lasting speed\\". As Lemaire had been booked to ride the filly Almond Eye in the Japan Cup, Rey de Oro's connections opted to bypass the race in favour of the Arima Kinen. When asked to compare the two horses Lemaire said \\"Almond Eye is like a Ferrari, but [Rey de Oro] is like a Land Rover. He's strong and he can keep giving you more in the stretch. He's like a fast four-wheel drive.\\" On 23 December the colt started 6/5 favourite for the Arima Kinen at Nakayama. The field is partly determined by a public vote and Rey de Oro stopped the poll ahead of the absent Almond Eye and the popular steeplechaser Oju Chosan. After racing in ninth on the outside he produced a strong late run in the straight but failed by a neck to overhaul the three-year-old Blast Onepiece. In January 2019 Rey de Oro was voted JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse at the JRA Awards for 2018, taking 212 of the 276 votes. =2019: five-year-old season= In March 2019 Rey de Oro was again sent to Dubai for the Sheema Classic, but after leading for most of the way he faded badly in the straight and finished sixth of the eight runners, more than twelve lengths behind the winner Old Persian. The colt returned to Japan and made his next appearance in the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin on 23 June in which he started the 2.9/1 second favourite in a field of twelve. He raced on the inside in sixth place but was unable to make any significant progress in the straight and came home fifth behind Lys Gracieux, Kiseki, Suave Richard and Al Ain. After a three-month break Rey de Oro returned to the track and attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the Sankei Sho All Comers. He started favourite but finished fourth, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Stiffelio. Despite having failed to win in over a year, Rey de Oro started the 3.2/1 favourite for the Japan Cup on 24 November but came home eleventh of the fifteen runners behind Suave Richard. On his final start of the year he ran unplaced behind Lys Gracieux in the Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 22 December.

History The club was founded by Canon John Albert Douglas, a major figure in Anglican‚ÄìOrthodox relations in the 20th century. In 1905, with his brother, the Revd Charles Edward Douglas, he founded the Society of the Faith, which supported the Nik√¶an Club financially in its early years. The club owes its origin to the celebration in London to mark the sixteenth centenary of the First Ecumenical Council of the Christian Church held in Nic√¶a in 325. The club has almost 400 members. Each successive Archbishop of Canterbury has been president since the club began. The club holds an annual dinner in York in honour of the General Synod‚Äôs ecumenical representatives and guests. Other dinners are usually held in Lambeth Palace. Notable members in the years after the Second World War included such figures as John Betjeman, Rose Macaulay, Osbert Lancaster and Dorothy L. Sayers. In 1992, the Nik√¶an Club founded a charitable trust, The Nikaean Ecumenical Trust, to finance study trips made by members of Christian Churches from overseas. The club suffered damage to its reputation in 1993, when its chairman Patrick Gilbert, head of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, received a suspended sentence for child abuse. Canon Christopher Hill, also a member of the Nik√¶an Club accompanied Gilbert to court, and former Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan, wrote a character witness letter. Gilbert, who was also secretary of the wine committee at The Athenaeum, admitted a previous conviction for indecent assault on two 13-year- old school boys in 1962. The Nikaean Cross The Nikaean Cross is a fourth- century Coptic bronze cross which was presented to the Club by Sir Ronald Storrs. The cross had been presented to Sir Ronald when he was Oriental Secretary to Lord Kitchener by the Coptic Pope Cyril V. The Nikaean Cross is placed in front of the President at meetings of the Club.

Walter made a large fortune by taking up mortgages and then foreclosing on the estates. He purchased Stalbridge and other properties, chiefly in Dorset and Somerset. He became notorious for his methods and was satirized by several literary figures. Henry Fielding referred to him as ‚ÄòPeter Pounce‚Äô, while Jonathan Swift wrote of him as ‚ÄòThat rogue of genuine ministerial kind, Can half the peerage by his arts bewitch, Starve twenty lords to make one scoundrel rich‚Äô.

It was created during the third Session of the 45th Congress, listed as chapter 202. The purpose of the NBH was to carryout a piece of legislation passed in Session I of the 45th Congress, Chapter 66. Chapter 66 and Chapter 202 were redundant pieces of legislature in all aspects but one: the implementation and oversight of the NBH.  Purpose  The ambition of these two Bills, and by extension the NBH, were to stop the \\"introduction of contagious or infectious diseases into the United States\\". The legislation ordered for a medical officer from the Army, Navy, Marine Hospital Service to oversee the medical aspects of the organization. In addition, an officer from the Justice Department was to be appointed to deal with state and national laws regarding quarantine. In the passage of this Bill, the NBH was to effectively strip the powers of quarantine from the Marine Hospital Service, a precursor to the National Health Service which itself would become the CDC. The delegation of the power of quarantine from the Marine Hospital Service was to be renewed after a period of 4 years. Congress would have to reenact the bill if the NBH were to continue to have quarantine powers.  Reception  The NBH was met with immediate criticism, as many states believed that it was restrictive of trade. This came at a time following the Civil War when states' rights, particularly ones revolving around economy and commerce, were a sensitive topic. This, combined with internal politics led to the demise of the NBH.  Legacy  Although attempts during this period to established a national health organization failed, the idea of it remained. The NBH's legacy would see to the creation of a number of different government programs with the same overarching goals. This progression would eventually lead to the creation of the CDC following the second World War.

The major later died of his wounds.The Peerage of Ireland: Or, A Genealogical History of the Present Nobility of that Kingdom, Volume 3 (John Lodge, 1789)  References 1652 deaths 17th-century Anglo-Irish people People of the English Civil War ","title":"James Rochfort"},{"id":"59113779","text":"In mathematical analysis, Tannery's theorem gives sufficient conditions for the interchanging of the limit and infinite summation operations.

Early life  Cowie was born on 7 April 1892 in Milltown of Rothiemay, Banffshire, Scotland. She was the daughter of farmer Alexander Cowie and his wife Anna Hutcheon. After her parents had married in 1889, they took up a lease on Turtory farm near Marnoch. In 1893, Laura's older brother Alexander was born. When the father died in 1900, following a sudden heart attack, the remaining family moved to Aberdeen, where they lived with two of Laura's cousins and earned some money by taking in two female students as boarders. Laura went to school in Aberdeen. In 1902, her mother married her second husband, the elderly Alexander Reid Craib, the Minister of the parish of New Pitsligo. He was 61 at the time. As a young girl, Laura wished to become a professional dancer. She was already taking dancing lessons at a local institute in Aberdeen. Both her mother and her step-father decided that she was indeed talented and needed proper training. So Anna took her daughter as well as her son Alexander to London, where Laura gained a place at the Academy of Dramatic Arts (later RADA) which had been founded in 1904.  Career  The academy's founder, theatre director Herbert Beerbohm Tree, saw great potential in Laura Cowie, but convinced her that she would make a better actress than a dancer. While the young woman embarked on her career, she was chaperoned by her mother, who had decided to stay in London, opening up an agency for housemaids. While Anna Cowie took a flat in Hampstead, Laura shared an apartment in Great Smith Street with her brother Alexander, who had found a good job in the automobile industry. After appearing in various stage productions, Laura's first role in a film was in William Barker's Henry VIII (1911). She would later play major parts in Anne de Boleyn (1914) and Queens of France (1938). Laura Cowie played alongside famous actors like Sir John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Mrs Patrick Campbell or George Fawcett. In 1934 she starred as Katherine Parr in Winifred Carter's The Queen Who Kept Her Head. On 20 June 1918 she married scriptwriter and director John Hastings Turner. After the marriage, she mostly retired and only occasionally appeared in film productions by the Rank studios.  Final years and death  In 1939, both Laura's mother and her brother died, the latter leaving behind a wife and a young son. After their marriage, John Hastings Turner and Laura bought Blue Tile Farm in Fakenham, Norfolk. Here Turner wrote many of his scripts and novels, and here he died in 1956. Laura died on 11 February 1969 in the small coastal town of Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, England.

Most notably, she was the elder sister of Canadian artist Emily Carr. While Edith's artistry never received the same level of recognition as her sister, she won several awards for her donations to non-profit religious organizations. Carr raised the funds she would later donate by selling her painted ceramic pieces at Christmas bazaars.  Early life and family  Edith \\"Dede\\" Carr was born on February 5, 1856, in California, United States, and was the first child of Richard and Emily (n√©e Saunders) Carr (July 16, 1818 - November 20, 1888) (July 3, 1836 - September 22, 1886). In 1863, the family moved to Victoria, British Columbia, the westernmost province of Canada. She was the eldest of eight children, three of whom died as infants. Of the eight, only one, Clara (\\"Tallie\\") went on to marry and have children. Edith Carr spent her young life taking care of her tuberculosis-ridden mother and raising her siblings. When both parents died in the late 1880s, Carr became guardian to her siblings. Though proud of his English heritage, Richard wanted his children to get a \\"Canadian education,\\" according to her sister Emily. The children were sent to public school rather than the typical private finishing schools. Richard arrived in Victoria from England after first arriving in California with his wife and two eldest sisters in 1863. There, he set up a provisions importing business on Wharf Street. The Carrs bought four and a half acres of land when they arrived and then hired Wright & Saunders, a local architectural firm to build their home. Richard sold some of the land before his death in 1888.  Relationship with sister, Emily Carr  It's reported that Edith and Emily Carr disliked each other. The conflict grew after Edith became head of the family in 1888, which Emily described in her book Growing Pains. Emily accused her sister of beating her and her brother with a riding whip. She also claimed that part of the reason her father let her go to art school was to tame the hostility between the two sisters. However, there have been attempts to dispute Emily's claims about her sister, as Edith was publicly perceived as a valued member of her community and a charitable person who cared for her family's well-being. Tension remained between the Carr girls whenever Emily visited home. On one occasion, Emily played a prank on her sister, setting up a meeting between Edith and a Presbyterian minister, and telling each of them that the other had requested the meeting. When Edith and the minister arrived, they were confused as to why the other was there. Emily eventually admitted she had set up the prank as an April Fool's trick. After that, Emily and Edith's relationship improved for a while until 1899, when Emily got a dog. The dog turned out to be vicious and aggressive and Edith disliked it. When Emily went on a day trip that year, an accident delayed her return. Police came to investigate complaints about the dog, so Edith allowed them to put the dog down. Emily said she would never forgive her sister for this. However, when Emily got the news that Edith was on her deathbed, she returned to reconcile with her elder sister. Around 1911, Emily borrowed a sum of money from Edith in order to finance the construction of her House of All Sorts. The house, designed by architect John R. Wright, was a two story apartment building with a studio for Emily to work in. The home was originally called Hill House, but was later nicknamed the House of All Sorts because of the mix of people and animals residing in the house.  Work = Art = Edith dabbled in several art forms, including China-painting, wood-carving, and jewelry making. She taught these skills to others in Victoria, and continued to teach well into her sixties in her family home. Carr won first prize for china-painting at the Victoria Fall Fair in 1904. She may have also won first prize in the 1893 Victoria Fair, but the record lists only a ‚ÄúMiss E. Carr,‚Äù which could have been Edith‚Äôs younger sister Emily. The first prize that year was awarded for the best pen and ink sketches, an art form practiced by both Emily and Edith. Edith hosted an exhibition each Christmas in the family home, where she would sell her art and craft work to members of the community. She also sold her work her work at the annual Reformed Episcopal Church Christmas Bazaar. = YWCA founding = All of the Carr sisters had a role in founding the YWCA in Victoria. Initially, there was no official headquarters, so members of the community would meet at the Carr household to talk and pray.  Later life  In 1911, the Carr family decided to sell their land, but due to legal restrictions it wasn't sold until 1912. The remaining land was divided between the siblings. Edith rented out the family home and built a spent $5,000 having a cottage built on her share of the estate at 231 St. Andrews Street in 1913. The Carr‚Äôs other sister, Elizabeth, lived with her there and used her own share of land for a garden plot. The sisters lived in the cottage until 1916, when Edith and Elizabeth moved back into the family home where Edith continued teaching art lessons.  Death  Edith's other sister, Tallie, died in 1919. According to records, Edith mourned her sister excessively, as they were always very close. It is believed that stress from her grief worsened her underlying health conditions. Edith was diagnosed with terminal cancer months later. Emily returned home to reconcile with Edith before she died on December 11, 1919 in Victoria.

Most of the French vocabulary in English entered the language after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, when Old French, specifically the Old Norman dialect, became the language of the new Anglo-Norman court, the government and the elites. That period lasted for several centuries until the aftermath of the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). However, English has continued to be influenced by French. Background=Before 1066= In the early 11th century, Old English was not a single unified language but a dialect continuum that stretched from the southern English coast to the Forth estuary. However, a literary standard had emerged that was based around the West Saxon dialect spoken in the area centred on Winchester, the capital of Wessex.David Crystal, \\"The End of Old English\\" Also spoken in the territory ruled by the Anglo- Saxons were the Celtic languages of Old Cornish, Old Welsh and Cumbric, mainly in peripheral regions in which settlement by the Anglo-Saxons had been fairly minor, and Old Norse, across a wide swathe of territory in the North and the East Midlands. =Norman conquest of England and consequences= Royal arms of the United Kingdom: Honi soit qui mal y pense and Dieu et mon droit William II of Normandy landed at Hastings, Sussex on September 29, 1066. He deployed his men in the nearby area while he waited for King Harold Godwinson's troops. On October 14, exhausted by previous clashes with Scandinavians in the north and the long journey to Hastings, the English army lost the battle quickly and became disorganised after Harold was killed. After the defeat of the English, William claimed the throne as king of England on December 25, 1066. He was crowned William I of England and came to be known as William the Conqueror (Guillaume le Conqu√©rant in French). William's followers became a new Norman ruling class and imposed their language on the upper echelons of society. Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the royal court and aristocratic circles, the justice system and the church. Influential Norman settlers used their native language in daily life, but more modest rural and urban areas of society continued to speak varieties of English. The Norman Conquest marked the beginning of a long period of interaction between England and France. Noble English families, most of them of Norman origin, taught their children French or sent them to study in France. The early Norman kings spent more time in Normandy than in England.Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (sixth edition 2013), p. 111 Royal marriages also encouraged the expansion of the French language in England. From Henry II Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine early 12th century to Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou in the 15th century, many English kings married French princesses, which kept French as the language of the English court for several centuries and strengthened its use in England overall. =Decline of French as first language in England= Throughout the late 11th and 12th centuries, the Norman nobility had ruled over both England and Normandy. However, in 1204, Normandy was lost to France and so the aristocracy began to associate more with an English identity. Anti-French sentiment in England began to grow after Henry III invited relatives of his wife, Eleanor of Provence, to settle in England and bestowed lavish favours on them. Written works promoting the use of English in England began to appear around then, such as the Cursor Mundi. Meanwhile, the French spoken in England was stigmatised as a provincial variety by speakers from the Continent,Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (sixth edition 2013), pp. 126-134 particularly because the Anglo-Norman that was spoken by the elites had taken on a syntactical structure that resembled English. Some nobles had simply shifted to English entirely.Robert McColl Millar, \\"English in the 'transition period: the sources of contact-induced change,\\" in Contact: The Interaction of Closely Related Linguistic Varieties and the History of English (2016: Edinburgh University Press) In 1328, Charles IV of France died without an heir. Edward III of England and Philip VI of France disputed the French throne, and the Hundred Years' War ensued. The war provoked further negative feelings towards French in England, as it came to be seen as the language of the enemy. English had reasserted itself as a language of government and learning after over 200 years as a language of low prestige. In 1349, English became the language of instruction at the University of Oxford, which had taught in French or Latin. The use of English became widespread by the introduction of printing to England by William Caxton in 1476. Henry IV (1367-1413) was the first English king whose first language was English, and Henry V (1387-1422) was the first king of England to use English in official documents. Lexical Official Warwickshire arms, in Old French The most notable influence of French on English has been its massive contribution to the English lexicon. It has been estimated that about a third of the words in English are French in origin; linguist Henriette Walter claims that this total may be as high as two thirds. Anthony Lacoudre has estimated that over 40,000 English words come directly from French and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers. Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable note that \\"although this influx of French words was brought about by the victory of the Conqueror and by the political and social consequences of that victory, it was neither sudden nor immediately apparent. Rather it began slowly and continued with varying tempo for a long time. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have ever stopped.\\"Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (sixth edition 2013), p. 163 Baugh and Cable define several categories of early French borrowings:Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (sixth edition 2013), pp. 164-168 * Government and social class (revenue, authority, realm, duke, count, marquis, servant, peasant) * Church (religion, sermon, prayer, abbey, saint, faith, pray, convent, cloister) * Law (justice, crime, jury, pardon, indict, arrest, felon, pardon, evidence) * War (army, navy, battle, garrison, captain, sergeant, combat, defense) * Fashion (gown, robe, frock, collar, satin, crystal, diamond, coat, embroidery) * Food (feast, taste, mackerel, salmon, bacon, fry, mince, plate, goblet) * Learning and medicine (paper, preface, study, logic, surgeon, anatomy, stomach, remedy, poison) In many cases a French word might have existed alongside a Germanic word that meant the same thing, with the two words eventually taking on different senses. Exemplifying this are the \\"food pairs\\" in which the English word refers to a living animal on a farm, while the French word signifies the meat of the animal after it has been made into a meal (cow and beef, swine and pork, sheep and mutton).David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language (1997), p. 39 Other times, the same French word was borrowed twice, once from the Norman dialect and then again from the Parisian dialect, with different meanings arising. Such doublets include Norman catch vs Parisian chase, Norman warranty vs Parisian guarantee and Norman warden vs Parisian guardian. The period from 1250 to 1400 was the most prolific for borrowed words from French. Forty percent of all the French words in English appear for the first time between these two dates.Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable, A History of the English Language (sixth edition 2013), pp. 173-174 After this period, the scale of the lexical borrowing decreased sharply, though French loan words have continued to enter English even into the modern era. Morphological and syntactical The gradual decline of the English singular pronouns thou and thee and their replacement with ye and later you have been linked to the parallel French use of vous in formal settings.Herbert Schendl, Middle English: Language Contact (2012) The ubiquity of -s to mark plurals in English has also been attributed to French influence, but the -s ending was common in English even prior to the Norman Conquest since -as was the standard suffix form for plurals of strong masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases. It is possible that the dominance of that form over other endings such as -en was strengthened by the similarity of the French plural construction. Robert McColl Millar, \\"English in the 'transition period: the sources of contact-induced change,\\" in Contact: The Interaction of Closely Related Linguistic Varieties and the History of English (2016: Edinburgh University Press) Other suggestions include the impersonal one (\\"one does what one wants\\") and possessive phrases such as \\"the guitar of David\\", rather than \\"David's guitar\\", but similar forms are found in other Germanic languages, though, which casts doubt on the proposed French derivations.Robert McColl Millar, \\"English in the 'transition period: the sources of contact- induced change,\\" in Contact: The Interaction of Closely Related Linguistic Varieties and the History of English (2016: Edinburgh University Press) Attempts have also been made to connect the increased use of gerunds towards the end of the Middle English period to the French g√©rondif form. They are fairly rare in English, but constructions that place the adjective after the noun (attorney general) are derived from French.Herbert Schendl, Middle English: Language Contact (2012) English has adopted several prefix and suffix morphemes from French, including pre-, -ous, -ity, -tion, -ture, -ment, -ive and -able. They now stand alongside native English forms such as over-, -ish, -ly, -ness, -ship, -some, -less and -ful. Phonological The influence of French on English pronunciation is generally held to have been fairly minor, but a few examples have been citedHerbert Schendl, \\"Middle English: Language Contact\\" (2012): * The use of non-word-initial stress patterns in some loan words of French origin * The phonemisation of the voiced fricatives /z/ and /v/ (in Old English, they were allophones of their voiceless counterparts, /s/ and /f/, a pattern that can still be seen in some dialects of West Country English) * The use of the diphthongs /ui/ and /oi/ Orthographic In the centuries following the Norman conquest, English was written mainly by Norman scribes. Thus, French spelling conventions had a great effect on the developing English orthography. Innovations that then arose include the following:David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language (1995), pp. 41-42: * \\"qu-\\" instead of \\"cw-\\" (queen) * \\"gh\\" instead of \\"h\\" (night) * \\"ch\\" or \\"cch\\" instead of \\"c\\" (church) * \\"ou\\" instead of \\"u\\" (house) * \\"sh\\" or \\"sch\\" instead of \\"sc\\" (ship) * \\"dg\\" instead of \\"cg\\" or \\"gg\\" (bridge) * \\"o\\" instead of \\"u\\" (love, son; the \\"u\\" that was originally in such words was considered difficult to distinguish from the surrounding letters) * doubling of vowels to represent long vowel sounds (see) * doubling of consonants after short vowels (sitting) * more use of \\"k\\", \\"z\\" and \\"j\\" Several letters derived from Germanic runes or Irish script that had been common in Old English, such as ∆ø and √∞, largely fell out of use, possibly because the Normans were unfamiliar with them. √æ, the final remaining runic letter in English, survived in a severely-altered form until the 17th century. Miscellaneous The effects of the Norman conquest had indirect influences on the development of the standardized English that began to emerge towards the end of the 15th century. The takeover of the elite class by the Normans, as well as their decision to move the capital of England from Winchester to London, ended the dominance of the Late West Saxon literary language.Robert McColl Millar, \\"English in the 'transition period: the sources of contact-induced change,\\" in Contact: The Interaction of Closely Related Linguistic Varieties and the History of English (2016: Edinburgh University Press) London's growing influence led to the English spoken nearby, which was largely derived from the Mercian dialect of Old English, to become the standard written form, rather than that of West Saxon areas such as Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset. The Normans had a strong influence on English personal names.David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language (1995), p. 31 Old English names such as Alfred, Wulfstan, Aelfric, Harold, Godwin and Athelstan largely fell out of fashion and were replaced by the likes of John, Peter and Simon as well as Normanized Germanic names like William, Richard, Henry, Robert, Roger and Hugh.

She uses a feminist narrative to inspire and create her works and is helping to push third-wave feminism in the age of female oppression and the age of Donald Trump. She has recently gained fame for painting realistic works depicting celebrities from Drake to Barack Obama performing oral sex on women.  Early life  Rubinstein was born in 1988 in Sverdlovsk, USSR, currently Yekaterinburg, Russia, her mother is Russian and her father is Jewish. The family was given asylum after ten years of trying and came to United States illegally in 1997 and moved to Pittsburgh. Rubinstein took art courses at Carnegie Mellon University throughout her time in high school and was interested in art during this time.  Education  Rubinstein went to Carnegie Mellon University to earn her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. After graduating she went to live in New York City and follow her dreams of becoming an artist and creating art for a living.  Artistic career  Rubinstein works out of her studio in Brooklyn, New York creating all of her realistic oil paintings. She has done many small-scale exhibitions around the United States. = Looking for Mr. Goodsex (2013‚Äì) = Painted using oil paints, Rubinstein created this as one of her first large series, the images are stills taken from vintage pornographic films from the 80s, around the time of the pornographic film called \\"Deep Throat.\\" The women's faces during sex are made the highlight of the imagery. A focal point like this is meant to point out the fact that women are rarely made the real focus of these videos, and by putting the focus on women, makes the viewer question how far has pornography progressed, and whether or not female pleasure is seen as important. Over time the series branched out into stills of men as well as stills of men and women kissing, keeping the aspect of vulnerability within the imagery and focusing on the nature of sexual pleasure and romance. = A Dream Come True: Celebrity Cunnilingus (2014‚Äì) = This series is hyper- realistic oil paintings of a variety of different male celebrities performing cunnilingus on a faceless women. The celebrities she portrays are mainly seen as heartthrobs in society, a couple of the celebrities that she shows are, Justin Bieber, Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio, James Franco, as well as Barack Obama. Having the women be faceless does not make the image objectifying but rather makes it so the male gaze is removed from the equation since the viewer is placed in such an aggressively female point of view. The male gaze is turned back onto the viewer in a way. Rubinstein puts the women first in these portrayals, making it acceptable for women to feel pleasure while viewing the imagery rather than discomfort.Lui, Elaine. \\"Why More Women Need to Talk about Getting Head.\\" Flare, Winter 2016, 54‚Äì55. The images eroticize the male in order to target a female audience, giving women more power. The artist decided to create this series after realizing there was a real lack of focus on women in pornography, which helps promote the idea that heterosexual sex is about men and their pleasure. Rubinstein figuratively puts herself in a lot of her works, especially this series, her personality can be seen in the eyes of the celebrities she depicts, each image tells a story.McVey, Kurt. \\"New York City Artist And Curator Savannah Spirit Unveils Salacious New Exhibit.\\" Forbes. January 11, 2017. Retrieved October 20, 2018. https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtmcvey/2017/01/11/nyc-artist-and-curator- savannah-spirit-wants-to-trigger-your-trump/#4d56386c328d. = Thirsty (2015‚Äì) = This series puts a focus subverting heterosexual female sexuality through oil on panel images of 1970s male porn stars with a conveniently placed bottle opener on the area where the genitals would be. Once again this imagery is meant to turn the art world around, making women be the consumer of nude male imagery rather than women being the object that is consumed. The paintings use the bottle opener to mimic the usual decorative use of the female form, but instead, the men are made into objects and the ‚Äòthirst‚Äô for them comes after the thirst for beer. The imagery also pushes the idea that women are not only here for their sexual desire for vintage porn imagery but are mainly there to drink a beer, a stereotypically male beverage. The paintings push the idea that women are independent beings that can have sexual desires and can enjoy a beer every now and then too. = HOTTER THAN JULY: Hands off my Cuntry (January 11, 2017) = This exhibition was curated by Savannah Spirit and put on at Undercurrent Projects in New York City. This show was the third in Spirit's HOTTER THAN JULY series and this one was specifically put on a week before Donald Trump's inauguration. The entire show is a collective of artists that focus on erotic imagery and it was chosen to poke fun at Trump's rightwing cabinet. Spirit was moved to create the show because of the impending presidency and Trump's relationship with women. She chose to have contributions from 12 different artists and 20 percent of the profits from the show would go towards Planned Parenthood. The show, like the past shows, focused on the celebration of female sexuality in a playful and often a provocative manner. This exhibition gave Rubinstein a lot of publicity because her well-known painting called Thanks Obama (2016, oil-on-panel) was used on the posters and flyers for the event. The image is a photo-realistic painting of Barack Obama smiling and about to perform cunnilingus on a faceless woman. The show received a lot of backlash, especially Rubinstein's painting, hers was deemed to be offensive and disrespectful. One of Rubinstein's paintings from her Thirsty series was featured in the exhibition as well. The show was focused on erotica because that is what captures people's attention, and is what brings people in. The erotic nature of Rubinstein's works is what makes many people uncomfortable or may even cause an uproar, but the imagery brings attention to what she believes in and that is why her works were featured in the show.  Style  Rubinstein's style is very contemporary in her choice of subject, although nudity stems centuries back to Renaissance art and imagery. The oil-on-panel is what helps to create the realism of her paintings, the soft pastels and the bright colors all combine to create a very real image that makes many feel uncomfortable. Rubinstein paints mainly human figures, sometimes she uses more expressive imagery that is meant to represent something, like using puns in her title.  Reception  Rubinstein's art has not been welcomed with open arms, many art critics, mainly of older generations, find it offensive and too revealing. The mainstream media have found that her art is eye-opening and needed for more female representation of female pleasure, finally, an artist playing into women's wants and needs. Rubinstein's work is praised by liberal online news source BuzzFeed, and mainly for her use of celebrities within her works, rather than the point behind her works. Other news sources have praised her for her fight against the patriarchy through art.

It takes its name from its physical shape: the binding and sheets of vellum that comprise the manuscript are in the shape of an equilateral triangle. The text, once deciphered, details a magical operation through which a person can perform feats of magic, notably the discovery of treasure and extension of life.  Structure and contents  Example of ciphered text and diagram in Triangular manuscript The manuscript begins with a short Latin inscription mentioning that this is a gift given by Count of St. Germain, followed by an illustration of a winged dragon. All the text beyond this point, including the inscriptions belonging to the diagrams, is in cipher. Photo of an actual silver talisman created by Volund Jewelry that accompanied this book The book describes a ritual aimed at achieving one of three goals: discovering the location of certain valuable objects (goals 1 and 2) and life extension (goal 3). The former requires performing the ritual during a full solar eclipse. The latter can be performed at any time, but it requires wearing a specific longevity amulet, which the manuscript then refers to in a diagram. Although this text is a part of the Manly Hall collection of alchemical manuscripts, it does not contain any of the usual alchemical content. It was likely meant to stand on its own and was only combined with other manuscripts post-acquisition by Getty Research Institute.  Relation to other works  The ritual described in the Triangular Manuscript resembles those described in the Heptameron, a handbook of ritual magic sometimes attributed to Pietro d'Abano that appeared around the 16th century in Europe.  History  The two known copies of the Triangular Manuscript exist as Hogart Manuscript 209 and 210 (MS 209 and MS 210). Both currently reside in the Getty Research Institute‚Äôs collections, each with its own history. MS 209, dated 1775, was made for Antoine Louis Moret, a French freemason who immigrated to the United States in 18th century. At one point it resided in the library of Jules C. G. Favre (1809-1880), a French politician. Pliny E. Chase (1820-1886), an American mathematician with an interest in cryptography, makes mention of it in a lecture to the American Philosophical Society on October 3, 1873, stating that the manuscript was ‚Äúpurchased in Amsterdam, about seventy years ago,‚Äù i.e. around 1803. It is unclear if he owned the manuscript, examined it, or had simply heard of its existence. French bibliographer, poet, and Rosicrucian Stanislaus de Guaita (1860-1898) had it in his library for some time. From there it passed on to a certain Madame Barbe of Paris, and then to Frank Hollings, a 20th century London writer and antiquary. After 1934, Hollings sold it to Manly P. Hall. Much less is known about the other manuscript, MS 210. Dated 1750, older of the two copies, it was once in the library of Lionel Hauser, a member of the Theosophical Society in Paris. In 1934, Manly P. Hall purchased it for 40 guineas at an auction of Hauser‚Äôs library at Sotheby‚Äôs.  Format  One of the most peculiar properties of this manuscript is its physical shape - an equilateral triangle. Measuring approximately 23.7cm across each of its three sides, it is elegantly bound in leather and gilded on the front. In European grimoire tradition, one frequently finds the practice of conjuring spirits into a triangle drawn on the ground. This particular shape, fortified by the divine names written around it, was thought to force a spirit to answer honestly and perform its duties without tarrying. By making the manuscript in triangular form, the author may have intended to emphasize the book's spiritual nature.

Career  Cook's interest in photography began while she was working for the US government in Europe. Upon returning to the United States she was employed as one of the first photographers for The Village Voice. The Village Voice was an alternative weekly publication, which acted as a platform for creatives in New York city, beginning circulation in 1955 and ending in 2018. While creating content for the publication, Cook photographed poet Jean Cocteau, playwright Loraine Hansberry, Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Motherwell, writer Norman Mailer and many other famous artists, writers and icons of the time period. After moving to Provincetown, Massachusetts with her partner in the 1960s, Cook opened the first photographic gallery on the east coast; the VII Photographers studio. The studio represented many successful photographers such as Bernice Abbott, Eugene Atget, Edward Steichen, Harry Callahan, and Minor White. The studio famously sold prints by Ansel Adams for only $35. At the time, photography was considered an art form by only a small community and although patrons were frequent, the studio could not be sustained financially and Cook closed her doors only a few years after opening. Cook moved on to open the East End Bookshop, where she selectively stocked the shelves based on her personal judgment of quality of the literature. In 1966 Cook hired the soon- to-be famous American filmmaker John Waters, with whom she would maintain a relationship for over 40 years following. When her health began showing signs of decline in 1969, Cook closed the book shop. In the 1970s Cook worked as a literary agent for her partner Mary Oliver, among other writers, as well as an assistant to Norman Mailer. While working as her agent, anytime they received a call for Oliver, Cook would act as her and many editors would play along.  Personal life  Cook and Oliver lived together in Provincetown, Massachusetts, after first meeting at the former home of poet Edna St Vincent Millay in the late 1950s. Oliver dedicated many works to Cook and while accepting the national book award in 1992 she publicly thanked Cook saying \\"Molly Malone Cook, the best reader anyone could have. She is the light of my life\\". After Cook's death in 2005, Oliver published Our World; a compilation of Cook's journal entries and photography, accompanied by memories, prose and poetry written by Oliver. Throughout her profession, Cook developed friendships with many iconic American artists such as playwright Loraine Hansberry, writer Norman Mailer and director John Waters. Waters is said to have brought magazines and newspapers to Cook's home every day towards the end of her illness. After being put up for adoption as an infant, Cook spent her adulthood interested in discovering her own ancestry. Cook and Oliver visited Virginia several times with the intent of doing so. Among her discoveries, Cook found that she was in fact related to Judith Jefferson, the aunt of Thomas Jefferson. Cook was eventually able to meet her birth parents.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, New York City, United States, in March 2007. Global Feminisms was the first international exhibition exclusively dedicated to feminist art from 1990 to present. The exhibition was co-curated by Maura Reilly and Linda Nochlin and consists of work by 88 women artists from 62 countries. Global Feminisms showcased work in all media forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, film, video, installation, and performance, with a focus on contemporary feminist art from a global perspective. Conceived as a counterpoint to the landmark 1976 exhibition Women Artists: 1850-1950, the curators aimed to move beyond a Western exclusionary feminism, which has dominated understandings of feminism and feminist art since the 1970s, towards one that is less-defined by a western center and \\"other\\" peripheries. The exhibition included a catalogue with essays by Maura Reilly, Linda Nochlin, N'Gon√© Fall, Geeta Kapur, Michiko Kasahara, Virginia P√©rez-Ratton, √âlisabeth Lebovici, Joan Kee, and Charlotta Kotik. Artists involved Global Feminisms featured the work of young and mid-career artists, all born after 1960. These include * Lida Abdul * Mequitta Ahujha * Pilar Albarrac√≠n * Ghada Amer * Emmanuelle Antille * Arahmaiani * Fiona Banner * Anna Baumgart * Rebecca Belmore * Kate Beynon *Cass Bird *Cabello/Carceller (Helena Cabello and Ana Carceller) *Hsia-Fei Chang *Beatrice Cussol *Amy Cutler *Zoulikha Bouabdellah *Elina Brotherus * Tania Bruguera * Lee Bul *Ambreen Butt *Mary Coble * Angela de la Cruz *Iskra Dimitrova * Latifa Echakhch * Tracey Emin *Fiona Foley * Parastou Forouhar *Maria Friberg * Regina Jos√© Galindo *Anna Gaskell *Margi Geerlinks * Skowmon Hastanan * Mich√®le Magema * Oreet Asherry * Teresa Margolies * Chantal Michel * Mandana Moghaddam * Ingrid Mwangi * Nikki S.

The artworks included Ryoko Suzuki (Japanese, b. 1970) Bind, 2001, Boryana Rossa (Bulgarian, b. 1972) Celebrating the Next Twinkling, 1999, Ingrid Mwangi (Kenyan, b. 1975) Static Drift, 2001, Tania Bruguera (Cuban, b. 1968) Statistic (Estadistica), 1996, among many others. Themes The Global Feminisms exhibition was arranged by theme, whereas the exhibition catalog was organized geographically. The question that surrounded the exhibition is 'what is feminist art?'. There are a number of definitions of feminist art, therefore, there are several themes throughout the exhibition. The exhibition was displayed in a space that is anchored by the permanent installation of Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, as installed by Maura Reilly. Themes within the exhibition included openness, multiculturalism, variety, and gender inequality. Global Feminisms explored feminist issues among women across and within different cultures, races, classes, religions, and sexualities. Themes within these larger overarching thematic patterns included death, pain, old age, war, sex, and motherhood. The installation at the Brooklyn Museum did not follow a linear chronology, but was organized by four categories which the works overlap: life cycles, identities, politics, and emotion. Life cycles consisted of the stages of life from birth to death. Identities investigated the notions of the self, including racial, gender, political, and religious identities. Politics explored the world through women artists who have demonstrated that the political is personal. Emotions presented the conventional idea of women as emotional creatures and victims. Reviews and critiques In a written survey conducted after viewing feminist artworks at the Brooklyn Museum, participant responses revealed that participants had a new awareness of feminism. It is said that Global Feminisms jumps back and forth between the success platforms of the marketplace and the institutional stage. It has been critiqued that most of the work within the exhibition is body-oriented and familiar to the point of old-fashioned.

The incident was reported to 911 at 3:19 pm.  Incident  According to a 911 caller, the shooter entered the store and ordered the women inside to strip at gunpoint and sexually assaulted several of them before shooting one in the head. The suspect ordered the women to strip and submit to sexual intercourse; when one of the women refused to comply, he shot her. The injured woman, identified as 53-year old Jamie Schmidt, was transported to the hospital, where she died.  Suspect  Witness descriptions to police detailed the perpetrator as a white male, about 5 feet 7 inches with a heavy build and aged 40 to 50, with a black jacket and blue jeans with a large belt and a black or gray hat. The description was updated by police on November 20, that the perpetrator was 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall, wearing a paper-boy style hat, a navy blue Carhartt-style jacket, and a red, white and black plaid shirt. Responding officers found no evidence at the crime scene to help them identify a suspect. However, officers interviewed workers at neighboring businesses and a server at the Hotshots sports bar recognized the description of the suspect as matching that of a man who had recently left his business card. Police sifted through the trash, found the card, and immediately went to his home to make the arrest. The manhunt lasted just under two days. Thomas Bruce is a United States Navy veteran. Bruce and his wife, Diane, filed for bankruptcy on January 2017, listing $92,000 in assets and $159,000 in debt. Thomas Bruce was unemployed at the time of the crime. From 2003 to 2007 Bruce was pastor of a congregation of a few dozen people, Calvary Chapel of Cape Girardeau.  Legal proceedings  Suspect Thomas Bruce is being held without bail. He was arraigned on November 27, 2018, on charges of first-degree murder and on multiple counts of sodomy, armed criminal action, kidnapping, burglary and tampering with evidence. He was charged on December 4, 2018, with 17 felony counts, including murder in the first degree and multiple counts of sodomy. According to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, Bruce could be subject to the death penalty. The date of the trial is 10/13/2020. = Additional charges = Trisha Stefanski, the Jefferson County prosecuting attorney, has charged Bruce with invading the home of a 77-year-old woman near Hillsboro on September 27, 2018, kidnapping, sexually abusing, assaulting, and robbing.  Death penalty  A political conversation developed in the wake of the murder over whether or not newly elected County Prosecutor Wesley Bell will pursue the death penalty if Bruce is convicted. Former St. Louis police chief Tim Fitch has urged Bell to turn the case over to federal prosecutors so that they can seek the death penalty.

History The building's architects, Foster + Partners, said it was intended to complement the Gherkin, owned and designed by the same team. The tower was to be a visitor attraction without any office space. It would have been London's second tallest building. Work could have started as early as 2020 with a scheduled completion date of 2025. A planning application was submitted to the City of London planning authority on 19 November 2018. It faced opposition from Historic England and Historic Places, who argued that the tower would impact views of the Tower of London. The Greater London Authority expressed \\"significant concerns\\" about the design. A survey completed by 1,011 Londoners in December 2018, suggested that two- thirds believed the tower would be \\"an attractive addition to the London skyline\\". In November 2018, London City Airport officials insisted that National Air Traffic Services (NATS) be consulted regarding the impact rotating gondolas would have on radar systems; NATS responded that \\"it was satisfied that no impact from either the building or the moving gondolas is anticipated.\\" The city's planning and transportation committee approved the scheme on 2 April 2019. Opposition The tower has been opposed by Historic England, Historic Royal Palaces, and the Greater London Authority. Following the approval, chief executive of Historic England Duncan Wilson said he was disappointed with the decision and that the construction \\"would damage the very thing its developers claim they will deliver ‚Äì tourism and views of London‚Äôs extraordinary heritage\\". Duncan also claimed that the Tower of London has \\"already been damaged by the Walkie Talkie and it would be a great shame if that mistake was repeated\\", referring to the approval granted for the Tulip's construction. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also shown objection with the construction, saying that the tower breaches the London Plan by restricting free entry to the publicly-accessible viewing platform. He also said that the protected views of the Tower of London would be harmed.  Rejection  The tower was refused planning permission by Sadiq Khan on 15 July 2019. Historic England welcomed the rejection, saying in a statement \\"We have long been of the opinion that this is the wrong building in the wrong place. We advised that its height and design ‚Äì essentially a tall lift shaft with a bulge on top ‚Äì would cause permanent and irreversible damage to the setting of the Tower of London, and in turn, the image and identity of the capital.\\"  References  Proposed buildings and structures in London ","title":"Tulip (tower)"},{"id":"59114809","text":"Domantas ≈†imkus (born 10 February 1996) is a Lithuanian football player.

As a professional painter at the Central Academy of Fine Arts from 1976 and a prominent member of the Stars Art Group from 1979‚Äì80, Shao Fei combines the use of expressionism, fantastic and figurative art in her works. In China, she has influenced the contemporary art movement and eliminated artistic restrictions imposed on female artists.  Life = Early life = Her mother, Shao Jingkun, was an oil painter and taught her guo hua technique at an early age. At the age of sixteen, Shao Fei joined the PLA (People's Liberation Army) where she served in the forces from 1970-76. During these years, she continued to practice painting. She entered the Beijing Fine Art Academy as a full-time professional painter in 1976 and was highly respected by other painters. = Groups = Shao Fei was a prominent member of the Stars Art Group (xing xing) from 1979-80. During this time, she participated in the Star Art Exhibition held on September 27, 1979. The Chinese government disapproved of their art and did not grant them permission to hold the exhibition. In protest, Shao Fei and other Stars Art Group members held the exhibition outside the China Art Gallery to challenge the government over their authority of classifying art. In November 1979, the government granted them permission to officially hold their first exhibition ‚ÄúStar Art Exhibition‚Äù (xing xing hua zhan) in Beijing. = Relationships = Shao Fei was married to Bei Dao, a Chinese poet who openly opposed the Chinese government. They had one child. In 1987, they went to England when Bei Dao was invited as a visiting scholar at Durham University. In the 1990s, they emigrated to the US. Shao Fei and Bei Dao later separated.  Art = Art Style = Shao Fei's works are usually decorative, fantastical, and figurative. She practices expressionist devices in her oil paintings, and she often depicts women and children in her work. = Works = Shao Fei's works are often inspired by historical private gardens that were common in Xiuning, Angui during the Ming Dynasty from 1368-1644. Many of these garden scenes were made into woodcut illustrations, which Shao Fei incorporates into her art. She also includes mythological creatures inspired by the Chinese classic text Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas). Her art work, Last Song of the Grand Historian, is painted on both the front and back of the paper. This results in thick, opaque layers that resemble heavy colour painting. The rich colours used portray the intense range of emotions the viewer is meant to feel. Shao Fei distorts the subjects in her painting, so that the scene parallels an imaginary world.  Exhibitions  Shao Fei's exhibitions mainly toured in China, Japan, and the US. In 1982, her works were featured at the Exhibition of the Central Academy of Beijing in China. The exhibition, Contemporary Chinese Painting, toured the US which featured many of her paintings done in 1984-85. = Collections = Many of Shao Fei's collections are currently featured in the National Art Museum of China, Hong Kong Museum of Art, and private collections in China.  Reception  Shao Fei gained popularity as an exceptional painter, having received many positive reviews from art critics and news outlets. China Daily has described her work as a bridge between the real and the imaginary, stating, ‚ÄúHer delicate brush strokes and vibrant colors have connected the past and present, reality and fantasy.‚Äù Her paintings have been praised as powerfully emotional and deeply decorative, which art historian Michael Sullivan has noted her for her unique expressionist and fantastic art style.  Impact  Social and cultural conservatism in China has restricted Chinese female artists to go beyond the realms of traditional art genres. Shao Fei goes beyond the norms and restrictions by composing landscape and figure paintings with highly expressive and decorative strokes, rather than the typical subdued, muted ones traditionally tied with women's art in China. Subsequently, she has expanded the possible art genres for women artists to explore in China.

Career  His directorial debut film Sensitive Age or Age of Sensitivity (Ganguang shidai) won the special golden prize at the 6th 'Harbin Ice and Snow Cup' Film Festival in 1994. The film was also nominated for the director's maiden work at the 4th Golden Rooster Award in 1995. It features a song by rock singer Cui Jian, Greenhouse Girl, \\"as a commentary on a young photographer's painstaking, solitary struggle within a commodified society and his yearnings for artistic and personal freedom.\\" In 2005, Sensitive Age was recognized as one of 100 outstanding masterpieces in three hundred years across the Straits of Chinese films, representing 1994. A second film, A Chinese Moon (Zhongguo yueliang), followed in 1995. The film City Love (also called Urban Love (Chengshi aiqing) or Love in the Winter (Dongri aiqing)) was banned by the China Film Bureau for its content regarding the Cultural Revolution (it includes \\"dream-like sequences ... in which the male lead remembers his parents' humiliation at the hands of the Red Guards\\") and cohabitation. The film participated in the 15th Turin International Film Festival, and 45th Sebastian International Film Festival, as an Underground Film. After he returned home from the international film festivals, China revoked Ah Nian's directing qualifications. In 1999, China Film Group invited Ah Nian to direct a youth film project, Call Me (Hu wo), and his directorial qualification were restored.

The scandal, involving unreported future post retirement compensation and improper use of company funds by Ghosn, was described by Saikawa as a \\"negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn\\".

One of the most prominent pro-Turkish formations in the FSA, the group fought in the Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì2016) and other campaigns in Aleppo Governorate against the Syrian government, ISIL, and the SDF. The exact origin of the current Muntasir Billah Brigade is unclear, and it is possible that it originated as remnant of a rebel group that had been active in Raqqa Governorate until being subsumed by the al-Nusra Front and ISIL in 2013.  History = Raqqa militia = The exact origin of Raqqa's Muntasir Billah Brigade is unclear. One of its fighters stated that he joined the group \\"when the revolution began\\", and NOW News reported that it originated in or around Raqqa city. By early 2013, the Muntasir Billah Brigade was an Islamist-leaning Free Syrian Army militia that operated as part of the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigades and fought against government forces in Raqqa Governorate, while receiving support by Qatar. Though relatively small at the time, the Muntasir Billah Brigade played a significant part during the Battle of Raqqa (March 2013). Having joined the \\"Raqqa Liberation Front's Military and Revolutionary Council\\", the unit first helped other rebel groups to clear the city's outskirts of Syrian Army outposts on 3 March. Three days later, Raqqa's remaining garrison handed over the eastern entrance, and then the city's center, to the Muntasir Billah Brigade and the al-Nusra Front, mostly without offering any resistance. It remains unclear how this came to pass. In any case, capturing the city was a major success for the militia, and it subsequently took part in the siege of the nearby 17th Division base which was still held by the Syrian Army. In July 2013, the Muntasir Billah Brigade and other FSA units in Raqqa united and formed the 11th Division in an attempt to counterbalance the rising power of various Jihadist groups such as the al- Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Islamic State of Iraq (later Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). As time went on, however, ISIL began to eclipse the other groups in power, so that fighters of the Muntasir Billah Brigade started to defect to the Islamic State. In September 2013, the Muntasir Billah Brigade joined the al-Nusra Front in an attempt to halt its decline. At the time, the militia claimed to consist of 15 battalions. In October, the group fought in Tabqa against government holdouts. After ISIL suppressed the al-Nusra Front in its territory, the Muntasir Billah Brigade lost its protector, and consequently chose to join ISIL in December 2013. = Aleppo militia = Besides a white flag with its logo, the Muntasir Billah Brigade also uses the regular flag of Turkey as well as a green variant of the latter It is unclear how and to what extent Raqqa's Muntasir Billah Brigade is related to the militia of the same name that appeared in Aleppo after the former's submission to ISIL. Firas Pa≈üa, leader of Aleppo's Muntasir Billah Brigade, stated in a 2017 interview with TRT World that his militia was founded by Turkmen and Arab natives of Aleppo city in 2013, while NOW News reported that Firas' group \\"has its origins in Raqqa\\". Regardless of its origin, the Muntasir Billah Brigade of Firas Pa≈üa was fighting for the Syrian opposition in the Battle for Aleppo by January 2014, and consisted mostly of Turkmens at the time. In October 2015, the militia was among the rebel groups that attacked the YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood district of Aleppo, accusing the YPG of aiding the government and attacking Turkmen villages. By early 2016, the Muntasir Billah Brigade was still rather small, counting just 350 fighters, but its leader had gained some prominence in Turkey. Pa≈üa \\"regularly\\" appeared in Turkish television at the time, talking about the situation of the Turkmens in Syria and attempting to garner support for his group. Meanwhile, the Muntasir Billah Brigade suffered from heavy Russian airstrikes, causing Pa≈üa to argue that \\"if there were no Russian planes, there would be no Assad today\\". The militia joined the \\"Army of Aleppo\\" rebel coalition in February, and subsequently took part in unsuccessfully resisting a large Russian-backed offensive by government forces as well as the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Aleppo countryside. The Muntasir Billah Brigade also fought in the Northern Aleppo offensive (March‚ÄìJune 2016) against ISIL, this time as part of the Army of Conquest. On 20 June 2016, the militia took part in a prisoner exchange with Liwa al-Quds, a pro-government militia. Like several other Turkmen FSA units, the Muntasir Billah Brigade moved at least part of its forces from Aleppo city to support the Turkish-led Operation Euphrates Shield in November 2016. This further weakened the last rebel resistance in the city, which was fully retaken by government forces in the following December. A senior official of the Muntasir Billah Brigade justified the retreat by arguing that the rebel defeat in Aleppo had become inevitable anyway. The group arrested three Syrian Army soldiers near al-Bab in May 2017, reportedly to prevent them from looting a village. In early 2018, the militia took part in Operation Olive Branch which resulted in the conquest of Afrin Canton from the SDF. After the capture of Afrin city, the Muntasir Billah Brigade distributed 300 tons of sugar among the local populace. The group claimed that the sugar had been captured from the \\"black market storage room of the PYD\\" and this proved that \\"the Turkish army and the Free Syrian Army, have come here [Afrin] to put an end to [the PYD's] oppression\\". On the other side, the pro-PYD Hawar News Agency accused the unit and allied groups of looting antiquities in the Mobata district.  Organization and ideology  The Muntasir Billah Brigade is prominently led by Firas Pa≈üa, and consisted of 350 fighters, 170 of them ethnic Turkmen, by February 2016. The group is among the Syrian rebel groups that support or at least tolerate Turkish nationalist or pan-Turkic ideologies like Neo- Ottomanism and Turanism. As result, the Muntasir Billah Brigade has been associated with various Turkish right-wing or Islamist associations: By 2016, the militia received aid from the Grey Wolves and Great Unity Party, though Firas Pa≈üa claimed at the time that no Turkish citizens were fighting with his group. By 2018, several Turkish jihadists and ultranationalists had joined the militia. Despite this, Firas Pa≈üa has argued that his group makes no great distinction between Turkmens and Arabs, and mostly accepts aid by Turkish and Islamist groups out of simple necessity. The militia has also received support by the Turkish state, particularly after joining the Syrian National Army (SNA). Parts of the Muntasir Billah Brigade were trained by the Turkish Armed Forces in early 2018. By 2019, the unit served as \\"Brigade 122\\", part of the Division 12, in the SNA's First Legion. The militia is also known to distribute and organize humanitarian aid in the Aleppo countryside, and was supported by organizations like T√ºrkmen-Der and the Turkish Red Crescent in this regard.

Her works often feature isolated moments in contemporary life and explores the fl√¢neur's observations, voyeurism and the uncanny.  Background and Family  Choo was born in Singapore, the older of two children. Her father works in the freight industry and her mother is an administrative manager. She has one younger brother, Mathias, who is pursuing film-making at Nanyang Technological University. During her second year in Nanyang Junior College, Choo was offered a full scholarship to read art at Goldsmiths, University of London. However, she had to turn down the offer due to her parents‚Äô disapproval. Choo attended the Nanyang Technological University; School of Art, Design and Media where she graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography and Digital Imaging, First Class Honours. Following that, she completed her master's degree in Fine Art Media at the University College London Slade School of Fine Art in 2015.  Career  Choo has done numerous solo and group exhibitions throughout her career. Most notably, Choo was part of the Singapore Pavilion at the 57th edition of the Venice Biennale in 2017. That year, the Singapore Pavilion was officially opened by Singapore Minister of Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu. Choo also teaches at the Nanyang Girls‚Äô High School Art Elective Programme. = 2017 Venice Biennale = At a fringe programme of the 57th Venice Biennale, Choo showed her work, The Art of The Rehearsal (2017), at the Personal Structures exhibition, organised by the European Cultural Centre and held at the Palazzo Bembo. The artwork was originally commissioned by the National Museum of Singapore and was the first permanent showcase of Gallery10, the museum's then newly opened space. It was done in collaboration with Shanghai- based commercial cinematographer Jeffrey Ang. The three-channel video installation shows nine traditional dancers from different cultures rehearsing against a collage of notable ethnic districts in Singapore ‚Äì Little India, Kampong Glam and Chinatown. Funded by the National Arts Council, the installation cost between S$200,000 and S$250,000 and featured dancers from local dance troupes, namely the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Dance Theatre, Apsaras Art and Era Dance Theatre. As the Venice exhibition space was approximately ten times smaller than in the National Museum of Singapore, Choo modified the installation such that viewers could go up close to the dancing figures, creating a sense that they were miniature models of a larger work.  Notable Works and Exhibitions  * Accelerated Intimacy (2018) ‚Äì A solo exhibition held during the annual Singapore Art Week, Accelerated Intimacy presents a series of events that are incomplete, escalating and present. A 5-channel immersive video installation ‚Äì which has decontextualised conversations intercut with lines from notable films ‚Äì is projected in a space that is transformed to mimic a hotel room. Additionally, photos and props from the video installation are put on display to create a ‚Äúlived‚Äù experience. * Singapore: Inside Out (2017) ‚Äì The Sydney edition of the exhibition features two of Choo's multimedia installations. Waiting for the Elevator (2014) portrays routine actions of persons at the void decks of public housing flats in Singapore to examine the social value of these environments while Puddles in the City (2014) feature metropolitan street performers when they are not performing. * Consecutive Breaths (2016) ‚Äì The video loop features various footages taken at over 80 Mass Transit Railway stations in Hong Kong and explores ideas related to waiting and the slowing down of time. The artwork was also featured in the 2018 edition of Loop Barcelona. * Wear You All Night (2016) ‚Äì The split screen video installation showcases a slice of life of a woman and a man in their private space. While the characters live together, they are isolated, resorting to using objects as a form of communication. The exhibitions highlights the urban isolation observed in metropolitan cities and the viewer takes on the role of a voyeur, observing the events from a window frame. This work was also featured at Loop Barcelona in 2017. * From Across the Road (2015) ‚Äì Held at the Maurice Einhardt Neu Gallery in London, the solo exhibition explores themes related to surveillance and voyeurism. The exhibition features three series ‚Äì Waiting for the Elevator (2014), Puddles in the City (2014) and It was a Tuesday like any other Tuesday (2014). A copy of Choo's journal where she notes down her thought process was also put on display. * Photo London (2015) - Choo's work was exhibited at the first Photo London photography fair at Somerset House since its hiatus in 2007. The exhibition featured her video work titled It was a Tuesday like any other Tuesday (2014) which includes multiple photographs taken over a night from her window in London, creating a voyeuristic perspective. * Cinema Total (2014) ‚Äì Choo's The Hidden Dimension II (2013) and It was a Tuesday like any other Tuesday (2014) were screened as part of the Berlinale programme hosted by the Collegium Hungaricum Berlin. * Singapore Art Week (2014) ‚Äì Represented by gallerist Vera Wijaya of Galerie Sogan & Art, Choo sold all five editions of her photography during the art fair to a Singapore-based buyer at S$6,500 per edition. * The Hidden Dimension II (2013) ‚Äì The multimedia installation features seven family members engaging in personal activities, played on repeat. The artwork examines modern isolation and loneliness despite living in a highly populated country. Despite sharing the same space, the family members do not interact with one another. The viewer takes on the role of the voyeur as they observe these private, lone moments. The piece was exhibited in the Learning Gallery of the Singapore Art Museum in 2015.  Awards  In January 2014, Choo won the 4th Edition of the ICON de Martell Cordon Bleu ‚Äì a S$30,000 award that acknowledges exceptional photographers in Singapore, launched by Martell. Choo was also awarded the Highly Commended Award in the 2007 United Overseas Bank Painting of the Year Competition.

Early life  She was born April 1, 1925 in Montreal, Quebec to Romanian parents. Growing up in the Mile-End district of Montr√©al, Tobie attended Baron-Byng High School, where she studied under Anne Savage‚Äì a critically acclaimed Canadian painter and founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters.  Education  Tobie Steinhouse earned a diploma from Sir George-Williams University in Montr√©al (now Concordia University) in Engineering Drawing. After graduation, she was hired as a draughtswoman, designing Anson warplanes from 1944 to 1945. During this time, she also worked for the Royal Canadian Air Force illustrating manuals. At the end of the war, Steinhouse attended the renowned Art Students League of New York with a scholarship to study art. After she graduated, Tobie went to Paris, France to study art further at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris.  Artistic career  After graduating from √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, various reputable French art galleries began to feature work. These include the Salon de l‚ÄôArt Libre, the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne, and the Salon de la Jeune Peinture. Tobie's first solo exhibition occurred in 1957 at Galerie Lara Vincy. Shortly after this exhibition, she worked in the studio of abstract painter Arpad Szenes. In 1961, Steinhouse began working at Atelier 17 with Stanley William Hayter, known now as one of the most significant printmakers of the 20th century. After her time in Paris, Steinhouse returned to Montr√©al with her husband. She became a founding member of L‚Äôatelier Libre de Recherches Graphiques and La Guilde Graphique. Additionally, Steinhouse became the president of the Canadian Group of Painters in 1967, and was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1972. Later in her career, Tobie taught printmaking at McGill University, and studied Japanese calligraphy under Hiroko Okata. To Steinhouse, calligraphy creates a serene space where artists can investigate the relationship between looking and doing. She received awards for her calligraphy at the International Exhibition of Japanese Calligraphy competition, held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum.  Major influences = Anne Savage = Tobie Steinhouse was tremendously influenced by Anne Savage's modern view on art and the art world; she was especially inspired by Anne's progressive pursuits concerning female independence and repute in the male-dominated art sphere. For example, Savage was involved in the Beaver Hall Group‚Äì an all-women art collective striving for a ‚Äúnew kind of art,\\" which Steinhouse recalls as demonstrating Savage's inspiring ‚Äúmodern way of looking‚Äù that informed her own work. Additionally, Savage was involved in Les Fammeuses ‚Äì an all-women charity art show under the aegis of Savage in 1999. This show was originally conceived to showcase established female artists, but also to provide a platform for up-and-coming female artists to present their work, in order to raise money and support women and children who have been victims of domestic violence. It started in 1986 as a small event hosting 300 visitors, but since then has become a highly reputable show raising tens of thousands of dollars, attracting thousands of people to significantly support both female artists and females in the community who are in need. Steinhouse looks back at her participation in this show with appreciation and fondness. Anne Savage later became a cherished friend of Tobie's, becoming the godmother to her son. = Stanley William Hayter = While working at Atelier 17 (Hayter's studio), Steinhouse was exposed to many artists, including Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir√≥, and other artists from Japan, South America, Germany, and Italy. This cultural diversity as well as Hayter's emphasis on experimentation and quick-pace work made this period one of immense artistic development for Steinhouse. It was at Atelier 17 where Steinhouse was first introduced to the intaglio colour process of engraving, which is a strenuous technique developed by Hayter himself that allows for several colours to be applied to the metal plate at the same time. Steinhouse found the process of intaglio printmaking physically challenging, but was extremely passionate about the medium, dedicating months of practicing lifting the plates, handling the press, and accurately working with the chemicals. Despite her being well versed in oil painting and watercolor at the time, intaglio printmaking became Steinhouse's preferred medium, and was used to create some of the works she is best known for.  Style  As a result of not being able to lift some of the heavier rollers often used in printmaking, Steinhouse uses the smaller 20-pound rollers, using each one separately; this results in a vertical line running down the middle of her work which has become her trademark. Her work usually uses a warm colour palette, and has been described as muted, layered, abstract, and highly textural, with a softness found in French Impressionist paintings. Common motifs found in her work are landscapes, houses, and domestic objects, evoking the memory and ephemera of every-day life; often, she uses images taken from her immediate surroundings such as her window at home. Additionally, she is heavily inspired by natural light ‚Äì sensitive to its variations depending on time of day and place, as well as poetry. For example, Steinhouse has used Miriam Waddington‚Äôs Into My Green World as inspiration for some of her pieces, which focusses on the beauty of nature as an antidote to the ugliness of modern urban life.  Awards and honors  Tobie Steinhouse has earned many awards and honors. These include: the Jessie Dow Prize for Painting in 1967, the Sterling Trust Award of the Society of Canadian Painters, Etchers, and Engravers, the Canadian Centennial Medal in 1967, and the Purchase Award from the Thomas Moore Institute in 1999.  Exhibitions  Tobie‚Äôs art is recognized world-wide. She has been included in preeminent international printmaking Biennials in Chile, England, Scotland, Venezuela, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States. Additionally, her work is represented in the Confederation Centre Art Gallery, The External Affairs Ministry of Canada, The Winnipeg Art Gallery, The Canadian Embassy in Moscow, The McMicheal Canadian Art Collection, The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, The Montreal Contemporary Art Museum (Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain de Montr√©al), and The National Gallery of Canada. Recently, a major retrospective of Tobie was held at Stewart Hall in Pointe-Claire in 2012, and Galerie Jean-Claude Bergeron had an exhibition of her work in 2015.  Personal life  Steinhouse married CBC producer and author Herbert Steinhouse in 1947. They met while she was studying at the Art Students‚Äô League in New York. At the time, Herbert was volunteering for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and was doing his master's degree at the New School for Social Research. While they were in Paris, Herbert was on a Canada Council grant to write a book. Together, they have two sons. Tobie now lives in Westmount in Montr√©al, Quebec. While she was working at McGill University teaching printmaking, one of her students accidentally poured acid directly onto a plate without diluting it, causing damage to her throat; a lifetime of using strong acids in the etching process exacerbated this damage. Resultantly, Steinhouse is known to have a quiet voice.  Artist statement  ‚ÄúGiving life to a simple sheet of metal; accepting the challenge to confer to it a certain meaning and an individual atmosphere through the colour, the form and the content - this is fascinating for me. I love etching. The process fascinates me. Of course, I also do watercolour, drawing and oil painting but again and again I return to etching. Poetry is a vital source of inspiration for me, a way of communicating inner visions and feelings. It creates a world of serenity, leaving my reveries free to roam while safeguarding my thoughts. Transient fashions and tendencies of the moment are fleeting. For the artist there is only one truth: to be honest with ourselves. It is a philosophy that comes with many years of practicing the \\"m√©tier,\\" with maturity, with the experiences of life itself, with a personalized sensitivity permitting the expression of one's own unique vision.\\"  References  External links  Canadian women painters 1925 births Artists from Montreal Canadian printmakers Living people 21st-century Canadian women artists ","title":"Tobie Steinhouse"},{"id":"59115071","text":"Boris Stepanov (22 August 1930 - 28 December 2007) was a Russian boxer.

Rideout was a trial held in Marion County Circuit Court in 1978 in Salem, Oregon. John Rideout was accused of raping his wife, Greta Rideout, the first man in the United States to be charged with raping his wife while they were still living together. The trial was the first in Oregon relating to marital rape since the state revised its rape law in 1977 to eliminate the marital rape immunity. Following a jury trial, John Rideout was acquitted. Background In 1977, Oregon passed a law removing marriage or cohabitation as a legal defense to a charge of rape.Rape Statute Being Put To Test In Oregon In 1978, Greta Rideout brought a charge of rape against her husband under the 1977 law. The alleged assault according to Greta Rideout occurred October 10, 1978, at their apartment in North Salem. Having been arguing recently and facing threats of violence from John, she had refused to have sex with him and attempted to leave the house. He then brought her back to the apartment and forced himself on her. When she tried to report this to the police, she was told according to Oregon law she had to wait two days to make a rape charge. He was then arrested a week later and the trial began two months after that on December 19, 1978. John became the first man in the United States to be charged with raping his wife while he was still living with her. There were other cases of marital rape charges brought before the courts in the United States prior to this, but they did not involve couples who had been cohabitating. Trial Charles Burt represented the husband, John Rideout, while Greta Rideout was represented by Marion County District Attorney Gary Gortmaker. Burt is quoted saying, ‚ÄúA woman who‚Äôs still in a marriage is presumably consenting to sex‚Ä¶Maybe this is the risk of being married, you know?...If this law‚Äôs interpretation isn‚Äôt corrected it will bring a flock of rape cases under very bad circumstances‚Ä¶The remedy is to get out of the marital situation.‚Äù He was found not guilty by a unanimous jury composed of eight women and four men on December 27, 1978. Aftermath Even though the verdict in this case was reached very quickly, the case itself stirred up public and governmental interest on the issue of marital rape and social rules about sex between husbands and wives. It also continued conversations on behalf of activists and government representatives on whether or not other states should pass similar laws allowing wives to charge husbands with rape. As marital rape exemption clauses were removed from state rules for prosecution during the 1970s and 1980s, more cases were brought to the courts. However, by 1987, only twelve states had laws allowing wives to charge their husbands with rape without considerations of legal separation or cohabitation. By 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 U.S. states. The case was even turned into a made for TV movie in 1980. John Rideout was again prosecuted for rape in 2016 almost 40 years after his acquittal for the rape of Greta Rideout. However, those charges stemmed from two different charges of rape in 2013. One by a woman who had hired John Rideout to do handyman work and another by his cohabitating girlfriend at the time. He was convicted of the rapes in 2017 and sentenced to two 100-month sentences. Some criticisms of the court's involvement in this matter included that it was an inefficient use of judicial resources, and that the public scrutiny of the Rideouts' private life may have prevented the Rideouts from saving their marriage.

It fought on the Western Front in World War I. Postwar it was amalgamated with the Denbighshire Hussars as a medium artillery regiment that served in World War II. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì3.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. One such unit was the 1st Carnarvonshire Artillery Volunteer Corps raised at Carnarvon on 12 March 1862.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 38‚Äì9. It was a small unit (51 strong in 1871), and for most of the 1860s and 1870s only had one officer, Captain William Turner, commissioned on 13 August 1864, and later Sub-Lieutenant William Owen, commissioned on 20 June 1874.Army List, various dates. In 1863 it joined the 1st Administrative Brigade of Anglesey Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs). However, Volunteer recruitment in Anglesey declined and in 1873 the remaining Anglesey and Carnarvon AVCs were transferred to the Administrative Brigade in Cheshire This was consolidated as the 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire Artillery Volunteer Corps in 1880, with 1st Carnarvon AVC providing No 8 Company. In 1882 the 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire was assigned to the Lancashire Division of the Royal Artillery, but when the divisional structure was reduced in 1889 it joined the Southern Division. On 1 June 1899 all the Volunteer artillery units became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and from 1902 the unit became the 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire RGA (Volunteers). However, in 1904 the Carnarvonshire batteries were withdrawn to form a separate unit, the 1st Carnarvonshire RGA (V) of four companies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Savage, VD, with the following organisation: * Headquarters at Glynne Road, BangorBangor at Drill Hall Project.Caernarvonshire at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. * No 1 Company at Bangor, formed from part of No 6 Company * No 2 Company at Llanfairfechan, formed from part of No 6 Company * No 3 Company at University College of North Wales, Bangor, formerly No 7 Company * No 4 Company at Carnarvon and Penygroes, formerly No 8 Company Territorial Force 4.7-inch gun on 'Woolwich' carriage, ca 1914. When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Carnarvonshire RGA (V) became the Welsh (Carnarvonshire) RGA, with its HQ at Bangor and a dedicated Ammunition Column at Agyll Road, Llandudno.Llandudno at Drill Hall Project.

World War I=Mobilisation= The units of the Welsh Division had just departed for their annual summer camp when the order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. They then returned home and assembled at their drill halls to mobilise. The Welsh (Carnarvonshire) Heavy Battery mobilised at Bangor under the command of Major W.H. Hughes, who had held the command since 20 December 1913.53rd (W) Division at Long, Long Trail.TF RGA at Regimental Warpath. By 11 August the Welsh units had completed their concentration and TF members were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. Four days later the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/1st Welsh (Carnarvonshire) Heavy Battery= At the end of August the Welsh Division concentrated at Northampton to continue its training. On 18 November the division was warned for garrison duty in India, but this was cancelled and in December it moved to Cambridge, then to Bedford in May 1915. In July the infantry of the division (now renamed the 53rd (Welsh) Division) embarked for service at Gallipoli, leaving the divisional artillery behind in Bedford. On 20 November the divisional field artillery left to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, but the heavy battery remained at Bedford. with the 2nd Line Welsh Division (now numbered as the 68th (2nd Welsh) Division).Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 83‚Äì90. Finally, on 16 February 1916 the battery went to Woolwich to mobilise for overseas service with the BEF.

The obsolescent 4.7-inch guns were progressively replaced in the BEF by 60-pounders during 1916. In December 1916 the WO decided that all heavy batteries should be composed of six guns and 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty was brought up to that strength on 7 March 1917 when it was joined by a section of 201st Hvy Bty (newly arrived in France and immediately broken up).Farndale, Western Front, Annex E Vimy Ridge A battery of 60-pounders deployed during the Battles of Vimy and Arras, 1917. After this reorganisation, 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty joined 31st HAG in First Army on 11 March. On 20 March the artillery preparation began for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, with the batteries of 31st HAG firing from around Bully Grenay on the extreme north flank of the attack, from where they could virtually enfilade the German lines in support of I Corps. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised counter-battery fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the 60-pounders switched to 'searching' fire on the German rear areas to catch machine gunners and moving infantry. When the British infantry reached their Phase 2 objective (the Blue Line) the field guns would move forward and the 60-pounders move up to occupy their vacated positions. The attack went in on 9 April with I Corps and Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge while Third Army attacked further south near Arras. The only hold-up on 9 April was at Hill 145, near the north end of the Canadian attack, and the capture of this position was completed the next day. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty came under the command of 15th HAG on 11 May 1917 and moved to 67th HAG on 4 July, while First Army carried out a number of operations round Oppy Wood and Hill 70. Then on 23 October it moved to 11th HAG with Second Army, which was engaged in the final actions of the Battle of Passchendaele.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7. Spring Offensive A 60-pounder battery firing in the open during the German Spring Offensive, 1918. Second Army HQ was sent to the Italian Front at the end of 1917, and Fourth Army took over the Ypres Salient, with 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty transferring to 53rd HAG on 18 December. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 the HAGs were converted into permanent RGA brigades, with 53rd becoming a 'Mixed' brigade of 60-pounders and batteries of various calibres of howitzers.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. Second Army HQ resumed command of the Ypres sector (including 53rd (Mixed) Bde RGA), in March 1918 and was soon involved in the Battle of the Lys, the second phase of the German Spring Offensive that involved great loss of ground and rapid retreat for much of the artillery. The German advance on Second Army's front was halted on 29 April.Blaxland, pp. 17‚Äì24. Hundred Days A 60-pounder moving up during the Hundred Days Offensive, 1918. 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty received an extended rest from 27 July to 17 August. Next day Second Army joined in the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive with the capture of several important ridges, and then a succession of attacks in early September. Second Army's contribution to the great series of coordinated offensives starting on 28 September was the Fifth Battle of Ypres (28 September‚Äì2 October). 53rd Brigade including 1/1st Welsh Hvy Bty switched to First Army on 2 October and remained with it until the Armistice with Germany, including the Battle of the Selle, when it was under the command of VIII Corps to support XXII Corps crossing of the Echaillon and advance to the Schelde, and the Battle of the Sambre.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 380‚Äì3.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 313-4. The battery was placed in suspended animation in 1919. =2/1st Welsh (Carnarvonshire) Heavy Battery= The 2nd Line unit was raised in 1914 and joined the 68th (2nd Welsh) Division, which concentrated at Northampton in April 1915. It moved to Bedford in the summer to replace the 53rd (Welsh) Division. Training of the units was made difficult by the lack of arms and equipment, although a trickle of horses and saddlery and later some obsolete guns reached the division during the year. 68th (2nd Welsh) Division was now assigned a role in Home Defence and joined First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force, with its units quartered across Eastern England. In May 1917 it transferred to Northern Army (Home Forces), and the heavy battery was stationed at Leiston during the summer before moving into winter quarters at Blythburgh. 2/1st Welsh (Carnarvonshire) Bty remained with 68th Division, supplying drafts to units overseas, until May 1918 when it joined 227th Mixed Brigade. It remained stationed at Blythburgh with four old 4.7-inch guns until the end of the war.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 7. It was disbanded in 1919. Postwar When the TF was reformed in 1920, the Welsh (Carnarvonshire) RGA was initially reformed as 12th (Carnarvon and Denbigh) Medium Brigade, RGA, which was to have had its HQ and two batteries at Colwyn Bay and one battery at Bangor. When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year the unit was redesignated 61st Medium Brigade, RGA, with probably only one battery (241 Medium Bty) at Bangor. However, wartime experience showed that the army had too many mounted units, and only the 14 most senior Yeomanry Cavalry regiments in the TA were retained as horsed cavalry, the remainder being converted to armoured cars or artillery. On 1 March 1922 the Denbighshire Hussars were merged with the new medium brigade to form 61st (Carnarvon & Denbigh Yeomanry) Medium Brigade, RGA with the following organisation:Litchfield, Appendix VII. * HQ at Drill Hall, Colwyn Bay * 241 (Carnarvon) Medium Bty at Bangor, from 61st Medium Bde * 242 (Carnarvon) Medium Bty at Llandudo, from Denbighshire Hussars * 243 (Denbigh) Medium Bty at Colwyn Bay, from Denbighshire Hussars * 244 (Denbigh) Medium Bty at Wrexham from Denbighshire Hussars The commanding officer (CO) was Acting Lt-Col W.F. Christian, DSO of the RGA, with Major W.H. Hughes (the Welsh Heavy Battery's prewar CO) as senior major. No prewar officers of the Denbigh Yeomanry were carried over to the new brigade. =241 (Carnarvon) Medium Battery= When the TA was doubled in size just before World War II, 241 Medium Bty transferred to 69th (Carnarvon & Denbigh Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, which served in the Battle of France, the Middle East, Italy and North West Europe. After the war the regiment underwent a number of amalgamations until in 1967 it became Q (Denbighshire and Caernarvonshire Yeomanry) Bty in the Flintshire and Denbighshire Yeomanry, RA. In 1971 it was reformed as infantry, forming B (Flintshire and Denbighshire Yeomanry) Company in 3rd Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers. The Denbighshire Yeomanry lineage was discontinued from 1999 to 2013, when a new 398 (Flintshire & Denbighshire Yeomanry) Transport Squadron, Royal Logistics Corps, was formed in the Army Reserve.Deesite.com 20 November 1013.

She headed the Women's Department of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1947 to 1956 and then became a Secretary of the Party between 1956 and 1966. In 1966, she was elected as Deputy Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. During her tenure, through 1989, she stepped into the Chair of the Presidium between January and February 1984, as acting head of state. Early life Nizoramo Odinovna Kasyma was born on 8 March 1923 in the village of Pusheni in the Kulob Oblast of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic. Her father was a poor farmer, Odin Kasym, who died when she was five years old. Her mother raised Kasyma, along with her brother and three sisters alone, but their brother died when Kasyma was thirteen. To make ends meet, the family worked on the collective farm, picking cotton and mowing grass, when the girls were not in school. When their mother remarried, as she was grateful to their new stepfather, Kasyma took his surname, Zaripova. In 1937, Zaripova was sent by the district authorities to begin her studies at the Women's Pedagogical School in Stalinabad, but as her parents were not able to pay her expenses, she withdrew in 1940 and returned home. Enrolling in the Kulob Pedagogical School, she graduated at the beginning of World War II. Career Hired by the Komsomol committee, during the war, Zaripova visited collective farms and distributed rations to the fieldworkers. In 1945, she was promoted to head the Department of the Kulyab Regional Committee of the Tajik Komsomol. Between 1947 and 1952, she headed the Women's Work Department of the Kulyab Regional Committee. In 1952, she was approached by the party leadership to go to Moscow to take courses at the Higher Party School. Though she did not want to go, because she had married Zuhursho Rahmatulloev and the couple had children, she knew she had no choice. Six months into her studies in Moscow, she was offered the position by Bobojon Ghafurov to head the Women's Department for the Central Committee of the Party. She agreed to take up the post when she finished her courses in six months. At the end of the year, Zaripova returned to Stalinabad, though her family was living in Kulob and worked for one year before returning to Moscow to complete her studies at the Higher Party School in 1954. She returned upon completion of her studies to Stalinabad and resumed her work as head of the Women's Department. In 1956, Zaripova was promoted as a Secretary of the Tajik Communist Party, serving in the post until 1966. Simultaneously, she served as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR through 1963. She was a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1958, was re-elected to the post in 1962, and in 1964 served as the head of the Ideological Department of the Tajik Communist Party. Committed to improving the lives of women and girls, Zaripova introduced measures in the 1960s to establish quotas for women to attend university. She also pressed for the establishment of secondary schools for girls in rural villages, as well as the founding of a medical college in the Shahrtuz District. Zaripova often toured remote collective farms and inspected the conditions both inside the Tajik SSR and in the other Soviet Republics. After one trip to Turkmen SSR, where she noted that each collective there had a woman as vice chair of the collective, she returned and proposed a similar policy for the Tajik SSR. The policy was adopted and as a result, 480 women were placed in leadership positions. She was a member of the and the attended congresses of the Women's International Democratic Federation. In 1966, Zaripova became the Deputy Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR, serving under chair . She served as Deputy Chair until 1989, and during this time, between January and February 1984, was the acting Chair, effectively the head of state. After her retirement, Zaripova continued to be involved in women's issues, working with various NGOs to improve health services and opportunities for women's business and entrepreneurship. She was made an honorary member of the Tajik Committee on Women's Affairs. She also serves on the Council of Elders.

Currently it is awarded in four categories: Gold Medal, Silver Medal, Cross with red badge and Cross with white badge. All of them, except the Cross with white badge, have pensions attached to the salary of the police.  Creation, design and categories  This order was created by decree of June 18, 1943, with the aim of providing a way to reward the police for their outstanding actions, both in the form of \\"extraordinary services practised \\" and in the \\"work or studies of outstanding scientific interest or professional technique \\". The creation of the medal was raised to the rank of law on May 15, 1945 and extended the corresponding pension to immediate family members in case the decorated was for death in the act of service. Initially, the medal was awarded in three categories: gold, silver and bronze, but Law 5/1964, of April 29, in addition to specifying the causes that could lead to the award of the first two categories, eliminated the last one. In its place the categories of Cross with red badge and Cross with white badge were created. = Medals = The design of the medals was established in 1945, based on two of the works submitted to the public tender called. The adopted model was a 40 mm circle with an obverse showing the \\"sacrifice for the service under guardianship of the Guardian Angel\\" with the inscription \\"To the police merit\\". On the back a sword representing Justice with the slogan \\"Service-Sacrifice\\". The medal hangs on a green ribbon with the colors of the Spanish flag on the edges. The ribbon carries a pin with the corresponding metal (gold or silver) in which it is inscribed the year of the concession. In the version that was accompanied by a pension on the ribbon, a longitudinal white stripe appeared. = Crosses = The 1964 law that created the Cross also specified its design, which has \\"a total length of 4.5 cm and is a regular octagon of 8 mm on the side.\\" In the center, on gold enamel, a sword enamelled in white and decorated. The arms, on the inner surface, will be enamelled in red or white depending on the class, and in the center, from left to right, it will read: \\"To Police Merit\\".

Thanks to them, the lake waters flowed out through the belly of Mount Salviano from the Avezzano side along the almost tunnel until they flowed into the Liri River on the opposite side of the mountain, under the old town of Capistrello. The underground canal represents the longest tunnel ever built since ancient times until the inauguration of the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel occurring in 1871. With the fall the Roman Empire, and during the Barbarian invasions, the main canal, not maintained anymore, became definitively clogged. Centuries later, starting from 1854, Alessandro Torlonia built the new canal, more than long, mostly following Claudius' immissary and emissary. The new hydraulic work, starting from a monumental inlet () situated near the lake south of Avezzano, known as Incile del Fucino (Fucine Inlet), allowed the definitive drainage of the lake. In 1902 the hydraulic work was included among Italian national monuments; the tunnel area represents a site of archaeological and speological interest, provided with a park inaugurated in 1977 with the purpose of protecting and exploiting the whole work..  History  Major tunnel on Mount Salviano Interior of the Blacksmith Tunnel (Cunicolo del Ferraro) = Origin of the plan = Before the Claudian works it was Julius Caesar, pressed by Marsi, the local inhabitants, to see to the reclamation plan of the Fucine plateau, in Abruzzo. The initial purpose was to control the unstable level of the lake, which very often flooded riparian villages because of the frequent cloggings of the only natural swallow-hole situated at Petogna near Luco dei Marsi, while in summer, above all because of the receding waters, the lands surrounding the inhabited areas often became marshy causing serious sanitary problems to the population.. According to Suetonius, beside the main purpose there was the ambitious aim of tracing a road connecting the Tiber with the Adriatic Sea through the Apennine Mountains Caesar was not able to provide for the work since he was killed before carrying out his plan. = Construction = A first planning hypothesis provided the digging of a canal that would let the lake waters flow out through the low Cesolino hill flowing them into the Salto River. This easily feasible plan was discarded quickly, because the considerable amount of water, flowing first into the Velino River, then into the Nera River, and finally into the Tiber, would represent a flood threat for Rome. A second but harder plan provided instead to let the lake waters flow into the Liri River along a tunnel dug in Mount Salviano. In 41 AD it was Emperor Claudius who resumed the ambitious plan and, thanks to a substantial public financing, entrusted a Roman enterprise with the works. The work, considered to be among the grandest hydraulic enterprises of the antiquity, was to regulate the flow of the Fucine Lake, feared by local populations due to the violence of its waters. Along its banks, about 30,000 men, among slaves and workmen, strove intent on the manual digging of the swallow-hole. Eleven years later, in 52 AD, the work was brought to an end.. First collateral tunnels were constructed, connected to each other by means of numerous inclined shafts (or wells), which served to prepare the main digging, having completed which, waters drained towards the Liri River. However, there were a lot of unexpected inconveniences and difficulties during the work construction, including several landslides occurring in the most vulnerable and sandiest sections of the belly or the mountain and in the area of the dam, that is the lock made between the Roman basins for the water storage and the mouth of the emissary near the Fucine inlet.. When the works were concluded Claudius, before the opening of the locks, celebrated the work by organizing a naumachia, a naval battle on the lake, with the presence of his wife Agrippina and the young Nero. Later on with Trajan, between 98 and 117 AD, and with Hadrian, between 117 and 138 AD, there were maintenance works, which became necessary right from the inauguration due to the configuration of the carved rock, with a great economic and even human cost. Thanks to this work the lake basin shrank by about warding off the flood danger. The economy of Marsica and especially of the municipalities of Alba Fucens, Lucus Angitiae and Marruvium became thriving, and the surrounding mountainous areas were chosen as holiday resorts.. = Decadence = With the fall of the Roman Empire and the Barbarian invasions which also marked Marsica history, maintenance inevitably failed, so much so that, most probably also because of a serious earthquake occurring in 508 AD,. canals became clogged with the consequence of the return of the Fucine Lake to the previous levels.. In the subsequent centuries Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (13th century) and Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies (1790) tried to restore the water drainage into the Roman emissary, failing in their purpose due to the scarsity of funds and the complexity of the project.. = New hydraulic works = Blacksmith Tunnel and well no. 23 in a drawing of 1683 by Raffaele Fabretti Emissary Layout of the Tunnels of Claudius (Atlas commissioned by Alessandro Torlonia in 1876) From 1826, about 18 centuries after the first Claudian drainage, new attempts to partially recover the function of the emissary were carried out by Cavaliere Luigi Giura and Commendatore Carlo Afan de Rivera.. Afan de Rivera was given the task by King Francis I of providing for the new restoration plan of the emissary of Claudius. But it was with the intervention of Roman banker Alessandro Torlonia that on 10 July 1854 the Claudian plan was resumed with the technical assistance of Swiss engineer Franz Mayor de Montricher. The work was concluded in 1870 by two engineers, Swiss site engineer Enrico Samuele Bermont and French deputy site engineer Alessandro Brisse, assisted by agent L√©on De Rotrou. In 1873 the gradual drainage of the Fucine Lake began, while the reclamation operations of the territory were brought to an end between 1875 and 1876.. Thus, following considerable economic efforts the Abruzzese lake was completely and definitively drained, which was the third in Italy as to the extent with about .. Workers and technicians, among the best and most qualified of the time, were employed for decades, who restored the original emissary enlarging its section. The waters of the Fucine flowed out slowly into the Liri River from the exit of the tunnel under the old town of Capistrello.. Other canals and wells were added to the old tunnels and those from the Roman age were enlarged.. The purpose of the rock-carved tunnels with an inclined course was that of allowing air to arrive into the Mount Salviano tunnel and workers, means and dug materials to pass through.. On 1 October 1878 the lake was officially declared drained. Thus the Fucine plain, having been reclaimed and quickly supplied with several facilities,. became a fertile land, ideal for farming productions, especially cereals, vegetables and sugar beets, the latter being processed in the Avezzano sugar mill.. And so it was that Fucine fishers became farmers. A second emissary was made built by the Torlonia in the first half of the 20th century, with the purpose of compensating for the functions of the main tunnels in case of extraordinary repairs. It starts from the intersection point of the Roman emissary with the outer drainage next to one of the water storage basins of the Incile del Fucino southwards, ending up in Canistro next to one of the hydroelectric power plants built by the Torlonia with the aim of generating power for the operation of the Avezzano paper and sugar mill. = Perspectives = In June 1977, with the aim of protecting and exploiting the work, the Archaeological Park of Claudius was established, comprised between the entrances to the tunnels and the Fucine Inlet. The work was inserted among the Luoghi del Cuore (\\"Places of the Heart\\") for the year 2016 by FAI. In 2017 funds were allocated for the park exploitation by the Chamber of Commerce of L'Aquila, the municipality of Avezzano and the GAL Terre Aquilane (\\"Aquilan Lands\\").  Architecture  Exit of the emissary in Capistrello The monumental Fucine Inlet = Emissary = The total length of the underground emissary is over . It features a variable section wide and an average flow rate of with a drop of and an average gradient of in the stretch comprised between the entrance to the Fucine Inlet and the exit of Capistrello.. The entrance lies near the \\"emissary head\\" of the inlet at Borgo Incile south of Avezzano, next to the intersection with the outer drainage canal crossing the plateau longitudinally as far as the Bacinetto (\\"Little Basin\\"), a reservoir made built by Alessandro Torlonia to be used in case of extraordinary repairs or water needs. It is a depressed area of the plain whose elevation stands lower; it is located between the central pumping station of Borgo Ottomila (Celano) and the territories of Ortucchio, San Benedetto dei Marsi and Venere dei Marsi.. The section of the Torlonia emissary allows in certain points to observe the original one from the Roman age in both the entrance area to the Inlet and the exit that is situated on the opposite side of the mountain, under the old town of Capistrello, at Pisciacotta. In fact, in some parts it preserves the Roman age walls built in opus reticulatum. In order to simplify the drilling and extraction work of the material, 32 vertical wells and 6 inclined tunnels were also dug, of which in particular the impressive rests located on the eastern side of Mount Salviano are visible. = Fucine Inlet = The emissary head of Borgo Incile is dominated by the large statue of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary rising above the three-arched bridge of the sluice gates. The work was constructed by architect Carlo Nicola Carnevali in 1876. The structure features two water storage basins, one with a trapezoidal shape and the other hexagonal, and three gates (or locks). The first one separates the major hexagonal basin from the forebasin through a gorge. = The tunnels = * Major Tunnel (), located on the eastern side of the mountain, features three large arches, that is the entrances which join after a short inner stretch. Deeper inside there is the oblique tunnel (the so-called bypass). * Blacksmith Tunnel (), on the eastern side of the mountain, allows to know the system of tunnels and numerous wells closely. A first stretch was paved and equipped with lighting. The bypass connects it with the major tunnel. * Imperial Tunnel (), located lower compared to the previous one, connected to it through the well no. 23. * Coppersmith, Machine and Oil-Lamp Tunnels (), on the western side of the mountain..

It was founded in July 2006 by American businessman Mark Cuban and business reporter Chris Carey, formerly of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  History  Sharesleuth founder Mark Cuban In early 2006, Carey approached Cuban with the idea of launching an investigative organization focusing on corporate fraud. Cuban was receptive to the idea, and offered to finance the venture. Within its first year, Sharesleuth articles on the publicly traded companies Xethanol and UTEK were followed by drops of over 35% in the stock price of each company. Sharesleuth has since reported on many other companies, including Kandi Technologies and Highland Mint, a firm that manufactured the coins used in the Super Bowl pre-game coin toss. As a means of funding the site, Cuban typically shorts the stocks of the article subjects prior to publication, a practice which has drawn controversy. He has stated that the site has published articles on \\"literally anything that I have shorted\\".  Related sites  In October 2008, Cuban and Carey started a companion website, BailoutSleuth, for the purpose of tracking Troubled Asset Relief Program funds and bank activity in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and resulting bank bailouts. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists Gary Cohn of The Baltimore Sun and Russell Carollo of the Dayton Daily News were hired in 2009‚Äì2010, the latter to handle Freedom of Information Act requests. Unlike the for-profit Sharesleuth, BailoutSleuth was conceived as a nonprofit service. The site is no longer online. In mid-2010 Cuban and Carey created another nonprofit website, JunketSleuth.com, to provide access to government travel spending records. As with Sharesleuth, Cuban provided the funding and Carey served as the investigative reporter. The site has since closed.

His research focuses on development cooperation, international solidarity, and theories and organizations of civil society.  Biography  Early years After studying Information and Communications (1991-1994), he studied sociology at the University of Li√®ge (1994-1996) and then completed his doctoral thesis on the emergence of civil societies in Eastern Europe and in Sub-Saharan Africa (2002). Later, during a postdoctoral stay at the University of Lille II, he addressed the notion of humanitarian aid by looking into the Romanian humanitarian period that followed the fall of Nicolae Ceaucescu's dictatorship. From his first works came various scientific works and articles on the NGO sectors of Benin, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Romania as well as the dynamics favoring the emergence of certain forms of civil society in these countries (Pirotte G., 2011, M. Poncelet et al., 2006, Pirotte G., 2006). University He joined the University of Li√®ge in September 2006 and became Chairman of SocioanthropologySocio-Anthropology of Development. In addition to his role as a professor, he holds various positions in the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Li√®ge (ULi√®ge), he has served as the President (2007-2014) and then Jury Secretary (since 2014) of studies of the Master in Population and Development Sciences, as well as the Head of the Working Group in charge of the valorization and communication of the university faculty or Academic Secretary. Research At the same time, his research work since 2006 has focused more on the organization of international aid (humanitarian and development aid) as well as on the commitment to international solidarity. Gautier Pirotte coined the acronym P.I.I.S., Popular Initiative of International Solidarity (P.I.I.S., I.P.S.I. in French), to characterize forms of engagement for another distant developed by ordinary citizens, engaged not professionally in development cooperation. Through his works on P.I.I.S., Gautier Pirotte shed light on the action of these ordinary citizens and also shows the existing tensions within the scope of the cooperation subjected to the constraints of the professionalization and the effectiveness regarding interventions for help (Pirotte G., 2013, G. Pirotte & Godin J., 2013). Leadership roles Since 2010, in addition to his classical academic teaching, he has broadened his pedagogical commitment through further education. He created and led the University's Certificate program in Development and International Cooperation (U.C.D.I.C., C.U.D.C.I. in French) a certificate that aims to strengthen the skills of international solidarity project holders for developing countries. In 2018, he proposed a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) entitled \\"The Factory of International Aid\\" which is based on an approach that is both original and engaging. The students enrolled in this MOOC assume the role of a member of the Parliament of an imaginary country (The Republic of Hopeland), a country that wishes to have a legal framework for its international cooperation policy. Students enrolled in the MOOC must write and vote on this law from the materials made available on the platform of this online course (video capsules, documents, games ...). Additionally, Gautier Pirotte often participates in numerous public debates regarding his fields of research. He has contributed frequently to the French media on matters related to the election of President Emmanuel Macron and the formation of the government of Edouard Philippe which, in the wake of the movement \\"En Marche\\", favored the access to the power of actors of French civil society. International cooperation As an observer and analyst of international cooperation for over twenty years, Gautier Pirotte is himself a committed player in this field. Since 2006, he has led numerous university cooperation missions to various African academic institutions, including the University of Lubumbashi, University of Abomey-Calavi, University of Bujumbura etc. From December 2014 since June 2018, he has chaired the NGO \\"UniverSud\\", an organization developing World Citizenship Education (ECM) activities on the University of Li√®ge campus. He has also contributed to the evolution of humanitarian aid thinking within the Red Cross movement by participating in the International Scientific Council of the Red CrossFrench Red Cross Foundation.

It depicts the rear view of a naked man climbing out of a swimming pool outside a contemporary house. It is held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Background Hockney moved from England to California in 1964, drawn by its sleek modernist aesthetic and warm Mediterranean climate. In 1966, while teaching at UCLA, Hockney met the American art student Peter Schlesinger. The two became lovers, and Hockney started painting a series of pool pictures, often featuring Schlesinger. A few of these, such as Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool (1966), A Bigger Splash (1967) and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) (1972), later achieved iconic status. On 15 November 2018, the latter set a world record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction by a living artist. Description The painting measures . It depicts the communal pool of the apartment block at 1145 Larrabee Street, Hollywood, north of Sunset Boulevard, which was then the home of art dealer Nicholas Wilder, and shows a naked Schlesinger, then 18 years old, climbing up and out of the pool. Hockney, in his characteristic style, simplifies and flattens the image, and the rippling surface of the water is abstracted into wavy white lines on blue, similar to a comic or an advertisement. The straight lines in the painting were created using masking tape. The work has a border of un-primed canvas, like a photograph, which Hockney says he left \\"to make the picture look more like a painting\\". The figure in the painting is based on a polaroid photograph Hockney took of Schlesinger standing up against the hood of his own MG car. Interviewed about the painting in 2012, Schlesinger laughed about it, saying \\"That‚Äôs why the part under the water isn't painted well‚Äîbecause it was just invented.\\" In 1967, Hockney's painting won the John Moores Painting Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. The painting was acquired as a bequest from Sir John Moores who in 1957, established the eponymous biannual award and subsequently often purchased the winning entry and then presented the work to the museum. Moores purchased this work in 1967, and presented it to the museum in 1968. The picture remains in the Walker's permanent collection.

Taxonomy Hypericum formosissimum was first described in Zametki Sist. Geogr. Rast. (Notes on Systematics and Geography of Plants) in 1940 by Armen Takhtajan. The species was actually omitted by error from Norman Robson's comprehensive monograph of the genus Hypericum in 1981 but was later accepted as a valid species of the genus. The species is an extreme development of Adenosepalum and is confined to limestone rocks, a behavior shared with the other members of the huber-morathii group. Description Hypericum formosissimum is a perennial herb that grows tall. It is glabrous (lacks hairs) and has numerous stems that are straggling and almost grow along the ground. The stems are slender, terete, brittle, and lack glands. The internodes are long, and most grow longer than the leaves. The leaves are and are petiolate (with stems).They have long lamina which are broadly ovate or almost circular and are a bluish-green color. The leaves have 2 lateral pairs of veins that ascend from the lower portion of the midrib and are difficult to see. The glands on the leaves are pale and dense and the intramarginal glands are black and spaced out. The species is 1-5 flowered from terminal nodes without any flowering branches below. The pedicels that hold the flowers are long. The bracts are small and are black and denticulate. The flowers are wide with rounded buds. The petals are a pale yellow and are 8 by 5 millimeters in size. The stamens number around 18-20, with the longest being around long. The seeds are brown and approximately long with linear-foveolate testa. The species flowers from June‚ÄìJuly and fruits from July‚ÄìAugust. Distribution and habitat The species is native to Turkey in central Anatolia as well as the Transcaucasus region, especially in Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is found in fissures of limestone rocks at elevations of above sea level. Ecology H. formosissimum is an endangered species that occupies an area of less than 500 square kilometers. It was included in the Red Data Book of Armenia as a Rare Species (Category 2). Chemistry Unlike other species in sect.

The World Bank has been able to claim Costa Rica as a developmental success. Although Costa Rica has been actively working on reform to better the country and has the lowest poverty rate in Central America, it still remains a third world country, due to a slowdown in economic expansion, lack of job opportunities and lack of resources, especially in rural areas. Despite these challenges Costa Rica has been working with the World Bank to further move Costa Rica up the global ranks.  Country overview  Costa Rica has become one of the more wealthy countries in the region overall, being an upper middle income country with GDP per capita being US$13,876. Costa Rica differentiates from its neighbors by being relatively stable politically, providing high standards of living and effective social benefit systems. The country's main income source besides exports is ecotourism, due to the biodiversity in the country. Although advanced economically and policy wise for the region, Costa Rica has struggled with the poverty rate, stagnant for the past twenty years. Costa Rica has made strides towards universal health care and education. With projects like Costa Rica Higher Education and Strengthening Universal Health Insurance in Costa Rica, done with The World Bank, Costa Rica has the opportunity to make desired changes with the funds it receives for these projects. Costa Rica began their relationship with the World Bank in September 1956 when they received US$3 million for the Capital Goods Importation Credit Project. Costa Rica currently has an LPI score of 2.79 and the LPI rank of 73 as of 2018. Since then, Costa Rica has seen stable economic growth for the past 25 years, growing GDP from 2010 to 2016 and being a leader in environmental policies. With growing inequality and rising fiscal debt, the government has struggled on how to address these issues with regards to the general public and transparent social programs.  Relationship with World Bank  The World Bank had a presence in Costa Rica for quite some time. With the first project being in 1956, the World Bank was able to maintain buildings within the country until 1990. The World Bank office in San Jose had closed in 1990 due to unwelcoming political climate at the time. Costa Rica shifted to ecomarket projects, since environmentally cautious policy was important within this country, but at the time the World Bank had no presence. These events all lead to the World Bank making another effort to support Costa Rica and try to reenter. The World Bank entering back into Costa Rica was an easy decision because there were high hopes for a return of investment. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2016‚Äì2020 is a document that the World Bank and the government of Costa Rica put together in order to improve relations. Costa Rica has had four CPF's prepared for them and have been able to maintain relatively positive throughout the years. Through natural learning and knowledge sharing Costa Rica and the World Bank have been able to takes steps to tackling some of the more ambitious policy changes Costa Rica wants to enact while also providing positive information for investments. The World Bank wants to provide further resources that are environmentally friendly and aiming for growth within rural territories of the country. These rural areas are not intended to change but to grow more productive so other industries can effectively develop and improve competitiveness.  Active projects  There are currently two active projects within Costa Rica with the World Bank that total US$620 million. Strengthening Universal Health Insurance in Costa Rica, is a project, approved on March 15, 2016, with the commitment amount of US$420 million. The Costa Rica Higher Education is the second project within Costa Rica and the World Bank, that was approved on September 27, 2012 with the commitment of 200 million US dollars. Strengthening Universal Health Insurance in Costa Rica, main goals are to provide timely and quality health services, and improving the Costa Rican social security administration (CCSS) to be more efficient. This project will replace severally damaged hospitals so that the CCSS can open up more resources for other investments, including hospitals, while also strengthening health care programs for the countries population. This project is set to close in April 2020. The Costa Rica Higher Education project main purpose is to strength the educational system within Costa Rica so that intern they will be more appealing to outside investments for scientific and technology development and innovation. Within this project there are two components one focusing on institutions and the second focusing on institutions capacity to for quality enhancement which includes, developing a market and supporting projects within high education institutions. This project is set to close in December 2019.

Conventionally it refers to the formation of mountains in mainly Southern California during the Pleistocene and lasting until the present day; originally it referred to the uplift of the San Gabriel Mountains. The Pasadena orogeny is a major Late Quaternary-modern event of mountain formation, which took place in the middle or perhaps late Pleistocene or to the present-day. It is also known as the \\"Coast Ranges orogeny\\" or considered to be part of the Cascadian orogeny or Alpide Orogeny. Finally, the term \\"Pasadena orogeny\\" is sometimes applied to all very recent orogenies around the Pacific Ocean. The type location is close to Pasadena, California in the Transverse Ranges, and originally referred to the fast rise of the San Gabriel Mountains recorded there. During this orogeny mountain ranges such as the San Bernardino Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, San Jacinto Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Ynez Mountains and the Transverse Ranges grew, as did the northern Channel Islands such as Catalina Island and San Clemente Island, the Kettleman Hills anticline in the San Joaquin Valley and the Palos Verdes Hills. Sometimes the concept is limited to the uplift of the Transverse Ranges. The general uplift of mountains over a length of over is caused by the collision of the North American Plate with other geologic structures that are attached to the Pacific Plate. This orogeny has resulted in the uplift of mostly north-south trending mountain chains, although some east-west trending uplifts are also found such as the Channel Islands and the Transverse Ranges; much of the uplift took place at the edge of basins. The Pasadena orogeny is accompanied by earthquake activity, which includes tsunami hazards. Folding accompanying the uplift of the Coast Ranges in Southern California, folding farther north at Morro Bay and the structure of the Santa Barbara Basin and Ventura Basin are consequences of the Pasadena orogeny. The city of Long Beach, California lies within the affected region.

An important figure in the religious life of Connecticut as an Episcopal Churchwarden and co-founder of Trinity Church on the Green in New Haven, Doolittle was also an active Patriot during the American Revolution. Perhaps his most notable contribution is his having designed and crafted in 1775 the moving and brass parts for David Bushnell's submersible vessel Turtle, the first submarine used in combat. In crafting the watch work triggering mechanism for Bushnell's explosive underwater magazine, Doolittle created the first mechanical time bomb, while his two-blade propeller was the first practical and applied use of a propeller in watercraft.Stein, Stephen K.

He opened a shop across from Yale College on Chapel Street,Hoopes, Penrose R., Connecticut Clockmakers of the Eighteenth Century, Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1986, p.9 where he repaired, made, and sold not only clocks and watches, but \\"compasses, sea and land surveyors scales and protractors, gauging rods, walking sticks, silver plated buttons turned upon a horn, and a variety of other work\\".Hoopes, p. 72 =First Warden of Trinity Church= After opening his clock, instrument, and silversmith shop in New Haven, Doolittle became quite wealthy. Around 1749, he was appointed along with Enos Alling by the Anglican missionary priest and educator the Reverend Samuel Johnson, D.D., as one of two church wardens of Trinity Church on the Green, the first Church of England parish in Puritan-dominated New Haven, where the Congregationalist Church was the established state religion of the colony and Yale College in the town was seen as \\"The School of the Prophets\\" and the bastion of Puritan orthodoxy. Against strong and determined Puritan opposition, in 1752, he and fellow warden Alling obtained a deed for a plot from innkeeper Samuel Mix, Jr., and oversaw the construction of the first Trinity Church in 1752‚Äì1753, with Doolittle contributing more money to its construction than any of its other founding members.Beardsley, Eben Edwards, The History of the Episcopal Church in Connecticut: From the settlement of the colony to the death of Bishop Seabury, Hurd and Houghton, 1874, p. 172 He continued on in the role of warden, guiding the parish for much of the next 35 years, from 1750 to 1765, from 1770 to 1777, and again from 1783 to 1785.Croswell, Frederick, ‚ÄúA History of Trinity Church, New Haven, by Frederick Croswell, esq., Read March 8, 1868‚Äù, Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, New Haven Colony Historical Society, 1865., Appendix A =French and Indian War= Isaac Doolittle brass hall clock face, c. 1770s At the height of the French and Indian War the General Court of Connecticut appointed Doolittle Armourer (or Armorer) of the Connecticut Militia: in 1755, he served on the General Staff under General William Johnson from June 9 to August 6 and from September 10 to December 6, supporting Connecticut's war effort.Bates, Albert, Rolls of Connecticut men in the French and Indian war, 1755-1762, Connecticut Historical Society, 1903, Volume 1, p.3 He was again appointed Armorer in 1758, this time for Connecticut's Fourth Regiment under Colonel David Wooster.Hoadly, Charles J, The Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut [1757-1762], Lockwood & Brainard Company, 1880, p. 125 As armorer \\"he gained some experience in gunpowder production\\", which would prove vitally important to the Patriot war effort during the American Revolutionary War twenty years later.Kuslan, Louis I., Connecticut Science, Technology, and Medicine in the Era of the American Revolution, American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut, 1978, p. 38 He also gained firsthand knowledge of British leadership incompetence in the disastrous expedition against Fort Carillon as well as their naval capabilities in the successful Siege of Louisbourg of 1758.Nester, William, The Epic Battles of the Ticonderoga, 1758.

As the British Parliament's Iron Act of 1750 prohibited iron and steel manufacturing, Doolittle was already exhibiting a resistance to the British he had so recently joined to fight the French. In 1764, he was appointed tax collector in New Haven for \\"Proprietors of the Township of Ludlow, in the Province of New Hampshire.Hoopes, p. 71 He was also a sealer of weights and measures for town of New Haven, and printed Connecticut currency in his shop as well as government forms. In 1769, after successfully duplicating the iron screw used in printing presses, he expanded his business to manufacture and sell the first printing press made in America, which he sold to William Goddard of Philadelphia. The Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News- Letter of September 7, 1768 described it as a \\"Mahogany Printing-Press on the most approved construction, which by some good judges in the Printing Way, is allowed to be the neatest ever made in America and equal, if not superior to any imported from Great-Britain\\".Massachusetts Gazette and Weekly New Letter, Boston [Mass.] : R.

Cameron, 1905, p. 80 There is a tradition that Doolittle, though \\"the most important man among its founders\\",Scientific American, p.387 was forced out of the position Warden at Trinity Church, then part of the Church of England, \\"because he had aided the king's enemies by making powder\\" and that it was not until \\"the conclusion of peace Mr. Doolittle was reinstated in the hearts of his countrymen and in the vestry he became one of the wardens\\".Jarvis, p. 118Scientific American, p. 387 As only two of the 100 heads of households of the church Doolittle helped found were Loyalists, a large number of its members were Patriot privateers or soldiers, and even the neutralists members of his church turned Patriot after the destructive British raid when its rector the Rev. Dr. Bela Hubbard substituted General George Washington's name for King George III in its prayer services,Olsen, Neil, Two Hundred Years on the Green: Celebrating the 1816 Consecration of Trinity Episcopal Church, New Haven, Connecticut, Trinity Church Publications, 2017, p. 61-76 it was more likely that his many war-time activities left him too busy to fulfill the warden's duties until after the war. =The Turtle= According to Benjamin Gale, a doctor who taught at Yale, the many brass and mechanical (moving) parts of the Turtle submarine, the first submarine to engage in warfare, were built by Doolittle.Diamant, Lincoln, Chaining the Hudson: The Fight for the River in the American Revolution, New York: Fordham University Press, 2004, p. 23 Though David Bushnell is frequently given the overall design credit for the idea of the Turtle by Gale and others, Doolittle is often credited if at all as only a hired \\"mechanic\\". However, the relationship was actually asymmetric in the other direction. In 1775, Bushnell was a poor 35 year old Yale bachelor student and a former farmer in rural Connecticut who had sold his half-share of his Westbrook, Connecticut farm to his brother to fund his education as a medical doctor. Doolittle was a very wealthy and highly respected 55 year old head of a family of seven, a successful shop owner with a thriving business, the long time Warden and founder of Trinity Church in New Haven, and a pillar of the city, where he was an armorer, tax collector, selectman, port inspector, lead prospector, and gunpowder miller; he was experienced in large metal design and manufacturing of screws and bells, as well as the more delicate design and construction of pumps, navigation instruments, and clockwork devices, with his own foundry and team of apprentices at hand, and with access to gunpowder and lead, the two most scarce materials needed for the submarine. In the context of the time, an \\"ingenious mechanic\\" in Gale's wordingMorgan, William James, and Clark, William Bell, and Crawford, Michael J., Naval documents of the American Revolution, Volume 1, Naval History Division, Dept. of the Navy, 1964, Letter from Benjamin Gale of Yale from Killingsworth to Benjamin Franklin, August 7, 1775, p. 1089 was what today would be called an engineer and inventor, a designer and not just a craftsman.The Turtle submarine \\"Much of the equipment Bushnell needed to produce for his submarine was beyond the skills of a blacksmith\\" and were \\"sophisticated designs requiring precision manufacturing\\"; they required artisans with years of skill as apprentices, and the ability \\"to visualize mechanical concepts and interactions between gears and levers\\" as well as the tools and machinery to make the parts.Manstan and Frese, p. 52 Given his mechanical engineering expertise and previous experience in design and manufacturing brass bells, clocks, screws, and marine instruments, it seems likely Doolittle designed the brass and the moving parts of the Turtle.Manstan and Frese, p. 52, 52-53, 57, 88, 105, 107, 109, 110, 112, 120-123, 131, 138, 150, 194-198 Given his wealth and public position, he also likely funded the Turtle's development, supplied the scarce commodities of gunpowder and lead, and obtained the colonial government's cooperation for the first tests. Of the four major innovations of the first submarine, Bushnell figured out how ignite gunpowder underwater while he was a student at Yale,Tucker, Spencer C. Editor,\\"Bushnell, David (1740-1824)\\",American Revolution: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection, ABC-CLIO, 2018, Volume 1, p. 200 while brass caster, watchmaker, and scientific instrument maker Doolittle designed the propeller and its drive systems, the first working underwater depth gauge,Marstan and Frese, pp. 120-124 and the mine attachment and clockwork timed detonator. Doolittle's propeller, described as a \\"a pair of oars fixed like the two opposite arms of a windmill\\",Abbot, Henry L., Beginning of Modern Submarine Warfare under Captain Lieutenant David Bushnell, Hamden, CT: Acrhon Books,1966, p. 177 had \\"no precedent\\" in design and was the first known use of a bladed propeller in a watercraft.Manstan and Frese, p. 150 His clockwork detonator attached to the underwater mine was the first known mechanically detonated time bomb. Other parts of the Turtle, its hand crank, the food- driven treadle, and the flywheel for propulsion,Manstan and Frese, p. 94, 95 brass and iron emergency ballast drop,Manstan and Frese, pp. 103-104 brass forcing or bilge pumps for water ballast,Manstan and Freese, pp. 105-108 brass circular hinged hatchManstan and Frese pp.109-114 with three round glass ventilation doors,Manstan and Frese, pp. 114-115 two brass snorkel pipes and ventilator bellows, Manstan and Frese, pp. 116-117 compass marked with bio- luminescent foxfire,nstan and Frese, p. 120a and the rudder along with its iron bar steering mechanisms were based on preexisting designs and were likely jointly designed by Bushnell, Doolittle and his team, then built by Doolittle in his shop and brass factory. Recently, Doolittle's involvement in the Turtle was part of an important ruling in the field of copyright law over the ownership rights of the \\"original analysis\\" identifying Doolittle as the engineer of the brass hatch for the Turtle submarine. On July 15, 2015, US District Judge Jeffrey Alker Meyer ruled in the lawsuit of Leary v. Manstan, in the District of Connecticut that copyright law for nonfiction works does not cover \\"original historical theories nor use of typical storytelling techniques so long as they do not appropriate the particular expression used by another author.\\"Leary v.

Death Doolittle's health failed in 1785 and he suspended business activity for several years, but in January 1788 he announced in a newspaper advertisement his return to health and business in his reopened shop.Hoopes, p. 72 There is a humorous anecdote by the well-known New Haven physician Eneas Munson, a man known not only as a scientific doctor but for his droll comments at the expense even of his intimate friends, that may illuminate something of Doolittle's irascible character in this period. According to the account of Henry Bronson: :He gave an emetic to a troublesome neighbor, Isaac Doolittle, who in a fit of intoxication had taken an ounce of laudanum. The next day, finding his patient sober, he admonished him in the most solemn manner of the error of his ways, saying he had rescued him from a horrible death. ‚ÄúI do not thank you for what you have done,‚Äù Doolittle replied. ‚ÄúWell, I am sure the neighbors won't,‚Äù responded the doctor.Bronson, Henry, M.D., \\"Medical History and Biography\\", Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, Volume 2, New Haven Colony Historical Society, 1877, p. 272 Doolittle continued to make clocks and cast bells until 1797, when his health failed again and he largely retired from business. He died on February 13, 1800 at age 78, according to his obituary, \\"after a long and distressing illness of several years\\", honored as \\"a very worthy and respectable character\\".Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800; Hoopes, p. 72 He was buried on the Green in New Haven near the State House;Jarvis, p. 118 there is an empty space apparently reserved for his stone at Grove Street Cemetery next to his co-warden Enos Alling, but his stone was either lost, broken, or not transferred when the other stones from people buried on the Green were moved to Grove Street Cemetery in 1821 ‚Äì though his daughter Mary's stone can be found along the west wall there. His wife Sarah, born on January 30, 1725, in New Haven, Connecticut, died on March 10, 1814 in New Haven and is buried in Center Street Cemetery, Wallingford, Connecticut. Legacy The brass works for a number of Doolittle's clocks survive in private hands, and a circa 1765 \\"tall clock\\" is part of the holding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.The Met Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, Bequest of Helena D. Swift, 1943, Accession Number:43.148 A number of Doolittle's many apprentices continued his work, including his son Isaac Doolittle Jr. (who took over his father's clockmaking shop following the elder Isaac's death), his nephew Enos Doolittle, Hezekiah Hotchkiss, Nathan Howell, Simon Jocelin, his younger cousin Amos Doolittle,Hoopes, p.9 and James Cochran, who took over Doolittle's bell-foundry. It has been noted that, \\"The talent of these local artisans and others ensured New Haven's reputation as a leading hardware and clock-manufacturing city by the middle of the nineteenth century\\".Sletcher, Michael, New Haven: From Puritanism to the Age of Terrorism, Arcadia Publishing, 2004, p.43 Doolittle's grandson, Isaac Doolittle III, was also a Patriot in the War of 1812, an inventor who patented devices for steam engines and furnaces, and, like his grandfather, a pioneering printer and artist who illustrated the poem \\"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\\" in an 1821 book that was the first publication to illustrate the modern American legend of Santa Claus. In this and in other illustrated books he is sometimes credited with introducing the United States to lithography. The Turtle was the first submersible vessel used for combat. Historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as \\"the greatest of the wartime inventions.\\"Alex Roland, \\"Bushnell's Submarine: American Original or European Import,\\" Technology and Culture 18 (April 1977), 158. Thus it has inspired a number of working and artistic replicas, some of which can be found on display at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, United Kingdom, the Connecticut River Museum in Essex, the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, and the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco. Rick Brown, a co-builder of a 2002 replica, called it \\"the greatest technological advancement of the American Revolutionary War,\\" and that with it, \\"Yankee ingenuity was born\\".Tom Gidwitz, \\"The Turtle Dives Again: Two artists recreate George Washington's wooden sub.\\" Archaeology, 58 (May/June 2005): 36‚Äì41 For over half a century, from 1743 until his retirement in 1797, Doolittle was \\"one of the leading manufacturers and most versatile mechanics\\"Hoopes, p. 70 in the American colonies and \\"a citizen of character and enterprise, whose mark in his generation was that of striking originality\\",Scientific America, p. 387 as well as a key historical transition figure in the shift from Puritan to Yankee in New England. Doolittle is often cited as an early example of the famous Yankee ingenuity stereotype of inventiveness, discovering technical solutions to practical problems, self-reliance, and individual enterprise.

The group of students and disgruntled workers sought to legally form a labour union. Their efforts were, despite initial signs of support, opposed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which rarely engages in collective bargaining and has been described as 'ineffective at representing workers'. Unions in China are legal only if they are under the ACFTU. Hence, the Federation's opposition constituted a legal excuse for suppression of the JASIC unionists and their student allies. The movement consisted mostly of left wing students of Peking University and has been characterized as Maoist, Feminist, and Socialist. History In January 2018, the initially American-based Me Too movement began to gain popularity within Chinese academic circles. Yue Xin, a student at Peking University, began a campaign against Professor Shen Yang over allegations of rape and sexual misconduct in 1998, that led to the suicide of a female student. In September 2018, workers at the JASIC factory in Huizhou, Guangdong attempted to form a union in protest to poor labor conditions and inadequate pay. The news of workers' protests spread through Chinese social media, leading to a group of forty students to travel to Huizhou to protest in solidarity with the workers. Members of the group have characterized themselves as Marxists and Maoists.

A native of Pozna≈Ñ, Nawrot joined the Divine Word Missionaries in 1974, achieving ordination in 1981, in the same year earning his degree from the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin. He initially expressed an interest in traveling to Japan and China; instead, his first missionary assignment was to Paraguay, where he developed an interest in the reductions established by Jesuit priests in the 17th and 18th centuries. He enrolled in the Catholic University of America in 1986, taking a master's degree in music and a doctorate in musicology. Research undertaken as part of his studies led him to investigate the music left behind by the Jesuits in Bolivia; ultimately he discovered 13,000 pages of music held by members of the Moxo, Chiquito, and other tribes, many in the Santa Cruz Department. He also discovered music in the Convent of Santa Clara in Cochabamba. He has since reconstructed, edited, and published more than thirty volumes of music from the reductions, and continues to preserve and perform it with the assistance of local organizations and the Catholic Church. Nawrot was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1998 for his musicological work.

Its maximum apparent visual magnitude is 12.16, but its light curve shows clearly eclipsing events where its brightness can drop to a magnitude of 13.07. This leads to its classification as an Algol variable star. Spectrum The optical spectrum of QR Andromedae is not of a typical stellar blackbody, but is peculiar with many emission lines, the strongest being the HeII line. Balmer series and OVI lines are also present. It was also one of the super soft X-ray sources discovered by ROSAT satellite, one of the few source of this kind observed so far in the Milky Way. System It is now commonly accepted that super soft X-ray sources are white dwarfs that are burning matter with nuclear fusion on their surfaces, sustained by a high accretion rate of matter coming from a companion star. QR Andromedae is the nearest and brightest of those sources, and it has an orbital period of 15.85 hours. The companion star has a mass between 0.3 - 0.5 and should be a remnant of a more massive evolved star that is filling its Roche lobe. Variability Eclipses in the light curve of QR Andromedae are not symmetrical: the ingress is more gradual than the egress. The secondary minimum is variable in occurring phase and depth, meaning that the occultation of the secondary star happens behind a variable part of the disk. Out of the eclipses, light flickering can be clearly seen, and in some observations a periodicity arise.

In 2018, Yue participated in #MeToo inspired protest against Peking University on sexual assault allegations and participated in the Jasic incident as a member of Jasic Workers Solidarity Group. The BBC: China described Yue Xin as one of the country's most influential left-wing activists. China Digital Times listed her as their person of the week. South China Morning Post listed Yue as one of the \\"disappeared\\" in China, along with Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, activist photographer Lu Guang, and former vice-minister of State Security Meng Hongwei.  Biography  Yue Xin was raised in the city of Beijing and graduated from High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China in 2014. She then entered Peking University and graduated in 2018. In an interview with Yazhou Zhoukan, Yue discussed much of her personal life, noting that she began to become interested in politics in middle school after reading Liu Yu's Details of Democracy. During this period in life, she described herself as a liberal, upon reaching high school she began to become more interested in the standards of living for workers and peasants. Yue also sets the definitive moment that she decided to become an activist was after witnessing The 2013 Southern Weekly incident . Yue listed among her primary influences were Chinese feminist activists Liu Yu and Xiao Mei.  Activism  Yue Xin was a student at Peking University in Beijing, School of Foreign Languages class of 2014. During her senior year she participated in a series of protests against the university's handling of sexual assault allegations and perpetuating predatory behavior in the faculty and staff. The controversy centered around the university's culpability in the death of Gao Yan, a Peking University Chinese literature student who committed suicide in 1998, who was allegedly raped by Professor Shen, a former professor of Peking University. On 9 April 2018, Yue issued a formal freedom of information request to the university requesting information pertaining to Gao Yan's death and the allegations against Shen Yang. According to Yue, in an open letter to all students and staff of Peking University, the campus staff took immediate actions to attempt to coerce Yue to retract her freedom of information request. She alleges on 20 April 2018 a school advisor came unannounced to her dorm room with Yue's mother, who had been presented a distorted form of the events in order to persuade her daughter to rescind her request. According to Yue, the university failed to provide any relevant materials regarding the allegations against Shen Yang, Peking University citing that the materials were either missing or out of their domain.  Jasic incident  On 8 August 2018 Yue joined the student labor activist organization Jasic Workers Solidarity Group in the protests in Huizhou, Guangdong at the Shenzhen Jasic Technology plant labor dispute between the management of Jasic welder factory and the workers; the workers citing poor labor conditions and low pay attempted to form a labor union in violation of Chinese prohibition of non-state unions. The province of Guangdong is noteworthy for being the principal example of the Guangdong model, the economic policy initiated by Chinese politician Wang Yang. This policy focused on a policy of economic liberalization, while ignoring issues with industry practices and social welfare. The dispute led to numerous student activists, Yue among them, traveling to Huizhou to participate in protests against company and the Chinese government's policies towards labor rights.  Disappearance  Yue was among fifty members or supporters of the Jasic Workers Solidarity group to be arrested by Chinese police on 23 August 2018. As of 11 October, Yue has not been seen in public since her arrest by Chinese authorities. On 21 January 2019, a media report quoted the official website of the Jiashi Workers Support Group as saying that the Guangdong police forced Yue and four other members of the Christie Relief Group to record the confession of the film and admitted that \\"making illegal acts\\" was \\"radical.\\" In addition, the National Security Department of the People's Republic of China interviewed some members of the Solidarity Regiment and asked them to watch this ‚Äúguilty video‚Äù.  Reactions to detainment  Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek discussed the disappearance of Yue in an article published by The Independent. Zizek points out the inherent contradiction within Chinese society, wherein the official state ideology of Marxism is considered a dangerous form of political subversion. At least thirty academics, including linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky and Yale University Political Philosophy professor John Roemer are boycotting Chinese Marxist academic conferences, in reaction to the suppression of university activists who participated in the Jasic incident. Chomsky wrote in a message to the Financial Times: \\"To continue to participate in [...] officially sponsored Marxism-related events means we would stay complicit in the Chinese government's game. Leftist scholars around the world should join the boycott of such conferences and events.\\" On 26 December 2018, the birthday of PRC founder Mao Zedong, Peking University student and head of the Peking University Marxist Society, Qiu Zhanxuan, was arrested by Chinese authorities.

The low slung car featured height adjustable suspension, front wheel drive, and a powerful engine, and appeared in episodes of three TV series: \\"Bewitched\\" (which had an episode written around it), \\"Star Trek\\", and \\"Batman\\". The Reactor  Origin  After completing construction of his Strip Star car, Winfield's next project was even more ambitious. Joe Kizis, an East Coast show promoter, held an annual Autorama, an indoor rod and custom car show in Hartford, Connecticut. Kizis gave Winfield a $20,000 commission to build an aluminum-bodied show car named the Autorama Special. Designed by Ben Delphia of The Art Center College of Design, this vehicle later became known as The Reactor.

Reactor was finished in a trademark Winfield fadeaway paint job, changing from metalflake gold on top to green below. The car's low hoodline was made possible by its use of a version of the Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine. A similar engine was used in the The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Piranha. Winfield took the air-cooled turbocharged flat-six engine from a Corvair Corsa and mated it to the drive-train of a 1962 Citro√´n ID, Winfield kept the wide front and narrow rear track of the donor Citro√´n , as well as its height adjustable Hydropneumatic suspension, which enables the car's ground clearance to be varied from .

Biography  Marsicano received his Bachelor of Science, Masters of Education and Doctor of Philosophy from Duke University. He served as Executive Director of the Durham Arts Council in Durham, North Carolina, from 1982-1989. In 1989, he left to oversee the Arts & Science Council in Charlotte. While at its head, the united arts fund became the nation‚Äôs highest in per capita annual giving, and the Arts & Science Council became one of the largest endowed arts councils in the United States. In 1996, with Marsicano at head of ASC, controversy erupted around a Charlotte Repertory Theatre production of the Pulitzer Prize- winning play Angels in America. Local evangelical leaders protested the themes of the play and the onstage nudity, citing public funding via the Arts & Science Council as the core of its argument. Marsicano stood by ASC‚Äôs decision to fund, and the Mecklenburg County Commission responded by removing $2.5 million in funding to ASC. After four of the five commissioners who voted to strip the Arts and Science Council of its resources lost their seats in the next election, funds were restored and increased. In 1999, Marsicano was tapped to lead Foundation For The Carolinas, only the third head of the organization in its 60 years. During his tenure, FFTC has grown from assets of $240 million to more than $2.5 billion, and from the 35th largest community foundation in America to sixth largest.

Yet in October 2017, Occhi was cited in the plea of the financial operator L√∫cio Funaro to the Prosecutor-General of the Republic (PGR). In his testimony, Funaro defended that Gilberto Occhi had, at the time he was Vice-President of Government of the financial institution, a \\"monthly goal\\" of bribes to \\"produce\\" and distribute to politicians of the Progressive Party. By his press advisor, Occhi informed that \\"[he] strongly deny\\" what was said by L√∫cio Funaro about his person.

The theatre is owned by the nonprofit Foundation For The Carolinas.  History  The Carolina Theatre opened in 1927, as part of Paramount Picture's Publix Theatre chain. The opening feature was the silent movie, A Kiss in a Taxi. Originally, movies ran for three days, and vaudeville performers were on stage Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. In 1938, the theatre was renovated to accommodate sound films, with the original murals replaced with acoustic tiles. On Feb. 10, 1956, the theatre played host to a performance by Elvis Presley. The Sound of Music would premiere at the Carolina Theatre on March 31, 1965, and run a record 79 weeks. The 398,201 people who saw the movie were more than the population of Charlotte, at the time. With rising competition from suburban multiplexes, the theatre closed on Nov. 27, 1978, with a showing of Bruce Lee‚Äôs Fists of Fury. Arson furthered damaged the theatre in the 1980s. =Renovation= After many unsuccessful attempts to renovate and revive the theatre, the City of Charlotte acquired the building in 1986 and sold it to Foundation For The Carolinas in April 2013. The renovation will restore historical touches, such as the murals and original marquee, to replicate the original 1927 atmosphere as much as possible. Most of the $51.5 million of the budget was raised from private sources. Construction on the restoration began in 2017. The theatre will be part of a larger Civic Campus called Belk Place. When completed, programming will focus on civic discussions, speakers, community gatherings, films, concerts and more.  Intercontinental Hotel  In March 2017, it was announced that as part of the theatre's restoration, a 274-room InterContinental Hotel would be built atop the structure. SB&G; Hotel Group is partnering with Valor Hospitality Partners on the project. The 25-story hotel will bring the project's total height to 32 stories.

The sole species is Cecarria obtusifolia, a hemiparasitic aerial shrub. Description Cecarria obtusifolia is an aerial, stem-parasitic shrub, and like species in the genus Muellerina, it has epicortical runners. It is glabrous throughout. The obovate or broadly obovate leaves are opposite, curvinerved, and rounded at the apex. The leaf blades are 30‚Äì55 mm long and 20‚Äì45 mm wide, and attenuate into an obscure petiole 2‚Äì6 mm long. The inflorescence is axillary, with and a two- flowered umbel or a four-flowered raceme or spike; there are nearly orbicular bracts beneath each flower. The flower has six free petals. The stamens are nearly equal, and the anthers are dorsifixed and versatile, having a short sterile tip with the free part of the filament about 2 mm long. The peduncle is 6‚Äì9 mm long and up to 20 mm when the inflorescence is a raceme. The flowers are sessile or on pedicels up to 3 mm long. The calyx is entire and 0.5‚Äì1 mm long. The ivory-white corolla in mature bud is 10‚Äì14 mm long and slightly club-shaped. The fruit is almost spherical and about 8 mm long. Distribution and habitat Cecarria obtusifolia occurs in the Philippines, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia, and also in the Lesser Sunda Islands and Bougainville (New Guinea). The genus is thought to be a relictual Gondwanan entity. In Australia it occurs in the McIlwraith Range area in Queensland, growing in rainforest. Recorded hosts include plants in the genera: Calophyllum, Casuarina, and Syzygium, and Xanthostemon.Nickrent, D. The Parasitic Plant Connection: Cecarria obtusifolia. Department of Plant Biology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. Retrieved 21 November 2018. Taxonomy The species was first described by Elmer Drew Merrill as Phrygilanthus obtusifolius in 1906. In 1973, Bryan Barlow redescribed it, assigning it to the new genus, Cecarria, and the name thus became C. obtusifolia. The current accepted description is that of Barlow in 1984. The genus Cecarria is named for Cedric Errol Carr (1892‚Äì1936). The leaves, which are blunt and rounded at the apex (tip), gave rise to the latin-derived name, obtusifolia, meaning \\"obtuse-leaved\\".

She died on February 9, 2014 at the age of twenty-six by diabetes complications. She was born at the Language Research Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia. She lived the rest of her life at the Great Ape Trust in Iowa. Her half-brother is Kanzi, a famous bonobo. Kanzi learned 348 lexigram symbols and over 3,000 words from the English language over her lifespan.  Background  Kanzi and Panbanisha, two bonobos that Panpanzee grew up with at the Great Ape Trust The influence of humans started for Panpanzee at a very young age of eight days old. She grew up with a bonobo named Panbanisha. They were both in the same study, for five years, where the researchers thought them lexigram symbols and words from the English language. Kanzi was also getting research done to her at the Language Research Center during this time. He had already known 256 lexigram symbols by the time Panpanzee and Panbanisha had started their research. This research was conducted by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her research team. Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh is a primatologist and an experimental psychologist, where she studies the upbringings of non-human primates and their capability to learn, understand, and speak a language. Most of her work today is on bonobos. This research on bonobos has made her known for ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs leading ape language researchers.‚Äù  History of Bonobos and Chimpanzees  A part of this study was to see if there was a difference between bonobos and chimpanzees since they are very similar species. Both species shared a common ancestor after humans split from the chimpanzees and bonobos between four and seven million years ago in Africa. The split between the common ancestors of the chimpanzee and bonobos then took place about 1.5 to 2 million years ago with the two lineages giving rise to the two current extant species. In the past, bonobos were incorrectly relegated to subspecies status within the species chimpanzee. It is now understood that bonobos are an entirely different species. After Pan paniscus was differentiated and named as a new species to science, \\"bonobo\\" developed into its accepted common name. As bonobos aren't chimpanzees, old common names containing that word like \\"bonobo chimpanzee\\" or \\"pygmy chimpanzee\\" are generally considered outdated misnomers. Bonobos are more sociable, more sexual, and not as aggressive as chimpanzees. The Bonobos are the only members of the great ape family (which includes humans) that do not kill their own kind.  Research  One goal of Panpanzees and Panbanishas research was to see the effects of human enculturation on the chimps. Another goal was for the chimpanzee and bonobo to be able to comprehend spoken and symbolic language. To reach this goal the teachers had keyboards with lexigram on them. They had spoken communication to go with the lexigram in order for Panpanzee and Panbanisha to learn both. During the study, Panpanzee hardly utilized any of the symbol communication. She relied on gesturing at a young age. Her gestural communication was her main source of communication. For Panpanzee to show the researchers what she understood she would lead someone by a hand or guide them until they understood what she was saying. While Panpanzee was still using gestural communications, Panbanisha had moved on to symbolic communications. Panbanisha also could fully comprehend speech by the time she was around two to two and a half years old. When Panpanzee was around two years old her vocabulary started to increase and her use of lexigrams went up. Panpanzee took longer to pick up vocabulary words than bonobos did. She did not learn fifty vocabulary words until she was thirty-four months old. By this time, a typical child has already learned up to several hundred vocabulary words. Before Panpanzee began to progress, the researchers almost removed her from the study because of the lack of improvement. She was not picking up words fast enough and not learning enough symbols. The researchers assumed this was because chimpanzees did not have the capacity to be able to learn a language. They also assumed it was bonobos genetic superiority that led to Kanzi to have the success that she did. However, they stuck with her and a few months later Panpanzee began to show some understanding of a few words in the English language. Even though Panpanzee started to show a lot of progress the researchers still removed her from the study when she was five years old. By the time she became a grown chimpanzee, Panpanzee had learned one hundred and twenty-eight different lexigrams while being able to comprehend one hundred and fifty English words. This made Panpanzees understanding of English more precise than her understanding of lexigrams, which is also the same for Kanzi. She could now point out lexigrams when someone states a word that it corresponds with that particular lexigram symbol.

He works at the Programme National de Lutte contre la Trypanosomiase Humaine Africaine at the University of Kinshasa.  Early life and education  Kande studied medicine. At the age of 27, he was the only medical doctor for 11,000 people in Bandundu Province.  Research  Kande is known as the father of sleeping sickness. He was made the Director of the Democratic Republic of the Congo sleeping sickness programme and works with the Ministry of Public Health. African trypanosomiasis disproportionately impacts people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei and usually presents in the chronic form. He investigates the epidemiology of sleeping sickness. He was one of the first to report of the resurgence of sleeping sickness, calling for more aid, inter- country collaboration and improved healthcare facilities and treatment options. Kande has been the principal investigator for several studies of new treatments for African trypanosomiasis. He investigated the efficacy and safety of DB289, which is administered as a dication prodrug to Pentamidine. He also demonstrated a high failure rate with Melarsoprol and investigated the use of Pafuramidine. In a country with few passable roads or hospitals, Kande and his colleagues recruited 400 people with late stage Trypanosoma brucei for a trial of Fexinidazole sponsored by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. The study demonstrated that fexinidazole is an effective treatment for sleeping sickness. The work was published in The Lancet and led to Kande being described by Richard Lehman (primary care physician) the 'true hero of medicine'. Fexinidazole received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency under Article 58 in November 2018 and was registered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in December 2018. Kande is currently investigating SCYX-7158 (acoziborole) as a single-dose treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in a clinical trial sponsored by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. He looks for innovative partnerships between the private and public sector, such as the partnership that led to the delivery of fexinidzaole by DNDi.

Early career After studying social sciences and communications, he worked as a creative in an advertisement agency. He became a photographic reporter in 1992, doing missions for the UNESCO and travelling the world for the Gamma agency. In five years, he did thirty pieces in fifteen countries. His career in journalism shaped a working method that he would later apply in his fictional works. His stories are preceded by extensive research, which allows him to write stories that are as close to reality as possible. This vision of cinema, a \\"lived-in filmmaking\\" of sorts, aims to create fictional stories that are as documented as possible. Often tragicomical, his films present stories that are inspired by reality, with often non-professional actors. The objective is to blur the frontier between our world and the fictional realm. He applied this method for the first time in 1997, with his first comic script: Fox One ‚Äì Armageddon. To create this comic series, he attended the Red Flag Air Force Exercise at the Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada, visited the Charles de Gaulle, Foch and Clemenceau aircraft carriers during high seas exercises, and visited French Air Force Bases. The Fox One series was translated in five languages and sold over 90 000 copies. Film career In 2002, he directed his first short film, Undercover, a seven-minute presentation which mixed cinema and a live show; it won multiple international awards. In it one can find one of his central themes: the blurred distinction between fiction and reality. Later on, he filmed Coming-out (2004), a comedy starring Omar Sy, whose script was late adapted to a live show by comedians Omar et Fred. In 2006, he directed Mon dernier r√¥le, starring Patrick Chesnais and guest starring Patrick Poivre d‚ÄôArvor during a fake news broadcast. This black comedy was selected in fifty festivals, winning several awards, including the grand prize of the Meudon short film festival and the grand prize of the Comedia Festival, in Montreal. In 2007, he returned to his journalistic roots, shooting the documentary H√¥tel du Cheval Blanc, for six months. This film presented the terrible living conditions of the thousands of families who are hosted in insanitary hotels every year. In 2008, he went to China to adapt and stage his first theatre performance, The Nutcracker ballet. This version, produced by the Gruber Ballet Op√©ra, which presents 39 artists from Chinese State Circus, has made a world tour, starting in France in 2009. In 2012, he returns to cinema, writing and directing Welcome to China with Gad Elmaleh and Ari√© Elmaleh. Shot in Shanghai, the short film presents the two brothers playing their own roles. In 2013, he started research for his first feature film, which tells the story of a posh high school teacher in Paris that is transferred to the city's poorer suburbs. True to his method, he started researching France's educational institutions. For three years, Olivier immersed himself in the daily lives of high schools of the Seine-Saint-Denis region, on the outskirts of the french capital. Among them, he resided in the Barbara High School of Stains, which became the main setting of the film. Furthermore, the students of the High School participated in the project, becoming characters of the feature film. Shooting started in 2016. The film bore its final title, Les Grands Esprits (The Teacher in English), with Denis Podalyd√®s in the main role. The Teacher was released in theaters in France in 2017. It was shown in cinemas all around the world, in countries including the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Italy, Spain, Japan, Taiwan, Nigeria, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. The film was used as an educational tool by teachers in France and several other countries. Olivier Ayache-Vidal is currently researching the gastronomical world, in order to prepare his future film projects. Photographic journalism career Between 1992 and 1997, he worked as a photographic journalist for a number of publications and journalistic agencies (Gamma Agency, Agence Vu, Science & Vie Junior), covering scientific, cultural and social subjects. He also went on a mission to Southeast Asia, covering the UNESCO‚Äôs Education For All Programme. There, he photographed vulnerable populations helped by the programme, such as the Akha, Hmong, Lisu and Karen peoples of Thailand, the women of Bangladesh and the children of the streets of Saigon. In total, he made thirty pieces in close to fifteen countries: Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, China, the United States, Jamaica, Guyana, Nepal, Brazil. Comic book writing career In late 1997, the first tome of \\"Fox One\\", Armageddon, was published, with a script by Olivier Ayache-Vidal. In 1999, the second tome was released: T.L.D and in 2001, NDE (‚ÄúNear Death Experience\\"). = Comic book scripts = * Fox One, drawings by Renaud Garreta, Philippe Arnaud SA * Armageddon (1997) * T.L.D.

Mandetta has received widespread notoriety in 2020 for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The Health Minister has contradicted President Bolsonaro on numerous occasions; while Mandetta has defended social distancing measures in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Bolsonaro is an opponent of such measures and has criticized state governors who implemented lockdowns in their states.

Decades later, Toelken destroyed most of the physical records originating from his work with the Yellowman family, choosing to leave a set of cassette tapes with members of the family, not within an archive. Over the course of his career, Toelken was president of the American Folklore Society from 1977 to 1978, and edited the Journal of American Folklore and Western Folklore. The American Folklore Society granted Toelken fellowship in 1981. He received four of the association's major awards: the Am√©rico Paredes Prize and the Chicago Folklore Prize, both in 2007, followed by the Kenneth Goldstein Award for Lifetime Academic Leadership and the Lifetime Scholarly Achievement Award, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

The Sarcophagus was originally discovered in the Ostrianum and Vatican Cemetery. The good shepherd is seen with one sheep on each of his sides. There has been speculation on the religious origins of the Sarcophagus of Livia Primitiva. It was thought to be Christian because the inscriptions that are seen on the Sarcophagus was tied to Christianity, but later evidence has proven that the Sarcophagus of Livia Primitiva is actually Pagan. Livia Primitiva was 24 years and 9 months of age at the time of her death. Raoul Rochette suggest that Livia Primitiva‚Äôs monument was actually Pagan and had Christian elements added later. Victor Schultze agreed with Raoul-Rochette‚Äôs theory. Schultze argues that in Christian monuments, the shepherd either carries the sheep with both hands, or he carries the sheep by the legs with one hand, or the sheep lies on the shepherds shoulder without being held for any support. The shepherd on the sarcophagus of Livia Primitiva the sheep is seen on the shepherds shoulder while the shepherd is holding the sheep providing it support and therefor the inscription on the monument proves to not be Christian. The style in which the shepherd is carrying the sheep indicates that Livia Primitiva‚Äôs sarcophagus was suspected to be that of a Pagan faith.

Education and early career  Chowdhury was born in Rockland County, New York. Her parents are Bangladeshi immigrants. She enjoyed watching science fiction and attributes her curiosity about science to the Dana Scully effect. She completed her undergraduate study in management science and political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She joined Columbia University for her postgraduate study in statistics and quantitative methods. She holds a doctorate in political science from University of California, San Diego. She is interested in how data can be used to understand people's bias and ways to evaluate the impact of technology on humanity. She finished her PhD whilst working in Silicon Valley.  Career  Chowdhury taught data science at the boot camp Metis and worked at Quotient before joining Accenture in 2017. She leads their work on responsible artificial intelligence. She is concerned about the AI workforce; particularly on retaining researchers. She is also concerned about algorithmic bias. She has spoken openly about the need to define what ethical AI actually means. She works with companies on developing ethical governance and algorithms that explain their decisions transparently. She is determined to use AI to improve diversity in recruitment. Chowdhury, alongside a team of early career researchers at the Alan Turing Institute, developed a Fairness Tool which scrutinises the data that is input to an algorithm and identifies whether certain genders (such as race or gender) may influence the outcome. The tool both identifies and tries to fix bias, enabling organisations to make more fair decisions. She designed All.ai, a language analysis tool that can monitor and improve the gender balance of speakers in meetings. She launched X Institute, a program which teaches refugees about data science and marketing. She has given a keynote at Slush, talking about augmenting human capabilities. She delivered a TED talk about humanity in the age of artificial intelligence. In 2017 she was included in the 100 Women (BBC).

Sarna Burhi is depicted as the goddess of Sal tree groves and she is strongly associated with water and plant life. The deity is traditionally worshiped by the Munda, Kurukh, and Oraon peoples of Bengal.  Description  Sarna Burhi is described as being a goddess associated with spirits, rain, and plants. In the culture of the Munda and Kurukh peoples (both of which constitute part of the Adivasi peoples), Sarna Burhi is depicted as the guardian of Sarna, sacred groves of trees that serve as refuges for spirits displaced by human activity. These sites are described by some sources as remnant of old Sal forests which used to cover parts of Bengal's landscape. In the tradition of the peoples who worship at the groves, the Sal trees cause misfortune to fall on any who harm or cut down the trees that make up a Sarna.http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/biodiversity/sahyadri_enews/newsletter/issue4/Yogesh_Anno_bib.pdf Rather, the groves are treated as sacred places. Sarna play a significant role in the religious activities of several cultures originating in Bengal, where individual villages often worship their own pantheon of deities. The goddess Sarna Burhi resides in and protects these sacred spaces and as such worshipers of the faith pay homage to her during religious festivals that involve the Sarna. In the culture of the Munda peoples, some villages participate in a religious ceremony held in honor of Sarna Burhi. During the ceremony, several fowl are ritually slaughtered in front of an idol or symbol of the goddess near the Sarna. The worshipers then hold a feast during which the fowl are consumed. A procession, accompanied by music (produced by drums and horns), is then started leading back to the village; the worshipers also spread sal blossoms in their wake, which are later used to decorate the doors of the village's houses.

The movement was founded as the youth wing of Canadian Hadassah-WIZO and the Zionist Organization of Canada in 1917, and is affiliated with HaNoar HaTzioni. Young Judaea operates five Jewish summer camps across Canada. History Canadian Young Judaea was established by Bernard Joseph at the 15th Zionist Convention in Winnipeg in 1917. Acting as the youth wing of Canadian Hadassah-WIZO and the Zionist Organization of Canada, Young Judaea held biennial and regional conferences and facilitated transnational social contact between members with its Correspondence Club. At weekly meetings, activities included lectures and discussions on Jewish history, current affairs and topics related to Zionism. By 1925, there were 75 clubs across Canada and by 1935 national membership reached 5,000. Louis Rasminsky served as national vice-president in 1926. A. M. Klein served as editor of The Judaean, the movement's magazine, from 1928 to 1932 and as national president in 1934. Young Judaea became officially affiliated with HaNoar HaTzioni in 1950. Young Judaea soon grew from a city-based organization to one based around summer camps and Israel programs. The movement's summer camps were modelled after the pioneering kibbutzim in Israel. Young Judaea opened Camp Hagshama (later renamed Camp Kinneret) in 1942 in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, followed by Camp Kadima in Nova Scotia in 1943. Camp Biluim was founded in 1951 in Perth, Ontario, which offered an intensive leadership development program for older teenagers. Camp Biluim moved to the site of Camp Hagshama in 1972. Summer camps Canadian Young Judaea is the umbrella organization for a number of Canadian Jewish summer camps, including Camp Shalom in Muskoka, Camp Kadimah in Lunenburg County, Camp Solelim in Sudbury, Camp Hatikvah in Kelowna, and Camp Kinneret‚ÄìBiluim in Mont-Tremblant. Young Judaea also runs a four-week summer tour of Israel and a post-secondary educational gap year program. In 2018, Canadian Young Judaea announced it would be launching a week-long overnight summer camp for LGBTQ Jewish campers called Machane Lev.

Published since 1915, the journal is edited by Laura Weber and written for a non-specialist audience, with free distribution to all members of the state historical society. Among US state historical journals, Minnesota History has been regarded throughout its run for the quality of its scholarship and the caliber of the authors publishing in it. Overview and history The journal is published quarterly by the Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS). The journal covers topics related to various facets of Minnesota history, as well as the history of adjoining areas. Articles in the journal are intended to be understandable by lay audiences, may vary between 1,500 and 5,000 words, and undergo a double-blind peer-review process before publication. In addition to articles, the journal features book reviews, biographies, and information on the MNHS's collections. The journal's editor-in-chief is Laura Weber, who took over from Anne R. Kaplan in 2016. The MNHS occasionally refers to the journal as the Minnesota History Magazine. The first issue of the journal was published in February 1915 under the title Minnesota History Bulletin, authorized by MNHS superintendent Solon J. Buck. The Bulletin was intended to disseminate information presented at MNHS meetings or submitted to the society in a more timely manner than the previous method of collecting papers and notes for several years at a time, then publishing them in a larger single volume. Beginning with its March 1925 issue, the journal changed its name to Minnesota History, which the MNHS felt reflected the journal's shifting aims: to include more popularly accessible content and to provide materials for teachers of Minnesota history. The journal is also illustrated. Among state historical journals, Minnesota History has been well-regarded throughout its print run. The Bulletin was noted in The Mississippi Valley Historical Review shortly after its founding for being among the best local and state historical journals in terms of the quality of its news and notes. In 1932, the publication was described by the Review of Reviews and World's Work as being an \\"able and important\\" US state historical periodical. Upon its fiftieth anniversary, a review in the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society described the \\"high level of historical quality\\" within Minnesota History. Another in the Wisconsin Magazine of History described the journal as an exemplar to other state historical societies, for the caliber of its scholarship and of the scholars who contributed to the journal, suggesting that a similar journal should have been established in neighboring Wisconsin much sooner. alt=A black-and-white photo, tinted copper green, of a balding man in a tie, suit, and spectacles sitting head turned towards the camera and holding a sheet of paper Each year, Minnesota History presents the Solon J. Buck Award for the best article published in the journal in the preceding 12 months. The award was first given in 1955 and is open to all contributors to the journal who are not MNHS staff. A second award, the Theodore C. Blegen Award, was established in 1971 and is open to all contributors to the journal who are MNHS employees. As of 2019, the value of the cash prize for both awards was $600. Distribution and availability Issues of Minnesota History are distributed for free to members of the MNHS. Beginning in 2009, the MNHS began publishing full issues of Minnesota History on its website, initially with a five-year delay and, beginning in 2017, concurrent with their print publications. The journal is also available through JSTOR. Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in America: History and Life, Historical Abstracts, and the Modern Language Association Database. Topics The journal articles cover a range of topics of Minnesota history, including the Sioux people and the Dakota War of 1862, the historical importance of the Saint Anthony Falls, the history of cholera in the state, the historic Near v. Minnesota Supreme Court case, and root beer stands in the Upper Midwest.

He was one of three Iowa State faculty who contributed to the fourth (AR4) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report, which led to the IPCC sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. Early life and education Arritt was born on September 19, 1957, in Covington, Virginia, to Muriel Louise Smith and Raymond Ward Arritt Sr. He grew up in the Virginia cities of Lynchburg and Richmond. He attended the University of Virginia, at which he earned his B.A. in economics and environmental science in 1979 and his M.S. in environmental science in 1982. In 1985, he received his Ph.D. from Colorado State University, under the supervision of Roger A. Pielke Sr. He then worked as a research associate at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State for three years. Academic career Arritt took his first academic position at the University of Kansas in 1988. He was an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy there until 1993, when he joined the faculty of Iowa State as an associate professor. He became a full professor at Iowa State in 2000. He was a member of the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Society of Agronomy. He was also a contributing author of the third (TAR) and fourth (AR4) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports.

After the winners of this prize were announced, Arritt told the Des Moines Register, \\"It's kind of neat: I have, like, .002 percent of a Nobel prize now ‚Äì shared with about 2,000 other people\\". The IPCC has noted that the Nobel Prize was awarded to the organization itself rather than to any individual associated with it or its reports. Research At Iowa State, Arritt's research focused on aspects of the climate of the United States, such as increases in heavy rainfall and decreases in wind speeds. Personal life Arritt met Teresita Navarrete while in the final year of his undergraduate program at the University of Virginia in 1979. They married on March 29, 1980.

It is located at a distance of circa 80 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 720 is about 110,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on October 3, 1785. The galaxy is included in the Herschel 400 Catalogue. It lies about three and a half degrees south and slightly east from zeta Ceti.  Characteristics  NGC 720 is an elliptical galaxy with elongated shape in the northwest to southeast axis as seen from Earth. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of the core of NGC 720 did not reveal the presence of dust, disk, or inner spiral. As observed in X-rays by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2000, the galaxy features a slightly flattened, or ellipsoidal triaxial halo of hot gas that has an orientation different from that of the optical image of the galaxy. Its shape cannot be accounted for based on the observed mass, even when using the Modified Newtonian dynamics theory of gravity, which excludes the need for dark matter. The observations by Chandra X-ray Observatory fit predictions of a cold dark matter model. The galaxy lacks emission in radio waves, meaning it doesn't host an Active Galactic Nucleus. The total mass of the galaxy with its dark matter halo is estimated to be , with the total gas mass exceeding the stellar one. The observations of hot gas fit models that are nearly hydrostatic. 42 X-ray point sources were detected in the galaxy, including a possible central source. Twelve of them are located within 2 arcsec of globular cluster candidates. NGC 720 features nine ultraluminous X-ray sources, the most found in an early type galaxy as of 2003. Observations made in 1996 suggested the galaxy had 660 ¬±190 globular clusters in the central 30kpc, a number considered small for such a galaxy. The allocation of the clusters resembled the ellipticity, position angle and surface brightness of the galaxy. However, in 2012 it was observed that the blue globular clusters subpopulation had a similar slope with the X-ray surface brightness profile. Further observations by the SLUGGS Survey (2016), with wider field data, raised the number of globular clusters in the galaxy to 1489 ¬± 96 and their distribution was less elliptical than the surface profile of the galaxy. The clusters have bimodal distribution as far as color is concerned, with the clusters characterised as red or blue, with the blue clusters having a stronger connection with the galactic halo. Optical long slit spectrography of the galaxy showed a strong age gradient along the semimajor axis of NGC 720, which has been explained on the grounds of two distinct population components. At the centre of the galaxy lie stars whose age is estimated to be 13 billion years (Gyrs) old up to 0.73 kpc, where stars with solar metallicity age (5 Gyrs) dominate. These older stars form a small bulge-like spheroid. At distances over 1 kpc dominate stars with age at 2,5 Gyrs. Based on the Mg2 gradient and its mass, it is proposed that NGC 720 underwent an unequal mass galaxy merger about 4 Gyrs ago.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 720 is the foremost galaxy in a small galaxy group, the NGC 720 group, which also includes the galaxy Arp 4. NGC 720 lies at the centre of the group and the rest of the galaxies of the group are dwarf galaxies, which are at least 2 mag fainter than NGC 720. There is extended intragroup X-ray emission. The high fraction of early-type galaxies suggest that NGC 720 may be a fossil group, despite its low mass. Further away lie the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 681, NGC 701, and NGC 755.

A Democrat, Harckham represents Senate District 40 in the New York State Senate. He was first elected in 2018, defeating incumbent Terrence Murphy. The district includes parts of Dutchess, Putnam and Westchester counties in the Hudson Valley. Before serving in the Senate, Harckham was a member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators and served in the administration of Andrew Cuomo.  Background  Harckham grew up in the Hudson Valley, residing in Rockland County for most of his childhood. He attended Clarkstown High School North, before attending Dickinson College, where he graduated in English. Harckham began his career in the advertising sector, working on Madison Avenue in the 1980s. Today he continues to work in media and advertising, and owns his own business based in the Hudson Valley. Prior to elected office, Harckham served as President for a not for profit housing corporation that builds affordable housing in northern Westchester County. Prior to that, Harckham served as Vice Chair of the Clarence E. Heller Charitable Foundation, a San Francisco-based private foundation that supports the sustainable management of natural resources. In 2007, Harckham was first elected to the Westchester County Board of Legislators, winning again in 2009, 2011, and 2013. He ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Assembly in a 2010 special election. He served for four terms as a county legislator, including two terms as Democratic Majority Leader.

Caged IBC totes are handling and shipping containers for the storing, transit, and operation integration of various commodities, with the most common being water. Caged IBCs are often utilized as one-use containers, especially when it comes to hazardous materials, but are also suitable for reuse under many conditions. This IBC type often features an interior liner, blow-mold manufactured from polyethylene, that is structurally supported by a protective cage frame, often of galvanized steel composition. Caged IBCs are engineered for the bulk handling of liquids, semi-solids, as well as solid materials. All materials can present certain safety and compatibility concerns, especially hazardous liquids, and proper guidance is always recommended whenever using caged IBC totes for harsh chemicals.  Description  This IBC design type is a composite intermediate bulk container, as defined within Title 49 CFR, and that has been tested and certified according to UN / DOT requirements for the transport and logistic handling of non-hazardous and hazardous materials, many times packing group II and III. Caged IBC containers can be fabricated according to various manufacturing requirements as well as construction materials for container durability and compatibility. The most commonly used caged IBC type and material are composite IBCs fabricated from high-density polyethylene within a galvanized steel frame, and used at capacities of and .  Engineering & Specifications  Caged IBC totes are thermoplastic blow-mold engineered, often, from virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a BPA free, FDA approved, strong plastic. Caged tote engineering is a top port inlet with cap for filling of cargo (commonly 6\\") with a bottom discharge outlet port-- common is 2\\" ball valves--and an integrated pallet base skid for maneuvering the IBC. The pallet base of composite IBCs often features 4-way access channels for universal handling by moving equipment such as forklifts and pallet jacks. Caged IBC engineering has been to produce a multi-industry use container that is mobile, convenient, consistent, durable, as well as compatible. The high-density polyethylene used in the construction of rigid, poly caged IBC totes is a durable thermoplastic chosen for its compatibility with many chemicals and materials often employed throughout industries, commercial applications, agriculture as well as consumer-based uses, as caged IBCs are often repurposed for aquaponic gardening. Caged intermediate bulk containers are standardized for manufacture to near a commonly-accepted pallet size.

The formation is divided into three sections‚Äîthe oldest is made of basalt lava flows, some rhyolite, volcanic ash and sandstone indicating volcanic formation; the second oldest, about half of the total thickness, is made mainly of rhyolite with some basalt and sediments; and the youngest is mainly composed of sediments with some basalt and rhyolite. There are several explanations for the origins of these rocks with some geologists claiming that the rocks were formed elsewhere and transported along fault lines. Most of the area drains into the New River, the southernmost river on the American continent that flows from south to north cutting across the Appalachians into the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Some geologists have the New River as a successor to a larger river that drained the entire area to the west and east of Mount Rogers. With time, the Atlantic Ocean opened to create an Atlantic drainage capturing some of the headwaters of the New River's predecessor by a process known as stream capture.

P. Snow's Strangers and Brothers series. The events return to the Cambridge college of The Masters. It is once again narrated by Lewis Eliot. Plot synopsis An unpopular academic, Dr Donald Howard, is dismissed from the college for fraud. Doubt soon arises as to the evidence and the fellows are divided into two camps, those who are reluctant to reopen the case and others who override the board. Eliot handles the defense in the proceedings. Reception In a 1960 book review in Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"[the] one in which Mr. Snow's special talents have their best application... It is a scrupulous, equable, stimulating, passionless examination of human conduct‚Äîand C.P. Snow's considered almost flat prose is often deceptive so subtle are many of the intentions and revelations which ensue. His audience by now is most secure.\\" Michael Millgate, writing for Commentary Magazine, wrote the book \\"does not have quite the claustrophobic intensity of [The Masters]; but to look for these things in The Affair to the extent that they are present in The Masters is to misunderstand what Snow is about... the action is sufficiently compelling, both in its psychological complexity and its narrative excitement, to enable the book to stand firmly alone in its own right. But to be fully understood and appreciated The Affair needs to be read in the context of the whole Strangers and Brothers sequence. Adaptations The novel was adapted as a 1962 play by Ronald Millar and also adapted as a television play for Australian TV in 1965. It was adapted for the BBC Sunday-Night Play with John Clements as Eliot and Alan Dobie as Howard.

History Laksegade seen from Nikolaigade on a photograph by Johannes Hauerslev A shallow-watered area known as Dybet was in the Middle Ages located where Laksegade runs today. The water separated Zealand from the small isle of Bremerholm where the Royal Dockyard was then located. Dybet was reclaimed and initially the site of the royal vegetable garden. The royal vegetable garden was moved to Kongens Have when the area was built over with terraced housing for naval officers and personnel of Bremerholm in circa 1620. The houses were initially known as Skipperhusene but became known as Gammelboder (Old Houses) when Nyboder (New Houses) was constructed a few decades later. The streets in the area had a grid-like layout and were named after fish species and other sea creatures: Laksegade, Ulkegade, St√∏restr√¶de, Delfingade and Hummergade. The neighborhood was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. The name Laksegade only referred to the southwestern section of the street from Admiralgade to Bremerholm (Ulkegade). The eastern part of the street (No. 1-11 and No. 2-10) was until 1877 known as Reverensgade (Bow Street). The name was most likely a reference to its \\"bending\\" shape. Notable buildings and residents Laksegade 26 A number of buildings along the street date from the years immediately after the Great Fire of 1795, including No. 26 and No. 30 which have both been listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places.

Plot In the year 1965, with the post-WWII era now in the past, police crack down on the criminal organizations which had thrived during that turbulent era and numerous gangs are disbanded. Amid these conditions, 30-year-old Kensaku Gunji becomes the 4th head of the Hamayasu family operating in a small corner of the Port of Yokohama as a replacement for the acting head Tetsuji Kuroki, who is in prison. The Hamayasu member Onuma is arrested under the Port Labor Act and shipping work comes to a standstill. Onuma's wife asks for help but it is Onuma's third arrest and it will be difficult. Iwakiri, the head of his own organization, asks whether Gunji wishes to get out of the shipping business and suggests grabbing part of the warehousing rights to a huge new factory complex of Oriental Heavy Industries. To do so, Gunji will have to clear out the people living in slums on the land where the factory complex will be built. Gunji refuses to clear out the slums where he was raised but is told that if he does not, the Daimon organization from Tokyo will do it. Gunji agrees but asks Kasama Tsutomu to resign so that Kasama will not have to evict the elderly from the slum where his parents live. Kasama refuses to quit and pledges to take charge of the eviction. When Gunji attempts to talk with the people living in the slum, they become agitated and throw various objects, including a dead cat, at the Hamayasu. Kasama's father angrily criticizes him for joining the yakuza and now evicting them and his mother screams that she should have killed him at birth. A fistfight ensues but the Hamayasu are stopped by Hayami, an old friend of Gunji who abandoned the slum 12 years earlier to become a boxer but has now returned to defend it, taking refuge in a small boat dubbed the SS Black Dragon. Hayami is visited by Joe, a promising rookie boxer whose eye was injured in his last match but who escaped from the hospital because he could not afford to have his eye fixed. Hayami refuses to allow Joe to quit boxing and become a hustler, instead promising to get Joe the operation he needs so that Joe can live out the dreams Hayami lost when he himself had an eye injury. The next morning the Hamayasu and Iwakiri gangs arrive together to destroy the livestock held in the slum and attack its inhabitants. Unable to go to the police due to their illegal squatting on the land, they barricade themselves inside the slum, which gives them defense but cuts them off from income. Three miners from Kyushu arrive in an attempt to pass themselves off as inhabitants of the slum and thereby collect the payment for leaving offered by Daimon Construction. Tetsuji Kuroki is released from prison and returns to the Hamayasu. He visits a former lover who is now working as a waitress in a bar. She confesses that she has waited five years for him but he is resistant to letting her get involved with him again. Hayama accepts money from the Daimon organization and allows them into the slum to pressure one of the families into selling by force. The next morning Kasama, Ozaki, and other members of the Hamayasu see Daimon soldiers arriving at the slum and attempt to stop them but are shown the deed of sale and beaten up after resisting. Gunji receives a letter or resignation from Kasama with his severed pinky finger in it as an apology. Kasama invades the Daimon Construction office to kill their boss Daimon himself but when he is captured he commits suicide by biting off his own tongue. The brutal bespectacled Daimon enforcer Katagiri tells Gunji to come alone to collect Kasama. Gunji shows them the letter and pinky to prove that Kasama acted on his own during the attack. The Daimon demand a 50% share of the warehousing rights to overlook the attack just as Kuroki arrives and fights them off, telling them that there will be blood spilled if they do not stop. Kasama's parents later come to collect the body from a tearful Gunji. The next morning their bodies are found hanging in their home after an apparent suicide. Two of the Kyushu miners flee out of fear but their leader, who is actually from Tokyo, remains in order to fight the yakuza. Joe figures out that Hayami is collaborating with the Daimon and asks him to stop but Hayami refuses because he still needs more money for Joe's operation. Iwakiri visits the Daimon Construction office and offers to split the warehousing rights 50/50. Daimon soldiers kill the remaining miner and run over Joe with their cars during the escape, killing him. Hayami holds Joe as he dies and the other two miners return and cry over the body of their fallen friend. Hayami enters the Daimon Construction office and accuses them of the attack but they deny it. Hayami returns the money he has received and tells them that the deal is off. The Daimon organization leads the slum dwellers to believe that the attack was by the Hamayasu and the slum dwellers attack the Hamayasu at their office in the Port of Yokohama. The tables are turned as the Hamayasu barricade themselves inside their office but the attackers set fire to the barricade to force them out. During the ensuing melee, Iwakiri soldiers sneak in and stab one of the miners to death. The police arrive and arrest all of the members of the Hamayasu for the stabbing. Hayami watches his old friend Gunji being driven away by the police. Kuroki reads about the arrest in the newspaper and visits Iwakiri, who insists that the members of his gang who were working with the Hamayasu had already left before the fight occurred. Daimon and Katagiri arrive during their meeting and Kuroki realizes that the two groups are working together. Kuroki swears to Iwakiri that Iwakiri will never get the warehousing rights. As he is leaving he is stabbed in the back but he manages to take vengeance by killing Iwakiri before being shot to death. He collapses to the floor with his final thoughts being of the waitress. The Daimon gang then shoots the rest of the Iwakiri gang to wrap things up. Daimon Construction brings in its heavy machinery to destroy the shanties in the slum. The waitress pays Gunji's bail and they visit Kuroki's grave together. Hayami visits Gunji and they visit the destroyed slum, identifying the demolished SS Black Dragon. Realizing that they have been played like marionettes, they join together and attack the groundbreaking ceremony for the new factory complex. They stab Daimon to death but are then stabbed to death themselves by other members of the Daimon gang. The construction of the Oriental Heavy Industries factory complex is completed the following year. Japan's gross domestic product soon becomes the second- largest in the world, exceeded only by that of the United States.

It is a member of the Spafax Group, a WPP company. It was rebranded in 2016 after the merger of Spafax Content Marketing and Forward Worldwide and operates out of nine cities in North and South America, Europe and Asia. Bookmark specializes in content marketing, digital marketing, public relations, CRM, social media, magazine publishing and media sales. The company serves a number of major clients in industries including luxury, travel and hospitality, finance, real estate, automotive, beauty, and retail. History The main entrance of Bookmark's current London offices. =Origins of Spafax (1930s-2000s)= Spafax traces its origins to the 1930s, originally founded as Bath Spa Factors in Bath, England and providing garage services to Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles. Bath Spa Factors shifted into the film industry, forming Spafax Television, offering services to a client base including Reuters and Marconi. In 1986, Duncan Hilleary, one of Spafax's earliest contributors, worked with filmmaker Jeremy Hunter to produce content for British Airways as Spafax Group. This led to contracts with other airlines, including Singapore and Northwest. Spafax continued to provide services to airlines and began servicing more clients in different fields over time. In 1993, Hilleary re- launched British Airways‚Äô in-flight entertainment with a new programming strategy, a new graphic identity and media brand. Spafax provided services for all aspects of British Airways‚Äô in-flight passenger \\"audio-visual experience\\". From 1995 to 2004, Spafax expanded to Canada, Asia, South America, and the UAE. =Origins of Forward Worldwide (1986-2000s)= In 1986, Forward Publishing was established by William Sieghart and Neil Mendoza to create magazines for brands that would rival newsstand titles. The first office was the upper floor of a terraced house in Great Pulteney Street in Soho, London, designed by the architect Sophie Hicks. M & C Saatchi were early investors via its affiliate Megalomedia, the company also formed a strategic alliance with Cond√© Nast to develop titles for luxury brands. Forward was sold to WPP in 2001. William Sieghart founded the Forward Prizes for Poetry, as well as StreetSmart, an innovative charity to help the local homeless. Both non-profit ventures were run alongside the commercial business. Clients at this time included IBM, Xerox, British Airways, BT, Halifax, Midland Bank Patek Philippe, Tesco, Lexus, Nasdaq, NCR and The Body Shop. From 2001 the business stepped up its transformation into a digital agency with print still a core offering. Digital strategy, analytics, paid media and digital development were included in a full-service offering to a client list including Barclays, Standard Life, B&Q;, Ford, Bang & Olufsen, Fidelity and Aberdeen Standard Capital. The advertising department also expanded to include multi-channel content solutions. =Merger (2016)= In 2016, Spafax Content Marketing and Forward Worldwide, both content marketing companies, merged to become Bookmark Content and Communications, under the Spafax Group, headed by CEO Niall McBain. The merger of Spafax Content Marketing and Forward created a new global content marketing and PR agency, with co-CEOs Raymond Girard and Simon Hobbs. The decision to rebrand was based on an intention to avoid market confusion between the firms post-merger. The new company was formally launched October 8, 2016 in New York at Eleven Madison Park. =Independence and current work (2016-present)= Bookmark currently exists as a member of the Spafax Group, a WPP company. The company operates out of nine offices in seven countries, including offices in the cities of Lima, London, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York, Santiago, Shanghai, Singapore and Toronto. The company employs more than 200 specialists in content marketing, PR, and media sales. Since the merger, Bookmark has worked on several print, digital, and PR projects including Air Canada enRoute in-flight publications for Air Canada on topics ranging from restaurants to fashion, a biannual magazine for Patek Philippe, the Earn Your Wings gamified loyalty platform for Air Canada, the Tesco Baby Club content program, and an experiential campaign in a Toronto streetcar for the launch of Pandora Garden. Other major projects include content production for the StreetSmart Foundation, which raises money for homelessness charities and social media management for Hudson Yards through Related Companies.

She was a shallow draft steamer, stationed primarily at Tavoy, Burma, transporting passengers and cargo between Tavoy and Grindstone Island (; now Kathema Kyun) to connect with the ships trading between Rangoon and Penang. During World War II she evacuated British personnel from Lower Burma and then was the headquarters for a small flotilla that attacked the Japanese on the Mayu River. In 1951 she was sold to the Arakan Flotilla Co., which in 1953 sold her to Government of Burma.BI ship. World War II service In 1942 Yengyua was the first BISN vessel to evacuate refugees. On 15 January Japanese crossed from Thailand and seized a hill some three miles from Tavoy. In the morning of 18 January Captain R. Burch embarked 22 persons on Yengyua, including five Europeans, and sailed to Grindstone Island. Before he could sail 150 miles south to Mergui to pick up reinforcements to bring them back to Tavoy he found out that the Japanese had entered Tavoy. He therefore sailed for Rangoon instead, arriving there two days later. Next, Yengyua evacuated the British radio operators on Diamond Island. Then she sailed to Akyab, from where she made several voyages to Calcutta with refugees.Leigh (2014), pp.135‚Äì136. In 1943 the British were retreating up the Arakan peninsula. In order to impede them, the Royal Navy gave Captain Robert Franks the task of preventing Japanese forces from crossing the Mayu River and blocking the British Army's retreat. Using a commandeered Yengyua as his headquarters, he took six small craft from Chittagong to a port on the coast. On a moonless night his force drifted upstream until within 80 yards of several large, camouflaged Japanese vessels. He was able to take the convoy by surprise and destroy them. He also took what he believed were the first Japanese prisoners on this front. On 7 March Franks started moving his force upriver, hiding in jungle-covered inlets by day and patrolling by night. The little force engaged in several night-time battles and was able to block the Japanese from using the river. By mid-May, however, the British force could no longer operate, being subject to both deliberate fire by the Japanese artillery and air force and inadvertent attack by the Royal Air Force. Franks laid his craft up at Taung Bazar. He then led his 20 men, with mules helping them carry their weapons,ammunition, and kit, across the mountains to the coast.The Telegraph (20 November 2018) \\"Captain Robert Franks\\".

The main celebrations were held on 18 November 2018, and other commemorative events are set to take place from 2017-2021. Outside from the official celebrations, 18 November is also a public holiday, being the Proclamation Day of the Republic of Latvia.  Background  On 18 November 1918, The People's Council of Latvia, which was a coalition of competing Latvian political factions, proclaimed the independence of the Latvian region from the Russian Empire and established a new state, the Republic of Latvia, following a summit held inside the Latvian National Theatre. A Provisional Government was immediately created, with KƒÅrlis Ulmanis acting as its first Prime Minister. Two and a half weeks later, Latvian War of Independence began, with the Red Army and the Imperial German Army invading the country, later joined by the West Russian Volunteer Army, in order to have a foothold in the Baltic states. The war ended with a Latvian/pan-Baltic victory in August 1920 and the signing of the Treaty of Riga.  Focus of celebrations by year  Each year of the anniversary has a keyword in recognition of events that took place 100 years ago, which were significant to the foundation of the country. * 2017 - The Year of Will. Honours the consolidation of the independence movement in Latvia. * 2018 - The Year of Birth. Commemorates the creation of Latvia as well as the countries of the Baltics and Central and Eastern Europe from the ruins of former empires. * 2019 - The Year of Courage. Commemorates those who died in the Latvian War of Independence. * 2020 - The Year of Freedom.

The 5-year span will include events that mark the centenaries of different stages of Latvia's path to independence, as well as Latvia's accomplishments after its statehood was achieved. The official celebrations started on May 4, 2017, the Day of the Restoration of the Independence of Latvia, with the Embrace Latvia () initiative when citizens planted exactly 100 oaks along the country's border. As per events on its actual centennial anniversary on 18 November 2018, many high-level government officials, dignitaries, military leaders, and public figures laid wreaths and flowers at the Freedom Monument in the capital. A musical concert was held at the Latvian National Theatre, where Latvia declared its sovereignty in 1918. A special meeting of the Saeima was also held at the theatre. = Military Parade = The Italian Bersaglieri marching in the military parade. The annual military parade along the 11. novembra krastmala (November 11th Embankment) in Riga marked the centennial anniversary's main events.

She is most famous for her conversational piece \\"Racism and Sadomasochism: A Conversation with Two Black Lesbians\\" published in collaboration with Karen Sims and Rose Mason in a radical feminist anthology entitled Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis, for which she is also credited as co-editor.Sims, Karen; Mason, Rose; Pagano, Darlene (1982). \\"Racism and Sadomasochism: A Conversation with Two Black Lesbians\\". In Linden, Robin Ruth; Pagano, Darlene R.; Russell, Diana E. H.; et al. Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis. San Francisco: Frog in the Well. pp. 99‚Äì105.  Career  Darlene Pagano worked at \\"A Woman's Place\\" bookstore in Oakland, California in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \\"A Woman's Place,\\" founded in 1977, was known as one of the first feminist bookstores in the U.S. and home to a collective of lesbian feminist and progressive activist women who ran the store, including Pagano. Early on in the store and the collective's existence, Pagano took a firm stance against the display and sale of books that included the expression of lesbian sadomasochism, and the store's ensuing policy to discontinue such content became heavily criticized by the Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization primarily based out of San Francisco, California. In 1982, irreconcilable differences among the six person collective operating the bookstore resulted in two persons (a member of the collective and a former member of the collective) changing the locks on the door, after they decided that they wanted the bookstore to continue running under the guidance of a two-person collective only. The other four members of the collective (Darlene Pagano, Elizabeth Summers, Keiko Kubo, and Jesse Meredith), exiled from the bookstore, responded in kind by branding themselves as the \\"Locked Out 4\\" and organized to reclaim the bookstore, which drew widespread attention from feminists across the nation. The details of the inter-collective fight and the legal issues raised that resulted in the library's short-lived run are detailed in a book published by Kristen Hogan in 2016 titled The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability.  Works  In 1982, as a result of her interest in opposing sadomasochism and expanding the lesbian feminist movement, Darlene Pagano served as co-editor of Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis and co-authored two articles from the anthology. The essays included are written by a number of notable radical feminists, namely Alice Walker, Robin Morgan, Kathleen Barry, Diana E. H. Russell, Susan Leigh Star, Ti-Grace Atkinson, John Stoltenberg, Sarah Lucia Hoagland, Susan Griffin, Cheri Lesh, and Judith Butler. In particular within the anthology, Pagano is known for her alignment with black lesbian feminists Karen Sims and Rose Mason in condemning sadomasochism as a practice that lacked sensitivity to the black female experience as it could be historically linked to similar forms of sexual dominance and violence enacted against black female slaves in the U.S just a century prior. Since then, the anthology, and Pagano's collaborative article \\"Racism and Sadomasochism: A Conversation with Two Black Lesbians\\" has been cited as crucial to understanding the sadomasochism debate, which factored in as one of the many contestations of the period known as the Feminist sex wars. Legacy Pagano's papers are held in the collection of the GLBT Historical Society.

Siemon Muller was born in Blagoveshchensk on May 9, 1900 (Muller's father Wilhelm had moved from Denmark to Russia to work on the trans-Siberian telegraph line and later became a teacher). Siemon attended the Russian Naval Academy until the Russian Revolution overtook the nation, when he moved to Shanghai to work with an American company. He sailed to the United States in 1921, and enrolled at the University of Oregon, where he studied geology. He graduated in 1927, and married Vera Vilamovsky the next year. Muller earned his master's degree from Stanford University in 1929, and his doctorate in 1930, studying Mesozoic ammonite fauna in the Pilot Mountains of Nevada under the direction of James Perrin Smith. Muller began teaching as an instructor at Stanford while still a graduate student. He was named an assistant professor in 1930, was promoted to associate professor in 1936 (the year of his election as fellow of the Geological Society of America), and became full professor in 1941. In 1928, Muller made an initial identification of the ichthyosaur fossils found near Berlin, Nevada, although full excavations were not done until much later.Fiero, Bill. 1986. Geology of the Great Basin. Reno: University of Nevada Press. Before and after World War II, Muller worked extensively with Henry G. Ferguson doing geological mapping in west-central Nevada (along with Ralph Roberts and Stanley H. Cathcart); this resulted in the publication of seven USGS geology quadrangle maps between 1951 and 1954. During World War II, Muller worked for the USGS Military Geology Unit, where he studied frozen terrains such as Alaska; his Russian language skills enabled him to read the extensive Russian scientific literature on the subject. Muller is generally credited with coining the work \\"permafrost\\". In 1976, Muller Mountain in Mineral County, Nevada, was named after Siemon Muller to commemorate his work in the area.

She worked in a wide variety of genres and materials including illustrations, etchings and murals, although she is best known for landscapes and portraits.  Biography  She was the only child of Jurist and Albertine Engell (1832‚Äì1922) of Mecklenburg, the younger sister of the writer and women's rights activist Juliane Engell-G√ºnther (1819‚Äì1910). Her father also operated a microscopy institute (presumably related to forensics) and was co-owner, with his brother Hermann Gisbert von Rappard (1814‚Äì1902), of the on Lake Brienz. She spent her formative years in Wabern bei Bern, then in Interlaken. Extensive travelling throughout Europe with her parents gave her an acquaintance with art and culture. Her artistic inclinations made themselves apparent at a relatively early age, and she was immediately given formal lessons. From 1868 to 1869, she studied with Dominik Skuteck√Ω in Venice, from 1870 to 1871 with Heinrich Dreber in Rome, from 1871 to 1874 with and Carl Steffeck in Berlin and, from 1875 to 1885 in the women's art school operated by Karl Gussow. In between, she also took lessons from , Friedrich Kaulbach in Hannover, and at the school in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. During the 1880s, she also studied etching with Ludwig von Gleichen-Ru√üwurm. Other artists who participated, to a greater or lesser degree, in her education included Adolph von Menzel, Paul Friedrich Meyerheim, Arnold B√∂cklin and Eug√®ne Burnand. For a brief period in the mid 1880s, she operated her own studio in Munich. She exhibited widely throughout Western Europe and the United States, although she focused on German speaking areas. She held several solo showings there, including ones at the Kunsthalle Bremen (1894), (also 1894) and the Kunstmuseum Bern (1896). She took second place at the German Exhibition in London (1891) and received a gold medal at the International Women's Exhibition (also in London, 1900). She died in 1912, from pneumonia, following a long illness.  Sources/Further reading  * Jules Coulin: Clara von Rappard. Das Leben einer Malerin. Basel 1920. * Rappard, Clara von.

Built between 1955 and 1958, it was designed as a mixed use building for apartments and offices for the headquarters of the National Medical Insurance Company. It is considered to be one of the best commercial buildings in Havana of the 1950s, and among the best modernist buildings in the city. In regards to Edificio del Seguro M√©dico an architect from the Universidad de Oriente, Santiago de Cuba, Carlos Alberto Odio Soto made the following observation: Today the building houses the Cuban Ministry of Public Health and the Prensa Latina Agency. The only complete package of information about the building is the slides that were presented for the architectural contest, collected in the magazine 'Arquitectura', n¬∫ 269, of 1955 published by the College of Architects of Havana. History Commercial building entrance on La Rampa. Drawing by Quintana. The project arose as a result of a public architectural competition held in 1955 for the new headquarters of the Cuban Colegio de M√©dicos (National Medical Association) and the offices of the Medical Insurance Company. Given the high cost of the site, the complexity of the initial project was increased by the need to add rental income from apartments that would help to make the building profitable. Antonio Quintana's proposal was the winner since it managed to solve the complexity of the program with two volumes: a five-story box containing administrative offices, an auditorium, and lobbies and an eighteen-story modernist slab with its own separate entrance lobby. Quintana established a visual dialogue between the two geometries and generated new guidelines for the new emerging modernist, mixed-use typologies in the city. The Seguro Medico was a private company, they were the landlord and owner of the residential tower and thus subject to the new property redistribution instituted by the Castro government. Early in the new revolutionary government, guided by the principals that: 1. housing is a right, not a commodity, 2. housing should be equitable, and 3. the government is the primary decision-maker, \\"Fidel Castro sought to release the grip landlords held on Cuban properties with a 1960 urban-reform law that eliminated multiple ownership, gave renters a chance to buy their homes at low cost and made the state responsible for providing housing.\\" Thus, all private property was abolished and the government forcefully became the new owner of the Seguro Medico building. Program Residential lobby entrance from Calle N, mural by Mariano Rodriguez The first mixed-use building in Havana was the Radiocentro CMQ Building, also on La Rampa (Calle 23). The modernist Edificio del Seguro M√©dico is one of the earliest mixed-use buildings (commercial/residential) in Havana. Similar to the Lever House in Manhattan, Antonio Quintana Simonetti (1919‚Äì1943) sets up a relationship of two volumes of dissimilar proportion: a box at the lower level containing the Seguro M√©dico offices, and an eighteen-story residential block. Similar to the FOCSA Building's podium used only for recreation, the residences are located over the roof of the Seguro Medico offices; a large plane made into a children's playground (garden) as shown in the Quintana sketch-drawing for that area. Because the building must accommodate a dual program, there is a total separation by way of two scales, two structural modules and two entrances on two different streets.  Architecture  Structural Plan. Residential block =Residential module= The residential block has an architectural module of by . Three modules are expressed on the north elevation of the office block by the 9.40-meter dimension of the bearing walls. The outboard balconies are each of a different color and alternate position on every floor. The lower volume occupied today by the Ministry of Public Health. The width of the rooms is further subdivided into three sections of and this module determines the width of doors, windows, and passages between rooms within the apartment. The wooden windows have two sets of nine movable slats that can be independently controlled to modulate the natural light in the room, they can be completely closed to make the room totally dark, even in bright days. The pattern of the windows and door and the bearing walls (9.40 meters apart) are expressed on the Calle N elevation. =Balconies, walls and floors= Balconies in their present state of disrepair. The balconies have a six-inch terrazzo baseboard and two incandescent lights located in the ceiling of the balcony above. The front railing of the outboard balconies are the upturned concrete floor slab, the two pre-fab side railings are metal. Originally the floors in the residential tower were of black terrazzo. There are four structural walls of poured in place reinforced concrete. The two center walls are the shear panels of the tower. The height of the apartment ceiling is eleven concrete blocks high plus a terrazzo base (). They divide the apartments and rooms and are unpainted, set in common, gray mortar, the wall sits on top of a black terrazzo baseboard that matches the floors. Several of the doors in the apartment as the bathroom doors, for instance, have fixed louvers between the space from the top of the door to the ceiling, some of the doors have a fixed panel of glass over them. In some of the bathrooms, the terrazzo floor is raised by a step. In both sides of the rear elevation on each floor, there is a 12.65-meter long wall that is subdivided down the center it is divided horizontally into three parts: 1-Two prefab concrete panels of 6.32 m or 9.48 m in length depending on the layout of the floor. 2- Located under the kitchen cabinets, a strip window of equal length and in the middle of the two concrete panels. The window has wooden \\"persianas\\" (venetian blinds) that were widely used in modern and traditional residential buildings in Havana such as the FOCSA Building and the L√≥pez Serrano Building. The other wall is the exterior wall of the public corridor, made of floor to ceiling concrete blocks and set in such a way that allows for 8\\" X 8\\" openings throughout so that the exterior wall of the semi-public corridor is partially open to the elements. The concrete block wall is either 6.32 or 3.17 meters long and alternates with the plank wall in an abstract pattern. The wall enclosing the vestibule in front of the elevators is made of an aluminum frame for glass panel inserts with operable windows. =Ventilation and light= Edificio del Seguro M√©dico. South wall, rear elevation from La Rampa Edificio del Seguro M√©dico_wall detail, Havana The north wall is designed to regulate the view, breezes from the north and the natural light. The entire wall is subdivided according to the module and it is composed of louvered doors and windows that can be made to open completely so that the wall is de-materialized, or, its opposite, be made to change its character to the point where no air or light can enter the rooms. On the rear elevation, two different wall surface designs form an abstract pattern. One, accommodates a horizontal operable window in the middle of the wall, (similar to the FOCSA Building), which is made up of two prefab concrete slabs. The other design makes the wall partially porous by the placement of the cmu to allow for views, natural light and ventilation. =Parti pris= Lever House at 390 Park Avenue between East 53rd and 54th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, was built in 1950-52 and was designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in the International style. In 2003, the curtain wall was replaced, designed by SM&O.; It has 21 floors and is 307 feet tall. (Sources: AIA Guide to NYC (5th ed.)https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115090/lever-house-new-york-city-ny-usa The parti of the Edificio del Seguro M√©dico is similar to that of the 1952 Lever House on Manhattan's Park Avenue. A thin concrete slab above sits on a podium which, in both cases, is the connection to the street; in the Seguro M√©dico building, the podium and the residential slab is of different use; in the Lever House, the ground floor contained no tenants. Instead, it featured an open plaza with garden and pedestrian walkways. Only a small portion of the ground floor was enclosed in glass and marble. The ground floor featured space for displays and waiting visitors, a demonstration kitchen and an auditorium. The second and largest floor contained the employees' lounge, medical suite, and general office facilities. On the third floor were the employees' cafeteria and terrace. The offices of Lever Brothers and its subsidiaries occupied the remaining floors with the executive penthouse on the 21st floor. The top three stories contained most of the property's mechanical space. =Murals= The building has two murals, one a black and white tesserae mural by Wifredo Lam entitled Abstracci√≥n which is located on the main entrance- commercial vestibule on Calle La Rampa; the other is in the residential lobby on Calle N and titled Boomerang, by Mariano Rodriguez. =Prize= The Edificio del Seguro M√©dico was awarded First Prize at the Architecture Competition in 1954 and a Gold Medal by the School of Architects in Havana in 1959.  Structure  NE Elevation with the expression of the 9.40 meter residential module-support walls shown in red The residential block is supported by four bearing walls 9.40 meters apart, expressed on the office block by vertical glass mullions (4 red lines). These bearing walls allow for curtain wall construction: a non-loadbearing facade. The structural module of 9.40 meters by 10.30 meters. The 9.40-meter dimension between walls is further subdivided into three modules of 3.13 meters ( 10'-3\\"), and this is the architectural dimension seen previously of all the bedrooms and living rooms. There are eleven 3.15 meter subdivisions in total which make up the one- bedroom (6.30 meters) and two bedrooms (9.40 meters) apartments. The outermost 3.13 meters of slab at either end and on each floor, shown hatched on the structural plan diagram, is cantilevered and that is how Quintana achieves the thin walls at the ends of the apartment block (on the NE elevation), these walls only carry their own weight similar to the South and North walls of the United Nations Secretariat Building. They are the same thickness as the floor slabs. All outboard balconies are 5.34 meters long, all non-service rooms have access to balconies. The two basic floor plans of apartments alternate between the eighth floor and the twenty-third floor. The apartments on the seventh floor (the 1,449 sq m roof of the office block) had private gardens; the end wall of the residential block is missing and the residential block appears to float. (N.E. elevation). Unfortunately, the tenants of this apartment have added rooms so this subtle modernist detail has been lost. These three units and their private gardens, overlooking Calle 23, were confiscated early in 1960 and the roof was turned into a children's playground; the playground was eventually closed. =Office module= The 34.50 √ó 42 meters open structure floor plan (1,449 sq m) of the offices below the residential block (ground, second-floor plans) has a module of columns that is 9.4 m √ó 8.4 m on center and accommodates stairs of various dimensions, elevators, ramps, toilets, and an auditorium. It has a modernist reading as these appear as 'objects in space'. The 9.40-meter distance of the bearing walls of the residential slab above is positioned over the office block in such a way that the two innermost structural walls are carried down to the foundation of the building while the two outermost walls are supported by two columns each (below the sixth floor) as can be seen on the ground-floor and second-floor plans.

It has cylindrical pseudobulbs, each with up to ten leaves and flowering stems with up to twenty white flowers with yellow or purple markings on the labellum. It occurs in northern Australia, New Guinea and Timor, where it grows on the bark of trees. Description Dendrobium affine is an epiphytic herb with cylindrical green pseudobulbs long and wide with between two and ten leaves on its upper half. The leaves are long and wide. The flowering stem is long and bears between two and twenty white flowers long and wide. The sepals are long, and wide with the lateral sepals slightly wider than the dorsal sepal. The petals are about the same length as the sepals but broader. The labellum is yellow with purple markings, about long, wide and has three lobes. The side lobes are upright and the middle lobe often curves downwards and has five ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from March to August. Taxonomy and naming The white tea tree orchid was first formally described in 1834 by Joseph Decaisne who gave it the name Onychium affine and published the description in Nouvelles annales du Mus√©um d'histoire naturelle. In 1840 Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel changed the name to Dendrobium affine in his book Nomenclator Botanicus. The specific epithet (affine) is a Latin word meaning \\"related to\\" or \\"neighboring\\". Distribution and habitat Dendrobium affine is a bark epiphyte and grows on trees in moist places such as rainforest, on stream banks and in paperbark swamps. It is found in northern parts of the Northern Territory including Melville Island, the Kimberley region of Western Australia and the Moluccas.

Eskamani was quoted as saying, \\"I didn't come here for ritzy parties\\". During the 2019 legislative session, Eskamani was featured by the Tampa Bay Times as being on the front lines of the abortion debate. She was also a leader for the failed attempt to run out the clock on legislation that would define sanctuary city policies in Florida law. When a woman who alleged domestic violence was charged with armed burglary and grand theft for entering into her husband's locked apartment and taking his guns into the Lakeland, Florida police in June 2019, Eskamani tweeted that an arrest was \\"ridiculous\\" in this kind of situation. She sent a letter stating to State Attorney Brian Haas stating ‚ÄúProsecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it.‚Äù The State Attorney‚Äôs Office dropped all charges for both parties who were involved in a highly emotional contested divorce action in order for them to resolve their issues in a family law court. Eskamani also filed legislation in 2019 to eliminate statutory limitations for a minor who experienced sexual assault, legislation that ultimately became law in 2020.

During Committee Weeks for the 2020 Legislative Session, Eskamani was successful in protecting energy efficiency goals set by Floria's Public Service Commission. Eskamani is a leading voice for both energy efficiency and renewable energy and spoke to the Public Service Commission on the importance of energy efficiency and the need for Florida to establish new cost benefit measurements versus the current use of the RIM test. During the 2020 Legislative Session Eskamani played a leading role in seeking an investigation of the Florida Coalition Against Domestic Violence, a state organization whose CEO received more than $7.5 million in compensation over a three-year period, including millions of dollars in paid time off. The investigation ultimately led to the State of Florida ending it's contract with the organization. Eskamani also worked with Senator Randolph Bracy to file the legislation to end the school-to-prison pipeline. Filed in honor of Kaia Rolle, a six year old Orlando black girl who was arrested by police, the legislation would set a statutory limitation on the arrest of minors. The bill took shape as several amendments between the House and Senate chambers and did not pass in the final hours of Legislative Session. One of the biggest debates during the 2020 Legislative Session was focused on education. Eskamani filed legislation to prohibit public dollars from going to any voucher school that discriminates against students or parents for identifying as LGBTQ. She also supported public school teachers receiving a pay raise, but pushed for additional funding than what was provided. Another issue Eskamani championed focused on corporate taxation. During the 2020 Legislative Session Eskamani sponsored numerous amendments to remove special interest tax breaks from the main tax package. She also filed amendments for Florida to implement combined reporting in an effort to close corporate tax loopholes. In addition, Eskamani worked with the Minority Caucus Members to file several amendments to repeal a corporate tax refund of $543 million, stating that those dollars could be spent on essential state services versus be sent back to major corporations. No amendment passed. Responding to COVID-19 Eskamani has been a leading voice and advocate for Florida families and small businesses during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. She helped to open one of Orange County‚Äôs first testing sites at the University of Central Florida, emphasizes the importance of wearing a mask, and practices CDC guidelines to stop the spread of this virus. Eskamani was one of the first public officials in the state to ask the Governor for a stay-at-home order, helping to save countless lives. Tens of thousand of Floridians have relied on her office and expertise for support with Florida‚Äôs broken unemployment system. She has not only secured millions of dollars of benefits for unemployed Floridians, but she also fought to extend the work search requirement waiver and has held the Department of Economic Opportunity along with the Governor accountable. In addition to fighting for benefits, Eskamani has also focused on housing and food security. She‚Äôs worked with tenants and landowners to help prevent evictions and halt rent increases. She‚Äôs asked the Governor to put into place a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures while working around the clock to identify financial resources so folks can try to pay their bills on time. Early on during the pandemic Eskamani gained confirmation from one of the state‚Äôs largest utility companies that they would not disconnect customers for an inability to pay during the pandemic and she has restored power for Floridians who still faced disconnections. She‚Äôs worked with Second Harvest Food Bank to connect the hungry with nutritional meals, has delivered meals herself to constituents, helped to prevent homelessness by direct cash support to families and connections to local nonprofits, and ensured Floridians in need were able to process their SNAP and TANF applications. Small businesses have been one of Anna‚Äôs biggest passions during this pandemic. She‚Äôs fought against big corporations for receiving major tax breaks and PPP loans while small businesses suffer and only receive $50 million of state benefits. She‚Äôs connected small businesses to CARES Act programs, and has been their voice with state agencies like DBPR. She‚Äôs amplified the work of multiple nonprofits, and has continued to promote local small businesses, helping to ensure Floridians who are able shop local, and help our small businesses survive. She‚Äôs advocated for our teachers, parents and students, and wrote a letter to the OCPS school board asking for the start date of K-12 schools be delayed until August 31st, giving teachers and administrators more planning time and parents more data to make informed decisions. She‚Äôs also protected International students from being removed from the United States, working with higher-ed institutions in Florida to develop programs that would meet the unnecessary requirements of a recently implemented ‚Äî and now rescinded ‚Äî ICE rule. While doing all of this and more, Anna has maintained constant communication with her community, hosting more than 30 virtual town halls, including a weekly Facebook and Instagram live session she hosts every Friday at 5:00pm. She‚Äôs also given up her state salary, donating those funds directly to families and Floridians in need. Her salary coupled with personal donations has resulted in more than $26,000 being given away to nearly 300 individual Floridians.

She was a feminist and a pioneer towards the development of female artists in China. Early life Zhang was the only female artist belonging to the group Tian Feng Qi Zi (), she became a student of Gao Qifeng at the age of 13 upon meeting him in Shanghai. Little of her life as a child is known; her parents passed while she was still very young. Zhang received an excellent education as a child and later as a teenager was given an education that concerned literature from various countries in Europe. Education Zhang's art career can be divided into the studying of calligraphy as well as painting. She studied under two separate teachers, both masters, and well-celebrated artists in China. Ye Gongchuo and Gao Qifeng influenced Zhang greatly and shaped the way she portrayed and created her artwork. Art career KunYi Zhang developed a unique style of painting with the help of her teachers. Her art has been praised throughout the past decades, and she is now considered to be one of China‚Äôs most notable women contemporary artists who worked in the field of traditional Chinese art and Chinese calligraphy. Her works have always been of great value to the art world in both China and globally, and her contributions even influenced the revolution within China that she experienced. Under her influence, art became a form of expressing opinions towards the war and a reflection of society in general. KunYi Zhang painted in a different style after the death of teacher QiFeng Gao, and focused more on promoting art spreading it throughout the world. Artistic style Zhang Kunyi was especially proficient at painting traditional landscape scenery, and bird and flower painting. Her work falls within the category of the so-called Lingnan school of painting. Her career in this particular field began in 1919. Meanwhile, the great painter, Gao Qifeng, became her teacher. Zhang devoted immense effort to enhancing her skill as a painter. In her later artworks, the ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù and ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù spirits live in harmony and evince a beauty of both grandeur and urbanity. Most Chinese calligraphic painting was elegant, but in Zhang's work, there are many ‚Äúgentle‚Äù elements and a romanticism that could only be created by a female artist. Her painting style was deeply influenced by Gao Qifeng. Moreover, Zhang was passionate about painting birds and flowers. In 1930, The Lotus with Quail received the gold medal at the International Exhibition in Belgium. =Traditional landscape scenery= The first decades of the twentieth century marked the end of the insular, tradition-bound Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) and the forceful entry of China into the modern age. Most traditional landscape painting was elegant, but in Zhang's traditional landscape work, there are many ‚Äúgentle‚Äù elements and a romanticism that could only be created by a female artist. Zhang's paintings focus heavily on traditional landscape scenery, which focuses on Shan shui, where the mountains, water and other shapes created on the canvas heavily relies on brushwork and the contrast between light and dark in addition to finer and thinker lines create an imagery that suggest to people certain objects within the painting. Her paintings also often show ‚Äúmasculine features‚Äù, as the brushstrokes show no hesitation, and are bold and strong. =Landscape scenery= Zhang is known for using darker, thinner lines when depicting mountains. Her brushwork allows her to carefully show details such as the edges of the mountains, enhancing the idea of dimension. Her trees are most often depicted with softer, shorter strokes, as if they have been caught in a gust of wind. =Birds and flowers= Birds and flowers are a speciality of Zhang‚Äôs. Her branches are often portrayed with thicker lines, with great contrast of light and dark to give the branch dimension. Her flowers are mostly painted in bright colors such as pink and red. Her lotuses are painted nearly always with fine and simple strokes to emphasize the Chinese belief that lotus flowers are a symbolization of purity, one of most important virtues. The bird and flower genre have been a time-honored, deeply-seated tradition in the history of Chinese art. However, it has encountered a crisis of existence since the 20th century when many artists turned to Western painting style, which including Zhang. Calligraphy Zhang was also proficient at painting Chinese calligraphy. She was one of the female artists that were most accomplished at Chinese calligraphy, as a result, most of her works depicted calligraphic images. The style of her calligraphy was unique. Allegedly, because she was a female artist, her work was mostly ‚Äúgentle‚Äù and romantic. However, her teacher was the originator of the Lingnan school, hence she was deeply influenced by him, and there are both \\"hard\\" () and \\"soft\\" () styles in her calligraphic works. In 1938, Gao Qifeng died in Hong Kong. Zhang wrote many poems to commemorate him, and those works became a famous part of her oeuvre. The most famous was The Picture of Resentment Filling the Universe. This work reflected her longing for him. Exhibitions Zhang became a resident in the United States and helped Chinese overseas citizens during the Second Sino-Japanese War. On January 28, 1939, she took 90 paintings by Gao Qifeng to San Francisco. She attended the San Francisco Exposition, and many overseas Chinese were evidently proud of her work. After 1940, Kunyi chose to settle permanently in the United States. She had an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, entitled The Art Exhibition of Qifeng Gao and Kunyi Zhang. For the rest of her life, she continued working to popularize both Chinese calligraphy and Chinese landscape painting, especially in her adopted country. In 1969, Zhang died from heart disease in her apartment in New York. =List of exhibitions in China= *China Women‚Äôs Art Exhibition, Ningbo, 1934 *ShaoAng Zhao Art Gallery, 2012-2013 *QiFeng Gao and Tian Feng Qi Zi Exhibition, Hong Kong University, 2013 *JianFu Gao and Students Exhibition, Taiwan, 2017 *Tian Feng Exhibition, ZhuangZhou, 2017 *LingNan School art exhibition, Jilin Provincial Museum, 2018 Auctions Zhang‚Äôs art is till this day one of the most expensive within the art market of China.
