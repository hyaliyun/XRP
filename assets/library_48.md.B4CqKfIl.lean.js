Preparation and properties  As first reported by Angelo Angeli in 1896, the salt is prepared by combining hydroxylamine and an organic nitrate, as a source of NO2+: :NH2OH + RONO2 \\\\+ 2 NaOR' ‚Üí ROH + 2 R'OH + Na2N2O3 The structure of the hydrate has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

The negative charge is on the oxygen atoms at opposite ends of the molecule. The angles are 112.9¬∞ (Osingle-N-N), 118.4¬∞ (N-N-Otrans), and 122.5¬∞ (N-N-Ocis). This means that the nitrogen- nitrogen bond is a double bond, and that the cis oxygen is slightly repelled by the single oxygen.

After Bishop Alexander (Vƒ´tols), formerly of Madona, died in Riga in 1942, Fr. John was elected Bishop of Riga. He was consecrated in 1943 after spending a period of time in preparation at the Holy Spirit Monastery in Vilnius. The new bishop found himself caught in the turmoil of World War II attempting to care for the many people displaced by the war. As the Soviet forces came into Latvia in 1944, Bp. John, together with his mother and an adopted son, Sergei, was forced to leave Latvia with a small group of Latvian priests. The group took refuge in southern Czechoslovakia and eventually arrived in West Germany with the help of American soldiers. In West Germany, Bp. John encouraged the Orthodox Christians to organize parishes in \\"Displaced Persons\\" camps. Bp. John arrived in the United States on July 22, 1949, after having petitioned metropolitan Theophilus (Pashkovsky) to accept him into the Metropolia. In October 1949, he was appointed Bishop of Detroit and Cleveland, and in 1955, he was appointed administrator of the Chicago-Minneapolis diocese. In 1957, he was confirmed as the ruling bishop of the diocese and raised to the rank of archbishop. Concurrently, the parishes previously under the Bishop of Detroit and Cleveland were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Chicago and Minneapolis. During his tenure as Archbishop of Chicago, Archbishop John served as senior bishop in the Holy Synod and as chairman of the Department of Music of the Metropolia, which became Orthodox Church in America in 1970.

It is part of the family Enteroctopodidae. Genetic analysis appeared to show that S. salebrosus is the sister taxon of the genera Benthoctopus and Vulcanoctopus, although the former is now considered a synonym of Bathypolypus, the only genus in the family Bathypolypodidae, and the latter as a synonym of Muusoctopus. The type specimen was collected and the Sea of Okhotsk, and the describer Madoka Sasaki named it Octopus salebrosus in 1920. When Guy Coburn Robson revised the Octopodidae, he tentativley reassigned O. salebrosus to Bathypolypus based on its rough skin, deep web, and short arms. The only specimens available to Robson were females, so the ligula could not be examined, the ligulae of Bathypolypus are distinctively large and are laminated. Subsequent workers raised doubts about where this species should be placed until surveys of demersal fish in the eastern Bering Sea gave workers the opportunity to study many specimens of B. salebrosus. The result was that it was placed in the new genus Sasakiopus. Sasakiopus salebrosus is a benthic octopopus with two rows of suckers on each arm, with the arms being roughly two times the length of the mantle in adults. They do not show arm autotomy and no enlarged suckers are seen. The integument has a sculpture of extensive papillae which are flat- topped, closely set, and irregular. No white spots occur on the dorsum and no oceallae or enlarged or supraocular papillae are present. The third right arm is hectocotylised in the males, and these have a large ligula which is not laminated. In life, Needham's sac extends into the dextral side of the mantle.

Gaffney described stadiums as \\"historical, economic, political, sociocultural, technological, and globalizing processes as they are expressed on the local level.\\" The book guides through the history of stadiums in general also in Brazil and Argentina. Through Gaffney, stadiums were considered as portrayals of changes.  Synopsis  Gaffney's argument for stadiums is that they tell their own stories. Development and diffusion of sport and stadiums correlate with \\"political, economic, and geographic processes\\". When soccer was first introduced in Brazil, it brought cultural influence as well. The popularity of soccer grew as lower or working-class started to play soccer in various ways. As a result, soccer became \\"civilizing mechanism\\", leading stadium to become a space of socializing. The author argues stadiums communicate over time and space. They are transformants, monuments, and hubs of the city.  Critical reception  Reviewed by Robert B. Ross in the Geographical Review 101 (2011): 125-127. Ross agreed with him to an extent that stadiums are not a simple space. However, he argued that Gaffney brought an argument to an extent that it is exaggerating. Ross' argument on stadiums was that it does impact on culture but it does not transform or change the culture significantly. Reviewed in the Journal of Latin American Geography 8 (2009): 235-237. Godfrey appreciates the Gaffney's work since it gave an accessible work for English- readers. He agreed that the usage of stadiums was appropriate in drawing an urban cultural difference between Brazil and Argentina.

Overview It was funded by NASA and tested in the Atacama Desert in the early 2000s. Urey was selected by NASA for further development in support ExoMars or any future Mars mission that could use Urey along with Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer, or Moma in 2007, funded with 1.5 million USD total (750k each). Urey was a suite of instruments that built on 15 years of research into detecting organic molecules.Aubrey, et al - The Urey Instrument: An Advanced In Situ Organic and Oxidant Detector for Mars Exploration - ASTROBIOLOGY Volume 8, Number 3 (2008 Urey is a design for in situ biomarker detection, and it was tested in the early 2000s. The device would also study the mysterious oxidants in Mars regolith. Urey was previously included on ExoMars rover in one of its iterations, and would have searched for organic compounds in Martian rocks and soils as evidence for past life and/or prebiotic chemistry. Starting with a hot water extraction, only soluble compounds are left for further analysis. Sublimation, and capillary electrophoresis makes it possible to identify amino acids. The detection would be by laser-induced fluorescence, a highly sensitive technique, capable of parts-per-trillion sensitivity. These measurements would be made at a thousand times greater sensitivity than the Viking GCMS experiment, and would significantly advance our understanding of the organic chemistry of Martian soils. Urey would follow up on the Viking results which were inclusive and only sampled the very near surface. Urey had been selected for a time to be on the Pasteur payload of the ExoMars rover, however, it was developed for any Mars mission not necessarily ExoMars and was funded independently by NASA. One of the components of Urey was the Mars Oxidant Instrument (MOI) and it was developed by NASA's Ames Research Center.

Her diminutive stature and courageous racing style made her one of the most popular horses of her time. She showed very promising form as a two- year-old in 1920 when she won four time from five starts. In the following year she was arguably the best three-year-old filly in England as she won the Epsom Oaks, Sandringham Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Park Hill Stakes. After retiring from racing he had some success as a dam of winners. Background Love in Idleness was a lop-eared brown mare bred in England by Sir Gilbert Greenall. She was named after one of the common names of the wild pansy flower (viola tricolor). During her racing career she was owned by the Yorkshire industrialist Joseph Watson, 1st Baron Manton (1873‚Äì1922) who bought her as a yearling for 1,500 guineas. He sent the filly into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at the famous stables at Manton, Wiltshire, recently purchased by Watson from Taylor (who was retained in charge of operations) and after which Watson named his peerage title in 1922. She was unusually small in stature, standing just over 15 hands and being described as \\"only a pony\\". She was sired by Bachelor's Double, a top-class performer whose wins included the Railway Stakes, Irish Derby, City and Suburban Handicap and Royal Hunt Cup. She was a half-sister to Corn Cockle, who produced the July Cup winner Golden Corn. Love in Idleness's dam Cornfield was a great-granddaughter of the British broodmare Thistle (foaled 1875) whose other descendants included the British Classic Race winners Common, Throstle and Witch Elm. She was ridden in most of her races by Joe Childs, who rode some of Watson's other horses including Lemonora, winner of the 1921 Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp,https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53067896x.item then the world's highest prize-money race.http://www.britishpathe.com/video/french- grand-prix-1/query/PARIS+GRAND+PRIX+ British Pathe Racing career=1920: two-year-old season= In 1920 Love in Idleness won four of her five starts, her only defeat coming when she finished second to Bayonne in the Redfern Plate at Kempton Park Racecourse. She won races at Ascot and Chester and in September she took the Champion Breeders' Foal Stakes at Derby Racecourse, coming from three lengths down to upset the favourite Polly Flinders. At Newmarket in October she won a Rous Memorial Stakes from moderate opposition. She ended the season with earning of ¬£3,719 and was rated the third best juvenile filly of the year behind Pharmacie and Chilosa. =1921: three-year- old season= Love in Idleness was scheduled to contest the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 April but was withdrawn from the race, which was won in her absence by Bettina, having been found to be \\"slightly amiss\\". In a twenty-two-runner field for the 143rd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 3 June, Love in Idleness started the 5/1 favourite ahead of Bettina, Pompadour and Hasty Match. Ridden by Childs in a race run in heavy rain she tracked the King's filly Picardy into the straight, took the lead two furlongs out an won \\"easily\\" by three lengths from Lady Sleipner with Long Suit a neck away in third. At Royal Ascot Love in Idleness finished unplaced behind The Yellow Dwarf in the Ribbledale Stakes but then returned to the track before the end of June to contest the Sandringham Stakes over 10 furlongs at Sandown Park. Conceding 20 pounds in weight to the promising colt Perfect Knight she produced an exceptionally game performance to win by the narrowest of margins. At York Racecourse in August the filly started at odds of 7/4 and won the Yorkshire Oaks, coming from last place to win by three lengths under a weight of 135 pounds. After the race she was praised for her \\"indomitable courage\\" and was reported to be \\"the popular idol of the English Turf\\". She was then stepped up in distance for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlong at Doncaster Racecourse in September and won \\"as she liked\\" from four opponents at odds of 1/5. In the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October she was matched against male opposition and finished last of the four runners behind Orpheus. Love in Idleness ended the season with earnings of ¬£8,743,making her the second biggest winner of the year in Britain behind the colt Craig an Eran. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Love in Idleness an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks, and the best British- trained filly of her generation. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Love in Idleness was retired to become a broodmare. When Lord Manton was killed in a hunting accident in 1922 she passed into the ownership of his son Miles Watson, 2nd Baron Manton. She produced at least six foals and three winners between 1923 and 1937: *Gay Lothario, a chestnut colt, foaled in 1923, sired by Gay Crusader. Won two races. *Idealist, bay filly, 1925, by Abbot's Trace *Violator, chestnut colt, 1929, by Hurry On. Winner. Placed in Princess of Wales's Stakes. *Lo Zingaro, chestnut colt, 1931, by Solario.

One of the first African-American nuns in the Roman Catholic Church, she established a school for black girls in Washington, D.C.  Early life and education  Becraft (sources also refer to her as Maria or Marie Becraft) was born in 1805 to William and Sara Becraft, prominent free Black Catholics. Anne Marie's grandmother, also a free Black, worked as a housekeeper for Charles Carroll (the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence) and was likely his concubine; Carroll presented Annie Marie's father with several of the Carroll family‚Äôs prized relics, paintings, and other keepsakes just before Carroll‚Äôs death in 1832. The oldest of seven children, Anne Marie began her formal education at the age of four at the white-operated Potter School in Washington, D.C. Race hostilities forced her to leave the school in 1812. Becraft continued her studies at another white-operated school, New Georgetown, until 1820, when it closed because white involvement in the education of black people was discouraged. At 15, Becraft became the proprietor of a day school for girls. The school operated from a house on Dunbarton Street in Georgetown. There was an average of 35 girls who \\"comprised girls from the best colored families of Georgetown, Washington, Alexandria, and surrounding counties.\\" The school became known as the Georgetown Seminary and operated as an academy for boarders and day students, one of the first for females in the District. Becraft operated the school for eight years, at which point she resigned and moved to Baltimore in 1831 to join the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore, the first Roman Catholic religious institute for Catholic women of African descent. The school continued under the direction of Ellen Simonds.  Religious life  On September 8, 1832, Becraft received the religious name Sister Aloysius (some sources say Sister Aloyons). The following year she took her vows and became the 11th sister to join the Oblates. She was a teaching oblate who instructed her students in arithmetic, English and embroidery.  Death  From the age of 15 Becraft had suffered from a chronic chest ailment. In 1833 her condition worsened and she was admitted to the order's infirmary. She died on December 16, 1833, aged 28. Becraft was buried in Baltimore's Old Cathedral Cemetery.  Legacy  Anne Marie Becraft Hall, 2010 On April 18, 2017, Georgetown University renamed Remembrance Hall (formerly McSherry Hall) after Becraft. The dedication of Anne Marie Becraft Hall was attended by Georgetown president John DeGioia, current students and administrators, and descendants of Becraft. Anne Marie Becraft Hall is the first building at Georgetown University to be named after an African-American woman. McSherry Hall was originally named after former Georgetown president Fr. William McSherry, one of the two Jesuits who played a major role in the 1838 Georgetown slave sale. In November 2015, Georgetown University announced that the name of McSherry Hall would be temporarily changed to Remembrance Hall, based the recommendations of the university's 16-member Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation. Consisting of administrators, faculty and students, the group was convened by DeGioia in September to research the university's slavery-related sites. Mulledy Hall, named for the Rev. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., the president who authorized the 1838 Georgetown slave sale of 272 enslaved Africans, was also temporarily changed to Freedom Hall. Marcia Chatelain, associate professor of history and African American studies and a member of the Georgetown University Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation, described Becraft as \\"a devout Catholic and deeply committed to educating young girls of color in the nation‚Äôs capital. Though she experienced both anti-Catholic and anti-black intimidation, she nevertheless responded to her calling to teach and to serve God.‚Äù The 1870 ‚ÄúCondition and Improvement of Public Schools in the District of Columbia\\" stated that Becraft \\"is remembered, wherever she was known, as a woman of the rarest sweetness and exaltation of Christian life, graceful and attractive in person and manners, gifted, well educated, and wholly devoted to doing good.\\"  References  1805 births 1833 deaths American Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns African- American educators Georgetown University people African- American_Roman_Catholic_religious_sisters_and_nuns African-American Roman Catholicism African-American Catholics ","title":"Anne Marie Becraft"},{"id":"56479658","text":"Angela Zuckerman (born March 24, 1965) is an American former speed skater.

The slaves had lived on plantations belonging to the Jesuits in Maryland, and they were sold to Henry Johnson and Jesse Batey. The sale price was $115,000, . Of the $25,000 down- payment, $17,000 was used to pay down building debt that Thomas F. Mulledy, the provincial superior who orchestrated the sale, had accrued as president of Georgetown College. The slaves sold by the Jesuits were part of the West Oak and Chatham Plantations, in Louisiana, both of which would later change ownership. None of the terms for the sale, directed from the Catholic Church leadership in Rome, was met. These terms included that there be no familial separation, that the proceeds not be used to pay debt or the operating expenses of the college, and that the religious practice of the enslaved people be supported. In 1848, the Jesuit James Van de Velde wrote to Mulledy about his concerns over the lack of religious instruction received by the slaves sold to Henry Johnson, and urged Mulledy to contribute funds for the construction of a chapel. Many descendants of these enslaved people (sometimes known as the \\"GU272\\") presently live in and around Maringouin, Louisiana. In April 2019, two-thirds of Georgetown students voted to establish a semesterly fee to fund reparations for descendants of the 272 enslaved people. The non- binding resolution was presented to the university for the approval of its board of directors.  Context prior to sale  Georgetown College (later known as Georgetown University) was founded by John Carroll, the Bishop of Baltimore, in 1789. In 1829, Thomas F. Mulledy was appointed the President of Georgetown College.  Legacy  National revelations of this connection were reported in a 2016 article in The New York Times. A discussion is ongoing addressing the question of reconciliation of the university and the descendants; an internal working group at Georgetown recommended that the university offer \\"the same consideration [they] give members of the Georgetown community in the admissions process\\" to the descendants. In response to these issues, descendant groups have formed, including the GU 272 Descendants Association. = Building renamings = Isaac Hawkins Hall, formerly Mulledy Hall and Freedom Hall, at Georgetown University After the revelation around the slave sale gained wider publicity, the university decided to rename two buildings that bore the names of two Jesuits at Georgetown who had played significant roles in the 1838 sale, Thomas Mulledy and William McSherry. In November 2015, Mulledy Hall was renamed Freedom Hall and McSherry Hall was renamed Remembrance Hall as temporary measures while other names were being considered. In 2017, the two buildings were rededicated in the names of Isaac, the first slave listed in the 1838 sale document, and Anne Marie Becraft, a free woman of color who established a school in Georgetown for black girls.  Isaac Hawkins Hall  Isaac was an enslaved man born around 1773 and is believed to have been baptized in 1777. Historical records do not provide a family name, so his descendants' surname Hawkins was assigned to him. Before the sale he lived on the Jesuits' White Marsh plantation near present-day Bowie, Maryland, and went on to have at least five children. He was 65 years old at the time of the sale in 1838. Most of his family members were also sold and were sent to Louisiana; his son Patrick arrived on the same ship as Isaac, and his grandson Cornelius was sent to Louisiana as well. His name does not appear on bills of sale from the 1850s that include his descendants, so Isaac is assumed to have died before then. Isaac has living descendants . Isaac was chosen to represent the entire group for the building renaming because his name was first on the list of enslaved people sold. Georgetown historian Maurice Jackson said, \\"We thought if we take the name of the first person, in which some ways he becomes representative of the other enslaved black people sold\\". The building and an adjacent one had been built around 1833 and 1904, and housed Jesuits until 2004. After ten years of vacancy, they were renovated as student housing and opened in 2015. In the February 5, 2019 episode of PBS's Finding Your Roots, actress S. Epatha Merkerson was revealed to be a descendant of Isaac Hawkins.

J., (born 21 July 1937, Yonkers, New York) is an American mathematician, specializing in differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. He has done research on foliations, knot theory, and 3-manifolds. In 1974 he found a counterexample to the Seifert conjecture that every non-vanishing vector field on the 3-sphere has a closed integral curve. In 1995 he demonstrated that Sergei Novikov's compact leaf theorem cannot be generalized to manifolds with dimension greater than 3\\\\. Specifically, Schweitzer proved that a smooth, compact, connected manifold with Euler characteristic zero and dimension > 3 has a C1 codimension-one foliation that has no compact leaf. Education and career Schweitzer studied at Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts with M.A. in 1958 and then received his Ph.D. in 1962 at Princeton University under Norman Steenrod with thesis Secondary cohomology operations induced by the diagonal mapping. He received a degree in philosophy (Phil. L.) in 1966 from Weston College in Weston, Massachusetts and a bachelor's degree in 1970 in theology (B. Div.) from the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts and was ordained in 1970 as a Catholic priest. In 1963 he became a member of the Jesuits. He became in 1971 a professor extraordinarius and in 1980 a professor ordinarius at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. Schweitzer has been a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame, the Fairfield University, Northwestern University, Boston College, Harvard University, and the University of Strasbourg. For the academic years 1970‚Äì1971 and 1981‚Äì1982 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study. Since 1978 he has been on the board of the Brazilian Mathematical Society.

The brand was founded in New York City in 1900 and acquired by Meyer Corporation in 1997. History A Farberware-brand minute timer. Russian emigrant, Simon Farber, began S. W. Farber Inc in 1897, which manufactured gift trays and racks. The company was officially founded in 1900 and started as a match peddler located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It later expanded to Brooklyn, opening a plant there and invented a clamp-on light. During the 1940s, Simon's son Isadore became the company's president and his other son, Milton, became vice president. In 1944, the company moved to The Bronx and expanded into the manufacturing of stainless steel pots and pans dubbed Farberware. During World War II, the company assisted the United States government in manufacturing small arms. Milton was honored for serving as chairman of production engineering and of the Small Business Mobilization Committee. Simon's nephew, Sam Farber, joined the company after serving in the Second World War. Milton became the president after Isadore retired and opened a factory in Israel. The company was sold to Hanson Industries. Milton remained in his position until his retirement in 1973. The company has since undergone numerous name changes. In 1993, Farberware's pans were manufactured by Syratech and the pan's recoating was covered by All American Lighting Corp. The Better Business Bureau has received numerous complaints of issues with recoating. Meyer Corporation later acquired the Farberware license in 1997 and backed warranties for pans purchased after from that year forward. In 1981, New Jersey leased Farberware's factory building, the borough's largest, to U.S. Industries, which pledged to operate for 25 years. U.S. Industries, however, sold the Farberware brand to Boston company, Syratech Corporation in 1993. In 1992, Farberware Millennium, an anti-scratch anti-stick pan, had been described as \\"one of the finest cookware innovations\\". After testing \\"1,000 back-and-forth scrapes by a metal spatula\\" the Millennium pan did not scratch. By 1995, Farberware was among the largest producers of stainless-steel cookware in the United States reporting an \\"anemic annual earnings of $1 million on sales of $125 million for the fiscal year\\". Syratech was a $169 million company at the time and paid higher wages than those offered in China or Malaysia. Union members feared that production would be outsourced to those countries with lower wages. Farberware products are currently found in most major retailers, including Walmart.

After two weeks in jail she returned to Leicester to set up a branch of the WSPU. Alice was jailed a second time in 1909 as she tried to force entry into a public meeting where Winston Churchill was speaking in Leicester. In this case the lead role was played by her husband, Alfred. Alice could not gain access into the room where Churchill was speaking so Alfred volunteered. During the speech Alfred asked Churchill to explain why women did not have a vote and he was ejected. Alice was protesting outside when she too was arrested. Alfred also defended Alice when heckled by men in a crowd where she was speaking saying 'get back to your family!\\" She was able to say 'here is my family they are here to support me\\" as Alfred was demonstrably for the cause, which some but not by any means all suffragists could claim. Alfred suffered for his support, when he was eventually awarded ¬£100 compensation after having his leg broken during a suffragette protest on 26 November 1910. His case had been taken up by the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement after he was thrown down some stairs after protesting against Winston Churchill during a Liberal party meeting Bradford. The judge ruled that he had been ejected without warning after merely asking a question and that was an assault. Her third imprisonment was in 1911 after throwing a brick through a Home Office window in full view of a policeman. She was jailed twice more in 1913, first for throwing ink into a Leicester post box, and then a last time for digging a slogan into a golf course at night.Daily Mirror Oct 2015 My ancestor was just a poor factory worker but she fought for women's rights \\"Suffragette, which stars Carey Mulligan as fictional washerwoman Maud Watts also stars Kate Barratt whose great great grandmother was a real Suffragette\\"BBC 24 January 2018 Suffragette Alice Hawkins' family praise Leicester statue She received a Hunger Strike Medal from the WSPU. Hawkins was one of the prisoners who built a relationship with the female prison warders also working-class women who comforted the prisoners as well as having the job of holding them down to be force-fed. In 1913 Hawkins was among the representatives chosen to speak with leading politicians David Lloyd George and Sir Edward Grey. The meeting had been arranged by Annie Kenney and Flora Drummond with the proviso that these were working-class women representing their class. They explained the terrible pay and working conditions that they suffered and their hope that a vote would enable women to challenge the status quo in a democratic manner. Hawkins explained how her fellow male workers could choose a man to represent them whilst the women were left unrepresented.https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2018/02/suffragettes- women-100-years-working-class Her protests ceased when war was declared in 1914 and the WSPU agreed to cease protests in exchange for having all prisoners released. Home Office report that 1,300 women were arrested over the years in this cause, along with 100 men like Alice Hawkins' husband Alfred. Death and legacy on the Leicester Walk of Fame Alice Hawkins statue in Leicester Market Hawkins died in 1946 and her burial had to be paid for by the state, a 'pauper's grave'. She has a plaque at her workplace and another on the Leicester Walk of Fame. In 2018, a five-year campaign ended when a seven foot high statue was unveiled in market square by four women including Manjula Sood and Liz Kendall. The ceremony was witnessed by Helen Pankhurst, dozens of her relatives and hundreds of people. Her great-grandson, Peter Barratt speaks to schools and at public events, a century later, that Hawkins was fighting for women to have equal pay and that is still not achieved, and encouraging all people to use their right to vote. He found the transcript in the National Archives of the delegation including Hawkins of Working Women to Lloyd George, the chancellor, from January 1913.

Early life and education Amanze was born in Nigeria in 1982. She was raised in the United Kingdom, living there for 13 years before coming to the United States in 2004 when she moved to Philadelphia. She received a B.F.A. summa cum laude from the Tyler School of Art at Philadelphia's Temple University in 2004. She received her M.F.A from Cranbrook Academy of Art, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Amanze now resides in Brooklyn, New York.  Work  Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze's graphite, ink and pigment drawings, often combined with photo transfers, are populated by hybrid creatures that exist in multi-geographic spaces,floating in the white space of their paper substrate. She is greatly influenced by Nigerian artists and the Nigerian history of drawing. Her mixed-media drawings center on the concept of displacement and cultural hybridity. Drawing has become her primary medium, with Amanze describing it as \\"constantly reinventing itself\\". Despite working with various mediums, her current pieces are all centered around drawing, a favorite medium since childhood. Only in college did she depart from drawing as her primary medium, instead majoring in the art of photography and textiles. Influenced by textile design, photography, print-making and architecture, her work conveys cultural displacement, anxiety, and identity, inspired by her ‚Äúpieced-together memories‚Äù of Nigeria. These works explore a sense of displacement and existence between places, evoking feelings of homesickness and longing.

The campaign began at night on 20 April, and lasted until 2 June 1949, concluding after the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai to the Communist forces.  Background  Between the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949, the Nationalist government suffered consecutive defeats against the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the Liaoshen Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign and the Pingjin Campaign. On 21 January 1949, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down as the President of the Republic of China and was replaced by Li Zongren. The area north of the Yangtze River were firmly in control by the Communists by spring of 1949. In the second plenary session of the 7th Congress, the Communist forces were renamed as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as part of the reorganization efforts in preparation for the campaigns in south China.  Prelude  On April 1949, representatives from both sides met in Beijing and attempted to negotiate a ceasefire. While the negotiations were ongoing, the Communists were actively making military maneuvers, moving Second, Third and Fourth Field Army to the north of the Yangtze in preparation for the campaign, pressuring the Nationalist government to make more concessions. The Nationalist defenses along the Yangtze were led by Tang Enbo and 450,000 men, responsible for Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Jiangxi, while Bai Chongxi was in charge of 250,000 men, defending the portion of the Yangtze stretching from Hukou to Yichang. The Communist delegation eventually delivered an ultimatum to the Nationalist government. After the Nationalist delegation was instructed to reject the ceasefire agreement on 20 April, the PLA began gradually crossing the Yangtze River on the same night, launching a full assault against Nationalist positions across from the river.  The campaign  Between 20 April and 21 April, 300,000 men from the PLA crossed from the north to the south banks of the Yangtze River. Both the Second Fleet of the Republic of China Navy and the Nationalist fortress in Jiangyin soon switched sides to the Communists, allowing the PLA to penetrate through Nationalist defenses along the Yangtze. As the PLA began landing on the south side of the Yangtze on 22 April and securing the beachheads, the Nationalist defense lines began to rapidly disintegrate. As Nanjing was now directly threatened, Chiang ordered a scorched earth policy as the Nationalist forces retreated toward Hangzhou and Shanghai. The PLA stormed across the Jiangsu province, capturing Danyang, Changzhou and Wuxi in the process. As the Nationalist forces continued to retreat, the PLA was able to capture Nanjing by 23 April without encountering much resistance. On 27 April, the PLA captured Suzhou, threatening Shanghai. In the meanwhile, the Communist forces in the west began attacking Nationalist positions in Nanchang and Wuhan. By the end of May, Nanchang, Wuchang, Hanyang were all under the control of the Communists. The PLA continued to advance across the Zhejiang province, and launched the Shanghai Campaign on 12 May. The city center of Shanghai fell to the Communists on 27 May, and the rest of the Zhejiang fell on 2 June, marking the end of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign.  In popular culture  In 1954, Tang Xiaodan directed the film Reconnaissance Across the Yangtze () starring Sun Daolin. Based on the exploits of the PLA officer Xiong Zhaoren and his unit, it glorifies the Communists' victory in the campaign. A major hit in China, it won the Ministry of Culture's Best Film Award in 1957 and was remade in colour during the Cultural Revolution.

Early life and education  ApSimon was born on 28 April 1942 in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England. She was educated at Northampton High School, an all-girls independent school in Northampton, Northamptonshire. She went on to study Mathematics at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating in 1960. She completed a PhD in astrophysics at the University of St Andrews.  Research  ApSimon is a founding member and Chairman of the European Association for the Science of Air Pollution. ApSimon is well known for her research into the transport of radioactivity from the Chernobyl disaster. In the immediate aftermath, Russia issued a media blackout and ApSimon was one of few European scientists to detect rising radiation levels. She modelled the nuclear fallout, calculating Chernobyl released 15 ‚Äì 20 megacuries of Iodine-131 and 1 ‚Äì 2 megacuries of caesium-137. During the first few weeks after the disaster, ApSimon calculated the radioactive plum covered Scandinavia and the North coast of Europe. She travelled to Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria in 1988. ApSimon has also worked extensively for Task Forces under the UN ECE Convention on Long- Range Transboundary Air Pollution, undertaking modelling and assessment of cost-effective strategies to reduce acidification, eutrophication, excess tropospheric ozone and fine particulate concentrations. ApSimon is interested in the impact of urban air pollution on human health and ecosystems. In 1995, she calculated the cost of building damage due to acidic European atmospheres. In 1998, the UK Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions commissioned ApSimon to study investigate the cost-effectiveness of controlling the shipping emissions in the North Sea.

History Roberto Longhi was the first to identify it as a fragment of the upper register of Death of the Virgin (Prado), probably for the private chapel of Ludovico III Gonzaga in the Castello di San Giorgio in Mantua. At its base is the arch which links it to the main painting. The design and decorative scheme for Ludovico's chapel was Mantegna's first official commission - he became court painter in 1460, but negotiations to bring him to court had begun three years earlier. During the 16th century the chapel was rebuilt and redecorated, with the 15th century paintings and decorations removed, though the 16th century scheme itself was later destroyed. Death of the Virgin ended up in Ferrara, as shown by its appearance in a 1588 inventory listing it as among the paintings in the small private chapel of Margherita Gonzaga, wife of Alfonso II d'Este - the part of the work showing Christ and the Virgin's soul may have been removed at this time to fit the work into its smaller new home.

Work Fruish is known for his novel Kiss My ASBO. Along with a number of other short stories by the writer, the initial section of Kiss My ASBO, \\"Double Bubble\\", was first published in Philosophy Now. Kiss My ASBO was one of Russell Brand's recommended reads, given as part of his The Reading Agency lecture in November 2014. On its release the book was highly praised by British working-class writers Alan Moore, Russ Litten and Alex Wheatle, with Courttia Newland describing it as \\"completely original\\". Writer and editor Steve Moore called the book \\"a masterpiece\\". During a Prison Reading Groups supported visit to maximum-security prison HMP Full Sutton to discuss the book with prisoners, Fruish referred to the book's genre as \\"grime fiction\\", with prisoners celebrating the colloquial language and lyrical experience of reading the book. Kiss My ASBO is one of the books that have been banned from Guantanamo Bay. Fruish is also author of a 46,000-word single-sentence work that is entirely monosyllabic, called The Sentence, which has been staged around Britain, and is performed in non-stop group readings orchestrated by the director Daisy Eris Campbell. These performances began in February 2017 at The Cockpit in London and ended in March 2018 at the British Library. Readers have included, Alan Moore, Robin Ince, Jeff Young, Alan Cox, Sean McCann, Frances Thorburn and Gavin Mitchell. The Sentence is highly unusual in that it is not officially published, but has been performed in its entirety as part of a nationwide tour. John Higgs said of the piece, \\"It is tempting to see The Sentence as the spirit of all books raising their game now that virtual reality threatens to take their place as our most vivid art form.\\" Since 2001 Fruish has worked in over 40 prisons as a writer-in-residence. Since starting out at HMP Wellingborough he has worked as a writer in nearly every category and type of English prison, in both the public and private sectors and both male and female estate. With HMP Full Sutton's writer-in-residence Gerry Ryan, he initiated the first ever writer-led arts project at the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) military prison in Colchester. As of 2015 he was based in HMP Leicester where he worked closely with Senior Community Librarian Louise Dowell. He has collaborated with a number of other artists on prison arts projects including Dr Bruce Wall of the London Shakespeare Workout and poet John Row. Fruish is dyslectic and was drawn to work with prisoners because of the large levels of literacy problems found among the prison population. In a report by the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, on adult literacy and numeracy, Fruish is quoted as saying, \\"sadly, there are only a handful of writers-in-residence remaining working in prisons. Much of the expertise that has been built up over the last two decades is in danger of being lost\\". Along with Steve Moore, John Higgs and Donna Bond he is one of the four editors of Alan Moore's Jerusalem. Moore credits Fruish's research with providing vital information that allowed him to finish the novel. In an interview with his biographer, Lance Parkin, Moore states that he has few hobbies, but he likes to go for walks with Fruish, whom he met when Fruish invited Moore back to visit the school he was expelled from. Moore recounts how he and Fruish were ejected from Easton Neston Hall while walking around it in From Hell. Fruish also took Moore in to HMP Wellingborough to meet prisoners. In the mid 1980s, while still at school, Fruish edited a magazine called Tripping Yarns. Issue two appeared in 1988 and contained an interview with Kathy Acker conducted by Alan Moore, as well as an interview and retrospective with underground comic artist Edwin Pouncey aka Savage Pencil, who also provided the cover. The magazine included an interview with publisher Tony Bennet, as well as interviews with the bands Killdozer and the Butthole Surfers. In the late 1980s Fruish worked for independent record company Blast First. During this time he toured with the band Dinosaur Jr. Fruish played the role of William Burroughs in Daisy Eris Campbell's theatrical adaptation and production Cosmic Trigger at The Cockpit theatre in May 2017. He also created two podcasts to accompany this production. The first is a conversation with Erik Davis, the second, In the Sphere Of The MInd, voiced by Oliver Senton as Robert Anton Wilson, and Kate Alderton as Arlen Riley Wilson, a poetic take on John Lilly's Beliefs Unlimited. Fruish had previously given a talk entitled \\"R.A.W on the Inside\\" at the Daisy Eris curated festival Find The Others, that accompanied the original performance of Cosmic Trigger in Liverpool in 2014. Fruish appears, is credited, thanked or acknowledged in a number of books and publications including: Yvvette Edwards' The Mother, Andrew O'Neill's History of Heavy Metal, John Higgs Watling Street, Deborah Delano's Saddest Sound, and A.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty small, crowded, dark purplish brown flowers. It usually grows between low shrubs and sedges. Description Genoplesium eriochilum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and twenty dark purplish brown flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall and much taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and lean downwards. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The sepals, petals and labellum all have tiny hairs on their edges. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are about long, wide with a sharply pointed tip. The labellum is about long, wide, thick and fleshy with a pointed tip. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming The Mount Wilson midge orchid was first formally described in 1885 by Robert D. FitzGerald who gave it the name Prasophyllum eriochilum and published the description in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium eriochilum and in 2002, changed it again to Corunastylis eriochila. The specific epithet (eriochilum) is derived from the Ancient Greek words ·ºîœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (erion) meaning \\"wool\\" and œáŒµ·øñŒªŒøœÇ (cheilos) meaning lip. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium eriochilum is only known from the Blue Mountains between Blackheath, Mount Wilson and Mount Victoria, where it grows in heath with grasses and sedges.

As of February 2019 the current Minister is Rev James Church who is assisted in running the church by ordained elders elected by the church members. As well as traditional Sunday worship weekly events include sunday school, Rainbows, Brownies, Girl Guides, table tennis, coffee mornings and toddler cafe. Like all other Free Churches it has a certain degree of autonomy, although it and its Minister ultimately answer to the national General Assembly. The quarterly church magazine is named The Link. History=20th century= The history of the church began in 1948 when the main free church denominations in the nearby town of Leamington Spa, the Baptists, Methodists and Congregationalists, realised the need to provide meeting places for the number outside of the town proper. The Congregationalists were given the responsibility of Lillington and quickly purchased a site of 1,550 square yards on Cubbington Road for ¬£150. Whilst funds were being raised to construct a suitable building on that site the Free Church met at a nearby Women's Institute building, the first time being 6 January 1952.Mee, William: Lillington Free Church - The First 25 years, page 14. Lillington Free Church, 1977 Planning permission was granted in 1953 for a ¬£3,000, 180 person capacity church on the Cubbington Road site. Foundations stones were laid on 27 June 1953 and the church was officially opened for worship on 30 January 1954 with a service led by its first minister the Reverend D.Gibbons.Mee, William: Lillington Free Church - The First 25 years, page 23. Lillington Free Church, 1977 As well as the main worship area there was a foyer, cloakroom and toilets at the front and a vestry and kitchen at the rear. By 1959 it was already becoming clear that the existing building was too small for activities, especially the sunday school, so a new building committee was set up. Further land adjacent to the site was purchased for ¬£200 and by 1963 plans were put in for a much larger new church. The first sod was cut for these schemes on 10 April 1965 with expected costs of ¬£28,000. Whilst the presence of an old gravel pit initially hampered work the first service at the new church took place on 3 September 1966.Our Warwickshire website page on the church It contained foyer, cloakroom, toilets, main hall and vestry and was much taller than the old church. The 1954 church at that point took on the role of a church hall with the vestry being removed and the kitchen extended. On 21 June 1972 the Congregational Church in England and Wales who had opened the church and the Presbyterian Church of England were combined to create the United Reformed Church. Although technically a URC the one in Lillington still maintains the name Free Church. That year also saw the foundation of the Lillington Free Church Table Tennis Club.

On 23 March 1974 a large extension was opened to the rear consisting of a games room, coffee bar, stage area, a small committee room and new toilets. =21st century= In September 2017 planning permission was granted for the demolition of both churches and the erection of a new church.Planning application on the Warwick District Council website Orbit Homes completed the work and as payment the Free Church is giving land to Orbit, on which they have permission to build 25 homes, a percentage of which will be affordable housing.Leamington Courier article on the development The final service in the 1966 church was held on 26 November 2017. The introduction to the service was given by the current minister whilst the main service was led by Reverend John Carrier, minister in 1966. The church was demolished in March 2018 and the older church was kept whilst the new one was being built. The first Sunday service was held in the new church on 20 January 2019, with the official opening taking place on 9 March that year.

Among the most famous of the leagues was one organized in 1916 by Robert Church Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee. Tennessee Lincoln League The Tennessee Lincoln League was established by Robert Church Jr. in 1916 and advocated for African American interests in the Republican Party. Church recruited various business leaders to join the group including T. H. Hayes, J. B. Martin, Levoy McCoy, Bert M. Roddy, and J. T. Settle. The Lincoln League worked to secure patronage (government jobs doled out by party leaders) and advocated for policies against lynching, fire protection, police services, parks, and schools. The group also raised money to pay poll taxes so African Americans could vote and supported voter education at night schools, promoted candidates, and held fundraisers. The group leveraged African American voters and solidarity to deliver political involvement, influence, and government funding to benefit the African American community. The group also advocated for representation, rights, safety, and recognition for African Americans in the Republican Party. Organized in Memphis, the group held meetings in Church Park Auditorium on Beale Street, an African American-owned venue. The group's success expanded to various cities and towns in Tennessee as well as to cities in other states. The Lincoln League took to the national stage with the development of the Lincoln League of America and a national meeting was held in Chicago in February, 1920. According to the Tennessee Encyclopedia, the Lincoln League contributed to later Civil Rights movements by promoting African American racial solidarity.

In 2000 he held a solo exhibition in the RAM Foundation in Rotterdam.Ed. \\"When summer has almost gone.\\" de Volkskrant, 7 September 2000. To mainly work outside the context of the art world, museum and galleries, the activities of Verschuren resulted in collaborations with other artists, organizations and the establishment of several foundations and artist initiatives. He is active in several long-term collaborations with a.o. FSKE-Studio Galleria, S-Air (Sapporo Artists in Residence), artists‚Äô initiative La Source du Lion in Morocco, East Street Arts in Leeds (GB), and doual‚Äôart in Cameroon.  Work  New Walks, New Ways. 2 kilometers, open-air gutters of the neighborhood New-Bell (Douala). This covering of gutter was realized with long wooden boards on which the artist wrote texts and words bound to water, which were drilled, so allowing the water to infiltrate while avoiding in the solid garbage to penetrate there. Kamiel Verschuren is working in a broad international practice with a special interest for the public domain and the artist‚Äôs position in society from different positions; as a drawer, (spatial) designer, designer of public space, organizer, initiator, social activist, observer, teacher, urban advisor, landscape artist, producer and publicist; working individually and within divers partnerships with other artists and organizations.Kamiel Verschuren, Bureau Voor Kunst PHK18. Accessed 29.11.2019. For Verschuren art is an open critical platform to engage with others, a global conversation, happening simultaneously at different places in which one can take part and sometimes join or even become the subject. = Leitmotiv in early and later work = Until 1998, Verschuren studied and worked on understanding and expending the concept of space and the idea of existentialism, often resulting in literary works (sound-text-video): installations, conceptual art, drawings, photo works and writings. He skilled himself to work in all media and techniques, except painting, as he believes there is no better or worse context for art. In 1998, he decided to shift directions and started to work within realism and participation; within the context of daily life, in which art has to create its own context to be meaningful and in which artists have to re-find their role as part of society. Verschuren: ‚ÄúTrue meaning can only be found in the encounter with others through working together and by participating‚Äù. = Larger public commissions, public art projects and manifestations = In 1996-2005, he completed several larger public commissions often re-setting the original assignment to realize art as public space and creating examples for policy makers to extend their practice and policies. Since 1998, he is closely involved with the urban and social development of Rotterdam South, where he works and lives.

Wentz is an American electrical engineer and entrepreneur. He is recognized for his work in engineering authenticity in electronic devices and the use of these primitives in distributed systems, developing neural interface technologies and innovation in optoelectronics, low power circuit design, wireless power and high bandwidth communication technologies.  Early life  Wentz grew up in Wausau, Wisconsin. He graduated from Wausau East High School in 2004. Wentz received a bachelor of science degree in electrical science and engineering in 2009 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He received his master of engineering degree in electrical engineering and computer science in 2010 from MIT. He returned to MIT in 2013 to pursue a PhD with the support of the Myhrvold & Havranek Hertz Foundation Fellowship in applied sciences. His PhD work focused on development of minimally invasive biosensors. As of 2017, Wentz is on leave from MIT to pursue entrepreneurial ventures.  Career  As an undergraduate student at MIT in the lab of Edward Boyden, Wentz developed wireless neural interface technology using optogenetics, and worked on ultra-low power circuit technology for large-scale acquisition of neural signals. In 2011, based on this work, Wentz founded Kendall Research Systems, LLC (KRS). KRS became the first company to commercialize wireless optogenetics instrumentation for use in the pharmaceutical industry and translational neuroscience. The company bootstrapped itself until it received support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). KRS explored ultra-low power signal processing topologies to capture signals from large numbers of neurons in devices implanted in humans, e.g. deep brain stimulators. In 2010, while still a student at MIT, he co- founded Cerenova, Inc, a spinout from Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurosurgery, with noted functional neurosurgeon Emad Eskandar. Their work focused on novel applications of electrical neuromodulation for recovery and improvement of learning and cognition. In February 2017, KRS‚Äô neurotechnology assets were acquired by Kernel for an undisclosed sum. Following the acquisition, Wentz served as Vice President of Product at Kernel, leading development program in clinical neural interfaces. In August 2018, Wentz announced the establishment and funding of Gradient Technologies, Inc., a venture focused on engineering trust into everyday electronic devices such that \\"the authenticity and integrity of every electronic device, the software it operates, data it stores and computes, and information itself, are provable qualities by construction, not by trust in a third party\\". Previously, Wentz worked on hardware for wearable technology company Misfit, Inc. Misfit was acquired by Fossil Group in November 2015 for $260 million.  Recognition  In 2011, Wentz was named to the inaugural Forbes 30 Under 30 in Science and Innovation for his work in neurotechnology.

She is known for her role as Harriet Conklin, the student of Miss Brooks and the daughter of Principal Osgood Conklin (played by Eve Arden and Gale Gordon respectively) in the popular 1950s sitcom, Our Miss Brooks. Early years McMillan was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1933, but her family moved to Hollywood, California, when she was 7. She attended Westlake School for Girls, Immaculate Heart High School, and Mount Saint Mary's College. She also studied piano under Amparo Iturbi, fitting four hours of practice in among her other daily activities. McMillan's sister, Janet, acted on stage and on radio and was a teacher. Stage Early in her career, McMillan acted at the Pasadena Playhouse and with the La Jolla Players. In 1974, she returned to the stage in Seattle, in Under Papa's Picture. The production reunited her with Eve Arden, with whom she had worked in Our Miss Brooks. The play ran for nine weeks and \\"broke all records in the history of Seattle legitimate theater attractions.\\" The production eventually went on tour to Washington, D.C., Dallas, Toronto, and London.  Radio  At age 4, McMillan was singing on a radio station in Portland. Three years later, her family's relocation to Hollywood enabled her to become involved with radio entertainment there. The first radio drama on which she worked was Big Town. From 1948 to 1957, McMillan played Harriet Conklin, daughter of high school principal Osgood Conklin, on Our Miss Brooks, from which the show starred opposite Eve Arden. Before beginning that program, she had the role of Sharlee Bronson, girl friend of the title character's ward, in Mayor of the Town. She also was a member of the cast of Meet Corliss Archer and was heard often on Dr. Christian. Television From 1952 to 1956, McMillan portrayed Harriet Conklin in the television version of Our Miss Brooks. In 1956, she had that same role in the Our Miss Brooks film. In the early 1960s, she was host of Faith of Our Children on KRCA-TV. In the fall of 1971, the Chancel Players of First United Presbyterian Church of San Bernardino appeared five times on Sunday Story Time, a children't television program on KABC-TV. The group was directed by McMillan, and she and her husband, the church's pastor, appeared on camera with an introduction and conclusion for each episode. In 1976, McMillan had the role of nun Sister Ann in the pilot episode of Most Wanted on ABC, and in the 1980s, she appeared on Perfect Strangers, also on ABC. Teaching In September 1969, McMillan opened Star Way Academy of Drama with students enrolled in beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of classes. In 1974, she and Ron Cocking opened The Looking Glass Studio of Performing Arts in San Bernardino, with the goal of building self-confidence and self-respect in children, aiding in \\"the development of the child into a total person\\", rather than training \\"primarily for professional roles. On June 30th 2018 she retired from teaching when all classes at The Looking Glass Studio of Performing Arts transferred to their new Redlands location run by her daughter Kelly Uminskihttp://www.lgspa.com/history \\" Personal life On November 23, 1954, McMillan married Gilbert W. Allen, a senior at the University of Southern California, in Beverly Vista Community Church in Beverly Hills, California. The wedding had Our Miss Brooks connections, as Gale Gordon gave the bride away, Richard Crenna was an usher, and Eve Arden's daughter was a junior bridesmaid. They had two sons and two daughters. Later she divorced Gilbert Allen in 1974. She married Ron Cocking in 1987 onstage at the historic California Theatre in San Bernardino. She is a member of Actors' Equity Association, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Church activities As a youth, McMillan was involved in church activities, including teaching a Sunday School class of first-grade children and leading her church's eighth-grade girls' club. Six months after her wedding, McMillan announced that she was giving up acting to help her husband in his ministry as he was preparing to enter the Presbyterian San Francisco Theological Seminary. The couple met through their mutual work with young people at Beverly Vista Community Church. McMillan said, \\"We've both had a good taste of church work, and we love it.\\" In 1965, McMillan and Allen led in establishing the first Presbyterian church in Huntington Beach, California, with Allen having been assigned that role by the Presbytery of Los Angeles. McMillan directed the drama group of First Presbyterian Church in San Bernardino, California, when her husband was pastor there in the late 1960s.

The Code of Practice is a standard designed to count the usage of electronic resources, in a library setting. Purpose Formed in 2003, COUNTER's main function is to provide the Code of Practice. COUNTER maintains a list of compliant vendors of the Code of Practice. To facilitate discussion among its users, COUNTER also supports Usus , a community website on library usage. COUNTER sets and maintains the standard known as the Code of Practice. COUNTER has developed the standard to be used with the ANSI/NISO Z39.93-2014 protocol, called SUSHI, to retrieve usage data quickly. History In 2002, publishers and librarians approached usage statistics from very different perspectives. Some publishers, those who were the very first to support COUNTER, understood the potential benefits to their industry of providing usage statistics to an agreed standard; others saw it as an unnecessary extra cost. On the library side there was also a tension between those librarians who wanted a set of practical, implementable usage reports, while others wanted a whole range of very detailed usage data that publishers were unlikely to provide. There were arguments on both sides, but a consensus was reached, resulting in the launch in 2003 of Project COUNTER. Its mission, to develop standards for the recording and reporting of the usage of online publications. Release 1 of the COUNTER Code of Practice for Journals and Databases was published in 2003 and widely implemented by vendors, who proceeded to make the COUNTER Usage Reports available on their websites to their customers. As the number of COUNTER-compliant vendors expanded, the manual downloading of the COUNTER usage reports from a large and growing number of vendor websites became increasingly time-consuming, and ultimately a barrier to libraries making effective use of the COUNTER reports. COUNTER, having defined the protocols for the recording and reporting of online journal and database usage, lacked a method for the routine delivery of large volumes of usage data. By the time Release 2 of the COUNTER Code of Practice was published in 2005 there were almost 100 COUNTER-compliant vendors, providing COUNTER reports for over 15,000 journals, as well as for databases and books. An automated way of downloading and consolidating the COUNTER reports was becoming essential, if librarians were to continue using the COUNTER reports. COUNTER discussed the problem with NISO and the result was the SUSHI protocol, developed by NISO, which enables libraries and library consortia to automate the retrieval of COUNTER usage reports. Release 3 of the Code of Practice for Journals and Databases replaced Release 2 in August 2009. Release 4 of the COUNTER Code of Practice, an integrated Code of Practice covering journals, databases and books, as well as multimedia content, replaced Release 3 in December 2013. In 2017, COUNTER consulted widely with its communities to develop Release 5 (effective from January 2019). The result is a Code of Practice designed to have improved consistency, clarity, and flexibility, so that the Code of Practice can be adapted and extended as digital publishing changes over the years. In 2014 COUNTER also published two new Codes of Practice. First, the COUNTER Code of Practice for Articles, which sets a standard for the recording and reporting of usage at the individual article level. A very important aspect of this Code is that it can be implemented by repositories as well as by publishers and aggregators. This is important as repositories represent a significant and growing proportion of online usage. Secondly, a new Code of Practice for Usage Factors, which would enable publishers to calculate Usage Factors for their journals based on COUNTER data. Current projects include the development of a Code of Practice for recording and reporting the usage of research data.  Usage  In 2019, usage of COUNTER statistics was integrated in the Unpaywall Journals web-based dashboard, a tool to improve the cost effectiveness of the institutions' subscription set. Structure COUNTER is supervised by a Board of Directors and administered by an Executive Committee and Technical Advisory Group. The Executive Committee and Technical Advisory Group are all volunteers.

The layout is designed to make typing more efficient and comfortable by placing the most frequent letters on the home row. Many major modern operating systems such as Mac OS, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, and BSD support Colemak. A program to install the layout is available for Microsoft Windows. For Android, the layout is offered by several virtual keyboard apps like GBoard and SwiftKey, as well as by apps supporting physical keyboards.  Overview Diagram of English letter frequencies on Colemak Diagram of English letter frequencies on QWERTY The Colemak layout was designed with the QWERTY layout as a base, changing the positions of 17 keys while retaining the QWERTY positions of most non-alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts, supposedly making it easier to learn than Dvorak layout for people who already type in QWERTY without losing efficiency. It shares several design goals with the Dvorak layout, such as minimizing finger path distance and making heavy use of the home row. 74% of typing is done on the home row compared to 70% for Dvorak and 32% for QWERTY. The default Colemak layout lacks a Caps Lock key; an additional Backspace key occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards. Coleman states that he designed Colemak to be easy to learn, explaining that Dvorak is hard for QWERTY typists to learn due to it being so different from the QWERTY layout. The layout has attracted media attention as an alternative to Dvorak for improving typing speed and comfort with an alternate keyboard layout. =Variants= A series of intermediate layouts known as 'Tarmak' have been created with the intention of making it easier for new users to adopt the layout. The layouts change only 3-5 keys at a time in a series of 5 steps. Colemak has been criticised for placing too much emphasis on the middle-row centre-column keys (D and H), leading to awkward lateral hand movements for certain common English bigrams such as HE. The Colemak user community developed a modified version of Colemak, called Colemak-DH, to address these concerns. The Colemak community has created several other modifications and variants. Some of these are not directly related to Colemak but would work on other layouts as well.

He is an artist, curator, teacher, and active initiator of various projects. Lucas Grandin has developed an approach combining sound, video, light, low-tech with a particular focus on the urban planning and architecture. Currently he lives and works in Sarthe, France. Biography In 2001, Grandin obtained DNSEP from the College of Fine Arts in Le Mans. He experienced sound as his primary material for work and experimented with it in various forms: video and sound installations in situ, performances, diverted machines, etc. For him the sound, being a noise, music, idea, or material, is a natural energy, message and social claim. Grandin‚Äôs approach is supported by concepts of recovery and recycling, be it material or ideological (copyleft, low-tech). His projects go against a fragile idea of art, precious and mercantile, instead they emphasize a ludic and social approach of ideas. He anchors his work in DIY and recovery concepts and confronts his practices in urban spaces. In Douala (Cameroon) he presented Douala Feed Back (2005), Zebu Douala (2007), Le Jardin Sonore de Bonamouti (2010). The latter was also realized in Sao Tome, Nantes and Angers. He also participated in various collaborative projects, such as, Project PUB (Pavilion Urbain de Bonanjo), P.I.A.F, and C.A.I.R.E. His work has been shown in various exhibitions in France, Portugal, Cameroon, Canada, Mexico, Sao Tome, the USA and in different biennales and triennales. Lucas Grandin is also a co-curator of the exhibition Making Douala presented in Dakar, Rotterdam, Ghent, Nantes, and (in 2017) in Basel. In 2013, he won the 1st prize of the Audace Artistique (Daring Art), which was awarded by the President of the Republic of France for his project designed together with Jean Moulin school in France, the art centers La Cri√©e and doual'art. In 2014 Le Jardin Sonore de Bonamouti was included in Beaux Arts Magazine. It was also presented in a booklet published by the Tate Modern, Across The Board in the edition of Bozar Brussel, Visionary Urban Africa and DOMUS.

The area is connected to Kabul some 16 km away via Darulaman Road, a long straight boulevard, which has been described by one analyst as \\"perhaps the most exquisite street of the capital Kabul\\". A narrow-gauge railway, the Kabul- Darulaman Tramway, was also built and operated through this boulevard. Numerous buildings and palaces were built there, including the Darul Aman Palace, National Museum of Afghanistan, and Tajbeg Palace. However, in 1929, Amanullah Khan abdicated after Habibullah Kalakani took over authority. As a result, his planned city was never fully completed and it never became a capital city. In summary The existing buildings continued to be in official use. Since 2015, the Afghan parliament building is also based in Darulaman.

His father was the successful businessman Robert Reed Church, and Church Jr. succeeded his father as president of the Solvent Savings Bank and Trust Company after his father's death. An African American, he organized the first NAACP branch in Tennessee and was a member of the NAACP national board of directors. From the 1910s to 1940s, he was one of the most powerful political figures in his hometown of Memphis. Church moved to Washington, DC in 1940, where he became a member of the board of directors of the Fair Employment Practice Committee. Church's half sister was the activist Mary Church Terrell. Personal life Church was born on October 26, 1885 to Robert Reed Church and Anna Wright. He had one sister, Annette E., from this, his father's second marriage. Mary Church Terrell, the well-known civil rights activist and suffragist, was his half- sister, born during his father's first marriage. Church was educated at parochial schools in Memphis and by private tutors. He later attended Morgan Park Military Academy in Morgan Park, Illinois and at the Berlin and Parkard School of Business in New York. After schooling, he worked for two years on Wall Street.Roberta Church and Ronald Walter, Robert Reed Church, Jr. (1885-1952) in African-American Members of the Tennessee General Assembly, 1873-1995, eds Bobby Lovett & Linda Wynn, Annual Local Conference on Afro- American Culture and History, 1995. Church married Sara P. Johnson of Washington DC in DC on July 26, 1911. They had one child, daughter Sara Roberta Church. Church died of a heart attack on April 17, 1952. Career Church's career in Memphis began as a cashier at his father's Solvent Savings Bank and Trust Company. When his father died in 1912, he succeeded him as president. He later resigned to manage extensive real-estate holdings. In 1916, Church founded the Lincoln League in Memphis to organize African- American political power, helping to organize voter registration drives, voting schools, and paying poll taxes. The League sponsored a ticket in the 1916 election in Memphis, losing at the ballot box but establishing the importance of the group. Church's national political reputation also grew. Church was a delegate to the Republican National Convention eight times, starting in 1912.Roberts, Stanley.

Church, Jr The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) 7 May 1916, page 7, accessed via Newspapers.com In 1917, Church organized a Memphis branch of the NAACP, the first branch in Tennessee. Church became a member of the national board of directors of the organization in 1919, representing fourteen southern states. At the peak of his career, Church was known as the \\"Colossus of Beale Street\\". He assisted in directing presidential campaigns for Republican party candidates in 1920, 1924, 1928, and 1936. As his activities were central in the Republican vote in Tennessee, he became an important figure in patronage appointments in West Tennessee during the presidential administrations of Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Church was credited with putting Harry S. New into the cabinet of Calvin Coolidge as postmaster general in 1923.Noted Mansion Loses Prestige, The Times (Munster, Indiana) 18 Dec 1941, page 9, accessed via Newspapers.com By 1920, Church's power was increasingly being challenged by Memphis Democratic leader E. H. Crump. The two became leaders of opposing factions in Memphis, with Josiah T. Settle, Jr, George Klepper, and Baily Walsh being Church's chief assistants. Church also saw opposition within the Republican Party in Tennessee. For example, Church's attendance at the 1928 Republican National Convention in Chicago was strongly opposed, but he eventually was seated. Church's faction occasionally supported Democrats in Memphis politics, as the Republican Party was increasingly unable to succeed in city-wide elections. One noted example was family friend Watkins Overton, who was Memphis's mayor from 1928-1939. Other key allies in Western Tennessee included Perry Howard, Roscoe Simmons, Emmett Scott, John R. Hawkins, James A. Cobb, and L. K. Williams. In 1940, Church's economic and political power in Memphis was greatly reduced when the city administration seized Church's real-estate holdings and instituted a campaign of harassment against businesses allied with Church. As a result, Church moved to Washington, DC, where he continued to work for civil rights and the Republican Party. After Church moved to DC, his real-estate office on Beale Street was occupied by Atlanta Life Insurance Company managed by Church ally George W. Lee.

It dates to between 1449 and 1450 and is now in the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art.Catalogue page History It is usually thought of as an early work by the artist, shortly after he left the studio of Francesco Squarcione in 1448, enabling him to shift from religious works for third parties to private commissions in a variety of genres, such as this one, thought to have been commissioned by the humanist and poet Ulisse degli Aleotti. It probably also relates to his first trip to Ferrara in 1449 to work at the court of Leonello d'Este. The Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin holds a drawing of St Jerome with a lion, dating to around the same time, with a depiction of the saint that has many similarities to that of the painting, but in a different pose - it may be a preparatory drawing for this composition or a study for another now-lost work. The painting merges Jerome the scholar and Jerome the ascetic, the two predominant modes for depicting him. The abandoned sandal in the foreground has probably been borrowed from Flemish works, which Mantegna could have seen in the Este collections. Two hammers are resting on a beam hanging in the cave, possibly referring to Christ's Passion, whilst perched above the cave entrance is a barn owl, traditionally linked to magic and superstition, which Jerome and Ulisse fight with the light of reason.

Lewis is a forensic psychologist and a Supervisory Special Agent of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. Lewis first appeared in \\"The Job\\", originally serving as a temporary replacement for Agents Kate Callahan (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Jennifer Jareau (A.J. Cook) while they were both on maternity leave. Aisha Tyler was originally slated to appear in only the first six episodes of Season 11 but the producers \\"loved her so much\\" that they extended her role. She then appeared in 18 episodes (12 more than originally planned) that season. Tyler was then promoted to Series Regular in Season 12. Development After the end of Season 10, showrunner Erica Messer said that she wanted to have \\"a fun guest star\\" while both Jennifer Love Hewitt and A.J. Cook were on maternity leave during Season 11. Messer said that her original plan was not to replace both Hewitt and Cook, and that there was \\"an opportunity there to have fun for a few episodes\\". In an interview with TV Guide, Messer expressed her interest in bringing back characters from previous seasons instead of adding a new character to replace Hewitt permanently on the show. She explained, \\"I feel like when you look at 10 years of people we could bring back, it would be fun to do that\\". Messer added that bringing back old characters would allow the show to focus on the team without having to service a new regular character. On June 22, 2015, it was announced that Aisha Tyler had been cast in a recurring role as Dr. Tara Lewis to temporarily replace both Hewitt and Cook. Messer said that Tyler's character was only meant to appear in the first six episodes of Season 11 with the possibility of extending her role. In September 2015, the producers decided to extend her role and Tyler went on to appear in twelve more episodes that season. In July 2016, Tyler was promoted from her previous recurring status to series regular. =Characterization= Tyler described her character as \\"fun\\" saying \\"she's funny and engaged and passionate, so I think she connects with the team in that way. She means business for sure.\\" During Tyler's first season on the show, she wore a \\"pixie wig\\". Tyler had asked that her character have short hair when she joined the show as it would suit her character. This would also allow the audience \\"to see that Tara Lewis is different from me and any of my other dramatic roles\\". Background Lewis is very intelligent, and holds a degree from Dartmouth College. She joined the FBI as a forensic psychologist who interviews a number of psychopathic criminals to determine whether they are fit for trial. Through her job, she has encountered a number of depraved minds, giving her the experience necessary to join the BAU. Before joining the BAU, Lewis worked at the San Francisco FBI field office. In recent seasons, she is engaged to a man named Doug Fuller (Rob Kirkland), which causes her some personal distress after other women begin flirting with him. Due to a childhood spent traveling around the world, Lewis is fluent in both French and German. Lewis revealed in the episode \\"Mirror Image\\" that she was bullied throughout her childhood due to her name, resulting in her brother giving her the nickname \\"T\\". In \\"The Witness\\", Lewis tells Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) that when interviewing serial killers, she tries to find something about them she can identify with to establish a therapeutic alliance, which is key to establishing a relationship between psychologist and killer. For example, she bonds with one killer by pointing out that their mothers attended the same elementary school, and that they both liked fossils as children. In \\"False Flag\\", Lewis becomes upset after a suspect, Melissa Miller (Zelda Williams), tells her that she believes the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was staged. Lewis then reveals to the team that she was present at Sandy Hook on the day of the shooting. She tells the team that she provided counseling to the parents of the shooter's victims and that she also saw the victims' bodies, which severely traumatized her. She was briefly married to Daryl Wright (Gale Harold), but they divorced because of his drug addiction. Storylines=Season 11= In the season 11 premiere, \\"The Job\\", the BAU is short two profilers. Supervisor Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) starts interviewing applicants for the open spot on the team. He speaks briefly to Lewis, a forensic psychologist whose skill set is not quite what they are looking for in the BAU. Lewis tells Hotchner that interviewing serial killers is one thing and hunting them is another: \\"For twelve years, I've studied these men after they were caught. Now I want to catch them.\\" Lewis gets a chance to prove herself during the case when the killer calls home on the victim's phone once they arrive at their destination, and Hotchner has her pretend to be the victim's wife. She tries to relay the message that he needs to get his head down so they can get a shot on the killer. Instead, the victim grabs his gun and turns to shoot the killer. After Lewis' work on the call, Hotchner tells her that she has the job. =Season 12= In \\"Mirror Image\\", Lewis' brother Gabriel (Terrence Terrell) is abducted by serial killer Peter Lewis (Bodhi Elfman), aka \\"Mr. Scratch\\", who brainwashes a man named Desmond Holt (Alimi Ballard) to take Gabriel's place. In \\"True North\\", while Reid is in prison on a false murder charge, Lewis is given an opportunity to visit him and act as his psychiatrist. Lewis gives Reid a cognitive interview, during which he reveals he stabbed the victim, Nadie Ramos (Ani Sava) to death. However, she later tells Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) that she believes he manufactured the memory in a desperate attempt to find an answer to his circumstances. She resumes the interview the next day, and Reid seems to remember the murder a little more clearly, recalling someone spraying a fine mist in his face while he was in a hotel room with Ramos. This matched the M.O. of Peter Lewis, the BAU's prime suspect. However, when Lewis presses further, Reid remembers that the person who was in the hotel with him and Ramos was not Peter Lewis, but a woman. In the season 12 finale, \\"Red Light\\", the team gets a new lead on Peter Lewis' current location. However, their SUVs are disabled by spike-strips and struck by a semi-truck. The SUV Lewis was in takes most of the impact, and as a result, she nearly goes into shock due to internal bleeding in the adjacent Season 13 premiere. Reception Douglas Wolfe of TV Fanatic in 2015 said the introduction of Aisha Tyler's character, Dr. Tara Lewis, was \\"the saving grace, and a reason for hope for this season\\". Meredith Jacobs of Buddy TV wrote that the character of Tara Lewis was \\"good, as is Tyler in the role, in a way that I want to see more of her but I don't feel is in any way taking away from the regular team members\\". She also wrote that, \\"Tara brings something new to the show that we haven't seen quite that much of before\\". In 2016 while reviewing \\"Mirror Image\\", Angela Niles described Lewis as \\"eager and dedicated to the job without taking away from any of the others‚Äô skills, and comes off as a like-able, supportive team member\\". She noted that her character had \\"remained something of a mystery\\" during her first two seasons on the show. Jay Ruymann of Tell-Tale TV said that \\"Criminal Minds has not made a better decision in the past decade than casting Aisha Tyler as Tara Lewis\\".

The division of the NOS responsible for gathering and broadcasting the news is known as NOS Nieuws, and is based at the Media Park in Hilversum; the NOS also has fully equipped radio and television studios in The Hague, from which political programmes are often produced.  History  On 5 January 1956, the Nederlandse Televise Stichting (Dutch Television Foundation, the forerunner of the NOS) broadcast the first NTS-journaal bulletin: initially, these were broadcast three times a week. Each edition lasted fifteen minutes, and had no presenter. From 3 October 1957, Coen van Hoewijk became the first newsreader of NTS-journaal, and by extension, on Dutch television; the first female newsreader, Eug√®nie Herlaar, started in 1965. The number of broadcasts increased over time. The Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Dutch Broadcasting Foundation) was founded in 1969, as a result of a merger between the NTS and the Nederlandse Radio Union. On 6 January 1973 at 8pm, the autocue was introduced; previously, the newsreaders read from scripts printed on paper. In 1989, NOS Journaal gained competition, in the form of RTL Nieuws, broadcast on the then-upstart channel RTL V√©ronique. Since then, other channels have launched, bringing with them their own news broadcasts, such as SBS 6 with its successful Hart van Nederland (Heart of the Netherlands), which focuses on news from within the Netherlands. Major changes to the presentation of NOS Journaal were made in May 2012: the anchors now presented the news standing up, as opposed to being sat behind a desk, and the news began to be delivered with the help of a large videowall displaying pictures of the day's news. According to the NOS, these changes were made in order to give a greater sense of urgency and to connect more with the viewer.  Broadcasts = Evening = Evening bulletins are broadcast at 6pm, 8pm and midnight on NPO 1 every days; in addition, current affairs programme Nieuwsuur, broadcast nightly at 9.30 pm at NPO 2, also includes a news bulletin, presented by an NOS newsreader. The 8pm broadcast is the oldest and considered tot be the most important edition of NOS Journaal, typically lasting for 25 minutes; there is more in-depth coverage of the news compared to the 6pm edition, and there is a comprehensive weather report at the end, presented by a meteorologist. = Daytime = As of 2018, there are NOS Journaal bulletins every half hour on weekdays between 6:30am and 9am on NPO 1, which are simulcast with a sign language interpreter on NPO 2, and hourly bulletins broadcast on NPO 1 or NPO 2 between 9am and 5pm. There are fewer bulletins at weekends: on Saturdays, the first bulletin is broadcast at 1pm, and on Sundays at 12pm; there is also a short bulletin at 5pm.  Studios  Studio 8 at the Media Park, circa 2012 NOS Journaal is broadcast from studios 8 and 10 at the Media Park, Hilversum. The 6pm and 8pm bulletins, along with Nieuwsuur and NOS Jeugdjournaal, are produced in Studio 8, while daytime bulletins come from Studio 10.  Design and theme music  The design of NOS Journaal has changed many times throughout its history. The first title sequence of the NTS-journaal was controversial, because it showed footage of women wearing short skirts and men dressed in leotards; the NCRV objected and as such, the footage was removed from the intro. The theme music to NOS Journaal has traditionally featured the sound of a gong; however, this was not the case between 1988 and 1995, nor was it so between 2005 and 2012. The theme music used from 1995 to 2001, which was composed by Stephen Emmer, used the same gong as was used in the original theme from 1956. After a long search, the gong was found in the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam; as there was a small crack in the gong, the gong itself had to be repaired. On 17 December 2005, the NOS Journaal received a rebrand, which was designed by British design agency Lambie-Nairn. The NOS itself also received a new logo, featuring a red 'O', a motif which featured prominently in the logos, title sequences and sets of all programmes produced by the NOS. The radio news bulletins, previously known as NOS Radio Nieuws, were also renamed to NOS Journaal; as well as the news section on NOS Teletexst. New theme music was also introduced, composed once again by Stephen Emmer. On 27 May 2012, the corporate identity was revamped again: many elements, such as the use of the colour red, were retained. For the 6pm and 8pm bulletins, presenters no longer sat down to present the news, instead standing and walking around the studio, in front of a newly built video wall. New theme music and title sequences were also introduced, with the red 'O' motif becoming a focal point in the title sequences.

History  The mosque was built in 1342 (CE) under the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan and was considerably restored under the Alaouite sultan Moulay Slimane (1792‚àí1822). Only the minaret and the mosque entrance are still essentially in their original Marinid form, while the appearance of the rest of the mosque generally dates from the Alaouite restoration. The Mosque of Abu al-Hasan to the west, founded around the same time and similarly renovated by Moulay Slimane, bears a number of resemblances with this building.  Location and origin of name  The mosque is located on Tala'a Kebira, the main souq (market) street and artery of Fes el-Bali, the old city of Fez, from which its minaret is prominently visible. The surrounding district is also referred to as Chrabliyine, a name which refers to a type of traditional Moroccan women's shoe called \\"cherbil\\" in which the local shops specialized (and still do to some extent today). Architecture View of the minaret from the west, on Tala'a Kebira street. = Minaret and exterior = The mosque is considered notable for its minaret, which is particularly well-decorated in the medieval Moroccan-Andalusian style (evolved from earlier Almohad models), making use of the darj-w-ktaf or sebka pattern (resembling palmettes or fleur-de-lys shapes) covering much of the facades, as well as polylobed arch motifs near the base, merlons at the top, and multicolored mosaic tiles that fill in the empty spaces. One of these tile mosaics, on the side of the minaret overlooking the interior courtyard, features a notable inscription in the \\"square\\" kufic style. The main street entrance to the mosque is directly below the minaret and is overlooked by a canopy of carved wood. The street facade of the building also includes spaces for two shops. = Interior and layout = The interior of the mosque features a rectangular courtyard (roughly 11 by 5 meters) that can be accessed directly from the street entrance and which is flanked on either side by annexes. The courtyard, like that of many mosques, features a marble fountain in its center, while on its north/western side is also an entrance to an ablutions room. On its southern/eastern side is the prayer hall, featuring two transverse naves formed by rows of five horseshoe arches parallel to the qibla wall (i.e. the wall towards which prayers face). The mihrab, a decorative alcove or niche in the qibla wall that symbolizes the direction of prayer, is a small octagonal space topped by a dome of muqarnas. On either side of the mihrab are two small doors leading to other rooms. The eastern one (on the left) connects to a \\"mosque of the dead\\" or funerary mosque (Jama' el-Gnaiz), a space used for funerary rites and prayers around the bodies of the deceased before they are buried. (This space is attached but separate from the rest of the mosque in order to protect the cleanliness and sanctity of the main prayer space.) Both this funerary space and the main prayer hall can also be accessed by smaller secondary entrances from the street on the eastern side of the building.

The title of the book is derived from Native American legends. Spider Woman was the one who taught the Navajo people how to weave. Officer Bernadette Manuelito is the daughter of a weaver, and married to Officer Jim Chee. He nicknamed her \\"Spider Woman's Daughter\\" for her ability to weave together a complex array of evidence to solve a crime. In her debut effort to continue the series, Anne Hillerman has given the reader an exceptionally detailed plot and long list of characters. One reviewer at Goodreads.com counted 46 named characters. The Navajo Nation on which the story takes place, abuts a geographical area known as the Four Corners. The nation spans the connecting borders of the US states of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. According to the NN itself, it encompasses 500 Indian tribes on 318 reservations. The book's fictional Double X Ranch in southern Colorado, while not part of the Navajo Nation, connects to it at the Four Corners. Plot=Chapters 1‚Äì3= Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is retired from the Navajo Tribal Police, and living with anthropologist Louisa Bourebonette. Now a freelance investigator, he retains use of the department's computer facilities. Leaphorn carries wide respect for his pioneering crime investigation methods, and is a regular participant at their informal weekly breakfasts at the Navajo Inn in Window Rock, Arizona. As the story opens, Officer Bernadette Manuelito, Captain Howard Largo, and Officer Harold Bigman are being entertained by Leaphorn's story of an unnamed woman who set up an appointment with him, and then didn't show up. As Manuelito steps to a window to take a phone call, Leaphorn exits the Navajo Inn. She witnesses someone shoot Leaphorn in the head and escape in a 2-door blue sedan with an Arizona license plate. As an ambulance rushes Leaphorn to the hospital, the Arizona State Police crime team and FBI investigator Jerry Cordova interrogate Manuelito. Her husband Officer Jim Chee is put in charge of the investigation. Leaphorn had never updated his emergency contact information, so Manuelito is ordered to drive Leaphorn's truck home and to ask Louisa about his next of kin. Gloria Bernally is the owner of the get-away vehicle. Her son Jackson, who uses it to drive to the University of New Mexico Gallup campus with his friend \\"Lizard\\" Leonard Nez, left it at Basha's grocery for her. Over her protests, the police search the car. Chee sends Officer Harold Bigman to search Leaphorn's hard drive and discs, which Bigman takes back to the police station. =Chapters 4‚Äì5= At Leaphorn's house, Manuelito finds only the cat at home. Neither Leaphorn's cell phone nor Louisa's cell number can be found. A pottery book lies on his desk, as well as his phone charger, but no phone. Chee arrives and searches in vain for recent case files, but he finds old hard copy pre-computer files that he takes home to compile a suspect list. As they depart, Manuelito leaves her business card with a note, \\"Louisa, call ASAP\\". The next day Manuelito is due for her weekly visit with her mother at Toadlena at Two Grey Hills, to relieve her sister Darleen as caregiver. On her way, she stops by Leaphorn's house to see if Louisa has returned, but only finds a phone message from her indicating they had quarreled. She takes Leaphorn's cat so Chee the cat lover can care for it. She takes mail Leaphorn intended to post, including a bill for his services addressed to Dr. John Collingsworth in Santa Fe. On her drive to her mother's house, shes pulls over for a nap, awaking to find the cat is gone. At her mother's house, Darleen arrives drunk with Charley Zah, a.k.a. \\"Stoop Boy\\", and both quickly leave. During the visit, Mama Manuelito talks about a special old rug she wove. When it comes time to leave and Darleen has not returned, Manuelito asks neighbor Stella Darkwater to come stay with her. When she returns home, Manuelito tells Chee she lost the cat. The Gallup Police could not find Jackson Bernally or \\"Lizard\\" Leonard Nez, who has no police record. The FBI have made Louisa a suspect because of her unexplained absence. Louisa calls Chee from Albuquerque, where she's awaiting a flight to Houston to go to a conference. She remembers that Leaphorn recently told her of \\"a ghost from the past\\", but she didn't know anymore than that. Louisa tells them he had no immediate family members she was aware of, but he kept addresses of relatives in his pocket notebook. She dodges when Chee asks her what kind of conference she's attending, and combined with her message on Leaphorn's answering machine, he believes the FBI will suspect her of a murder-for-hire. Chee and Manuelito go through the old files to compile a suspect list. =Chapters 6‚Äì7= The following day, Chee goes to the Navajo Tribal Police station in Shiprock and compares the list of suspect names against the lab fingerprint report. The FBI wants to talk to Louisa. Chee receives a panicked phone call from Darleen who can't find her mother, only to receive another one that Mama Manuelito had spent the night in the Darkwater home. Before visiting Leaphorn in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) at CHRISTUS St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe, Manuelito posts his mail, except the one to Dr. John Collingsworth. Medical tests were run by neurologist Grant Moxsley, and the results sent to the FBI. In response to Manuelito's query about Collingsworth, Moxsley tells her is a director of the American Indian Resource Center (AIRC). Leaphorn lies in an induced coma, part of his skull removed to reduce pressure. If he survives, the long-term affects could alter his lifestyle and personality. When she is allowed visitation, Manuelito talks to him in the Navajo language. She's told by the hospital that Leaphorn's notebook is being held with his personal effects, and she examines its contents over lunch. Much of the coding confuses her, but on a hunch she asks reverse directory service on one set of numbers, which are found to belong to someone named Austin Lee in Farmington. When Manuelito delivers Leaphorn's letter to Collingsworth's at AIRC, he is upset that it's only part of the information Leaphorn was supposed to provide. As Collingsworth explains, Leaphorn was evaluating the assessed valuation of a proposed acquisition from the Grove McManus Foundation, headquartered in Japan. The evaluation summary is missing. As she leaves, Collingsworth's secretary Marjorie Rockwell gives a tour of facility. Manuelito phones Officer Bigman and asks him to re-check Leaphorn's truck for a second envelope to AIRC. =Chapters 8‚Äì9= Officer Bigman brings the missing cat to Chee after it found its way back to Leaphorn's house, but Bigman had found no lost envelope at the house. Internet searches brought up nothing negative about Jackson or Gloria Bernally. When Jackson is taken in to be fingerprinted, Chee believes he is lying when he says he does not know how to contact Nez. Eventually, he admits to renting out the car for extra money for school books, and that his mother does not know about it. Chee makes him hand over all the contact numbers on his phone. Jackson says Nez has an uncle with a ranch. After Louisa leaves Chee a phone message that she had to talk, his return goes went to her voice mail. The police fingerprint analysis show that some of the prints from the car belong to Garrison Tsosie, whose brother Notah Tsosie went to prison for car theft because of Leaphorn. Garrison lives in Crownpoint. Manuelito dials Austin Lee's number, but it is not answered. Cordova wants an alternate number for Louisa, but no one has one. Manuelito is asked to submit to a hypnosis debriefing about the shooting. While examining Leaphorn's notebook, both Chee and Manuelito notice geometric sketches. =Chapters 10‚Äì11= Chee takes care of feeding the cat and cleaning the cat box, and before heading out asks Manuelito if she can find a connection to any Tsosie in Leaphorn's files. She plans to look at her old college books at her mother's house for a clue to Leaphorn's sketches. At the same time, she intends to have a discussion on Darleen's caregiver responsibilities. Dr. Maxie Davis calls on behalf of Collingsworth, asking about Leaphorn's missing report. When Manuelito brings up Leaphorn's sketches, Davis dismisses them as having nothing to do with the McManus pots. Mrs. Tsosie mentions to Chee that they are related. She believes her sons had no motives for harming Leaphorn. The family feels Notah deserved imprisonment, and he used it to get his GED certificate. She gives Garrison's address and phone number to Chee, assuring him her son has his own jewelry making business. At Garrison's home, Chee is invited in and told that on the day of the shooting, Garrison was selling jewelry at Earl's Restaurant on Route 66, later confirmed by Earl's manager. As he leaves Earl's, Chee buys earrings for his wife. Back at Toadlena, Manuelito and Darleen clash over their mother's care. Darleen is more interested in being an artist and has followed the party lifestyle of her friends. Manuelito reads her old textbook Native Arts of the Southwest: Roots and Routes, a copy of which was also found on Leaphorn's desk. Seeing geometric designs that resemble Leaphorn's, she asks her mother, who says they look like ancient drawings at Chaco Canyon. The books says they are Pueblo Bonito jars. Manuelito finds a picture of a Klah rug she believes was at the AIRC museum. Mama wants to see it. Manuelito returns home to an empty house, and only the cat to keep her company. When Chee arrives, he presents her with a cake, the earrings, and a thumb drive with Leaphorn's missing report on it. =Chapters 12‚Äì13= Leaphorn's report verifies that most of the original valuations were accurate, but there were exceptions in 2343‚Äì2355 that had troubled him. The original appraisal firm was listed as EFB. Photos of the exceptions are included and are shown to be tall cylinders; nevertheless, Leaphorn believed the collection could be shown on a contingency basis to the public without problems. Dr. Davis offers to update the valuations, but Manuelito intends to hand the report as is over to Collingsworth. On their way to Santa Fe for Manuelito to be debriefed by a hypnotist, she speculates about the nature of the argument between Louisa and Leaphorn, and wonders how she could have just dropped out of sight. Chee brings up the murder-for-hire theory floated by the FBI. At the New Mexico State Police Building in Santa Fe, Manuelito's hypnosis session brings up a memory of the shooter's black gloves and sand-cast silver bracelet with linked hearts. Afterwards, they pay a hospital visit to Leaphorn who has improved but is still unable to speak. In response to Chee's prompt, Leaphorn raises a finger to indicate he wants a singer to pray over him. Chee will do the sing. At the AIRC, Chee and Manuelito are given clearance to view the Klah rug that she believes was in her book. Since Manuelito's last visit, the original copy of Leaphorn's lost report has been found, minus the pages about the exceptions. EFB is owned by Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. Unable to locate EFB Appraisals on the AIRC computers, Chee gets the information from Rocko Delbert, a former Navajo police officer. After the divorce from Bernal, she reverted to the name Ellie Friedman. When they arrive at the address provided by Delbert, EFB is closed. The property owner Janelle mentions that Friedman's car is still parked there, but Friedman seems to have vanished. Let inside EFB by Janelle, the interior is ransacked, but the exceptions that were missing from Leaphorn's report are there along with a phone number. Chee remembers that he and Leaphorn once rescued Ellie Friedman at Chaco Canyon when a man named Randall Eliott tried to kill her. After finding her residence unlocked, she is considered a missing person. =Chapters 14‚Äì15= Austin Lee's ex-wife returns a message from Cordova at the FBI to let them know he is a clan brother to Leaphorn. After Chee notifies Cordova and Largo about Friedman's disappearance, he and Manuelito head for the Santo Domingo Pueblo. Jackson Bernally phones Chee to tell him that he uses his mother's car on the weekends at his southern Colorado job on the Double X Ranch. The employees leave their keys in the cars in case they have to be moved, thereby providing the opportunity for anyone to make a copy of a key. He gives Chee the ranch phone number, and it's the same number Chee had seen next to Friedman's phone. Chee passes the follow-up information of the ranch to Manuelito. After camping overnight at Chaco Canyon, they meet fellow camper Karen Dundee from Denver. When Karen finds out they're law enforcement, she relates recently witnessing an argument between two people, a woman wearing a long-sleeved shirt, and the other person with a \\"dorky-looking\\" khaki hat. Dorky Hat seemed to be physically forcing the woman along. Karen saw Dorky Hat run away, but the woman had disappeared. Shortly thereafter, Karen heard a loud bang. Chee and Manuelito report the incident to ranger Andrew Stephen who is personally acquainted with Friedman, but hasn't seen her around in a long time. After looking for pottery books at the park station, they hike to Una Vida. Chee remembers seeing Maxie Davis in the canyon years ago, when he and Leaphorn rescued Friedman from Randall Eliott . The Double X Ranch does not fall under Navajo jurisdiction, but owner Slim Jacobs agrees to be interviewed by Manuelito. When she arrives, she noticed the parked cars with windows down and keys in the ignition, verifying that part of Bernally's story. Friedman had a recent appointment with Jacobs, but she never showed up. She and Jacobs had dated when she worked at Chaco Canyon, having met when Jacobs hired her for a small appraisal job. He says Chaco Canyon pottery was her specialty, and someone hired her to do an appraisal when the original shipment of Chaco Canyon Anasazi antiquities were sold to a buyer in Japan. She was angry the antiquities were going out of the country. Jacobs provides Manuelito with a photo of Friedman and Maxie Davis, but he doesn't recall ever hearing Leaphorn's name. Friedman and Davis had set up a dig on the ranch, with Friedman doing the digging and Davis taking the photos. Nez is a rodeo fan. Jacobs says to check who is offering a prize in bronc riding, and Nez will be there. Jacobs thinks Jackson acts as Nez's manager to pick up girls. At the ranch, Jackson is a bookkeeping assistant. Inasmuch as he has an interest in archeology, h also works for Maxie Davis. According to Jacobs, Davis recently showed up at the ranch trying to retrieve any old photos of her with Friedman. After Manuelito completed the interview, she told Chee to run a background check on the whole bunch. =Chapters 16‚Äì17= Back in Shiprock, Chee checks in with the station prior to visiting Mrs. Bernally, and Largo remonstrates Chee for the side trip to Chaco Canyon. Ranger Stephen found a woman's body on the trail, and Cordova is conducting an investigation at the canyon. Largo sends Chee back to the canyon to assist Cordova. Tim Morris, a San Juan County deputy is out there. As he walks out to Cordova, he notices unusual shoe tracks and unfiltered cigarette butts. The victim is wearing a sand-cast silver bracelet, with linked hearts. Manuelito visits her mom, tells her about Chaco Canyon and her interview with Slim Jacobs. Darleen shows up drunk, but only stays long enough to get into \\"Stoop Boy\\"'s car. Mama shows Manuelito some magazines and catalogs brought over by Stella Darkwater, because one of mama's rugs that had been auctioned off is in there. The cylinders in the book are double the price of the pots. Manuelito looks through her old books and finds that the cylinder pots were the only ones made in the pueblo, making them more priceless. Largo phones and says she needs to be back at work on Monday. =Chapters 18‚Äì19= Rev. Rodriguez from the Santa Fe hospital calls with an update that Leaphorn has pneumonia. He clears Chee for the sing, but specifies no smoke or loudness out of respect to other patients. Mr. Darkwater agrees to stay with Mrs. Manuelito until Mrs. Darkwater comes home. As they drive to Santa Fe, Manuelito tells Chee about the rugs in the catalog. At the hospital room, they notice Leaphorn has a grayish cast to his skin, and Chee invites Rodriguez to add his own prayers to the sing. When they're finished, Leaphorn awakens and draws two peaks and a valley on a piece of paper. Chee and Manuelito sit with him until sunrise. The next morning, Louisa has finally arrived to relieve them. Chee leaves for the AIRC to take photos of the rugs for Manuelito. Gardener Yazzie sends him to Dr. Davis inside the museum. Chee takes photos of flowers outside, and sends Manuelito a picture with \\"Guess where I am\\" message. But he can't get a signal in the exhibit room, so he can't send or receive messages. Davis is waiting for him with a gun. Davis puts the gun down when she realizes it's Chee, and claims to be nervous about intruders and is there making room for the new acquisition. He asks about the sand-cast silver bracelet with linked hearts on her wrist, and she says it was made by Notah Tsosie, who also made bracelets for her boyfriend Randall and for Friedman. She then begins to rant about Friedman, accusing her of lying about Randall, causing Leaphorn to leave him in the canyon to die. Davis had made fake cylinders for Japan, stashing the real ones at a storage shed in Cuba. When Leaphorn figured out why she had under-valued the cylinders, Davis claims Friedman she shot him to save her business reputation. Louisa has explained her absence as being in Houston being examined for an auto-immune disorder. Cordova calls Manuelito relaying that the dead woman in the canyon was Friedman, and that she was shot with the same calibre bullet as Leaphorn. Chee's requested background check on Davis reveals she was in the National Guard and married to a police officer. Both filed claims of domestic violence against one another, and Davis filed for divorce. He disappeared, and his body was found years later with a bullet in his skull. =Chapters 20‚Äì21= Manuelito begins to worry when Chee does not answer his phone, and Louisa loans her car to help find him. At AIRC, Mark Yazzie says Chee was headed to the museum where Davis was working. The museum is locked, and Davis' car is gone. She runs into Rockwell and asks her to call the campus police who let her into the museum, mentioning that Davis left a half hour earlier. They find Chee's cell phone on the bloody carpet and report to the police that he's been kidnapped. Manuelito arrives at the storage sheds in Cuba, and arms herself with the gun in Louisa's glove box. Identifying herself as Navajo Police at the storage office, she's told a woman with Friedman's ID has gone to the locker. Manuelito tells the office to summon assistance from local police. Inside the locker, Chee is tied to a mattress on his back, while Davis is shouting that he's going to hell. As she's sneaking in, Davis sneaks up behind and tasers Manuelito, and ties her up. It's then Manuelito see the black gloves and bracelet, and knows Davis is the one who shot Leaphorn. Davis rants about renting Jackson's car on the ranch and making a copy of the key. She pours gasoline and sets the ignition to a timer, driving off. Manuelito manages to wriggle free and defuse it. Manuelito frees Chee, and finds a phone to call 911. After rescue by the Cuba police, Cordova arrives to tell her he interviewed Nez, who was so obsessed with rodeo that he wasn't aware the rest was happening, and doesn't know the parties involved. Davis is apprehended by the FBI. When they go back to the hospital, Austin Lee is visiting Leaphorn. Manuelito tells her about taking their cat, and Louisa says it wasn't their cat, just a stray. The Leaphorn Award of Valor is established by the FBI, and Manuelito is the first recipient.

It was formed in 1967 as a result of the razing of the Moroccan Quarter neighborhood in the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War.  Location  The Western Wall Plaza abuts the Western Wall, part of the ancient retaining wall erected by Herod the Great to surround and increase the surface area of the Temple Mount. Apart from the Western Wall to the east, the plaza is bordered on its north side by the Chain of Generations Center, Yeshivat Netiv Aryeh and the Western Wall Tunnel, the latter also affording access to the Muslim Quarter via an additional connection to HaGay Street; by Aish HaTorah, Porat Yosef Yeshiva and the Jewish Quarter via the Yehuda HaLevi Stairs on its west side; and by the Jerusalem Archaeological Park on its south. Access to the plaza from the south is through the Dung Gate. The plaza measures 10,000 square meters and can accommodate up to 400,000 persons per day.Ricca, Simone \\"Heritage, Nationalism and the Shifting Symbolism of the Wailing Wall\\", Open Edition JournalsAbowd, Thomas \\"The Moroccan Quarter: A History of the Present\\", Journal of Palestine studies History The site was the location of the Moroccan Quarter, a neighbourhood founded by El Afdal, son of Saladin, in 1193 for Moroccan Muslims. Access to the Western Wall was limited to a narrow street through the neighbourhood which sometimes caused friction with the local population. In 1887, Baron Rothschild tried unsuccessfully to purchase the neighborhood and resettle its inhabitants in better accommodation elsewhere. Three days after the conquer of the Old City by the Israel Defence Forces in the Six-Day War of 1967, workers guarded by troops proceeded to remove a public lavatory connected to the Western Wall. Immediately afterwards a request went out to the inhabitants of the Moroccan Quarter to evacuate all 135 houses, which along with the Sheikh Eid Mosque were bulldozed to make way for the plaza. This was done in anticipation of the upcoming holiday of Shavuot, during which it was anticipated that many thousands would seek to visit the site. It was also seen as opportunity that would not return due to the chaotic situation during the immediate aftermath of the war. The only surviving relic from the neighborhood was the Mughrabi Bridge, which overlooked the plaza and terminated at the Mughrabi Gate, allowing for access to the Temple Mount above. On 8 October 1990, during the First Intifada, Jewish worshipers in the plaza were pelted with stones hurled by Palestinians attending prayers at the al-Aqsa Mosque, which is situated above the plaza on the Temple Mount. Archaeology Archaeological excvations took place at the northwestern edge of the Western Wall Plaza, c. 100 meters west of the Temple Mount. =Late First Temple period= The archaeologists made numerous Late First Temple period findings characteritic of the Kingdom of Judah in the time between the end of the 8th century BCE and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. These included building remains, some preserved to a height of more than 2 meters. A large quantity of pottery was discovered, including numerous fertility and animal figurines and jar handles with the stamped inscription \\"LMLK\\". Another inscription in ancient Hebrew script reads \\"[belonging] to the king of Hebron\\". A First Temple period seal made of semi-precious stone containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name \\"Netanyahu ben Yaush\\" was found as well. Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the Lachish letters. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars. =Late Roman period= During the same excvations part of the Roman 2nd-century CE Eastern Cardo was uncovered,Israel Antiquities Authority, Building remains from First Temple period exposed west of Temple Mount, 13 March 2008, accessed 11 February 2019 as well as a street segment dated around 130 CE and leading westwrds towards the Temple Mount.  Usage  The plaza is divided by a low wall of Jerusalem stone into two sections. A smaller section immediately adjacent to the Western Wall, and further divided into two sections by a mechitza for opposite genders, serves as an open-air synagogue. It has since become a popular place to hold bar mitzva ceremonies.Koopmans, Ofira (3 May 2016) \\"Fifty Holocaust Survivors Celebrate Bar and Bat Mitzvah Ceremonies at Western Wall\\", Haaretz The larger section immediately west and south of the smaller one acts as a crowd overflow area for the first, but by itself serving as the location for induction ceremonies of IDF soldiers. While the plaza is open to all, the Ministry of Religious Services employs Modesty guards to ensure visitors dress appropriately to the holiness of the site and as a courtesy to worshipers.  Other plans  In August 1967, the architect Yosef Shenberger was called upon to present a design for the plaza, but his idea quickly became the first of many to be torpedoed by planning boards. In 1970, landscape architect Shlomo Aronson proposed digging the eastern plaza down to the street level of the Second Temple period. In 1972, Moshe Safdie was hired to submit a proposal for the plaza. He followed Aharonson's plan somewhat, with a series of terraced plazas descending to the Herodian era street level adjacent to the Western Wall, but his proposal was scrapped as well.MacFarquhar, Larissa (20 January 2003) \\"Truth in Architecture\\", New Yorker In 1976, Irwin Shimron headed the Shimron Committee, which was set up to explore all the options for the development of the plaza. The committee recommended implementing Safdie's proposal, with nothing coming of it to date.

His father was a carpenter and sculptor, progenitor of three generations of artists. Jak≈°eviƒçius' family moved to Panevƒó≈æys in ca 1887 where three youngest Vincentas' siblings were born. Jak≈°eviƒçius married a noble woman in 1897 and had a large family. However, out of seven of his children, three died in infancy or early childhood. Jak≈°eviƒçius' talent for art was recognized at early age.

Jak≈°eviƒçius moved around frequently, but settled in ≈†vƒók≈°na where he built a family house around 1920 on land gifted to him by the Plater family, owners of ≈†vƒók≈°na Manor. Jak≈°eviƒçius worked with his family members, first with his father, then younger brother Benjaminas, and later with sons Silvanas (1900‚Äì1933) and Adomas (1908‚Äì1967). Working as a team, they were able to undertake larger and more complex projects. Jak≈°eviƒçius was a versatile artists as he could design and implement (sculpt, paint, carve) various projects. He is mostly known for his work in decorating churches: pulpits, altars, furniture (benches, ceremonial seats), sculptures, paintings, wall decor, various decorative elements, etc. He also built grottos of Our Lady of Lourdes (in Veivir≈æƒónai, Ablinga, Gardamas, Dembava, Inkakliai) as well as grave monuments. Their major project was the interior decor of Kai≈°iadorys Cathedral. Jak≈°eviƒçius suffered a heart attack while working in Gegu≈æinƒó Church on July 19, 1936. He was buried in Kai≈°iadorys Cemetery. A symbolic bench to commemorate Vincentas Jak≈°eviƒçius' legacy in ≈†vƒók≈°na was unveiled in 2014.

Medieval Church The original church was built sometime during the Middle Ages. It was originally dedicated to the Assumption of Mary however it was changed sometime between 1575 and 1588 and rededicated to the Nativity of Mary, to commemorate the victory of the Great Siege of Malta. The medieval church is mentioned in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's report of 1575. He states that the church was in a state of disrepair. It had no door, lacked in all liturgical necessities, had no rector and had no means of income. At that time the church was cared for by the Cassar family, notably Jacob who seed to it that annual feast is celebrated with a Eucharist and vespers. However this was discontinued on orders of Dusina. The church was mentioned again by Bishop Baldassare Cagliares in 1615 who states that the church had 2 paintings, the main one portraying the Nativity of Mary. In 1636, Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa documents the presence of the same painting as mentioned by his predecessor in 1615. He also adds that the church had a cemetery. The church was deconsecrated by the same bishop in 1656.Spiteri, Hilary (2016). Filial Churches in Malta: Qormi - A Case Study, pp. 97-120. Horizons, Qormi. . Present Church The exact date of when the present church was built is unknown however it was already standing by 1685. The church was built in a rectangular form with two doors, one facing north and the other facing west. The facade is quite plain except for the upper layer of the facade which includes some carving adoring the statue of the Immaculate conception and the adjacent belly tower, the latter being added in 1866 by Michelangelo Sapiano. The south side of the church has 3 upper windows which shed light to the interior of the church and a door way in the middle.\\"Qormi\\", Malta-Canada. Retrieved on 02 February 2018. Interior The church has a total of 5 altars, 4 side ones and the high altar. The main painting depicts the birth of Mary and is the work of Giuseppe Cali, however due to unprofessional restoration works, the original work done by Cali is all but changed. The painting is adorned with numerous carving. The painting replaced an older one dating back to the 17th century, probably the work of Lucas Garnier. The other 4 side altars, 2 on each side, are dedicated to St Roch, St Leonard, St Paul and the Assumption of Mary. The altars were erected as a commemoration of the 4 original churches that stood in the area around the present church, which were demolished in the 16th century.Micallef, G. \\"Il-kappella tal-Vitorja ~ ƒ¶al Qormi ~\\", Kappelli Maltin, Malta.

In 2000, she was hired by Tom Ford to join Gucci, responsible for women's ready-to-wear and accessories, until her departure in 2004. The following year, she became Artistic Director of Pringle of Scotland. In 2007, she received the Scottish Fashion Awards 'Designer of the Year' in the cashmere category. She resigned her position at Pringle of Scotland in 2011. In the same year, she moved to Paris where she became the Artistic Director of Chlo√©. In 2017, Keller was appointed Artistic Director of haute couture and ready-to-wear for women and men at Givenchy. Replacing Riccardo Tisci, she was the first woman to hold the position at the company. She designed the wedding dress which Meghan Markle wore for her wedding to Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, on 19 May 2018. For her second couture show, Waight Keller went through Givenchy's archives, and used modern materials \\"to create something that floats\\". In January 2019, for autumn/winter 19, Waight Keller presented her first standalone menswear collection for Givenchy in Paris. It was an intimate salon show that just consisted of 17 looks with a complete day to evening wardrobe. While future Givenchy ready-to-wear and haute couture shows will remain combined, this means Waight Keller's vision of Givenchy menswear is given its own stage. She left Givenchy on 10 April 2020. = Awards and honors = At the 2018 British Fashion Awards, Keller was presented the British Designer of the Year Womenswear Award by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and actress Rosamund Pike. In 2019, Time magazine included Keller in its annual list of the most influential people of the year. Personal life She is married to Philip Keller, an architect. They have three children.

At the time of the 1838 sale, he was a resident of Terrebonne Parish.  Georgetown University slavery connection  Three weeks prior to the 1838 Georgetown slave sale, Batey traveled north to Washington, D.C. in order to list the Maringouin plantation for sale in The Washington Globe, seeking either payment in slaves or a business partnership with another slaveowner. On June 19, 1838, Rev. Thomas Mulledy, S.J. of Georgetown University agreed to sell 272 slaves to Batey and Henry Johnson. Mulledy finalized the sale of 64 slaves to Batey on November 10 of the same year. The enslaved persons, consisting of men, women, and children, ranged in age from 65 years to 18 months, with over half being children under the age of 18. Following Batey's death in 1852, the majority of the slaves sold in the agreement were purchased along with Batey's estate by John S. Barrow. The plantation was ultimately renamed West Oak and fell into the possession of Emily Woolfolk, the widow of notorious slave trader Austin Woolfolk, in 1856. Many of the enslaved persons working on the plantation at the time of emancipation in 1865 were either victims of the 1838 sale or their descendants.

Biography T√™tes de r√™ve par Boris Nzebo Boris Nzebo primary studies took place in Libreville in Gabon. Arriving in Cameroon, he began by custom painting signs for hairdressing and beauty salons. Then he gave that up to devote himself exclusively to art in the early 2000s. Painting for advertising initially has left its mark on his artistic identity. As a self-taught artist, he trained in Douala with artists Koko Kom√©gn√©, one of the pioneers of contemporary art in Cameroon, Herv√© Yamguen and in workshops organized by Goddy Leye at ArtBakery in Bonendale near Douala, where he did a residency in 2007. During this residency, he mingled with different mediums: video, photo, installation and performance. He also submerged himself into the works of Roy Lichtenstein, Jack Mitchell, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Banksy and Takashi Murakami, whom he particularly likes. At the art space doual‚Äôart, he has assisted artists like Faouzi Laatiris (2007), Ato Malinda , Tracy Rose and Mariela Borello (2009), who added to Nzebo‚Äôs his education in their exchanges, discussions and artistic projects. Subsequently, he says his singular theme is to explore hairstyles in the urban space. In them, he sees the signs of social rank, of the expression of a thought, of cultural belonging. How do we grasp that our environment is not as well groomed as our heads? When our hair is sick we care for it, but we do nothing to combat corruption, the embezzlement of funds, etc. We put so much effort into the treatment of our hair, why can‚Äôt we do the same thing for the problems plaguing us? Boris intersperses transparent profiles of pretty young women with the d√©cor of precarious habitats. In April 2008, he presented his work for the first time at the artists‚Äô square in Douala, with a group of six artists on the theme Lady, She go say I be Lady, inspired by the title of a cult song by Nigerian singer Fela Ramson Kuti about the emancipation of women. In June 2009, he participated in the exhibition Jeunes Regards Urbains at doual‚Äôart, with two other young Cameroonian artists, Landry Mbassi and Man Faust. From 2010, he has participated in many other collective exhibitions, in Cameroon and abroad: in 2010 the Maison Revue Noire (Paris) and Savvy Contemporary (Berlin), in 2011 to the Blach√®re Foundation (Apt), then in 2011 and 2012 at Art Paris Art Fair and the Ifa-Galerie (Berlin). His piece T√™te en l'Hair' was presented at the exhibition 30 ET PRESQUE-SONGES by Jo√´l Andrianomearisoa at doual‚Äôart. His work has been exhibited in two one-man shows, one, In & Out of my head, at the SUD2010 in Douala, and the other, at the off program Vil-Vissages, at the Institut Fran√ßais in Yaound√© in 2011. In April 2013, his canvases were presented by doual‚Äôart at the international fair of contemporary art ART DUBAI, where they were received as a great success. He was noticed by the Jack Bell Gallery of London, which has since offered him a spot at several collective exhibitions at fairs (in London and New York). ReferencesBibliography * Jack Bell Gallery.

She spent her career as a \\"country ship\\", that is trading in the Far East. She made some voyages to England, including at least one, in 1809, under charter to the British East India Company (EIC). She also participated in two military campaigns as a transport. The French Navy captured her in 1804, but she returned to British hands before 1809. A fire in 1817 destroyed her. Career One of Upton Castles owner, Thomas, was also her master in her early years.The Bombay Almanack, and Register, for ... 1798, p.109. However, by 1801 her captain was John Pavin. Around 1800-01 Upton Castles history becomes a little ambiguous. One report has her in the Red Sea as one of the many transports supporting General Baird's expedition to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French from Egypt. However, between 13 April and 1800 and 10 April 1801 she had traveled from Bombay to England, having arrived at Portsmouth on 10 April. She sailed from Gravesend for India on 12 June. In December 1801, Upton Castle sailed, together with Marquis Cornwallis, Betsey (an armed HEIC brig), some other vessels, and 1000 troops to Daman and Diu to persuade the Portuguese governor to resist any French incursion. The expedition was under the command of Captain John Mackellar, of the Royal Navy, whose own vessel, , was not ready for sea.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, p.219. The governor accepted the British reinforcements, which, as it turned out, were not needed. In August 1804 Admiral Linois was cruising in the Indian Ocean in Marengo, together with the frigates and . On the 18th, near the des Neoufs Channel they encountered and captured two British merchant men, and Upton Castle. They were on their way to Bombay when Linois's squadron captured them. Linois described Charlotte as being copper-sheathed, of 650 tons and 16 guns. She was carrying a cargo of rice. Upton Castle he described as being copper-sheathed, of 627 tons, and 14 guns. She was carrying a cargo of wheat and other products from Bengal. He sent both his prizes into Isle de France (Mauritius).Mercure de France (1804), Vol. 20, p.380. She arrived at Ile de France in November, a few days prior to the 14thLloyd's List ‚Ññ4204.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4196. How Charlotte and Upton Castle returned to British hands is currently obscure. Still, Charlotte was again in British hands by 1807, and Upton Castle by 1809. On 23 July 1809 Master Hugh Adams sailed her from Bombay for England. She was at the Cape of Good Hope on 15 September, reached Saint Helena on 7 October, and arrived at The Downs pm 22 December.British Library: Upton Castle.

After training as a mechanical engineer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) and spending some years in America, Huber took over the management of the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, founded by his father Peter Emil Huber-Werdm√ºller, near Zurich, Switzerland. He focussed on solving the difficulties of high power, electrically powered mainline railway systems. In 1904, he electrified the Seebach-Wettingen line with high-voltage alternating current (15,000 volts) at low frequency (15 Hertz). This experimental operation was successful. The first railway to use this system (standard in several European countries today, but with a frequency of 16.7 Hertz) was the Bern‚ÄìL√∂tschberg‚ÄìSimplon railway. In 1925, Emil Huber-Stockar received an honorary doctorate from the ETHZ for his achievements. Family Emil Huber-Stockar was the son of Peter Emil Huber-Werdm√ºller and brother of lawyer and diplomat Max Huber.

of the Workers' Party of North Korea (WPNK) was elected at the 2nd Congress of the WPNK held in March 1948, and consisted of 67 members and 20 deputy members. Upon the merger of the WPNK and the Workers' Party of South Korea in 1949 to form the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), it became the 2nd Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. It served until the 3rd Central Committee of the WPK replaced it at the 3rd Congress of the WPK in 1956. Election The 2nd Central Committee of the Workers' Party of North Korea was elected at the 4th session (30 March) of the 2nd Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea that was held from 27‚Äì30 March 1948. On Ho Ka-i's suggestion, an 11-member committee (composed of five members of the Political Committee and six provincial chairmen) created a list of nominees for the 2nd Central Committee. With the work done, Kim Il-sung presented 63 nominees for full membership, and 20 for candidate membership. According to Kim Il-sung, the committee chose nominees based on four grounds; if they were outstanding cadres, what position in the government, socialist military or party apparatuses they held, if they were new cadres and at last, former reprimanded communists who were concluded to be \\"basically good communists.\\" In the order of ranking given to them the nominees stated their personal history to the congress before they were elected; all the nominees for full membership, with the exception of O Ki-sop, were elected unanimously. Of the 990 delegates present, five voted against his candidacy. Similarly, when electing the nominees for candidate membership, only Kim Tu-yong was not elected unanimously, with one vote against. The 2nd Central Committee was composed in total of 63 new members, 30 of which had served in the 1st Central Committee. Among those not reelected were Choe Yong-dal and Chong Tal-hyon. The position of the partisan faction was strengthened at this congress, with Kang Kon, Kim Kwang-hyop, Kim Kyong-sok and Pak Chum-kol being elected to the Central Committee. Despite this, the largest single group within the 2nd Central Committee were the domestic faction. 1st plenum of the 2nd Central Committee The 1st Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee convened after the 2nd Congress on 30 March. It followed procedure, and elected the 1st Political Committee (composed of seven members), of which the party's Chairman and two deputy chairmen had to serve in. Kim To-bong was reelected to the chairmanship, while Kim Il-sung and Chu Yong-ha were reelected deputy chairmen. All the members of the 1st Political Committee were reelected (the other two being Ho Ka-i and Choi Chang-ik), while two new were added; Kim Chaek, a partisan, and Pak Il-u from the Yanan faction. Formation of the Workers' Party of Korea When the Workers' Party of North Korea merged with the Workers' Party of South Korea on 11 June 1949 to form the Workers' Party of Korea, so did their central committees. The 2nd Central Committee was reinforced with the 31-member central committee of the Southern party. No official announcement was made that this was a new central committee, so it continued to operate as the 2nd Central Committee, now of the unified Workers' Party of Korea. Upon the merger, Kim Il-sung replaced Kim Tu-bong as the Chairman of the Central Committee. The 3rd Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea replaced it at the 3rd Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in 1956.

She tells him that the father he was told was dead, is actually alive and living in Mexico and has asked for his son's help. When he arrives in Mexico he finds that his father has died under mysterious circumstances.

Defects or injuries to these support structures in the pelvic floor leads to pelvic organ prolapse. Anatomical and congenital variations of vaginal support structures can predispose a woman to further dysfunction and prolapse later in life. The urethra is part of the anterior wall of the vagina and damage to the support structures there can lead to incontinence and urinary retention. Pelvic bones The support for the vagina is provided by muscles, membranes, tendons and ligaments. These structures are attached to the hip bones. These bones are the pubis, ilium and ischium. The interior surface of these pelvic bones and their projections and contours are used as attachment sites for the fascia, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support the vagina. These bones are then fuse and attach to the sacrum behind the vagina and anteriorly at the pubic symphysis. Supporting ligaments include the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments. The sacrospinous ligament is unusual in that it is thin and triangular. Pelvic diaphragm The muscular pelvic diaphragm is composed of the bilateral levator ani and coccygeus muscles and these attach to the inner pelvic surface. The iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus make up the levator ani muscle. The muscles pass behind the rectum. The levator ani surrounds the opening which the urethra, rectum and vagina pass. The pubococcygeus muscle is subdivided into the pubourethralis, pubovaginal muscle and the puborectalis muscle. The names describe the attachments of the muscles to the urethra, vagina, anus, and rectum. The names are also called the pubourethralis, pubovaginalis, puboanalis, and puborectalis muscles and sometimes the pubovisceralis since it attaches to the viscera. Urogenital diaphragm (perineal membrane) The urogenital diaphragm, or perineal membrane, is present over the anterior pelvic outlet below the pelvic diaphragm. The exact structure description is controversial. Despite the controversy, MRI imaging studies support the existence of the structure. Superficial and inferior muscles of the perineum (urogenital diaphragm): * ischiocavernosus * bulbocavernosus * superficial transverse perinei The perineum attaches across the gap between the inferior pubic rami bilaterally and the perineal body. This grouping of muscles constricts to close the urogenital openings. The perineum supports and functions as a sphincter at the opening of the vagina. Other structures exist below the perineum that support the anus. Perineal body The bulbospongiosus muscle is highlighted in red. The perineal body is a pyramidal structure of muscle and connective tissue and part of it is located between the anus and vagina. It is a tendon that is formed at the point where the bulbospongiosus muscle, superficial transverse perineal muscle,Also known as transversus perinaei superficialis. and external anal sphincter muscle converge to form this major supportive structure of the pelvis and vagina. Below this, muscles and their fascia converge and become part of the perineal body. The lower vagina is attached to the perineal body by attachments from the pubococcygeus, perineal muscles, and the anal sphincter. The perineal body is made up of smooth muscle, elastic connective tissue fibers, and nerve endings. Above the perineal body are the vagina and the uterus. Damage and resulting weakness of the perineal body changes the length of the vagina and predisposes it to rectocele and enterocele. Endopelvic fascia and connective tissue The internal surface of the ilium showing where the muscles supporting the vagina insert and terminate The vagina is attached to the pelvic walls by endopelvic fascia. The peritoneum is the external layer of skin that covers the fascia. This tissue provides additional support to the pelvic floor. The endopelvic fascia is one continuous sheet of tissue and varies in thickness. It permits some shifting of the pelvic structures. The fascia contains elastic collagen fibers in a 'mesh-like' structure. The fascia also contains fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and vascular vessels. The cardinal ligament supports the apex of the vagina and derives some of its strength from vascular tissue. The endopelvic fascia attaches to the lateral pelvic wall via the arcus tendineus. Anterior vaginal support Not all agree to the amount of supportive tissue or fascia exists in the anterior vaginal wall. The major point of contention is whether the vaginal fascial layer exists. Some texts do not describe a fascial layer. Other sources state that the fascia is present under the urethra which is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall. Despite disagreement, the urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall. Lateral and mid support structures The midsection of the vagina is supported by its lateral attachments to the arcus tendineus. Some describe the pubocervical fascia as extending from the pubic symphysis to the anterior vaginal wall and cervix. Anatomists do not agree on its existence.  Complications  Vaginal support structures can be damaged or weakened during childbirth or pelvic surgery. Other conditions that repeatedly strain or increase pressure in the pelvic area can also compromise support.

It is fiction, but based on the author‚Äôs experiences during the Battle of the Atlantic. It was published in 1956. It was filmed in 1957 with Robert Mitchum and Curd J√ºrgens, but the film made major changes to characters and action, including making the destroyer an American ship. Plot The story covers four days in September 1943. His Majesty‚Äôs Destroyer Hecate is on independent patrol in the South Atlantic, when they detect by radar a distant object. Coming closer, it proves to be a German U-boat running on the surface. U-121 is in fact on its way to rendezvous with a German merchant raider in the South Atlantic Ocean, where they are to collect vital documents concerning British cyphers. The submarine does not detect the approach of the ship for some time, believing the radar contact to be a ‚Äòghost echo‚Äô. When the contact is eventually identified and reported to the commander, Peter von Stolberg, he is furious with the watch officers for the delay. He immediately orders the U-boat to dive. John Murrell, Captain of the Hecate, proves himself a match for the wily U-boat Kapit√§n von Stolberg, a man from an aristocratic background who is not enamoured with the Nazi regime. A prolonged and deadly battle of wits ensues that tests both men and their crews. Each man grows to respect his unseen opponent. Murrell stalks the U-boat and subjects von Stolberg and his crew to multiple depth charge attacks. In the end, von Stolberg takes advantage of a moment of vulnerability in Murrell's pattern of attacks and succeeds in torpedoing the destroyer. The submarine, also badly damaged and critically short of air and battery power, is forced to the surface, and a gun battle takes place. The destroyer, although armour-plated, is badly damaged; she loses steam and therefore all power. Many sailors are killed or wounded. But they manage to send off a radio message on an emergency short-range transmitter. Eventually, both commanders order Abandon Ship, and the survivors pile into lifeboats. Murrell and von Stolberg find themselves in the same lifeboat. Murrell assumes that von Stolberg will now formally surrender, but in fact, the latter demands that Murrell surrenders, believing that the German ship they are to rendezvous with is very close. The two commanders, now angry, engage in fisticuffs. von Stolberg is nearly knocked into the sea by a punch from Murrell and the latter is struck with a wooden oar by an enraged young German sailor. As all this is going on, HMS Marabout arrives to take off the survivors. Her Captain cheerfully reports that her two companion ships are busily engaged in sinking the German raider. Background The novel is divided into five major sections, which reflect the nature of the conflict between the U-boat and the destroyer: Radar Sparring, ASDIC Duel, Gun Battle, Cold Steel, Fisticuffs. In an introductory note, the author points out that the story is fictional; as far as he is aware, no British destroyer ever fought a single-ship action against a U-boat. He further explains that, in such an action, the odds are rather more in favour of the submarine, which has more chances of sinking her adversary by torpedo and deck gun, whilst presenting a smaller target for the destroyer. He further explains that an early attempt by the ship to ram the submarine was not carried out, due to the thin metal used to plate the ship; this would have caused major damage to the latter and little damage to the U-boat.

Personal life  Schrijver was the second son of naval captain Philips Schrijver and Cornelia Tijloos, a daughter of naval captain Cornelis Tijloos. Philips was the son of the Amsterdam postmaster at the time, so not a real \\"patrician\\", and this hindered his career when he had to compete for advancement with several members of the Dutch nobility. After having been passed over for promotion to admiral several times (despite having had a stellar career during the War of the Spanish Succession in the battles of Cadiz, Vigo Bay, Malaga, and Gibraltar) he resigned his commission in disgust in 1710. Despite his modest ancestry he had amassed a respectable fortune due to wise investments: 200,000 guilders at his death.Bruijn, p. 112. As one of the five children inheriting this fortune in 1711, Cornelis was therefore relatively wealthy. He married Maria le Plat in 1728, and had three daughters with her. Again through frugality and wise investments she was able to bequeath the sum of 470,000 guilders to her two surviving daughters at her death in 1784.Bruijn, p. 165.  Career  Schrijver joined his father‚Äîa captain since 1690‚Äîaboard his ships from age 10 as a cabin boy. He received his commission as a naval lieutenant in 1702, and was promoted to captain on 17 January 1711.Nationaal Archief, Den Haag, Nummer toegang: 1.01.02, inventarisnummer: 12281, folionummer: 151 verso He had fought in the same battles as his father. He was promoted to vice-admiral in the Admiralty of Amsterdam in 1738, and to lieutenant-admiral in the same admiralty in 1748.NNBW, p. 705 = Gunboat diplomacy = After the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, the Dutch Republic entered a long period of peace, during which the navy was not involved in any major conflicts, and mostly operated together with the Royal Navy in a subordinate role, whenever the flag had to be shown. At the same time, the Dutch government was hard pressed for money, due to the fact that the service of the national debt consumed almost all tax revenues, and taxation was already at a level that was considered \\"unsupportable.\\" There was therefore no financing available for adequate maintenance of the fleet, let alone naval expansion. The Dutch navy therefore entered a period of neglect.Hoving & Lemmers, p. 14. The only area in which the Dutch Republic was forced willy-nilly to conduct an independent diplomatic policy was that of the relationships with the so-called Barbary pirates, although they are better considered privateers conducting a legitimate commerce raiding in the context of properly declared wars. The Barbary Coast comprised a number of independently-operating principalities, among which the Regency of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, and the Moroccan Empire, the first three nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, but acting independently. European powers like the Dutch Republic were regularly at war with some, if not all, of these entities, and during those wars privateers based in these \\"rogue states\\" freely preyed on their shipping and their crews. The ships were legitimately (under international law of the day) made prizes, and the crew members ended up as slaves. The European powers had two major options: station naval patrols in the area to protect their shipping from these depredations, or come to an accommodation with the local rulers the Dey of Algiers, and the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli, or the Emperor of Morocco. The latter was the least expensive in the long run. The maintenance of a good relationship usually encompassed an annual tribute to the ruler, in exchange for which that ruler tried to hold back his subjects from capturing the shipping under the flag of the Republic. Unfortunately, the periods during which the peace was so maintained were short, and the relationship had to be continually monitored, and if necessary, repaired. This usually worked best when the envoys did not come empty handed, but brought along hard money for bribes, and an adequate naval presence for further persuasion. Schrijver was several times sent out in the early 1730s, to act as a gunboat diplomat at the head of a Dutch squadron of frigates. Before that he had in 1724 captured and destroyed several Algerian and Moroccan privateers as captain of an individually operating frigate. One of those privateers was the former Dutch ship Oranjeboom(36) under Algerian flag (master Ra√Øs Ben Taback). She had a crew of 250 among whom 26 Christian slaves, who were released.Le Clerc. P., Geschiedenissen der Vereenigde Nederlanden, sedert den aanvang des jaars 1714 tot aan den dood van zyne doorluchtige Hoogheid den Heere Prinse van Oranje en Nassau, Erfstadhouder der Unie, in den jaare 1751 (1753), p. 129. In 1729, he was captain-commodore of a cruising squadron of six frigates that first managed to liberate two ships of the Dutch East India Company, that had been captured in peacetime by Algerian privateers. These ships, the Purmerlust and Ter Horst of the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC, did not possess passes provided by an Algerian Consul, and were therefore initially declared lawful prizes. Schrijver (whose squadron lay in the roadstead of Algiers at the time they were brought in) managed to convince the Dey that these ships were the property of the Dutch state and therefore did not need passes. He negotiated an agreement under which the ships were released in exchange for half of the bullion they were transporting to the Dutch East Indies: a value of 137,000 guilders.Le Clerc, op.cit., p. 215. In 1731, he was again put in command of a squadron of frigates that was formally sent out to Algiers to convey the annual tribute to the Dey. This mission was very successful: he managed to obtain a few concessions on the existing peace treaty with Algiers, safeguarding the position of VOC ships.Van der Aa, pp. 501‚Äì502. At both occasions Schrijver managed to negotiate the ransom of a large number of enslaved Dutch crew members.Vander Aa, p. 502. Though this was technically \\"slave trading\\" it will be clear that the object of the transaction was to free the prisoners, and should not be held against him. As a matter of fact, due to the frequency of enslavement of Dutch sailors by Barbary pirates, there existed so-called slave treasuries in the Dutch Republic that acted as a form of kidnap and ransom insurance. Schrijver used money provided by these treasuries to finance the ransoming.Cf. the Slavenkas Zierikzee Those that still belonged to the Algerian state, and therefore could be ransomed directly, brought 1,828 guilders for officers, surgeons, mates, and carpenters. Non-Dutch prisoners, taken in Dutch ships, were cheaper. The Algerians let them go for 408 guilders each.Le Clerc, op.cit. pp. 214‚Äì215 = Naval construction = During his cruise to the Barbary Coast in 1724, Schrijver commanded the frigate Wageningen. This ship was a fortunate exception to the rule that Dutch ships were too slow to successfully pursue and capture the usually more nimble and speedy corsairs. As a matter of fact, Wageningen was the only ship in the squadron that had any success in capturing corsairs. This was a constant worry for Schrijver and other Dutch captains, who usually were forced to follow in the wake of the ships of foreign navies. Schrijver and others were of the opinion that the relatively unimpressive performance of Dutch naval ships was due to the backwardness of the admiralty shipyards that built most of the Dutch naval ships in both design methods and construction methods. Schrijver made his opinion known in loud and undiplomatic tones, and his criticisms endeared him to one of the members of the Amsterdam Admiralty Board, Lubbert Adolph Torck who shared his negative opinions. In 1726, Torck ordered Schrijver to recruit one or more British shipwrights to take over as superintendent of the Amsterdam Admiralty shipyard, in hopes that this might help introduce the \\"British\\" methods of ship-design and construction in the Dutch Republic. This recruitment effort failed due to the opposition of the British government, but in 1727, three British shipwrights were persuaded to come to Amsterdam: Thomas Davis, Charles Bentham, and John May. One of the \\"advanced\\" techniques the British recruits were to introduce was the use of engineering drawings and of \\"dockyard models\\".Hoving & Lemmers, pp. 28‚Äì35. As one of his first ships, built according to the \\"new, British\\" methods, Davis designed the ship of the line Provincie van Utregt in 1728. Schrijver was the first captain assigned the command of this ship and he sailed her on her maiden voyage in 1729 to Plymouth, where it became part of a joint Anglo-Dutch squadron. In Plymouth, the ship was tested against the fastest British ship of the line of the time, , in a four-day regatta under various circumstances and the contest ended undecided, Utregt being faster \\"before the wind\\", and Monmouth faster in close-hauled courses. But during the voyage to Plymouth Schrijver discovered signs of sabotage: the scuppers were blocked with shipyard debris, apparently in an attempt to make the ship founder during a storm. This must have been done by the shipyard personnel in an apparent attempt to make the \\"new methods\\" look bad; at least that was Schrijver's opinion at the time. Davis was soon driven out by the criticism of Dutch rivals and succeeded as superintendent of the Amsterdam shipyard by Bentam, who immediately was championed in future conflicts by Schrijver.Hoving & Lemmens, pp. 16‚Äì17. During his lifetime the rivalry between the British designers in the Amsterdam admiralty shipyard‚Äîchampioned by Schrijver‚Äîand the Dutch superintendents of the other admiralty yards became a heated controversy. Schrijver was by then a respected lieutenant-admiral who had a close political relationship with the new stadtholder and Admiraal Generaal of all the Dutch provinces, William IV, Prince of Orange, who came to power at the end of the Second Stadtholderless Period, and acted as his adviser in a number of reforms of the Dutch navy that remained still-born due to obstruction of the Dutch shipwrights and the untimely death of William in 1751. Schrijver gave vent to his frustrations with the state of Dutch naval construction in an article in the periodical Boekzael der geleerde waerelt, published in 1755, in which he proposed to translate the French and British naval regulations, and also several foreign technical works on the theory of naval construction. This article was formulated in such confrontational terms that it caused a furore in Dutch naval circles. Several shipwrights from other admiralty shipyards published polemical pamphlets, in which they showed‚Äîfor the first time, because previously they had considered this proprietary information‚Äîthat they too used technical drawings and even towing experiments in ship model basins to improve the hydrodynamic characteristics of ships.Hoving & Lemmens, pp. 18‚Äì20. In other words, the Dutch shipbuilders were not as \\"backward\\" as Schrijver‚Äîand historians like Johannes Cornelis de Jonge‚Äîhave asserted. The \\"bad\\" performance of Dutch ships was in reality a consequence of a basic constraint on Dutch ship design: the draft could not go over certain depths, because the shallowness‚Äîin the days before large scale dredging‚Äîof the Dutch coastal and river waterways made that impossible. Ingenious constructions like ship camels brought only limited relief. As the Dutch still needed to construct big ships of the line to compete with foreign navies, they had to use broad and flat- bottomed designs, and these were hydro-dynamically penalized. No amount of foreign technical innovation could remedy that. Like the other admiralty shipyards, the Amsterdam yard, under British management, could not evade this restriction.Hoving & Lemmens, pp. 146‚Äì157.  Other controversies  Schrijver had, to put it mildly, a \\"difficult character\\" and a sharp tongue and pen, which did not make him popular among his colleagues, and especially his \\"enemies.\\" His polemical approach often hindered him more in his attempts to promote reforms, however well-intentioned and thought-out they may have been, than that it helped him achieve his goals. De Jonge, from whose work this appreciation is taken, spends a page and a half excoriating Schrijver's character flaws; de Jonge, pp. 108‚Äì110. In his final years he published a number of polemical works: * Omstandige brief of memorie aan Z.D.H. den Prins van Oranje ... over de redenen van het groote verval van 's Lands zeemagt, a memorandum about the decline of the contemporary Dutch navy for stadtholder William in 1747 * Twee voorname articulen, om te dienen tot redres in de vervallen zeedienst van de republiek en particulier in 'slands zeemagt, tot maintien van de goede ordres, a memorandum on reform of the articles of war for the navy, sent in 1755 to Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange * Memorie betreffende een Tafereel van de cruelle behandeling, in which he complained about grievances his grandfather Cornelis Tijloos, his father Philips Schrijver and he himself had about the way they were treated) published in 1756 * Verdediging van C.

(in Japanese) (in Japanese) (in Japanese) Scientific objectives Binary black holes (BBHs) are believed to be formed during the merger and growth of galaxies. Although several binary blackhole candidates have been identified, they have yet to be verified by long-term observations. In order to ascertain that an object is a BBH, periodical luminosity change in X-ray wavelength must be detected. However, continuous observation of BBHs by large X-ray telescopes is difficult as such spacecraft are used by many groups and have numerous observation targets. Since microsatellites have comparatively low-cost, flexibility, and can fly more often than large spacecrafts, they can conduct unique studies where risks are associated. As ORBIS is dedicated to study BBHs, it can conduct continuous observation of such bodies. The scientific goals of the microsatellite is to uncover the growth process of black holes and galaxies, and to and contribute to gravitational-wave astronomy. Some simulations have concluded that after crossing a certain distance, the energy dissipation of two approaching black holes ceases, result in them not getting closer any further. However, the merger of black holes is expected to occur during the collision of galaxies. This unsolved problem is known as the final parsec problem. By finding and studying black holes less than 1 pc apart, ORBIS aims to resolve this issue.

The model further posits that employers discriminate against minority applicants to avoid interacting with them, regardless of the applicant's productivity, and that employers are willing to pay a financial penalty to do so. It is one of the two leading theoretical explanations for labor market discrimination, the other being statistical discrimination. The taste-based model further supposes that employers' preference for employees of certain groups is unrelated to their preference for more productive employees. According to this model, employees that are members of a group that is discriminated against may have to work harder for the same wage or accept a lower wage for the same work as other employees. Taste-based discrimination can be observed from the side of employers, customers or co-workers. In the case of an employer's \\"taste for discrimination\\", the employer aims to avoid non-monetary costs and does so often based on his own preferences. In the case of co-workers and customers, they often don't want to interact with people belonging to a minority group, which the employer considers during the hiring process. History The taste-based discrimination model was first proposed by Gary Becker in 1957 in his book The economics of discrimination. Becker argued that the reasons for such discrimination should be determined by psychologists and sociologists, not by economists, and he sought only to determine the consequences of discrimination as manifested in economic decision-making. The early version of this model was criticized for failing to explain the continued existence of discriminating firms, because it predicts that these firms will be less profitable than their non-discriminating counterparts. Nevertheless, the taste-based model has since become the predominant economic explanation for discriminatory practices. Distinguishing taste-based and statistical discrimination It is difficult for economists to distinguish between taste-based and statistical discrimination. A paper in 2008 studied the effect World War I had on German Americans as traders at the New York Stock Exchange. The German Americans were discriminated against as a consequence of the war and were considered an ethnic minority, creating opportunity for taste-based discrimination in the trade market. The results showed that the discrimination indeed had an effect on the German Americans in the NYSE, where the rates of their rejection doubled. However, the discrimination had no effects on the price of NYSE seats. In 2014, researchers from the Center for Economic and Policy Research conducted a study of the Fantasy Premier League, which is an online game where players choose their 15 players from 20 Premier League teams. Since this is a virtual game, the players are able to discriminate without real life consequences. There are no real customers and the \\"workers\\" (players) do not interact. This allowed the research team to control for statistical discrimination, because all information about potential employees' productivity is publicly disclosed. The results showed that the research subjects were choosing players based on their performance, which is measured in points, and the race of the players did not play a role. The research was done over a period of three years and no evidence of taste-based discrimination was found.

Nostalgia drives her subject matter, Still Life being her main focus. Farrell considers her Still Life paintings to be simple meditations on people and places she has known - there is a sense of the portrait in everything that she paints. Farrell's subjects are the common, everyday tools of our day to day existence - things that many of us are able to project our own experiences onto. Farrell says: \\"Homely is how I would describe most of my subjects. It‚Äôs how I feel when I look at my paintings, whether I am connecting to something, someone, or some time. A clear line is drawn to people who are closest to me. My cookbook series is an homage to my mother‚Ä¶memories of her baking pies, roasting roasts ‚Äì memories of her standing behind the counter of our family diner, lipstick on cigarettes and coffee cups. Chairs, bowls, clocks‚Ä¶other domestic tools‚Ä¶functional things that now hold special meaning, allowing us to reach back for a moment and maybe experience a bit of the past.\\" Holly Farrell - 2017. Farrell's work has been exhibited in Canada, the U.S., England, and Japan. Her paintings are in corporate and private collections throughout North America, Europe, Australia and Japan including: BMO, Canada; William Louis-Dreyfus Family Collection (G√©rard Louis-Dreyfus), U.S.A., Sony Music, Japan, TD Bank Group, and OPAM (Oita Prefectural Museum of Art), Japan. She lives with her husband and three cats in Toronto, Ontario. Painting Farrell began to paint at 30. She exhibited her first paintings at the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition in 1992. Between 1992 and 2000 she focussed on honing her drawing and painting skills, while building a following in Toronto. By 2005 Farrell had gained attention by such publications as Toronto Life, The Toronto Star, and the Globe And Mail. The Star's Peter Goddard had this to say about Farrell's 2003 show: \\"Yet her works share with his (Morandi's) sense of discovery, as if you've never seen what you're seeing as quite as memorable as they now seem. It's as if the artists added something unseen to their mass. Gravity's pull on them feels much greater than it should be. Like Morandi's, Farrell's work denies any critical attempt to mine them for symbolic content. If they're about childhood, no analysts allowed. Same too, with the objects she uses - or the objects she comes upon. Her paintings act as spies, seemingly catching their subject unprepared.  Peter Goddard, 2003. With the advent of the internet Farrell expanded her reach to connect with galleries and clients in the U.S. She participated in Folk Fest Art Fair in Atlanta Georgia where she connected with Karen Light, owner of Garde Rail Gallery. Light exhibited Farrell's work in shows at Garde Rail Gallery in Seattle, garnering reviews from the Seattle Post Intelligencer as well as Seattle Weekly. Light was also instrumental in introducing Farrell's paintings to the New York Outsider Art Fair. Painting of Chair, by Holly Farrell. 2003. Not always comfortable with the label of 'outsider', Farrell prefers 'self-taught' or naive art. Her technique she learned through trial and error - culled from years of practise - employing both acrylics and oils, and always trusting to instinct. Farrell says she is not always certain why she paints what she paints. Sometimes the connection to a subject seems a vague shadow...but knows at the end of painting, she will have found the reason. In 2016 Farrell was interviewed for an article on self- taught artists by Danielle Bravado of Art Brut online magazine. She was asked how she felt about being an 'outsider artist'. She responded by explaining: \\"In my mind, the outsider artist starts out creating with no or few skills or tools and somehow finds a way to pull something together, a way to express how they feel - it's like suddenly you can speak. I feel that way when I work. There wasn't much of a dialogue in my life before I began to paint. I was floundering. Traditionally trained artists, in my mind, start out with a bigger skill set. The real education, self-taught, outsider, traditional, or otherwise, comes in the making of art. I think that formally trained artists have a better sense of intention...they go into art school because they want to be artists, they have some kind of expectation, confidence.\\" Though Farrell primarily focusses on Still Life, she has also occasionally delved into the realms of Portraiture and Landscape painting.

Biography Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn came from the South Tyrol noble family Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn. His parents were Franz von Liechtenstein- Kastelkorn, Imperial Privy Councillor, and Katharina b. Freiin Pavlovska. He studied philosophy and law in Brno and Olm√ºtz. After he had decided on a spiritual career, he received in 1709 a canon in Olm√ºtz and studied from 1709 to 1712 at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, where he acquired a theological doctorate. After being ordained a priest in Rome in 1713, he worked for several years in the episcopal chancery in Olomouc and was at the same time an archdeacon in Troppau. In 1717 he was, after the renunciation of his brother, canon in Salzburg, where he soon rose to consistory president. =Bishop of Seckau= On 17 January 1728, Pope Benedict XIII appointed Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn as Bishop of the Salzburg Diocese of Graz-Seckau (Eigenbistum); he succeeded Leopold Anton von Firmian, who became archbishop of Salzburg. The episcopal ordination took place on 14 March 1728. At the same time he became Salzburg Vicar General for Styria and the Neust√§dter district. =Bishop of Olm√ºtz= After the death of Wolfgang Hannibal von Schrattenbach, Bishop of Olm√ºtz, the cathedral chapter chose Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein- Kastelkorn as his successor on 11 October 1738. The papal confirmation of the election took place on 26 January 1739. During his tenure, he donated to the college in Wei√üwasser. In order to procure work for the craftsmen, he arranged extensive work after the Prussian occupation of Olm√ºtz in 1742 at the cathedral and at the prince-bishop's residence. On 12 May 1743, he crowned Maria Theresa of Austria in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral as Queen of Bohemia. The pontifical garment he wore at this ceremony is now in the treasury of Saint Wenceslas Cathedral in Olm√ºtz. =Archbishop of Salzburg= After the death of Salzburg's Prince-Bishop Leopold Anton von Firmian, the cathedral chapter there chose Jakob Ernst von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn as his successor on 13 January 1745. Due to the high debts of the archbishopric, his short reign was overshadowed by disputes with the cathedral chapter. After his death he was buried in the crypt of the Salzburg Cathedral.

Greyhound came alongside Mars and fired a broadside at close quarters which caused great loss of life: Mars was able to set sail during the engagement between Greyhound and Bellone. Terror tried to stop Le Mars but a volley from Bellone disabled her. Mars was then led by Bellone out to a bay at the head of Loch nan Uamh, where Mars started her repairs, and Bellone engaged the British ships. Spectators lined the shores watching the battle and where fired upon by Greyhound to prevent the carrying away of the gold and cargo that had been unloaded by the French ships.

Raised in North Carolina during March 1862, it initially served in the eastern part of the state. The regiment moved north and joined the Army of Northern Virginia, guarding rail junctions during the Battle of Gettysburg. For the rest of the war, the regiment served in the North Carolina brigade successively commanded by Pettigrew, Kirkland, and MacRae. It subsequently fought in the Bristoe Campaign, the Wilderness campaign, and the Siege of Petersburg. In the northern hemisphere spring of 1865 it served with the Army of Northern Virginia in the retreat from Richmond and surrendered at the conclusion of the Appomattox Campaign on 9 April.  History  Officers of the 44th North Carolina: Lieutenant Colonel Tazewell F. Hargrove (center), Captains Elkanah E. Lyon of Co A (top left), R.C. Brown of Co B (top right), Robert Bingham of Co G (bottom right), Thomas Hill Norwood of Co H (bottom left) The 44th North Carolina Infantry was organized on 28 March 1862 at Camp Magnum, near Raleigh, North Carolina, under the command of elected Colonel George B. Singletary. It included ten companies, which enlisted between January and March and were mustered in on 3 April. Company A (Granville Regulators) included men from Granville County, Company B men from Edgecombe County, Companies C and D (Pitt Regulators) men from Pitt County, Company E (Turtle Paws) men from Chatham County, Company F (Trojan Regulators) men from Montgomery County, Company G men from Orange and Alamance Counties, Company H (Montgomery Guards) men from Montgomery County, Company I (Eastern Tigers) men from Pitt and Craven Counties, and Company K (Franklin Guides to Freedom) men from Franklin County. The men of the regiment hailed from the eastern part of North Carolina. The regiment initially served with the Department of North Carolina, being ordered to Tarboro on 19 May. It then moved to Greenville in eastern North Carolina, participating in outpost and picket duty against Burnside's North Carolina Expedition. On 5 June the regiment fought in the Battle of Tranter's Creek, during which Singletary was killed. His brother, Thomas C. Singletary, was elected Colonel on 28 June. The regiment was sent north to Virginia, where it joined Pettigrew's Brigade, serving with the Army of Northern Virginia alongside the 11th, 26th, 47th, and 52nd North Carolina Regiments. While the rest of Pettigrew's brigade moved on to Gettysburg, where it fought in Pickett's Charge, the regiment was left behind at Hanover Junction to guard the rail line there, securing the army's communications to Richmond. Singletary guarded the junction with two companies, while Major Charles M. Stedman with four companies was posted north of the junction. The remaining four companies, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Tazewell L. Hargrove, were each assigned to guard a bridge of the Fredericksburg and Central Railroads across the South Anna and Little Rivers. Hargrove remained with Company A at the Central Railroad bridge over the South Anna, the most threatened by Union attack. The 44th subsequently served with Kirkland's Brigade and MacRae's Brigade, fighting in the Bristoe Campaign. During the Battle of Bristoe Station, part of the Bristoe Campaign, the regiment reported losses of 23 killed and 63 wounded. It suffered heavy casualties during the Battle of the Wilderness before fighting in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and the Battle of Cold Harbor during the Wilderness campaign. From late 1864 to the northern hemisphere spring of 1865, the regiment fought in the Siege of Petersburg south of the James River, in which it again suffered heavy casualties. In late March 1865, the regiment retreated from Richmond with the rest of the army during the Appomattox Campaign. On 9 April, it surrendered with the rest of the army at Appomattox, mustering only eight officers and 74 men. Its commanders included Colonels G.B. Singeltary and T.C.

Born in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, Yan began studying painting in 1909, founded the Suzhou Art Academy along with Zhu Shijie in 1922 and went to Paris in 1929, enrolling in the L'Ecole Superieure Nationale des Beaux Arts, making him, along with Xu Beihong and Sanyu, one of the earliest Chinese artists to study abroad in France. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of \\"The Four Great Academy Presidents\\".  Career = Early life = Snow (1950) Yan Wenliang Oil on Canvas 89 x 122cm Yan Wenliang founded the Suzhou Art Academy with his friend Zhu Shijie in 1922. Yan studied painting in Paris between 1929 and 1931, alongside other Chinese painters such as Fang Ganmin, his travels coinciding with those of Liu Haisu, and painted in the Impressionist style. While in Europe, Yan assembled a collection of plaster casts of famous European sculptures, which totalled as many as 500 pieces, which he shipped home to be used at the Academy. = Post-1949 China = In 1952, as part of a national reorganization of art schools by the Chinese Communist Party, both Shanghai Art Academy and Suzhou Art Academy were moved out of Shanghai and formed the East China Arts Academy in Wuxi. Yan Wenliang was transferred to the post of vice-director of the East China campus of CAFA, a job that Yan initially refused. Yan was ultimately persuaded by Boshan, a professor of the East China Cultural Department, appealing to Yan's ideals as an educator. Yan accepted the Hangzhou position to teach the ideologically unproblematic subjects of perspective and color theory. In 1957, Yan published a book on colour theory. Salon de 1929 In the lively art scene of Shanghai, many painters worked in the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist styles taught before 1949 at the Suzhou Art Academy and the Shanghai Art Academy. The unofficial Shanghai art scene was dominated by the styles of Yan Wenliang and Liu Haisu, which trend persisted even during the later years of the Cultural Revolution. = Cultural Revolution = One surprising result of Yan's influence was the development of an underground landscape painting movement in Shanghai during the early 1970s, at the height of the Cultural Revolution's promotion of pro-government and Realist figure painting. After being tried by the Red Guards for some time, Yan Wenliang was liberated from the investigatory incarceration of the Cultural Revolution authorities in 1969 and spent time painting by himself for the rest of his years. = Late life and legacy = Yan Wenliang attracted many young followers when it was discovered that he painted in the park and that he sometimes gave technical pointers to young artists who worked nearby. He welcomed the enthusiastic young artists to his apartment, where he showed them the paintings that he had painted in France and Italy 45 years before. The result of his kindness was that Romantic and Impressionist styles of early 20th century France became integrated into a new regional Shanghai style. It was also practiced and inherited by his students from the Suzhou Art Academy, and many self-taught artists of the 'lost generation', those born in the 1950s who had been denied formal schooling by the Cultural Revolution. Yan Wenliang died in 1988 at the age of 94. Among the pioneers of Chinese modern art, four men earned the title of \\"The Four Great Academy Presidents\\": Lin Fengmian, Xu Beihong, Liu Haisu, and Yan Wenliang. These artists were revered in the early Republican Era due to their effective stewardship of the Hangzhou National School of Fine Art, the Art Department of Central University, the Shanghai Academy of Arts, and the Soochow College of Art respectively. Of the four Presidents, Yan Wenliang's surviving works are the fewest, and those with clear provenance are even rarer.  Works  The misty pagoda under the cold moon (1960) Yan Wenliang Oil on Canvas 47.5 x 29cm Yan Wenliang's oil paintings of landscapes are an extension and expansion of Chinese traditional landscape painting. His lifelong study of perspective and colour were an important chapter in the modernization and internationalization of Chinese art. Kitchen (Âé®Êàø) (1920) is one of Yan's best-known works. A panoramic depiction of an old-fashioned Jiangnan kitchen scene, its lifelike imagery and balanced colors reflect the artist's grasp of perspective, light and shade. The fifteen years between 1950 and 1965 were Yan Wenliang's most prolific period in terms of artwork and experimentation. A stable academic environment allowed him ample time to paint. It was during this period that Yan's style became fully honed. Important works of during period include Dawn of the Pujiang River (Êµ¶Ê±üÂ§úËà™) (1953) and The Countryside Late at Night ((Ê∑±Â§ú‰πãÂ∏ÇÈÉä) 1954). Another notable work is Southern Lake (ÂçóÊπñ) (1964), which depicts the \\"red boat on the Southern Lake\\", the allegorical birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party. It is currently in the collection of the National Art Museum of China in Beijing. Yan's later period began with his return to Shanghai in 1969, when he produced works such as Ode of Our Country (1982).  Legacy  Serving as the first president of Suzhou Art School, Yan became on par in fame with Xu Beihong (president of Beijing's National Art School), Liu Haisu (president the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts), and Ling Feng-mien (president of the National Hangzhou School of Arts). These artists had been labelled by painter Peng Xunqin as the Republic of China's four greatest in their position, and all four were spearheads of the national modern art movement of the time. The other three masters became active in the areas of oil and Chinese ink painting. Yan Wenliang's whole career, in contrast, was spent on exploring the depths of oil painting, which led him to discovering a unique style and philosophy of painting on his own, and allowed him to combine in his creative processes the Western language of oil painting with Eastern values and aesthetics. Art critic Shang Hui once said, 'Yan Wenliang was one of the very few Chinese artists to have a truly firm comprehension of impressionism while at the same time being a Courbet-influenced Europe-taught realist oil painter. In his artistic language, he was closer to Chinese aesthetics, but when compared with the other pioneers of modern Chinese art, Yan's style sported a great number of differences among many similarities.'

That same year CLC also appeared for the first time in the national rankings, coming in ninth. The following year, 1969, nicknamed ‚ÄúYear of the Warriors,‚Äù Robbie Robison set an NAIA record with seventeen field goals, which moved the team up to seventh place in the national ratings. From an 8-1-1 record in 1970, the team moved into their greatest season the following year, when the team captured the national championship beating both Westminster College and Montana Tech in the playoffs. A celebration was held at the Hollywood Palladium in conjunction with the Dallas Cowboys, an NFL team which trained at CLC, who won the Super Bowl in January 1972. After having won the championship, coach Shoup was named NAIA Coach of the Year and also Lutheran Coach of the Year.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to six small, yellowish green or reddish flowers with a red labellum. It grows in coastal heath and scrub and is currently known only from a single population of about twelve plants near Coles Bay. Description Genoplesium firthii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Up to six yellowish green or reddish flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall and much taller than the leaf. The flowers lean downwards and are about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with a small gland on the tip. The lateral sepals turn downwards, are about long, wide and spread apart from each other. They also have a small gland on the tip. The petals are about long and wide with a pointed tip and hairless edges. The labellum is red, egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide, with irregular edges and a pointed tip. There is a callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from January to March. Taxonomy and naming Firth's midge orchid was first formally described in 1971 by Leonard Cady who gave it the name Prasophyllum firthii from a specimen collected near Bicheno. The description was published in The Orchadian. In 1989, David Jones changed the name to Genoplesium firthii and in 2005 changed the name again to Corunastylis firthii. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium firthii grows on a roadside near Coles Bay. Conservation Firth's midge orchid is only known from a single population containing about twelve plants. It was formerly also known to occur at Friendly Beaches Reserve but has not been seen there since 1973. The species is classified as Endangered under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are road maintenance, trampling by people and cars, by weed invasion and inappropriate fire regimes.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the SS and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union, as part of Police Regiment South. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen and the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations. Background and formation The German Order Police (uniformed police) was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. During the prewar period, SS chief Heinrich Himmler and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to Wehrmacht's security divisions. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Along with Police Battalion 45 and 303, Police Battalion 314 was assigned to Police Regiment South. Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905‚Äì1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti-semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The regiment was placed under the command of Hermann Franz, a career policeman who had previously served in the Order Police in the occupied Poland. When the regiment crossed the German-Soviet border, it came under the control of Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group South in Ukraine. Operational history Upon formation, while still in occupied Poland, Police Battalion 314 participated in the round-ups of Polish civilians for deportation to slave labour to Germany. Its actions quickly escalated to genocide while in the occupied Soviet Union. On 22 July, the battalion killed 214 Jews in a settlement near Kovel, including entire families. The orders came down from the regimental commander, who had referred to an order from Heinrich Himmler. During the summer months, the battalion took part in joint actions with the 1st SS Infantry Brigade of the Waffen-SS, both providing support and undertaking independent killings. The brigade's report of 19 August to the Command Staff Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (SS operational staff set up for the invasion) noted that the battalion executed 25 Jews and 16 Ukrainians. It also referred to the unit's killing of 322 Jews in the town of Slavuta. The 21 August report detailed the battalion's killing of 367 Jews in a \\"cleansing action\\" while securing German supply lines, while the 22 August report noted that the unit executed 28 Ukrainians on charges of \\"arson\\". In the last week of August, the battalion killed a further 294 Jews. During the month, the unit killed at least 1,689 people in seven separate operations. During the massacre at Babi Yar, all three battalions of the regiment took part. The police cordoned off the area, while Sondercommando 4a and a platoon of Waffen-SS men did the shooting. The killing activities of both the Einsatzgruppen detachments and the Police Regiment South slowed down the farther the Wehrmacht advanced, as more Jews were able to escape east and the density of the pre-war Jewish population was lower in Eastern Ukraine. Nonetheless, the murder operations continued, targeting Jews, communists and \\"suspicious elements\\". In July 1942, the regiment was redesignated as the 10th Police Regiment. Decrypts by British intelligence While the activities of the Police Regiment South, the Einsatzgruppen detachment and the 1st SS Brigade, progressed, the reports by the murder squads were being intercepted and decoded by MI6, the British intelligence service. As part of Ultra, British signals intelligence program, the codebreaking facilities at Bletchley Park decoded and analysed the messages. The head of MI6, Stewart Menzies, communicated the decrypts directly to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The first message decrypted was the 18 July report on the mass murders by the Police Regiment Centre of over 1,100 Jews at Slonim, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. In late July and early August, similar reports were intercepted on a regular basis. The first messages mentioning the murders by the Police Regiment South were intercepted on August 23, with Police Battalion 314 reporting executions of 367 Jews south-east of Kiev. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS. Its members were able to reintegrate into society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers. Police Battalion 314's home base had been in Vienna, and many of its members joined Austrian police after the war. Members of the battalion were investigated by the Austrian authorities, with at least two former members providing testimony on the mass killings of Jews. One former member testified that the killing method changed from using sidearms and carbines to machine guns since the former was deemed \\"too tedious\\". For reasons of national security, the Ultra program remained classified after the war and the decrypts pertaining to the activities of security and police troops during the war were not shared with Britain's allies. Consequently, they were not used during the Nuremberg trials or subsequent investigations of German war crimes and crimes against humanity. The decrypts were finally released in 1993.

Together, they have written numerous popular Christian songs. They have been ministering together in a music and speaking ministry since 1985 called \\"Love Sings! Ministries\\" (formerly known as \\"Heart for the World\\").  Early life  Terry Franklin was born in Miami, FL in 1957 to Bob and Sandra Franklin. Bob was a member of The Suntones, a barbershop quartet that performed on The Jackie Gleason Show from 1964 to 1970. For two years, while still traveling in music ministry with Barbi, Terry performed as part of the Gaither Vocal Band (1992 to 1994). Together, they opened for some of the Gaither concerts and sang at all the Praise Gatherings, Jubilates, and Family Fests during the 2 years. Barbi Franklin was born Barbi Murk in Chicago, IL in 1959 to Dr. Jim and Donna Murk. She sang and played violin as part of the Murk Family Musicale, a family singing ministry composed of her parents and 5 siblings that began traveling in full-time music ministry in 1963 until each of the kids were married. They recorded 25 albums together from 1963 to 1988. The group got its start after Jim won the national championship of the Original Amateur Hour (hosted by Ted Mack) in 1963.The Troy Record (Troy, NY), December 14, 1963, p. 38.  Early ministry  Terry & Barbi met in 1980 on \\"Prayer Day\\" when they were both students at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, IL. They married in 1983, and launched into music ministry as singer-songwriters in 1985. That same year, they signed a recording contract with City Alive Records in Chicago, (affiliated with WCFC- TV 38 in Chicago). They produced their first television special Time for Joy in 1985, and have traveled in missions to 40 nations worldwide. In 1988, they moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and they wrote their first original song recorded by another artist, \\"No Wonder,\\" that was well received on radio charts nationwide. Through the years, the Franklins have worked with many highly respected and widely acclaimed Christian leaders and prominent musicians, the late Billy Graham, and the late Dr Adrian Rogers, Dr. Jack Hayford, Jim Cymbala and The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, Bill & Gloria Gaither, Don & Tim Wildmon of American Family Association, and many more. From 1992 to 1994, while still singing with Barbi, Terry sang tenor with the Gaither Vocal Band for two years during the group's transition. He sang on two of their albums: Peace of the Rock and Southern Classics, both released in 1993.

Twelve of their albums are still available online.  Worship & family ministry  Terry and Barbi have traveled full-time in Worship & Family Ministry since 1985, ministering across the United States and in 40 nations worldwide so far. In 2017 their non profit ministry name was changed from Heart for the World to Love Sings! Ministries. Besides their family worship events, they also lead marriage retreats, and worship and prayer conferences. Their two sons also traveled and sang a capella songs with them, as well as original contemporary Christian music. In 2009, they recorded one family music CD, The Franklins, that all four of them contributed to with singing, songwriting, producing, and playing instruments. Besides their ongoing worldwide ministry, they also founded a ministry in Tennessee in 2011 called \\"Worship City,\\" which they have seen blossom as they have gathered worship and prayer leaders to seek God in prayer together across their city, state, and region. Their 2018 Let Your Glory Fall worship and prayer conference featured special guest, Jason Hershey, founder of David's Tent DC, and testimonies from 25+ leaders across Tennessee and 4 other surrounding states in their region. They secured the registered trademark for \\"Worship City\\" and have held many events locally and nationally, along with a tent ministry that their Worship City leaders have founded, David's Tent Tennessee.http://worshipcity.us/davids-tent-tennessee/ Worship City's theme is \\"Changing our City to Change the World through Fasting, Prayer, and Worship.\\" Terry and Barbi's worldwide ministry, Love Sings, has always included Family Worship Events and Marriage Retreats. But in recent years, since seeing revival firsthand around the world, they began leading Prayer and Worship Conferences as well. Their ongoing theme worldwide has always been \\"Inspiring Love in the Home & Revival in the Church.\\" But the Franklins have been deeply impassioned by what they've seen in other nations in recent years, So in 2011, they responded to Gods promptings to call the body of Christ to a prayer and fasting observance in the U.S. called \\"Awaken Us: 40 Days to Fast and Pray.\\" http://AwakenUs.com American Family Radio Network partnered with them to reach the nation, penetrating 40 states, with 500 churches and 30,000 people joining their efforts. They recruited 8 Christian leaders from a variety of denominations nationwide, unifying Christians across the U.S. for fasting and prayer, November 21 ‚Äì December 31, during the last 40 days of 2011. Since that time, there has been a steady burgeoning of the worship and prayer movement nationwide that many have said could bring another historic \\"Great Awakening\\" of the Christian faith. Terry and Barbi have also secured the trademark name \\"Love Sings\\", and have plans to record a marriage seminar with that title for American Family Association in 2018 that will be produced and distributed nationwide.  Personal life  Terry and Barbi live in Nashville, Tennessee and have two grown children.

It operated between 1939 and 1980, and was in charge of coordination between the staffs of the three branches of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy and the Air Force). Jornadas de estudio sobre el t√≠tulo preliminar de la Constituci√≥n, IV Volumen, p√°g. 2914  History  The AEM was created on 30 August 1939 with the objective of having a \\"body of coordination, study and information, which would provide to the supreme command the elements of suitable judgment for the orientation of its designs\\". In this way the Defence High Command is constituted with the following tasks: * Submit to the authority studies and proposals for the management of national energies so that in case of war they were insured to the maximum extent their evolution and functioning in autarkic regime. * Prepare the study of the resolutions that proceed in order to the weighting of organic media between the Army, Navy and the Air Force. * Study and propose the general lines of the permanent organizations that should constitute bases of combined operations of the aforementioned forces. * Study and propose directives and plans for their joint action in case of war. * Provide the supreme command with the necessary information for the appreciation of the military and economic potential of other countries. For this it was necessary on the one hand the appointment of a General-Chief who would be a member and secretary of the , and on the other hand the creation of a secretariat and three sections: a military, an economic and an informational. On 5 February 1944, the need to act against foreign intelligence services within Spain was raised. That is why a new military intelligence agency began operating, the so-called \\"\\" (SIAEM). However, due to problems of coordination between the various counterintelligence mechanisms of the time, it was decided in 1945 to divide the powers: the Defence High Command would be in charge of espionage and counterintelligence of military character both inside and outside the country, while the Ministry of the Interior would be in charge of the internal security of the country, and the rest of the ministries would collect the general information according to their needs. After the death of Franco in 1975, the administrative structure of the Armed Forces was reorganized. The AEM disappeared in 1980 when all its functions were taken over by the Board of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JUJEM), which was succeeded in 1984 by the Defence Staff (EMAD).

A well-known Ethiopian poet, Gibreab Teferi Dasta died at age of 65 in the city of Addis Ababa. He was one of the early pioneers of Ethiopian music and Theater. Gibreab was a celebrated poet, lyricist, and playwright who wrote over two-hundred songs, dozen plays, and hundreds of poems in the Amharic language. Gibreab's patriotism as can be seen in many of his songs and plays. He also worked as a journalist, author, musician, composer and theater director. He wrote several unpublished plays, thousands of songs, and was in the process of publishing a book of plays and poems when he died in 1980 EC. He also served in the Imperial Army (), rising to the rank of Shalaqa-Basha and was the primary Amharic lyricist for the Ras Band in the famous Ras Hotel, eventually becoming management there, where he worked until retirement. Life Gibreab Teferi was born in 1915 E.C in the Bure Damot region of Gojjam to his father, the Commander of the Right Brigade, Qenyazmach Teferi Dasta (Amharic: ·âÄ·äõ·ãù·àõ·âΩ ·â∞·çà·à™ ·ã∞·àµ·â≥), and his mother, Weyzero Semagne Tasama (Amharic: Àà·ãà/·àÆ ·à∞·àò·äù ·â∞·à∞·àõ). Gibreab Teferi was married to Yeshi- Emebet Aregaye. He fathered ten children ‚Äì four boys and six girls. As of 2018, five of his children reside in the United States and live in the Pacific Northwest near Seattle, Washington. The other five reside in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. =Early life= Gibreab's parents separated when he was just nine months old. He was raised by his aunt, who lived in the same region. Gibreab received primary education in the traditional schools of the area, learning to read and write through the church. He became known for his fast learning skills in Ge‚Äôez /liturgical language and served as a Deacon at an early age. He studied under the tutelage of Aleka Teffera. Aleka Teffera had an affinity for music that he shared with his young student. Teffera had once been a high-ranking member of a musical group in Emperor Menelik's court in Addis Ababa. He taught young Gibreab many of the songs and lyrics in praise of Addis Ababa, the capital city, which had been played at the emperor's palace at a special occasion which took place on Thursday, 17 November 1878 EC. Gibreab made his first journey to Addis Ababa when he was a mere ten years old. Having graduated from the church school in his village, he went to the capital city to apply for a deaconship. He later described his first impressions: ‚ÄúAs compared with the countryside, Arada (the current Piazza) was lovely, a paradise. Everything I saw was thrilling and attractive‚Ä¶It might surprise you if I tell you that when I first saw the mounted statue of Menelik, I almost ran away thinking that the horse would descend upon me and squash me like a fly! It was in stages that I got used to it!\\"(From Ethiopian Herald, Vol. XLIII, Thursday 20 November 1986 (11 Hedar 1979) \\"Oh! Addis Ababa, Oh Arad\\" by Melese Telahoun) While in Addis Ababa, Gibreab stayed near St. George's Cathedral, continuing to learn music (although in a way that was not, perhaps, traditional): He was begging for food, as was the custom for young students () at the time, when a waitress offered him a meal. As he was eating, he heard a traditional singer () accompanied by a Krar, singing a beautiful song. He was so transfixed by the melody that the song become embedded in his mind (Telahoun). After two weeks in Addis Ababa, the young Gibreab returned to his village home of Gojjam to continue his studies there. He was forced to quit his education in 1929 EC, during the second Italo- Abyssinian War war of resistance against Italian Fascists. During the five- year occupation by Italy, Gibreab served with his uncle, Dagazmach Zalaka Dasta() in Gojjam, in the Kola Dega Damot () region. He became a resistance fighter and tailor for the patriot (), creating the coarse, wool, blanket-like garments () for the anti-fascist rebels and a fighter. Even in this situation his passion for music kept growing. =Kebur Zabagna (·ä≠·â°·à≠ ·ãò·â†·äõ) and Entertainment= Kebur Zabagna Crew ‚Äì from the right Baheru Tadla and next to him Gibreab Teferi In 1938 EC, Gibreab Teferi returned to Addis Ababa to find a city much changed from his previous visit 12 years prior. He told Melese Talahoun, the city had \\"changed a lot; practically nothing was as it used to be. Everything was mixed-up.\\" He had become a deacon in St. George's cathedral and was in the city looking for a job. He came upon an employment posting from the Imperial Army (), looking for any person who could read and write. Gibreab could do both, so he applied. Through the long application and interview process, the Imperial Army() recruiters discovered that Gibreab was a talented poet. He was brought into the Imperial Army () as an official playwright and lyricist for the entertainment division. During his tenure with the Kebur Zabagna, Gibreab wrote several plays, many as a source of education for the soldiers; his first play to be performed in the military was \\"Don't forget your military duty\\" (·ãà·â≥·ã∞·à≠·äê·âµ·àï·äï ·ä†·âµ·à≠·à≥), which encourages the soldiers to be clean, honorable, and presentable. Years before the Kebur Zabagna created a theatrical department in 1949, Gibreab's plays were performed by the men; just like Shakespearean actors, some men wore dresses and played the role of women. Gibreab also wrote many lyrics for the Kebur Zabagna band and most of his lyrics were performed by the famous kebur Zabagna band which includes the Famous Tilahun Gessesse, Tefera Kasa, Bizunesh Bekele, and many more. His work lives on, because, even today, those same lyrics are performed by the famous Kebur Zabagna artists and are appreciated and enjoyed by many Ethiopians. Resignation Letter From Kebur Zabagna In 1948 EC or 1956 when the Yugoslavian president Marshal Tito visited Ethiopia, nobody was willing to give a presentation in front of king Haile Selase and Martial Tito. Then, the king asked Gibreab Teferi to introduce the army and the day's program. Gibreab gladly went onstage and gave a military salute and presented the program well. His family still has the picture of him giving speech on that historical day. Later, he transferred to Takele Ena Sarawitu (), the Imperial Army's radio and newspaper department, where he worked as a journalist and writer. Gibreab Teferi reached the rank of Shalaqa-Basha () (commander of the colonel) before leaving the Imperial Guard in 1954. He received many awards for his ethics, loyalty, and service to his country. Plays Gibreab Teferi wrote several plays, both during and after his time with the Kebur Zabagna. Some of these plays were never performed; others received recognition from military and government officials. One of Gibreab's most admirable talents was his ability to write plays in dramatic verse. His plays contained poetry and lots of hidden meanings. Like the English William Shakespeare, Gibreab also adapted ancient tales into modern plays. One play, Astyages The Cruel Leader, tells the tale of Astyages, the last king of the Median Empire (in modern-day Iran). This play, written in dramatic verse, was first published as a book in Ethiopia. \\"Astyages the cruel leader\\" Gibreab's first book Published This is an incomplete list of plays written by Gibreab: * ·ã®·àû·âµ ·àò·ã≥·äí·âµ \\"Life Potion,\\" 1940EC (the oldest recorded theater written, dramatic verse) * ·ãà·â≥·ã∞·à≠·äê·âµ·àï·äï ·ä†·âµ·à≠·à≥ \\"Don't Forget Your military Duty,\\" (presented for the army, first to be shown, dramatic verse) * ·ãà·â≥·ã∞·à≠ ·àò·àà·ã®·âµ ·ä†·ã≠·çà·à´·àù \\"A Soldier Is Not Afraid to Be Separated,\\" (presented for the army, dramatic verse) * ·â¢·â∞·ãç ·ä†·àõ·à® \\"Bi-taw Amara,\\" (shown for military, military officials, and their families dramatic verse) * ·ä†·àµ·â¥·ä†·åÑ·àµ ·å®·ä´·äô ·åà·ã¢ \\"Astyages The Cruel Leader,\\" 1950 EC (dramatic verse, published as a book) * ·ã®·àÅ·àà·âµ ·ä†·àà·àù ·àµ·ã∞·â∞·äû·âΩ \\"Refugee of Two World's,\\" 1950‚Äì1953 EC (presented for higher officials, dramatic verse) * ·àµ·àõ·äï·ã´ \\"Eighty\\", 1976 EC (passed government censorship but not shown for public, dramatic verse) * ·çç·âÖ·à≠ ·àù·à≠·å• ·àê·ä™·àù ·äê·ãç \\"Love Is the Doctor,\\" translated from the French play by Moli√®re, L'Amour m√©decin (passed government censorship but not shown, dramatic verse) * ·â∞·â†·àã·àΩ·â∂ ·ã´·àç·âÄ·à® ·â£·àç \\"The Prodigal Husband,\\" 1976 EC (Passed government censorship but not shown, dramatic verse) In 1953 EC, the showing of \\"Refugee of Two Worlds\\" garnered Gibreab appreciation and recognition among elites, higher officials, friends, and relatives. After the play was over, the higher official who was sitting in front Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway ·â•·à≠·åã·ã¥·àç ·åÄ·äê·à´·àç ·àò·äï·åç·àµ·â± ·äê·ãã·ã≠ was touched and crying throughout the show. When it was over and Gibreab came out to the stage to greet his audience, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway ·â•·à≠·åã·ã¥·àç ·åÄ·äê·à´·àç ·àò·äï·åç·àµ·â± ·äê·ãã·ã≠ came out to the stage, took off his wristwatch and gave it to Gibreab Teferi. After that Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway ·â•·à≠·åã·ã¥·àç ·åÄ·äê·à´·àç ·àò·äï·åç·àµ·â± ·äê·ãã·ã≠ went on to commit a coup d'√©tat on the king Haile Selassie. The failed coup d'√©tat cost him his life and Gibreab Teferi and the Kebur Zabagna team received a six- month prison time, including the famous Tilahun Gessesse and a forced resignation from the royal Army. Most who worked with Gibreab Teferi know and appreciate his guts and his willingness to discuss the social inequality of his time through his music, short plays, or dramatic works like this one. To this day, most argue that Gibreab's play caused the coup d'√©tat to happen; but, according to the investigation by the king Mengistu Neway, ·â•·à≠·åã·ã¥·àç ·åÄ·äê·à´·àç ·àò·äï·åç·àµ·â± ·äê·ãã·ã≠ and his comrades were planning this for a while and Gibreab wasn't considered a part of that, but the timing and the play itself became the straw that broke the camel's back. To this day, Gibreab's colleagues respect him, because, as an artist, instead of trying to please his bosses or the king, he chose to be a voice for the poor and the voiceless. Music Throughout his career with the Imperial Army, Gibreab continued working with music, and wrote five military marches. Three of these marches were performed in a competition in 1953 EC at the Sergaga Tore School (·àµ·à≠·åà·äõ ·å¶·à≠ ·âµ·àù·àï·à≠·âµ ·â§·âµ). In one competition, Gibreab's marches received first place and two of his marches received second place in different categories. He was an accomplished musician, playing the clarinet and the traditional krar, a stringed instrument similar to a lyre, as well as possessing a strong tenor voice. He taught himself to play the krar, since it is a traditional instrument that one can learn by watching a master player and then practicing. Gibreab learned modern music in the Kebur Zabagna from the Armenian instructor Kevork Nalbandian, and become very good at playing clarinet. He also learned to read and write musical notes. Finally, he became an instructor and taught other Ethiopian musicians in the police orchestra and many others. When Gibreab was put in prison because he was suspected of involvement in the Coup d'√©tat, he wrote lyrics depicting the king as his lover to show how much he still loved his country. The music is called \\"Altelashem Kato\\" (·ä†·àç·å†·àã·àΩ·àù ·ä®·â∂), with vocals by Tafera Kasa. =Ras Band= In 1954 EC when a new orchestra was formed in the famous Ras Hotel, Gibreab, recently retired from the Kebur Zabagna (Imperial Guard), became one of the original members of the band, the primary Amharic lyricist (writing lyrics to more than 220 songs), and the MC of the first Ras Band. Entirely made up of Ethiopian musicians, this first Ras Band is remembered to this day as the quintessential, old-style club band, demonstrating style, mastery, and elegance. Most say the music recorded by the Ras Band played a big role in Ethiopian music and are still listened to and sung by other singers. Ras Hotel Note Book Gibreab used to write lyrics It was with the Ras Band that Bahta Gebrehiwot recorded most of his works. With the exception of maybe one or two songs, all of the Amharic songs were written by Gibreab Teferi, including : * Anchim Endelela, (·ä†·äï·â∫·àù ·ä•·äï·ã∞·àå·àã) * Degmo Endemin Alesh, (·ã∞·åç·àû ·ä•·äï·ã∞·àù·äï ·ä†·àà·àΩ) * Yetilacha Werie, (·ã®·å•·àã·âΩ·äï ·ãà·à¨) * Kalatashew Akal, (·ä´·àã·å£·àΩ·ãç ·ä†·ä´·àç) * Ya Ya (·ã´ ·ã´) * Hello (·àÉ ·àé) * Menaw Tadayalesh (·àù·äê·ãç ·â≥·ã∞·ã´·àà·àΩ) * Gizi√© (·åä·ãú) * Wede Harar Guzo, (·ãà·ã∞ ·àê·à®·à≠ ·åâ·ãû) * Enaye Nagne Waye Mognu, (·ä•·äî ·äê·äù ·ãà·ã≠ ·àû·äô) * Ya Kolega Azmara, (·ã®·âÜ·àà·äõ ·ä†·ãù·àò·à´) * Gizawen Alawekem, (·åä·ãú·ãç·äï ·ä†·àã·ãç·âÖ·àù) * Tarasahugne Ende, (·â∞·à®·à≥·àÅ·äù ·ä•·äï·ã¥) and many more Other professional roles When the original Ras Band was moved to Ghion Hotel in 1959 EC, Gibreab stayed at the Ras Hotel, transferring into management where he served as legal and director of personnel. He continued to work in the hotel industry for many years, in both management and legal departments, at all Ras Hotel Branches, such as: * Genet Hotel, * Assab Hotel and * Hotel D'Afrique. Through his loyalty and work ethic, Gibreab earned a good reputation from people of all walks of life. He continued to be well respected well into his retirement. Gibreab Teferi continued to write plays, poems, and songs throughout all the years that he was employed in the hospitality industry. Later years and death Gibreab Teferi After his retirement from the hotel industry, Gibreab worked on more plays, translating well-known plays, such as Molier's L'Amour m√©decin (1665) from French into Amharic. On Ter 5, 1980 EC, Ato Gibreab Teferi succumbed to an internal illness and passed away at Maekalawi ez Hospital (·àò·ä†·ä®·àã·ãä ·ä•·ãù ·àÜ·àµ·çí·â≥·àç). Upon his death, he was presented in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa ·âÖ·ãµ·àµ·âµ ·àµ·àã·à¥ ·â§·â∞·ä≠·à≠·àµ·â≤·ã´·äï. The body was escorted by the Honor Guard. When the coffin entered into the tomb, military personnel performed a three-gun salute, followed by a short Trumpet fanfare Marsh. Gibreab Teferi's body was committed to the earth on Ter 6, 1980 EC, at 10 pm Ethiopian time, in front of family, relatives, and friends. Gibreab rarely performed his songs himself, preferring to remain behind the scenes, but there are a few recordings of him singing. He was invited to sing his song \\"Addis Ababa\\" for the televised celebration of the city's 100th anniversary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVMphl98lnw He is also known for his performance and recording of ‚ÄúWoi Addis Ababa, Woi Arada Hovi\\" (or \\"woy Addis Ababa, woy Arada Hoye\\").

The Raja wrote to the British Resident, Colonel James Stuart Fraser, an amateur scientist proposing the establishment of an astronomical observatory. This led to John Caldecott who earlier ran a small personal observatory at Allepey being appointed as the royal astronomer. The observatory was located on the highest point in the city and opposite the palace and was considered important as the magnetic equator at that time passed through Trivandrum. The observatory was designed by Lieutenant W H Horsley of the Madras Engineers. Caldecott also began taking meteorological measurements from July 1837 and expanded to another building in 1842 that housed a Dollond equatorial circle. A Travancore Almanac was published in 1838. Caldecott travelled to Europe in 1839 to obtain additional instrumentsand during this period the observatory was headed by Sperschneider. Caldecott died in 1849 and from January 1852 it was headed by John Allan Broun. Broun and his assistants including J. Kochukunju (Cochoocoonjoo) and E.

Career  Anne Hugon has worked for several years on the history of European exploration of Africa. She taught at the University of Lyon II and wrote a thesis on missionaries in Africa in the early 1990s. She is currently a ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University where she is teaching 19th‚Äì20th century African history. She is also a member of the , a joint interdisciplinary research unit associating with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Her studies and research themes on Africa include colonial history of Ghana, social history, history of colonisation, history of women and gender, history of medicine and history of cultural changes. She has authored several articles and books on the subject. She wrote for the \\"D√©couvertes Gallimard\\" collection, an illustrated pocket book published in 1991 and has been translated into ten languages, including English. The book has been adapted into a documentary film titled (\\"Mystery of the Sources of the Nile\\") in 2003. A sequel to this book, , released in 1994, has also been made into a documentary film with the same title. In addition to articles and books authored by herself, Hugon has also translated the English explorer Mary Kingsley's account of her travels into French.  ( or 'Explorers in Africa') is a book miniseries composed of two pocket-sized books published by √âditions Gallimard in the series (later reorganised into series) of their collection, both of them made into documentary films.  US edition (left) and UK edition. (lit. 'Explorers in Africa: Towards the Sources of the Nile'; English edition: The Exploration of Africa: From Cairo to the Cape) is the first book of this \\"miniseries\\" and the 117th title of collection. Despite the small format, the book is distinguished by the huge number of colour illustrations taken from 19th century journals and other sources, the quality of the colour is remarkable. The body text is divided into five chapters: I, \\"A World to Explore\\"; II, \\"The Mystery of the Source of the Nile\\"; III, \\"Livingstone's Mission in Southern Africa\\"; IV, \\"Into the Heart of the Forest\\"; V, \\"The Explorer's Profession\\". The text follows the steps of those explorers in Africa: Richard Francis Burton, John Hanning Speke, James Augustus Grant, Samuel Baker, Henry Morton Stanley, David Livingstone, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, Jean-Baptiste Marchand and Mary Kingsley. In less than fifty years, in the late 19th century, they penetrated the heart of Africa, discovered the sources of the Nile, explored the Congo and Zambezi Basins, surveyed the Mountains of the Moon. But these explorers also revealed the riches of the black continent to the European colonisers. The \\"Documents\\" section at the back features excerpts from the explorers' own journals which is divided into five parts: 1, Preparing an Expedition; 2, The Explorers Confront Africa; 3, The Advent of Colonialism; 4, The Explorer's Changing Image; 5, Patrons. These are followed by a map, a chronology, further reading, list of illustrations and an index. The book has been translated into American and British English, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, South Korean, Spanish, simplified and traditional Chinese. A 52-minute documentary adaptation of the book titled , directed by St√©phane B√©goin, released in 2003 for Arte's documentary television programme The Human Adventure. It's a co- production by Arte, Arte France, √âditions Gallimard and . In an interview with Arte, the director explains the use of pictures in the documentary: \\"I sought to find the iconographic richness that made the success of these small books (from ). Specifically for this film, this is reflected in the mixture of different visual sources. There are the 'vignettes' that we talked about earlier, which are photomontages made from coloured prints.\\"  First edition (lit. 'On the Road to Timbuktu: Explorers in Africa II') is a sequel to and the 216th title of collection, published in 1994. This book concentrates on Timbuktu, an ancient city in Mali, in West Africa, a region which the previous book has nothing on it. The book is not available in other languages. For the Europeans, Timbuktu was a mythical city in the heart of the Sahara. In 1795, Mungo Park acknowledged the Niger River. Thirty years later, Ren√© Cailli√© entered this \\"forbidden city\\", while Hugh Clapperton explored Lake Chad, Heinrich Barth crossed the Sahara... Travellers discovered the powerful dynasties of West Africa. Since 1850, the new explorers were mostly colonial officers with mission of conquest. On the eve of the World War I, despite African nationalism, Europeans managed to create genuine empires in Africa.

He is currently a professor of applied linguistics at the Department of Applied Linguistics at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. He is known for his work on Complex Dynamic Systems Theory. He is one of the members of the \\"Dutch School of Dynamic Systems\\" who proposed to apply time-series data to study second language development along with de Bot, van Geert, and Verspoor.  Career  Lowie obtained his PhD degree at the Centre of Language and Cognition, Faculty of Arts at the University of Groningen on 14 January 1998. He was supervised by his future colleague at the University of Groningen, Cornelis de Bot. The title of his PhD thesis was \\"The acquisition of interlanguage morphology: a study into the role of morphology in the L2 learner's mental lexicon\\". Lowie is the Associate Editor of The Modern Language Journal, a peer-reviewed academic journal. Research In 2004 he wrote a seminal article along with de Bot and Verspoor on second language development in which he applied the dynamic systems theory to study second language writing development. This was the first research paper in which time-series data were used to explicate changes in the development of second language writing. In a 2012 article he discussed the pedagogical implications of Dynamic Systems Theory approaches to second language development. He suggested that only an approach that values the relevance of variability can capture the crucial time dimension of development. He proposed that a longitudinal approach using a language portfolio that captures a wide range of language skills as suggested by the Common European Framework of Reference is of greater value for the language learner than a rigid assessment of some aspects of language proficiency at one point in time.https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/cercles.2012.2.issue-1/cercles-2012-0002/cercles-2012-0002.xml  Bibliography =Books= *Second Language Acquisition: An Advanced Resource Book (2005) *A Dynamic Approach to Second Language Development.

On the hill are located basic structures of the New Pechersk Fortress (Hospital fortifications), a complex which today is part of museum-sanctuary \\"Kyiv Fortress\\" and a military hospital. Nearby also is located the Kosyi (Oblique) Caponier also known as Kyiv Schlisselburg as it served as a political prison in 1863-1918. At the foot of the hill stretches an esplanade, empty and open space between the citadel and the city, about which reminds the name of street Esplanadna. In 1897 slopes of the hill were decorated with pavilions of the All-Russian Industrial Exposition, and designed by such architects as Gorodetsky, Kobelev, and Zhuravsky. Sometimes in the beginning of 20th century, on the hill was created the Alekseevskiy Garden. In 1913 there took place the All-Russian Industrial and Agrarian Exposition. In 1920 there was built the Red Stadium, today better known as the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex.

He helped to popularize the role of the electric lead guitarist in country music and, with fellow guitarist Hank Garland, was responsible for input into the design of the Gibson Byrdland guitar, named after parts of the names of both players. Biography Byrd was born in Nashville, Tennessee and learned to play the guitar at 10 and appeared on radio playing with local bands whilst still in his teens. At the age of 18 he joined the house band at Nashville's WSM Grand Ole Opry and then worked with Herold Goodman and the Tennessee Valley Boys and Wally Fowler and his Georgia Clodhoppers before and after serving in World War 2. In 1949 he commenced his most important association, that with Ernest Tubb as lead guitarist with the latter's Texas Troubadours, a position he occupied until 1959, followed by a second stint between 1969 and 1973, when he effectively retired from the music business. A self-taught guitarist influenced by jazz players such as Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt, he tutored a number of well-known Nashville session players including Hank Garland and Harold Bradley. With Tubb's band he favored simpler lead lines which can be heard on Tubb hits such as \\"Jealous Loving Heart,\\" \\"Two Glasses Joe\\" and \\"Answer the Phone.\\" Another side of his lasting legacy is the instrument that bears his name, the Gibson Byrdland thinline electric archtop guitar, developed with input from Byrd and fellow country/jazz guitarist Garland, which was in initial production from 1955 through 1969, and subsequently revived for limited runs several times later. Taking a break from life on the road with Tubb, Byrd recorded several solo instrumental albums between 1959 and 1964 before returning to Tubb's band for a second stint in 1969 until retiring from life as a professional musician in 1973 to run a taxi company in Nashville. He died in his home town of natural causes on August 7, 2001. Influence and guitar style Byrd was one of the earliest and most widely known featured lead electric guitar players with a popular country outfit (other than the steel guitar players with western swing bands) and as such was influential in establishing this role in Nashville style country music. Although little of his jazz chops was on display in his featured lead breaks with Ernest Tubb, according to other Nashville players in his day he was considered the \\"best pop jazz player in town\\" and Harold Bradley (speaking for himself and Hank Garland) is quoted as saying: \\"Without him coming along and showing us that jazz stuff, we never would have been able to do what we did.\\" In an essay on pedal steel great Buddy Emmons, who joined Ernest Tubb and the Texas Troubadours for a stint in 1958-1959, author Steve Fishell notes: \\"the Texas Troubadours - considered one of the top bands in country music - proved to be a perfect vehicle for jazzy swing instrumental ideas and arrangements. The band routinely sang and played at dances for two hours before Tubb was introduced, with Buddy and lead guitarist Billy Byrd leading the charge.\\" Some examples of Byrd's playing on his lead breaks are analysed by Sam Smiley on his instructional website at the page labelled \\"Billy Byrd Intro Solos\\". Instruments Byrd initially favoured Gibson archtop guitars and by the late 1940s was playing a Gibson L-7C. In 1949 he was on the waiting list for a new solid-body electric guitar from noted guitar maker Paul Bigsby and was informed that a novel, double-cutaway instrument initially constructed for guitarist Jimmy Bryant had become available since Bryant had entered an endorsement deal with Leo Fender and would no longer be taking it. This instrument, modified to prominently display Byrd's name instead of Bryant's, was then sold to Billy and became his featured instrument on recordings and film clips up until he took delivery of his own Byrdland guitar in 1955 (see below). This guitar was sold in the late 1950s to a Tulsa guitarist named Dick Ganders, and subsequently into a private collection on the U.S. East Coast, and is extensively documented in the section entitled \\"Jimmy Bryant / Billy Byrd Bigsby solid-body electric guitar #10749\\" on \\"The Bigsby Files\\" website. From 1955 onwards, Byrd was associated extensively with the Gibson guitar named after himself and Hank Garland, the Byrdland, a thinline, electric, single cutaway archtop with a shortened scale that presaged Gibson's popular Gibson ES-335 thinline series by several years. Byrd is believed to have received instrument #1, while Garland received #2 and subsequently also #3 which was supplied in a custom cherry sunburst finish.

She often went by the stage name Anto√±ita La Singla or simply \\"La Singla\\" but sometimes its written as Antonia Singla. Early life She was born as Antonia Singla Contreras in 1948 in the neighborhood Somorrostro de la Barceloneta, in Barcelona, Spain. At the time of her birth, this neighborhood was a shanty town and a gypsy community. A few days after her birth she was in pain so her mother took her to many hospitals in order to see different doctors. Despite the examinations, no accurate medical diagnosis was found. It was thought that the pain was caused by severe meningitis, however, the little girl was left deaf as a result of the pain she suffered during her first months. In 1968, she made a partial recovery from her medical condition. While she was growing up, La Singla learned to dance rumba, fandango, buler√≠as and flamenco with considerable skill. Singla began to dance by watching her mother clapping, absorbing the rhythm and turning it into a really remarkable dance full of emotions. It is said that she did not speak fluently until the age of 16. Career La Singla dancing Singla began her career at the early age of 12, dancing in some taverns in Barcelona. She was known for wearing pants in a bailaor style when performing dramatic dancing, this was something also done by Carmen Amaya and a few other flamenco dancers before her. In 1960, she launched her artistic career to the top by participating in the group project Festival Flamenco Gitano in which personalities such as Paco de Luc√≠a, Camar√≥n de la Isla, and El Fara√≥n, among others, participated. This 1965 event was the brainchild of German organizers of Blues and Gospel festivals, who decided to invest in flamenco, later participating in numerous television programs. In addition, the Festival Flamenco Gitano toured Europe and the American continent. The first performance took place in the German capital, Berlin. It is worth noting the fact that La Singla was more famous internationally than in Spain. In 1963, she performed as an actress and dancer in the film Los Tarantos, directed by Francisco Rovira-Beleta. The film is based on a play by Alfredo Ma√±as and tells the story of the fierce confrontation between two gypsy families in Barcelona: \\"Los Tarantos\\" and \\"Los Zorongos\\". Anto√±ita La Singla participated in the film as 'Sole', one of the dancers. In addition, thanks to the filming of the movie, Singla was able to meet Carmen Amaya, with whom she was compared too. The film, Los Tarantos was nominated for an Academy Award in 1964 for \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\". Another important milestone in the career of Anto√±ita Singla was her performance in the flamenco club Los Califas, a 1964 flamenco club whose tablao flamenco was inaugurated on October 15, 1965. The club owners heard about her through the artistic manager Antonio Fern√°ndez. A few days later she traveled to Madrid ready to debut in \\"Los Califas\\". Obviously, it was not easy to accompany \\"La Singla\\", not having the hearing and the speech needed, however she maintained the performance in its entirety. This unexpected situation and the flamenco club ‚Äò‚ÄôLos Califas‚Äô‚Äô was entirely filled with professionals from the flamenco dance community.  Legacy  As of 2017, Singla lives in Santa Coloma de Gramenet, in Catalonia, Spain far from the tablaos. On April 15, 2017, one of the brothers of the artist, Juan Jos√© Singla Contreras, and his partner, Santiago Parra, opened a flamenco tablao in Barcelona with the name of La Singla to pay tribute. The location of La Singla is located in front of La Monumental bullring, and it is the first new flamenco establishment that opened in the city in 30 years.

A \\"constant presence in Zebra's catalogue\\", she specialized in the \\"creepy child\\" or \\"child in supernatural peril\\" trope. Life and work Jensen was born Ruby Jean Hendrickson in McDonald County, Missouri, where she spent her early years before moving with her family to Northern California. There she met her husband, Vaughn Jensen. They moved to the Rogers, Arkansas area in the late 1950s. They were married for over fifty years, until his death in 1999. Jensen took up writing at an early age, and published over 200 short stories. Her first book sale was to Warner Paperback Library in 1974‚ÄîThe House That Samael Built, a Gothic romance. After another three novels with them, all with strong paranormal elements, she published three more with Manor Books in 1978, with a heavier emphasis on the occult. She would switch to unmitigated horror for the rest of her career, which included short stints with Leisure Books and Tor before finally settling with Zebra, starting with MaMa (1983). Many of her horror books dealt with the \\"creepy children\\" trope (in the lines of Henry James' The Turn of the Screw or Stephen King's \\"Children of the Corn\\") or that of the \\"evil doll\\" (as in the Child's Play film series or in Annabelle‚Äîwhich coincidentally is the title of a novel by Jensen, though unrelated to the film).

It is an agricultural area flanked by forested hills and ridges. Zinap√©cuaro's climate is temperate with summer rains. Average annual precipitation in the municipality ranges between 700 and 1600 millimetres. History Two Pur√©pecha words have been suggested as possible sources of the place name Zinap√©cuaro: tzinapo \\"obsidian\\" or tzin√°pecua \\"healing\\". The obsidian quarries near Ucareo include one of the largest known pre-Hispanic quarries in Mesoamerica and were already exploited in the early Formative period. In the late Classic period Ucareo was the principal source of obsidian at Tula and Xochicalco, and Ucareo obsidian was distributed throughout central Mexico, Oaxaca and the northern Yucat√°n, being found as far away as Chichen Itza. In the Postclassic period the area was controlled by the Tarascans, who built a temple there to worship , the mother goddess of Pur√©pecha mythology. Around 1530, a Spanish settlement was founded at Zinap√©cuaro by the conquistador Don Luis Monta√±ez. Zinap√©cuaro was first incorporated on 15 March 1825 as a partido in the department of Oriente in Michoac√°n. It became a free municipality on 5 February 1918. Administration The municipal government comprises a president, a councillor (Spanish: s√≠ndico), and ten trustees (regidores), six elected by relative majority and four by proportional representation. The current president of the municipality is Alejandro Correa. Demographics In the 2010 Mexican Census, the municipality of Zinap√©cuaro recorded a population of 46,666 inhabitants living in 11,608 households. It recorded a population of 47,327 inhabitants in the 2015 Intercensal Survey. There are 97 localities in the municipality, four of which are classified as urban: *Zinap√©cuaro de Figueroa, the seat of the municipality located in its west-central part, which recorded a population of 15,875 inhabitants in the 2010 Census; *Jer√°huaro, a town located east of the municipal seat in the Ucareo Valley, which had 2822 inhabitants in 2010; *Ucareo, a town located east of the municipal seat, which had 2284 inhabitants in 2010; *Bocaneo, a town located south of the municipal seat, which had 2082 inhabitants in 2010.

As a result of the occupation of Shusha by the Armenian Armed Forces about six hundred exhibits of the museum were destroyed and those could be carried were transported.

Mission  Soyuz MS-16 was launched on 9 April 2020 at 08:05:06 UTC. The Soyuz 2.1a booster's first and core stage engines ignited on time and lifted the rocket away from its firing stand at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, with cosmonaut Anatoli Ivanishin, joined by the rookie Ivan Vagner on the left and astronaut Chris Cassidy on the right. Like Ivanishin, Cassidy is making his third space flight. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted congratulations: \\"Chris Cassidy, Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner are safely in orbit, no virus is stronger than the human desire to explore. I'm grateful to the entire @NASA and @roscosmos teams for their dedication to making this launch a success\\". The International Space Station passed directly over the launch site about three minutes before the launch and the booster climbed directly into the plane of its orbit. Six orbits after that, at 14:13:18 UTC, the Soyuz docked at the Poisk docking compartment.https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/09/soyuz-crew-docks-with-the- international-space-station/ - 10 April 2020  References  Crewed Soyuz missions Spacecraft launched in 2020 2020 in Russia Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets ","title":"Soyuz MS-16"},{"id":"56484054","text":"Impulse is an American science fiction drama web television series based on the 2013 Steven Gould novel Impulse.

Kerala  SIMI operated several terrorist training camps in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Due to votebank politics and pressure from human rights activists, the ruling LDF government failed to act against such terrorist groups. Emboldened by the passive attitude of the government and its failure to bring charges against the organisers of the Binanipuram camp, SIMI conducted more terror training camps in the state. Indian Mujahideen, a SIMI front, enjoys a certain degree of political patronage in the state. = Binanipuram camp = A camp was organised in 2006 at Binanipuram near Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala state. 40-50 SIMI members were trained in commando and jungle warfare skills. On 15 August 2006, Kerala police questioned 18 people and arrested five ‚Äî Ansar Moulavi, Shaduli, Nizamuddin, Abdul Rafeeq and Shamas ‚Äî under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The five arrested were later released on bail. Ansar Moulavi and Shaduli are also accused of attending another training camp at Vagamon conducted between December 2007 - January 2008. Both were arrested after the 13 May 2008 Jaipur bombings by the Rajasthan police. = Vagamon camp = A camp was conducted at Thangalpara, Vagamon in Idukki district of Kerala in December 2007-January 2008. Camp attendees are said to be trained in commando, jungle warfare, trekking, rock climbing, rappeling and herbal medicine. Speeches inciting the participants to wage jihad (war) against India are said to made. About 20 students from Hubli, Belgaum and Bangalore were trained to assemble explosives with easily available materials by a bomb expert Abdul Subhan Qureshi. Ammonium nitrate, a commonly available nitrogenous fertiliser, was used in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings. Prototypes of liquid bombs using commonly available hydrogen peroxide were first experimented at the Vagamon camp. Abdul Sathar alias Manzoor, from Aluva in Kerala, is accused of attending the camp and of being involved in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings and 2008 Bangalore serial blasts. He is also accused of recruitment of youths from Kerala and sending them to Pakistan for terror training by the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Declared a proclaimed offender, an Interpol red alert notice was issued against him. A fugitive for six years, he was deported from Dubai on 2 August 2013 and arrested on arrival in India. =malappuram camp= On 23 April 2013, a terror training camp inside a building owned by Thanal Foundation Trust in Mayyil Narath area of Kannur district was organised by members of Popular Front of India (PFI), a SIMI front. The camp was raided by police and 21 people were arrested. Country bombs, a sword, a human effigy, cellphones and accessories for making bombs were recovered during the police raid. According to the charge sheet filed by the investigators, activists belonging to Popular Front of India and its political wing Social Democratic Party of India had organised this training camp. The charge sheet said that one of the participants had links with Indian Mujahideen terrorist group. The investigators provided evidence of transfer of funds between bank accounts to prove its allegations. The bank accounts details of Sanaulla Shabandri were found during the raid on the house of one of the accused. Shabandri from Bhatkal, is believed to be a close associate of Yasin Bhatkal and an Indian Mujahideen member.

Biography=Early life= Franz Anton was a son of Ferdinand Bonaventure Graf von Harrach (1637-1706), confidant of Emperor Leopold I, and Johanna Theresa Gr√§fin von Lamberg. His younger brother was Aloys Thomas Raimund von Harrach (1669-1742), the progenitor of the house. Franz Anton grew up in Madrid, studied canon and civil law at the Pontificium Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum de Urbe in Rome, and was raised by Emperor Leopold ad personam in the Imperial princely state. =Ecclesiastical career= In 1685, Franz Anton was canon in Passau, 1687 canon in Salzburg, and 1692 there dean. Emperor Leopold I appointed him coadjutor of Vienna in July 1701, the Papal confirmation taking place on 1 December. He was also Titular Bishop of Epiphania. When Prince-Bishop Ernest Graf von Trautson died on 7 January 1702, Harrach became his successor and received the episcopal ordination by Johann Philipp von Lamberg, Prince-Bishop of Passau. On 19 October 1705, he was appointed coadjutor of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Johann Ernst von Thun und Hohenstein, and confirmed in April 1706 by the Pope. After the death of Thun, he was on 29 May 1709 made reigning Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Franz Anton was benevolent, affable and popular as prince-bishop, he loved pageantry and had the Mirabell Palace considerably enlarged and renewed. The result was an impressive Rococo staircase and marble hall. From 1710 to 1711, he had the Salzburg residence renewed. His reign was calm overall, even contemporaries spoke of the \\"Golden Age of Harrach\\". His artistic sense, which was characterized by the Late Baroque, is especially praised. He employed well-known artists for the execution of the plans at great cost. The architects were Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt, sculptor Georg Raphael Donner, painters Johann Michael Rottmayr and Martino Altomonte. Prince-Bishop Harrach endeavored to promote business and commerce as a source of prosperity. For trading in Venice and the Mediterranean, he had the major trade routes extended. He lies buried in the crypt of Salzburg Cathedral. Bibliography * Christoph Brandhuber: Recreatio principis.

He helped found the Leo Baeck College which is now a privately funded rabbinical seminary. Early life He was born in Hamburg in 1893, son of the physician Samuel Liebeschuetz and his wife Lizzy Olga Liebeschuetz (n√©e Sch√∂nfeld). He first attended the scholar's school Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg and studied from 1912 at the University of Berlin . From 1914 to 1916 as a Lance Corporal serving with the Mecklenburg Regiment, he faced the French on the western front at the Battle of the Somme. His actions while raiding French lines lead to the award of an Iron Cross Class II. After serving for two years he contracted pneumonia and left the battle to recover at the military hospital at Geesthacht on the Elbe near Hamburg. From 1918 onwards he continued his studies on a course shortened for war veterans (a \`Kriegsnotsemester‚Äô) at Heidelberg University in Medieval History. He received his doctorate in 1920 under Karl Hampe, the subject of his dissertation was titled \\"The Relations of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor to England after 1235\\". Hamburg From 1920 he worked at a Realschule (Secondary School) in the St Pauli, entertainment district of Hamburg and then moved in 1928 to the progressive Hamburg Lichtwarkschule (Helmut Schmidt attended this school graduating 1937). He found working at the school stimulating but being Jewish was forced to leave in 1934, as a consequence of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, a law passed by the National Socialist regime on 7 April 1933, two months after Adolf Hitler attained power. As a war veteran he was allowed to stay in employment for an extra year after this law came into force. In 1922 he co-founded the B'nai B'rith Lodge of Hamburg. In addition to his work as a teacher, he was a member of the Warburg Institute. There he met Fritz Saxl , who was later to assist him in emigrating to England. In the year 1929 he habilitated with the writing \\"The allegorical world view of the holy Hildegard of Bingen \\". After his dismissal from civil service in 1934 he had the good fortune to find employment at the rabbinical seminary for training Liberal Jewish rabbis, the Institut f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums. This institute became an informal Jewish university. Here he taught medieval philosophy and was able to establish a relationship with Leo Baeck. In his spare time he devoted himself to Jewish adult education and lectured at various Jewish schools in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1938 his family emigrated to England, while he initially remained in Hamburg. After the November pogroms of 1938, he was arrested and interned for four weeks in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, being released on 11 December 38. In March 1939 he decided to follow his family to England, the departure was delayed by waiting for his mother‚Äôs visa. England In 1940 as an Enemy Alien he lived in Internment on the Isle of Man. From 1942 he taught Latin at various schools in England. In 1946 he was hired as an assistant lecturer at the University of Liverpool, and the following year he became a British citizen.

It employed marquetry, using inlays of exotic woods of different colors, as well as ivory and mother of pearl. The style had three distinct periods. During the early years (1715-1730), called the Regency, when the King was too young to rule, furniture followed the massive, geometric Style Louis XIV style. From 1730 until about 1750, the period known as the first style, it was much more asymmetrical, ornate and exuberant, in the fashion called rocaille. From about 1750 to the King's death in 1774, a reaction set in against the excesses of the rocaille. The Second Style of Louis XV showed the influences of neo-classicism, based on recent archeological discoveries in Italy and Greece. It featured Roman and Greek motifs. The later furniture featured decorative elements of Chinoiserie and other exotic styles. Louis XV furniture was designed not for the vast palace state rooms of the Versailles of Louis XIV, but for the smaller, more intimate salons created by Louis XV and by his mistresses, Madame de Pompadour and Madame DuBarry. It included several new types of furniture, including the commode and the chiffonier, and many pieces, particularly chairs and tables, were designed to be moved easily rearranged or moved from room to room, depending upon the kind of function. History With the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, his grandson, Louis XV, born in 1710, became King. Because of his young age, France was ruled by a Regent, Philippe of Orleans, until 1723. During this period, the style of furniture changed little from the Louis XIV period; it was massive, lavishly decorated and solemn, designed for the gigantic state halls of the new Palace of Versailles. In 1722 Louis XV moved from Paris, where he had lived with the Regent, to Versailles, began his own rule, and gradually imposed his own taste on the arts, architecture, and furniture. Louis left the exterior of Versailles and the other palaces largely unchanged, but beginning in 1738 he extensively redesigned the interiors, creating the petits apartments, or smaller apartments and salons for himself, the Queen, Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, whom he married in 1725, and later, for his primary mistresses, Madame Pompadour and Madame du Barry. In these salons the traditional etiquette and formality of Louis XIV was abandoned. These new suites of smaller rooms were furnished in a new style that met the needs of comfort, intimacy and elegance. Beginning in about 1730, His preference was for the style called rocaille, a term which referred to an ornamental decoration resembling a stylized seashell, a style which expressed gaiety and fantasy. The ornament appeared rarely on the exteriors of the new buildings, but lavishly in the interiors, on the walls, ceilings, and furniture. The architects Robert de Cotte and Ange-Jacques Gabriel remade the interiors of the Palace of Versailles, the Palace of Fontainebleau, and the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne in the new style. Palatial residences with rocaille interiors soon appeared In Paris. They included the H√¥tel Soubise in Paris, (now the National Archives) in 1705; the H√¥tel Matignon (now the residence of the French Prime Minister) in 1721, by Jean Courtonne; and the H√¥tel Biron (now the Mus√©e Rodin) by Jean Aubert. They also appeared in the French provinces, the royal residence by Emmanuel H√©r√© in Nancy, and also in Aix-en-Provence and Bordeaux. All of these buildings featured rooms arranged in the new style; the bedrooms took on new importance, and were surrounded by smaller anterooms and cabinets, including an entirely new kind of room, the dining-room. All of them needed new furniture to match the new style and arrangement. For a quarter of a century, the furniture designs of the rocaille style was dominant, particularly under the influence of Juste-Aur√®le Meissonier (1695-1750), the Italian-born architect who became royal architect and designer of Louis XV, and the ornament designer Nicolas Pineau (1684-1754). Under their influence, straight lines disappeared, replaced by curves, ornaments lost all symmetry, and garlands of flowers appeared everywhere. Designs inspired by Chinese art and other exotic sources appeared in profusion, though the rocaille style never reached the excess of exuberance of the rococo style that appeared in Italy, Austria and Germany. In the 1740s, the style began to slowly change; decoration became less extravagant and more discreet. In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer Nicolas Cochin and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and made a grand tour of other classical monuments. They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments. In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI. Betwewen 1755 and 1760, the forms of furniture and interior decoration began to change into what became known as the Second Style Louis XV, or the Style Transition. The rocaille decoration remained, but became more discreet and restrained. Secondly, the new wave of enthusiasm for ancient Greece and Rome brought a series of new decorative themes, though the lines of the furniture were not much changed. This marked the beginning of what became French neoclassicism or Style Louis XVI. Designers The earliest furniture designers under Louis XV during the Regency included Claude III Audran, who had been responsible for furniture design under Louis XIV; Pierre Lepautre, who in 1699 became chief designer for Louis XIV, and Gilles-Marie Oppenordt, born in Holland, who became the furniture designer for the Regent. Opponordt's designs in 1714 for the decor of the Hotel de Pomponne on Place des Victoires, featuring curving S and C forms, helped introduce the new style to Parisians. Another important figure in introducing the new style was the painter Watteau, a former pupil of Audran, who, besides his famous paintings, made arabesque designs for the woodwork of the new chateau of La Muette. '''' In the 1730s, notable designers included the sculptor and architect Nicolas Pineau and the jeweler Juste-Aur√®le Meissonnier; their work featured a greater amount of asymmetry, floral design twisting elements and counter-curves. In 1736 the carver and jewelry sculptor Jean Mondon published Premier Livre de form rocquaille et carte, the first book specifically on the style, and was among the first to include elements of Chinoiserie, notably dragons, a phoenix, and other figures. Engravings of their designs for furniture, woodwork and other decoration circulated widely throughout Europe, making the rocaille style a model for artists and craftsmen in other counties to follow.

The Menuisier, made the wooden framework of the furniture, which was held together by its structure and wooden chevilles or dowels; the use of nails or glue was forbidden. The Ebenist then covered the frame and native woods with thin pieces of exotic woods, called marquetry. In the reign of Louis XIV ebony was most often used for this covering, but, beginning in 1675-80, more exotic and colorful woods were used, which could give more picturesque effects. This were sometimes placed in cubic designs, or checkerboards, or representing arabesques, floral patterns, trophies, or picturesque scenes. Originally the plaques were about a centimeter thick, but by the end of the period plaques were only slightly more than two millimeters thick. Then the furniture was completed by the bronziers, who made the handles and knobs; the doreurs who gilded them; the fondeurs, who made metalwork; the chiselers or wood sculptors, who made the decorate details, legs, and other carvings; the laqueursand vernisseurs, who applied multiple coats of lacquer or varnish. After 1751 each work was signed by the master craftsman who oversaw the work. This mark, called the Estampille, used a heated iron to mark the piece with the initials of the master. It was usually placed on the back of the rear traverse of chairs, under the marble of commodes and secretaries, and under the surrounding ceinture of tables. marks are often missing, either forgotten by the craftsman, or defaced. Given the high value of signed pieces by famous craftsmen, Counterfeit Estampilles are not unknown. Chairs and sofas Between 1769 and 1775, the furniture designer Andr√© Jacob Roubo published a series of books of engravings called L'Art du menusier, detailing the categories and styles. He divided the chairs into two categories; those with a straight back, called √° la Reine, and those with a rounded back, called en cabriolet. The chairs en cabriolet were usually lighter, often had cane seats and backs, and could be moved around easily. included some new styles, notably the voyeuse a small chair with an armrest on the back, so the person seated could either face forward or turn around and sit astride the chair with his arms on the back of the chair. The fauteuils, or armchairs, were larger and designed for comfort; their styles evolved during the reign of Louis XV. During the early years of the Regency (1715-23) the armchairs had short curved feet, the top of the back was slightly curved, while the supports of the back and the arms were straight. The armchairs of the middle Louis XV period (1723-1750) were smaller than those of the Louis XIV period, but more comfortable. The legs were more curved, the top of the back was rounded, and often had a small ornamental design. The back of the chair took on a more graceful violin form. This form became known as the Chaise √† la Reine, or \\"Chair of the Queen.\\" A variety of other new forms appeared, designed especially for comfort. The Bergere had a low seat with an additional cushion, and sometimes added padded wings atop the arms on either side of the back which protected the head against drafts, which also made it easier to take naps. Other new types that were introduced were the marquise, basically an armchair expanded to seat two persons, and the chaise longue, an armchair with a lengthened seat to support the legs, and the Duchesse, where two chairs could be combined with an extension between. Another new type was the Fauteuil de cabinet, a type of chair designed to go with a desk, and to provide more comfort while writing. It was usually upholstered in leather fastened with gilded nails to the frame, had rounded angles, and one leg of the chair was placed in the front, another directly behind, for greater stability. The curved back and arms of the chair enveloped the person seated. The passion for the oriental and exotic soon influenced the furniture. A new kind of seat, La Sultane was introduced, with two places; another type called the Ottomane, with the back in a form called en gondola, and arms which wrapped around the oval seat, and another variety, called la papose,without arms or a back; and finally Le Sofa, which featured cushions which could be moved and rearranged. The last phase of the Louis XV style, the gradual transition toward the neoclassical, had a limited effect on chairs. The basic forms remained, but the decoration increasingly took the form of garlands of flowers called a l'√°ntique in a repetitive rhythm, which opposed the sinuous form of the carved legs and frame.

(H√¥tel de Caumont, Aix-en-Provence) Consoles and tables The Table en console or Console table, was designed to be placed against a wall, often in front of mirror, and held statuettes or porcelain objects. It was among the most lavishly decorated pieces of furniture of the early Louis XV period. It was usually made of oak, carved and gilded, and drenched with rocaille decoration, usually in the form of seashells and foliage. The and legs in the form of an exaggerated S or a reverse S. The supporting frame under the table was also highly decorated, sometimes holding porcelain objects, and sculpted figures of dragons or other mythical animals. The face of the table often had rocaille masks. a g rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage. They usually had a plaque of colored marble on top. Another popular style of table was the bureau plat, or flat desk. It was introduced by Andr√©-Charles Boulle around 1710 in the late reign of Louis XIV, as a replacement for the desk mounted atop two columns of drawes. The early versions by Boulle were made of ebony and dark wood, and had eight legs, and six drawers, which were decorated with gilded bronze handles. The slightly curved legs ending in gilded ornaments in the shape of deer's feet. Gilded bronze espagnolettes decorated the corners and legs. Later in the period, the flat desks featured an abundance of marquetry; they were made of oak or spain, were embedded with thin plaques of exotic woods of contrasting colors. Another celebrated creator of tables was Charles Cressent, who carried on the refined and harmonious ornamental style of Boulle. A number of small, specialized and portable tables appeared around of after 1755, some of them designed for Madame de Pompadour. These included the table de chevet, a very small utility table made of oak and inlaid with rosewood and other precious woods, which could be put in the closet when not needed; the Table d'en-cas, or \\"Just in case\\" table, a small piece with two drawers, small cupboard with a grilled door, and a marble top; the Chiffoni√®re, a small table with gracefully curving legs and a porcelain top. Another small table was the cabaret or √° caf√© table, with a small marble top and long legs, on which coffee or drinks could be served. The version introduced in 1770 featured geometric designs and a neoclassical frieze around the plateau. Another popular type of small table was the Table de toilette, or dressing table. One particular variety, en coeur, or heart-shaped, was especially designed for men; it stood on three legs mounted on rollers, contained an assortment of drawers and small compartments, and featured a folding mirror on top. In the late, second style of Louis XV, after 1750, the tables lost the rococo curves and took on classical (or imagined classical) details, including table legs in the form of Doric columns; griffon paws and lion paws on the feet;, trophies of arms, friezes, and figures of nymphs, tripods and horns of plenty, This style was termed, rather imaginatively, √† la Greque, and presaged the neoclassical period to come.

It was heavy and boxlike, with short legs, and abundant decoration of gilded bronze. During the Regency and early style of Louis XV, particularly in the commodes of Charles Cressent, commodes became more graceful, with longer S-shaped legs and espagnolettes, or stylized female torsos, on the corners above the legs. The fronts of commodes became more rounded in form. Gilded bronze vines curled and wound across the facade. Bronze ornaments in the form of masks were replaced by faces of smiling women, palmettes, and, later in the period, a new theme, s stylized bat wing. The seashell was a common central element of the rocaille decoration, often combined with acanthus leaves. Handles of drawers were shaped like intertwined flowers. Sculpted images of various animals also appeared near the end of the early period. A large number of skilled √©b√©nistes from around Europe were employed to make fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the new apartments built by Louis XV at Versailles, Fontainebleau, and his other residences. They included Jean- Fran√ßois Oeben, Roger Vandercruse Lacroix, Gilles Joubert, Antoine Gaudreau, and Martin Carlin. As the period advanced, the marquetry, or inlays of different-colored woods, became finer and more dominant. Various geometric patterns, including the checkerboard, stars, and losanges, appeared, along with bouquets of flowers made of fine marquetry. New techniques of lacquering wood were introduced, based on Chinese and Japanese techniques, which were frequently used on the front panels of commodes. A particular variation, called the fa√ßon de Chine or \\"Chinese fashion\\" was introduced, which contrasted the gilded bronze ornament and handles against the black lacquered wood. The designs often borrowed motifs from Chinese and Japanese art. Beginning in 1755-60, the reaction against the excesses of the rocaille form began. The shapes of commodes became more boxlike, the front flat, and the legs shorter, though they retained their slight S curve. The faces of the commodes were decorated with geometric friezes of oak leaves, roses or serpents and drapery motifs, the early manifestation of the Greco-Roman Neoclassical style. A new form of commode, the Cartonnier, appeared in the 1760s, inspired by somewhat fantastic ideas of ancient Greek furniture. Its front was lavishly decorated with friezes, trophies of arms and lions heads, while on the top, a pedestal supported by two scrolled volutes held a group of replicas of classical Greek statues.

At the beginning the 18th century, Andr√© Charles Boulle and Charles Cressent had created the bureau au plat. a writing table with columns of drawers, graceful curving legs, gilded bronze decoration, and fine marquetry in geometric forms. Jacques Dubois made a series of celebrated desks in this fashion the 1740s. Around 1750, a new variety appeared, called the Secretaire √† capuchin or √† la Bourgone, which contained a section of drawers which could be raised up, while the top folded out into a writing surface. In addition to the drawers, it contained a number of secret compartments concealed within. Numerous other variants appeared soon afterwards; the Secr√©taire en pent, or sloping desk first appeared in about 1735. It was a small cabinet with a sloping front which opened out into a writing surface. It was also called en dos d'√¢ne, or \\"style of donkey's back\\". Madame de Pompadour possessed one of these, made between 1748‚Äì52, with a varnish of red and a blue in the Chinese style, which combined rocaille and exoticism. Mathieu Criaerd made a secretary in this style in about 1750, with marquetry of violette, amarante, satin wood and gided bronze. A much simpler variety, the pupitre √† √©crire debut, of pulpit for writing while standing, arrived at about the same time. The finest models were usually made of oak and fir, covered with marquetry of rose wood, satin wood, and amaranth. They had small wheels to be moved around easily, had a locked compartment under the sloping top surface, and shelves below for large documents. The Secretaire en armoire was a larger and more vertical variation, based on the form of an armoire; it was a large chest with a writing surface that folded down and drawers and shelves inside. It was designed to stand against a wall, and appeared in about 1750. It often featured a marquetry in a geometric pattern resembling cubes of dark and light wood, a design very popular in the last years of the Louis XV period. The Bonheur-du-jour was a small desk with cabinet which appeared in about 1760. Following the new style of the late Louis XV period, it had no gilded bronze. It featured graceful curbed legs, but the top part was geometric, with delicate inlays of marquetry flowers. The most celebrated new type of desk invented under Louis XV was the Bureau √† cylindre or rolltop desk, which appeared in about 1760. The master of this form was Jean-Fran√ßois Oeben. It had no gilded bronze other than a delicate frieze around the top,; very fine marquetry of flowers, and an interior with secret compartments. Many variants were made, including the desk of Louis XV now on display at Versailles.

The form of the bed and its covering evolved under Louis XV. Early beds had four posts and a canopy suspended from a rectangual form on top. Under Louis XV, the Lit √† la polonaise (Polish bed) appeared, with a canopy suspended from a crownlike structure; and the Lit √† la Duchesse, where the canopy was supported only from one end. The bed was usually separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade, and stools were arranged outside the balustrade for the Court to witness the formal awakening. The famous Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1751‚Äì72) included images of beds √† la Polonaise, and √† la Turque (a more ornate and exotic version of the Duchesse) and a bed placed into an alcove.

The rocaille designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture. The Commodes became to have more geometric forms; the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs. The legs gradually changed from s-curves to straight, often modeled after Greek or Roman columns, tapering to a point. Common decorations included stylized pine cones, and knotted ribbons. A new type of tall cabinet, the Cartonnier, made its appearance between 1760 and 1765. It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads, and other classic, elements. The ebenistes Jean-Henri Riesener, Jean-Fran√ßois Leleu, Martin Carlin and David Roentgen and menuisier Georges Jacob were among the most important creators of the late Louis XV transition style. Their careers continued and reached their peak during the following reign of Louis XVI.

In response U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette claimed that Saudi Arabia would sign a Section 123 agreement restricting how Saudi Arabia could use nuclear technology. Saudi Arabia has also shortlisted firms in Russia, China, France, and South Korea as sources of nuclear power. On September 17, 2020, according to a Chinese confidential report, as seen by a popular US news media site, Saudi Arabia was identified to have enough uranium ore reserves to begin domestic production of nuclear fuel. It was found heading as another country in the Arab region, after the UAE, to begin its own Nuclear energy programme. = Nuclear weapons delivery = According to the BBC, Saudi Arabian attempts to acquire ballistic missiles capable of fielding a nuclear warhead go back several decades.

Although this genus was not as specialized as the eel- like pleurosaurs for aquatic life, various skeletal features support the idea that it had a semiaquatic lifestyle. The type species, Vadasaurus herzogi, was described and named in 2017. It was discovered in the Solnhofen Limestone in Germany, which is dated to the Late Jurassic. The generic name \\"Vadasaurus\\" is derived from \\"vadare\\", which is Latin for \\"to go\\" or \\"to walk forth\\", and \\"saurus\\", which means \\"lizard\\" (although rhynchocephalians are not lizards). \\"Vadare\\" is the root of the English word \\"wade\\", which is the reason it was chosen for this genus, in reference to its perceived semiaquatic habits. The specific name, \\"herzogi\\", refers to Werner Herzog, a Bavarian filmmaker.  Description  The holotype of Vadasaurus herzogi is AMNH FARB 32768, a well- preserved but slightly flattened skeleton which is practically complete. = Skull and teeth = The skull of the Vadasaurus specimen. The part of the skull in front of the eyes is rather short, but the rear part is long, with elongated temporal fenestrae (holes in the back of the skull). As a whole the skull is triangular in shape. The lower temporal fenestrae, on the sides of the skull, are very large, about a quarter the length of the entire skull. The premaxillae are not fused together, and each possess a large fang seemingly formed from three fused teeth. The front part of the premaxilla is very short, but the rear part is long, excluding the maxilla from the long nares (nostril holes). Each maxilla possesses about thirteen or fourteen acrodont teeth which are fused to the bone (as is typical for rhynchocephalians). The first six or seven teeth are tiny and simple. However, the latter seven are much larger and more complex. These teeth increase in size towards the back of the skull and possess a pointed cusp followed by a low ridge. The nasal bones on the top of the snout are thin and separate from each other at the back of the snout to make room for the triangular front edge of the frontals. The bones of the skull roof (frontals and parietals) are not fused to their respective pairs, and the parietals form a sagittal crest between the upper temporal fenestrae on the top of the skull. The parietal foramen (a hole which holds the \\"third eye\\" in modern tuataras) is teardrop-shaped. The postorbital, jugal, and squamosal bones on the side of the head curve upwards to form the bar between the upper and lower temporal fenestrae. The jugal lacks a \\"subtemporal extension\\" forming the bottom edge of the lower temporal fenestra, leaving the hole open from the bottom as if it was an arch. The squamosal also forms a large portion of the part of the skull behind the lower temporal fenestra, along with a thin and tall quadratojugal and a curved quadrate which probably supported a tympanic membrane (eardrum). The bones of the roof of the mouth are mostly obscured, but were partially revealed by a micro-CT scan of the specimen. Each of the palatines possess a row of teeth, although the form of such teeth cannot be determined. The palatines themselves are separated by the long and thin front parts of the pterygoids, which do not seem to possess teeth. The lower jaw is more shallow than those of other advanced sphenodontians, but not as much as that of Pleurosaurus. It is smoothly curved, with the front tip at a higher level than the lower edge. The front part of the jaw is toothless, but the rear part has a row of teeth. Each tooth possesses a cusp preceded by a long ridge and followed by a short ridge. The outer edge of the teeth have been partially worn away by contact with the maxillary teeth. = Spine, tail, and ribs = Life reconstruction The specimen preserves seven cervical (neck) vertebrae, sixteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, two sacral (hip) vertebrae, and forty-two caudal (tail) vertebrae. This gives Vadasaurus a very long tail. The neural spines on the top of the vertebrae (particularly the cervicals) are short and rectangular. The pre- and post-zygapophyses on the side of the vertebrae are swollen, making the vertebrae hourglass-shaped from above. Each rib is thinnest in the middle. A jumble of thin bones in the middle part of the body are probably the remains of gastralia (belly ribs) and components of a cartilaginous sternum. The sacral vertebrae are partially fused to each other. Most of the caudal vertebrae possess tapering ribs which are flattened from the side. The last few caudal vertebrae are thin and very simple. = Limbs and pelvis = The humerus is short but proportionally similar to that of other rhynchocephalians when compared to the body length of the animal. The hand possesses five fingers, with the longest being finger IV, followed by fingers III, II, V, and I. The phalangeal formula of the hand (which describes the number of bones in each finger starting with finger I) is ?-3-4-5-3. Each finger ends in a curved claw. The metacarpal (hand bone) corresponding to finger I is characteristically wide. The ilium is short and tapers towards the rear. The top edge of the pubis is large and rounded while the back edge is arched, creating a large thyroid fenestra between the pubis and ischium. The ischium is larger than the pubis and has a bony spur which could have connected to tail muscles. The femur is S-shaped but the finer details of its structure (as well as the structure of the tibia and fibula) are poorly developed. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) are unfused. Metatarsal I (the first foot bone) is short and wide while metatarsals II-IV are much longer. Metatarsal V is even shorter and wider, with a hooked outer edge. The phalangeal formula of the foot is 2-3-4-5-4, and each toe is long and ends in a curved claw, similar to those of the hand.  Classification  Vadasaurus herzogi is believed to be a close relative of the pleurosaurids according to a phylogenetic analysis published in its description. The clade comprising this genus and Pleurosauridae is itself allied with Kallimodon and Sapheosaurus. Although the structure of Rhynchocephalia as a whole is changeable depending on the methodology used in the analysis, the Vadasaurus + Pleurosauridae clade seems to be one of most well-supported parts of the whole order. The discovery of Vadasaurus helps to depict the evolution of the pleurosaurids. Although not technically a true pleurosaurid, Vadasaurus still possesses several features characteristic of the family, such as a long tail and nares, a wide metacarpal and metatarsal I, and limbs which are less well-ossified than those of other rhynchocephalians.  Paleobiology  Vadasaurus is believed to have been at least partially aquatic, perhaps similar in lifestyle to the Galapagos marine iguana, Amblyrhynchus cristatus. It possessed thicker and heavier ribs and gastralia which may have functioned as ballast. Although a large amount of skeletal evidence provides evidence for the idea that the holotype specimen of Vadasaurus died in adulthood, the epiphyses of its forelimb bones were not completely fused. This is further evidence for a semiaquatic lifestyle, as animals which spend a large portion of their time in the water do not experience the forces of terrestrial locomotion to the same extent as fully terrestrial animals. Although the limb bones of terrestrial animals strengthen during development, semiaquatic animals have less need for such strengthening, and as a lineage becomes more inclined to an aquatic lifestyle, the limbs become less inclined to fully ossify as they develop. Vadasaurus's not-fully- fused forelimbs are an intermediate form between the strong limbs of terrestrial rhynchocephalians and the weaker limbs of pleurosaurids.

Norton played club rugby with Bective Rangers, represented Leinster at provincial level, was capped 11 times for Ireland, and was a member of the British Lions team that toured in 1950. Rugby career Norton picked up the game of rugby while in school at St Mary's College, Dublin. He joined St Mary's College RFC but struggled to displace his brother Austin from the team for his preferred position of fullback. Switching codes to play for Shamrock Rovers for a year or so, he moved club to Bective Rangers where he spent the remainder of his playing career. A first appearance for the provincial Leinster team came in 1947. In Ireland's first game of the 1949 Five Nations Championship against France, Norton started the game at fullback to make his international debut. He went on to play in all four of Ireland's games in that year's tournament, which culminated with Ireland being crowned champions and clinching the Triple Crown. During the tournament, Norton scored a total of 26 points, then a record for most points scored by a player in a single championship. The Barbarians invitation team included Norton in their 1949 Easter tour, where he played in two matches against Penarth and Newport. He again featured in all four of Ireland's matches in the 1950 Five Nations, which led to his inclusion in the British Lions squad that was selected to tour New Zealand and Australia later that year. Norton appeared in three out of the first five games that the Lions played on tour against local opposition teams, but sustained an injury in that third game against Southland that ended his participation in the tour. Norton returned to play for Ireland in the 1951 Five Nations Championship. He featured in the first three of Ireland's games against France, England and Scotland but suffered an injury in that game against Scotland resulted in him being unable to play in their final game of the tournament against Wales. Ireland again clinched the Championship, but the shoulder injury was serious enough to force Norton to give up playing rugby. Post-playing career Following his retirement from playing the game, Norton took up refereeing. He also was president of Bective Rangers. In 1998, he was inducted into the Rugby Writers of Ireland Hall of Fame.

The yacht was originally built for Chester W. Chapin, a rail baron and U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts. It completed several ocean cruises with no accidents. It passed through several hands and ultimately was purchased by Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany as a birthday present for his wife. He had another larger yacht built based on the design of the Yampa, which was named the Meteor III.  History  The Yampa was a yacht originally designed by naval architect Archibald Cary Smith for Chester W. Chapin, and the steel- keeled schooner was constructed in 1887 by the firm Harlan and Hollingsworth in Wilmington, Delaware, four years after Chapin died. She was considered the best in her class until 1891. The Yampa was overall, at the water line, and her draft was . She had a registered tonnage of 162 tons net and 170 gross, with a beam of . She participated in various events related to the America's Cup, a trophy award for best in a match race between two sailing yachts of different countries. American banker James Hood Wright used the Yampa for pleasure cruising in the summer of 1894. Chapin sold her that November to Richard Suydam Palmer who had memberships in various yacht clubs, and he refitted her in December 1894. The Yampa sailed for Gibraltar on January 18, 1895, and from there she went to Tunis and Algiers in Africa. She then sailed to Malta and other ports in the Mediterranean Sea. She made several ocean cruises from 1894 through 1895 with no significant accidents, and sailors referred to this as \\"sea-kindliness.\\" In February 1896, Palmer traveled with the Yampa for three months to the West Indies, stopping at Bermuda, Barbados, Trinidad, St. Thomas, and Nassau. Cuthbert S. Thompson, who was a cousin of Palmer, committed suicide in Bermuda aboard the yacht while Palmer's guest in March on the West Indies trip. Palmer took her to Southampton in England in 1897 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From there, he went through the North Sea and was towed to Kiel, Germany by way of the Kiel Canal. There the yacht anchored close to the German Emperor's yacht SMY Hohenzollern. The emperor liked the schooner and sought to purchase it. Palmer had left his business card on the SMY Hohenzollern and was informed that the emperor talked all day about how he liked the American vessel. The emperor immediately then took steps to acquire her for himself, and bought the yacht from Palmer in December 1897. The schooner was a birthday present for his wife Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The ship went to Southampton to be refitted to the emperor's luxurious specifications. The German Royal family took many cruises on the Yampa which carried the Empress's flag; she was renamed Iduna and participated in several European regattas. In 1898, she competed in the international Emperor‚Äôs Cup regatta. That same year, she was outfitted to race against the schooner Rainbow. The emperor had another yacht built based on the design of the Yampa, using Smith as the naval architect, and he had the yacht constructed in America instead of Germany. The new vessel Meteor III was an enlarged and improved version of the Yampa, and was the end result of a sequence of previous vessels designed and built by Smith. Meteor III was built in New York harbor in 1902, and christened by Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt. When the Meteor III was ordered in 1901 the Iduna, previously the Yampa, became the property of the emperor's wife. The Iduna participated in various races into 1909. The Induna and the Meteor III were sold in the early part of 1920 and the proceeds as a wedding present went to German crown prince Wilhelm, the heir to Kaiser Wilhelm II.

Biography  A native of T≈çbetsu, Hokkaido and graduate of the University of Tokyo, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time in 1993. Arai had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the office of former Governor of Hokkaido Takahiro Yokomichi, before retiring in 1993 to run in that year's general election. Arai managed to win a seat in his native Hokkaido and entered the House of Representatives, marking the start of his political career. A liberal politician, Arai has always been affiliated with centre-left parties, even in the turbulent Japanese political landscape where parties boom and bust and alliances change often. Arai lost in his first contest for his current Hokkaido-6th seat in 1996, but won the district in 2000. Since then, Arai would win another three times (2003, 2009 and 2017) and lost three times (2005, 2012 and 2014) in this seat. As his vote share was still considerably high in the races he lost, he always managed to return to the diet via the PR list. Arai had run in a seat outside the Diet once. He quit his seat mid-term in 2007 to run for the 2007 Hokkaido gubernatorial election against incumbent Harumi Takahashi, but lost. Two years outside Parliament, he ran again in his old seat in 2009, defeating incumbent Gaku Ishizaki by a large margin in an election that brought his party into government. Subsequent Prime Ministers Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan would bring Arai into their administrations. He served as a Special Adviser in the Hatoyama government and Minister of State in the Kan government. After leaving the Cabinet, Arai served in several Diet committees. Arai is also a staunch opponent of the closures of JR Hokkaido's local routes. In 2016, he led a pressure campaign against the closure, forcing Governor Takahashi to launch a review into the policy.

Lake Opataca is part of a group of lakes at the head of the Assinica River. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The nearest forest road is located at south-east of the lake, the road skirting Mount Op√©misca from the north; this road joins Southbound on route 113 connecting Lebel-sur-Qu√©villon to Chibougamau and the Canadian National Railway. The surface of Opataca Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally mid-November to mid-April.  Geography Toponymy The term \\"Assinica\\" has been assigned by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec to the lake, the river and the Wildlife Reserve. Of Cree origin, the term \\"Assinica\\" derives from the term \\"Asinikaw\\", whose roots are \\"asini, pierre and kaw\\" (verbal suffix equivalent to the verb \\"to be\\" in French), meaning \\"filled with stones\\". The old map documents indicate that prior to 1932 the term applied to a set of lakes on the same hydrographic slope. Today, Assinica now only refers to the most westerly hydrographic entity. The spelling of the place name Assinica has long been spelled \\"Assinika\\". Covering an area of 8,885 km¬≤, the Assinica Wildlife Refuge encircles the lake.Source: \\"Names and Places of Qu√©bec\\", a work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a dictionary illustrated printed, and under that of a CD-ROM made by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

Much of the valley is in the Connemara Gaeltacht. Location and topography The valley runs north-northwest from An M√°m (also known, unofficially, in English, as Maum or Maam) and the north-western end of Lough Corrib to just south of Leenaun (also known in English as Leenane) on Killary Harbour. Starting near its northern end, the valley holds the main course of the Joyce River, coming down from the western flanks to pick up small tributaries. In turn this river is subsumed into the Bealnabrack River, also coming from the valley's western side, near An M√°m, and then the combined river absorbs the Failmore River and some small streams before merging into Lough Corrib. The valley passes through part of the Maamturk or Maum Turk Mountains. There is a pass, the Mamean or Mameen Pass, crossing part of the mountains to another major valley, the Inagh Valley. Access The valley is bisected by the R336, which splits off from the R59 at Maam Cross and rejoins it at Leenaun. Population centres At the southern end is the small settlement of An M√°m, and at the northern end, though some argue strictly speaking outside the valley, is Leenaun. An M√°m has an active pub, and Leenaun has a pub, hotel and guest house, caf√© and restaurants, outdoor leisure centre and community centre, and more again at the nearby Delphi Resort and Delphi Lodge across the fjord. There are small pockets of population in the valley. Nearby are Cornamona and Clonbur. Popular culture The Maam Valley features in famous film The Quiet Man, with the Quiet Man Cottage located near An M√°m. Science The valley, formed around a fault, and modified by heavy glaciation, is considered of geological interest. In January 2018 a fossil found in the valley in the 1990s was declared to be a distinct species and named for its finder Dr Eamon N. Doyle. This find attracted international attention, and a well-known Irish nature writer, Michael Viney, suggested that it advanced the case for a Maam Valley and Joyce Country Geopark, on the lines of the successful Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark.Dublin, Ireland: The Irish Times: Viney, Michael, \\"Ireland's rocks remarkablly rich in evidence of ancient sea life\\": \\"Crepidosoma doylei, soon for display in the National Museum, may justify a fourth geopark in Maam Valley and the hills of Joyce Country.\\" Religion There was an old pilgrimage site in the Mamean Pass above the valley.

After being restored from 1926 onwards, it has been used as a Jugendburg. Neuerburg, 2017 aerial photograph  History  The first definite record of the hillside castle was in 1132, when a Theoderic of Neuerburg witnessed a deed of gift. The castle was certainly older than that because, in 1270, the Count of Vianden and Herrschaft of Neuerburg were described as an old fief of his house, which he himself was enfeoffed with by the Count of Luxemburg. An older document about the second Norman invasion of 892 mentions a newly built castle into which the monks of Pr√ºm Abbey fled. But this could refer to any one of several castles in the Eifel region. Neuerburg and its outer ring of fortifications Plan of the castle dated 1927, indicating important construction periods The importance of the castle is indicated by the fact that, in 1332, it gave town rights to the town located at its feet. That same year, Frederick III, the last lord of Neuerburg, died. In the following years, its lordship changed hands several times. Substantial expansion measures, making it more like a fortress, were then carried out between 1513 and 1540 by Dietrich IV, Count of Manderscheid-Blankenheim, Lord of Schleiden, Daun, Neuenstein, Kronenburg and Neuerburg etc. This line of rulers held the castle and its estate until its dissolution by French Revolutionary troops in 1794, when the bastions were built as part of the expansion measures for artillery. Particularly noteworthy is the transition from round bastions (southwest bastions) to polygonal bastions (northern bastions), which took place during this construction phase. The wall thicknesses were increased as part of this building work until they finally reached about 5.5 metres. This process is unusual for such an old castle, as it was now built like a fortress. Nevertheless, a residential wing was added. Its importance as a fortress is emphasized, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648), because at the outset it was repaired and stocked with munitions and then made ready to defend against Swedish, Dutch, Irish, Polish and French troops. However, the Luxembourg troops who were garrisoned for its defence behaved so badly that even they had to be defended against. The castle, however, prevented these troops from pillaging. The years that followed were dominated by wars (War of the Palatine Succession, Franco- Dutch War), so that the castle was further upgraded and fortified), but also attacked. 1692 was a decisive year because the fortifications were blown up by the French. Some of its facilities were rebuilt in 1701, but not to its former splendour. The final end came with the Coalition Wars when the castle was seized by the French and auctioned off to raise money for the state coffers. Its stones were sold after the great fire of 1818 and used elsewhere. The castle then came into municipal ownership and was used as an almshouse, archive and gaol until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1926, the Bund Neudeutschland acquired the castle as part of an Erbpacht contract and had it partially rebuilt. As a result of numerous conversions, a mezzanine was created between the ground floor and the first floor, which often acted as a hiding place and refuge. These rooms can still be accessed today through hidden entrances.  Present use  The castle is maintained today by Bund Neudeutschland (with its HQ in Cologne), as a Jugendburg and youth hostel, managed by the Krump family. The inner courtyard, castle chapel and ruins are freely accessible to the public.

Their westerly limits were at Spring Vale. To their southeast the territory went as far as Farrars Creek. Connemara and Brighton Downs were part of Maiawali lands.

It's a warning to me.\\" = 12 Rules = The book is divided into chapters with each title representing one of the following twelve specific rules for life as explained through an essay. # \\"Stand up straight with your shoulders back\\" # \\"Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping\\" # \\"Make friends with people who want the best for you\\" # \\"Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today\\" # \\"Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them\\" # \\"Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world\\" # \\"Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)\\" # \\"Tell the truth ‚Äî or, at least, don‚Äôt lie\\" # \\"Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don‚Äôt\\" # \\"Be precise in your speech\\" # \\"Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding\\" # \\"Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street\\" = Content = The founding idea is that \\"suffering is built into the structure of being;\\" although it can be unbearable, people have a choice either to withdraw, which is a \\"suicidal gesture,\\" or to face and transcend it. However, living in a world of chaos and order, each human being has \\"darkness\\" that can \\"turn them into the monsters they're capable of being\\" to satisfy their dark impulses in the right situations. Scientific experiments like the Invisible Gorilla Test show that perception is adjusted to aims, and it is better to seek meaning rather than happiness. Peterson notes: > [I]t's all very well to think the meaning of life is happiness, but what > happens when you're unhappy? Happiness is a great side effect. When it > comes, accept it gratefully. But it's fleeting and unpredictable. It's not > something to aim at ‚Äì because it's not an aim. And if happiness is the > purpose of life, what happens when you're unhappy? Then you're a failure. The book advances the idea that people are born with the instinct for ethics and meaning, and should take responsibility to search for meaning above their own interests (chapter 8, rule 7, \\"Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient\\"). Such thinking is reflected both in contemporary stories such as Pinocchio, The Lion King, and Harry Potter, and in ancient stories from the Bible. To \\"Stand up straight with your shoulders back\\" (chapter 1, rule 1) is to \\"accept the terrible responsibility of life,\\" to make self-sacrifice, because the individual must rise above victimization and \\"conduct his or her life in a manner that requires the rejection of immediate gratification, of natural and perverse desires alike.\\" The comparison to neurological structures and behavior of lobsters is used as a natural example to the formation of social hierarchies. The other parts of the work explore and criticize the state of young men; the upbringing that ignores sex differences between boys and girls (criticism of over-protection and tabula rasa model in social sciences); male‚Äìfemale interpersonal relationships; school shootings; religion and moral nihilism; relativism; and the lack of respect for the values that build Western society. In the last chapter, Peterson outlines the ways in which one can cope with the most tragic events in one's life, events that are often out of that individual's control. In it, he describes his own personal struggle upon discovering that his daughter, Mikhaila, had a rare bone disease. The chapter is a meditation on how to maintain a watchful eye on, and cherish, life's small redeemable qualities (i.e., to \\"pet a cat when you encounter one\\"). It also outlines a practical way to deal with hardship: to shorten one's temporal scope of responsibility (e.g., focusing on the next minute rather than the next three months). Norman Doidge, a Canadian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, penned the book's foreword. Publication=Marketing= Jordan Peterson speaking at an event in Dallas, Texas, in June 2018 To promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour, initially from January 14, 2018 to February 17, 2018, including events in England, Canada, and the United States. The sold-out venues included 1,000-seat conference hall Emmanuel Centre in London, and 2,000-seat Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The February 11 event at Citadel Theatre in Edmonton was cancelled by the theatre's board of directors and management for which they later apologized, and instead was held at a sold-out Hyatt Place. The second part included three sold-out events in March in Australia, continuing at Beacon Theatre in New York, and the third part held between early May and June initially numbering ten events in the United States and Canada, and one in the United Kingdom. Reportedly, until June the tour visited 45 cities in North America, Europe and Australia, reaching an audience of over 100,000 people. According to Peterson, nearly 200,000 people have attended the live events until late July. As part of the tour, Peterson had an interview on Channel 4 News which went viral, receiving considerable attention and over ten million views on YouTube. He also appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC's HARDtalk; LBC's Maajid Nawaz radio show; Fox & Friends and Tucker Carlson Tonight; ABC's 7.30; Sky News Australia's Outsiders; HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher; and The Dr. Oz Show, among others. =Release= The book was published by Penguin Allen Lane on January 16, 2018, in the United Kingdom (as Penguin Press covers the UK and Commonwealth), and by Random House Canada (which covers North America) on January 23 in Canada. According to Peterson's website, , the book was slated to be translated into 45 languages. The 12 Rules for Life audiobook was number one on Audible in Canada, and number three in the US. In Canada, since its debut, it topped the non-fiction category of The Globe and Mail and Toronto Star bestsellers lists. According to CBC Books, who based their data on 300 independent bookstores compiled by Bookmanager, it was the 4th bestselling Canadian book of the year. According to Toronto Star it was the \\"biggest Canadian book success story of the year,\\" topping original non-fiction and Canadian non-fiction categories, with only Canadian poet writer Rupi Kaur having similar sales. According to Publishers Weekly, Kobo Inc. reported that it was the 2nd bestselling audiobook of the year in Canada, whereas per BookNet Canada and BNC SalesData the print book was 3rd and Peterson was the bestselling Canadian author of the year. In the United Kingdom for five weeks topped The Sunday Times bestsellers list for general hardcover between February 18 and March 25, and again on April 15, selling over 120,000 copies until September 16, 2018. According to The Sunday Times the hardback edition was 4th in general hardbacks category with 153,160 copies sold until the end of the year. According to The Guardian, the Nielsen BookScan reported sales of 147,899 copies, being 32nd bestselling book of the year. According to The Guardian, the Nielsen BookScan reported sales of over 10,000 copies until March 12 in Australia. According to The Irish Times, in Ireland it was the 23rd bestselling book of the year with 14,408 copies. In the US, the book became the No. 1 nonfiction book and ebook on The Wall Street Journals Best- Selling Books list, it also topped The Washington Post, and Reuters US bestsellers list, reached No. 2 on USA Todays overall list, as well as topping hardcover nonfiction and top 10 overall category for Publishers Weekly, selling over 559,000 copies until September 24, 2018. In the category it replaced Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury. At the end of the year the hardcover version was the 11th bestselling book with 692,238 copies. Penguin Random House's CEO Markus Dohle in late March stated the book has already sold over 700,000 copies in the US. The book did not chart on The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and IndieBound bestsellers list. According to books editor Deborah Dundas from Toronto Star, The NYT stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company. According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the US market. On August 6, Jordan Peterson announced the book had sold over 2 million copies. On January 13, 2019, Jordan Peterson announced the book had sold about 3 million copies. As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life. In March 2019, Whitcoulls, one of New Zealand's leading book retailers, temporarily removed the book from their stores and online catalogue, apparently in reaction to the Christchurch mosque shootings. The withdrawal of Peterson's book was prompted by social media photos of Peterson posing with a fan wearing a T-shirt saying \\"I'm a proud Islamophobe.\\" Peterson and his supporters strongly criticized Whitcoulls's decision because Whitcoulls continued to sell Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and Henry Malone's Islam Unmasked. Peterson's book was reinstated six days after it was removed. Reception Melanie Reid, in her review of 12 Rules for Life for The Times, says the book is \\"aimed at teenagers, millennials and young parents.\\" Summarising it, she states: \\"If you peel back the verbiage, the cerebral preening, you are left with a hardline self-help manual of self-reliance, good behaviour, self-betterment and individualism that probably reflects [Peterson's] childhood in rural Canada in the 1960s.\\" Bryan Appleyard, also writing for The Times, describes the book as \\"a less dense and more practical version of Maps of Meaning.\\" He says it is \\"a baggy, aggressive, in-your-face, get-real book that, ultimately, is an attempt to lead us back to what Peterson sees as the true, the beautiful and the good ‚Äì i.e., God.\\" Hari Kunzru of The Guardian said the book collates advice from Peterson's clinical practice with personal anecdotes, accounts of his academic work as a psychologist and \\"a lot of intellectual history of the 'great books' variety\\", but the essays on the rules are explained in an overly-complicated style. Kunzru described Peterson as sincere, but found the book irritating because he considers Peterson to have failed to adhere to his own rules. Tim Lott, in an interview with Peterson for The Guardian, described the book as atypical for the self-help genre. A similar opinion was expressed by Barbara Danza of Epoch Times. Bill Jamieson, in a joint review with Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Now for The Scotsman, praised the essays for being \\"richly illustrated and packed with excellent advice on how we can restore meaning and a sense of progression to our everyday lives\\", describing both books as \\"verbal waterboarding for supporters of big government\\". David Brooks of The New York Times argued \\"The Peterson way is a harsh way, but it is an idealistic way ‚Äì and for millions of young men, it turns out to be the perfect antidote to the cocktail of coddling and accusation in which they are raised\\". Joe Humphreys of The Irish Times argued people shouldn't be stopped \\"from reading what is a veritable powerhouse of a book: wise, provocative, humorous and also maddeningly contradictory (as all deep and truthful studies of human nature must be)\\". Glenn Ellmers in Claremont Review of Books noted that Peterson \\"does not shrink from telling readers that life means pain and suffering. His deft exposition, however, makes clear that duty is often liberating and responsibility can be a gift\\". Dorothy Cummings McLean, writing for the online magazine The Catholic World Report, considered it as \\"the most thought-provoking self-help book I have read in years\\", the rules for life reminding her of those by Bernard Lonergan, and content \\"serving as a bridge between Christians and non-Christians interested in the truths of human life and in resisting the lies of ideological totalitarianism\\". Bishop Robert Barron in a review for the same magazine praised the archetypal reading of the story about Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden with Jesus representing \\"gardener\\", and the psychological exploration of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and The Gulag Archipelago; but was not supportive of its \\"gnosticizing tendency to read Biblical religion purely psychologically and philosophically and not at all historically\\" or the idea that \\"God ... [is] simply a principle or an abstraction\\". It is \\"valuable for the beleaguered young men in our society, who need a mentor to tell them to stand up straight and act like heroes\\". Adam A. J. DeVille took a very different view, describing the 12 Rules for Life as \\"unbearably banal, superficial, and insidious\\", claiming \\"the real danger in this book is its apologia for social Darwinism and bourgeois individualism covered over with a theological patina\\" and that \\"in a just world, this book would never have been published\\". Ron Dart, in a review for The Ormsby Review, considered the book \\"an attempt to articulate a more meaningful order for freedom as an antidote to the erratic ... chaos of our age\\", but although \\"necessary\\" with exemplary advice for men and women it is \\"hardly a sufficient text for the tougher questions that beset us on our all too human journey and should be read as such.\\" Julian Baggini, in a review of the book for the Financial Times, writes: \\"In headline form, most of his rules are simply timeless good sense.... The problem is that when Peterson fleshes them out, they carry more flab than meat\\". Peter Hitchens, writing for The Spectator, stated he did not like the \\"conversational and accessible\\" writing style and amount of \\"recapitulation,\\" but believed it had \\"moving moments,\\" \\"good advice\\" with a message \\"aimed at people who have grown up in the post- Christian West\\" with special appeal to young men. Park MacDougald of New York shared a similar view, stating that on paper Peterson lacks \\"coherence, emotional depth\\" compared to lectures, but \\"still, he produces nuggets of real insight.\\" Pankaj Mishra's review in The New York Review of Books described 12 Rules as a repackaged collection of pieties and late-nineteenth century Jungian mysticism which has been discredited by the modern field of psychology. Mishra compared the book, and Peterson's ideas, to historical authors who influenced Peterson, but whose serious moral failings, including racism and fascism, Peterson fails to address. He criticizes Peterson's book for failing to recognize how traditionalism and myth can be used in support of demagoguery and anti-democratic ideas, and claims Peterson's work is a symptom of the problems it attempts to cure. Peterson responded to the review on Twitter, claiming Mishra's reviews contained \\"half-truths.\\" Peterson tweeted \\"If you were in my room at the moment, I'd slap you happily.\\" In a review for Psychology Today, philosopher Paul Thagard described the work as flimsy and says Peterson's views fail to stand up to philosophical scrutiny. According to Thagard, \\"If you go for Christian mythology, narrow-minded individualism, obscure metaphysics, and existentialist angst, then Jordan Peterson is the philosopher for you. But if you prefer evidence and reason, look elsewhere.\\" Psychologist John Grohol, writing for PsychCentral, said the book's basic advice was sound, self-evident, and harmless, but he could not recommend it because Peterson justified his advice with rambling tangential anecdotes and religious dogma instead of scientific data. Guy Stevenson, writing for Los Angeles Review of Books, said Peterson's work was widely ignored by serious academics, in part because of the absurdity of some of his claims regarding \\"cultural Marxists,\\" but his level of celebrity had not been seen since Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s. According to Stevenson, Peterson's practical advice and Jungian mysticism both reflect a new counterculture movement which is similar to the 1960s. He described 12 Rules as aggressive and over-eager to blame problems on \\"bogeymen,\\" and recommends as an alternative the work of John Gray, who has addressed some of the same issues with more thoughtfulness. Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker noted: David A. French of National Review considered it as a \\"beacon of light\\" for current time, with a simple but profound purpose \\"to help a person look in the mirror and respect the person he or she sees.\\" Some critics, such as Heather Wilhelm for National Review and James Grainger for the Toronto Star, were critical of initial negative reviews which they believed had misinterpreted Peterson. In September 2018, Peterson threatened to sue Cornell University philosopher Kate Manne for defamation after she described his work as misogynistic in an interview done with Vox. Manne described it as an attempt to chill free speech. Vox considered the threat baseless, and it was ignored. In a critique often shared by prominent intellectual Noam Chomsky, Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs calls Peterson a \\"charlatan\\" who gives \\"the most elementary fatherly life-advice\\" while adding \\"convolutions to disguise the simplicity of his mind.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 12 Rules for Life ‚Äì Peterson's website * 12 Rules for Life ‚Äì Penguin United Kingdom * 12 Rules for Life ‚Äì Penguin Random House Canada * 12 Rules For Life by Jordan B.

He argues that the referendum was fought on the basis of misleading information and so it would not be undemocratic for the UK to change its mind about the result. The book addresses the issue of how to prevent Brexit through tactical voting and also suggests ways in which the referendum result could ultimately lead to a beneficial reform of the EU. Reception Writing for The Independent, Andrew Grice recommended the book to any remain voters \\"feeling as gloomy as Philip Hammond looks\\".

The Samjiyon Band performs traditional European classical music, instrumental, percussion, and sung pieces, ranging from orchestral to solos. It has been said that calling the \\"band\\" an orchestra would be more fitting. Uncommonly for a North Korean orchestra of its kind, the Samjiyon Band is led by a woman, Ri Sune. The band is part of the umbrella organization Mansudae Art Troupe. The history of the band began in 2009 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-il ordered the band to be formed. Later, several members of the band joined in a new Moranbong Band. When the current leader Kim Jong-un began promoting the latter band, popularity of the Samjiyon Band began to decline. While live performances of the band are numerous, it is not clear if they have ever released any records. It is currently unknown if the band has any relation to the Samjiyon Orchestra that performed at the start of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Multiple foreign observers, including officials from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, expect the two musical groups to be related someway. Naming The band is named after the town of Samjiyon, Ryanggang Province near Mount Paektu that is symbolic of the Kim dynasty. In North Korean propaganda, the town is portrayed as a \\"sacred site of the revolution\\", where the founding leader Kim Il-sung won an important battle against the Japanese and where his son Kim Jong-il was born. History Kim Il-sung statue at Samjiyon Grand Monument in Samjiyon, the namesake of the band The Samjiyon Band was created in January 2009 by Kim Jong-il, who had changed his policy toward musical groups since he had a stroke in 2008. The band was created from musicians of the Merited Women's Instrumental Ensemble of the Mansudae Art Troupe, an umbrella organization of North Korean artists. The Moranbong Band was formed from members of the Samjiyon Band and debuted in 2012. The future members of the Moranbong Band had been performing together in the Samjiyon Band since at least September 2009. Previously, the Samjiyon Band was considered more sophisticated of the two by North Korean artists, but since the leader Kim Jong-un began promoting the Moranbong Band, the popularity of the Samjiyon has waned and the band has even \\"fallen into relative obscurity\\". Accordingly, a 2018 defector testimony of a performing arts graduate says: \\"Many beautiful 'princess-like' girls appeared in the Samjiyon Band, but typically you hear of them moving up to the Moranbong Band or Unhasu Orchestra.\\" In February 2018, the Orchestra performed in South Korea, marking the first time in 12 years that any North Korean Orchestra had done so. Band The Samjiyon Band remains part of the umbrella organization Mansudae Art Troupe. The Samjiyon Band itself is a chamber orchestra of young musicians who perform mostly classical music. They perform separately from other Mansudae Art Troupe groups. The Samjiyon Band performs traditional European classical music, instrumental, percussion, and sung pieces, ranging from orchestral to solos. They play mostly classical instruments, including wind and string instruments, such as violin, cello, harp, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, flute, and timpani, with the occasional piano, accordion, and saxophone. Although titled a \\"band\\", \\"[i]t would have been fair to call the Samjiyon Band an orchestra because the band [includes] cellos, violins, and other orchestral instruments\\", according to a defector. It sometimes performs together with foreign performers as part of cultural exchange, including a 2011 concert conducted by Pavel Ovsyannikov. Live performances of the Samjiyon Band are numerous, including a recent performance during 2017 New Year's celebration. It is not known if the Samjiyon Band has released any records; their music is known abroad only through videos on YouTube. =Members= Hyon Song-wol, leader of the Samjiyon Orchestra The band has between 50 and 60 members, \\"winners of national and international contests and excellent graduates from Pyongyang Kim Won Gyun Conservatory\\". The band members are in their 20s or 30s. The leader of the band in 2017 was Ri Sune (), a female violinist. She also conducted the band. It is rare for a North Korean orchestra of its kind to be led by a woman. In 2018 the leader of the Samjiyon Orchestra that visited South Korea was Hyon Song-wol, another female artist and lead singer of Moranbong Band. The band members have \\"long elaborately arranged hair that fit well with evening dress and classical music\\". Although North Korean bands routinely rotate members, some affiliations appear to be long-term. Such is the case of violinist Hong Su-kyong in the Samjiyon Band, for instance. =List of members of the Samjiyon Band= *Ri Sune (conductor, leader) *Suno Hyang-hui (violin) *Hong Su-kyong (violin) Samjiyon Orchestra Samjiyon Orchestra performing in Seoul, South Korea The Samjiyon Band is possibly distinct from the Samjiyon Orchestra, but the two groups seem to be closely related. The Samjiyon Orchestra was hastily founded ahead of inter-Korean high-level talks concerning North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea for the purpose of performing during the Games. The Orchestra performed in the South at the start of the Games. Two months later, the Samjiyon Orchestra performed in Pyongyang together with South Korean musicians in the Spring is Coming concert tour that brought together artists from both countries. The orchestra might be formed from members of the original Samjiyon Band, with additional members. This opinion is shared by multiple observers, including the South Korean Ministry of Unification, and defectors familiar with the cultural circles. Jeon Young-sun of the Institute of the Humanities for Unification at the Konkuk University points out that because North Korean groups are under government control, it is easy to reorganize them keeping some of the original elements and adding new ones on an ad hoc basis. =List of members of the Samjiyon Orchestra= *Hyon Song-wol (leader) See also *Unhasu Orchestra *Music of North Korea *List of North Korean musicians References=Works cited= * Further reading * External links North Korean musical groups Musical groups established in 2009 2009 establishments in North Korea ","title":"Samjiyon Band"},{"id":"56485533","text":"Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjiƒá were the defending champions, but lost in the first round to Robin Haase and Matw√© Middelkoop.

Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (No. 1:17-cv-22568-MGC) is a federal case brought before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The plaintiffs, including Arthenia Joyner, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, and others, sought to enjoin the State of Florida from transferring voter records to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. After the Commission was disbanded, Kris Kobach, the vice chairman, announced his intent to turn the records over to the United States Department of Homeland Security.  Background  On November 20, 2016, President Trump asked Kobach to co-chair a commission (\\"Pence-Kobach Commission\\" or \\"PAEC\\") to investigate possible voting irregularities in the 2016 Presidential Election. Kobach is a defendant in a parallel lawsuit filed by Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). On June 28, 2017, the Commission requested voter records from each of the states and the District of Columbia. Forty-four states rejected the request to deliver voter records On July 10, 2017, the Commission postponed its request of the states. Specific allegations * The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (‚ÄúPence-Kobach Commission‚Äù) violates the procedural requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 5 U.S.C. app. 2 ¬ß¬ß1-16  Latest Developments and Next Steps  On January 3, 2018, President Donald J. Trump terminated the Commission by executive order. That same day, Kobach gave media interviews in which he indicated that the Commission's preliminary findings would be sent to the United States Department of Homeland Security. On January 5, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for injunction to prevent the transfer of any documents from the Commission to any other persons. On January 9, 2018, the court ordered the government to clarify whether the state voter data would be sent to DHS. In response to the plaintiffs' motion, the United States Department of Justice stated that the state voter data would not be turned over to DHS. The DOJ stated that Kris Kobach could not speak about the disposition of the Commission's documents on behalf of the government. As a result, the court ordered the government to produce Kobach or another Commission member to explain what had happened with the documents, and whether they had or would be given to DHS or any other person or entity. As a result of the litigation, the White House has stated that the state voter data will be destroyed. ReferencesExternal links Donald Trump litigation ","title":"Joyner v.

After 1 month, the movie earned more than 60 billion VND in theatrical revenues. At 20th Vietnam Film Festival, The Tailor won two awards, including an award from the judge. It was selected as the Vietnamese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot The re-enactment of a long dress era in the 1960s is thought to be the heyday of traditional Vietnamese costumes. Interwoven into that transformation in the style and style of the √°o d√†i in modern times are told through the story of Miss Ba. Audiences will also see somewhere the image of the 1960s‚Äì70s full of honest women. An image of Saigon in the past, gentle and steeped in contrast to the rush of a dynamic city will be described by fashion, namely √°o d√†i. All of them are cleverly nested in the story between two families, between mothers and their children, between a tailor and a fabric shop filled with dramatic rage. = Main plot = In 1969, the tailor house Thanh Nu is considered to be the most famous tailor house in Sai Gon. Nine generations of the family have spent their entire life tailoring ao dai. The owner who is Thanh Mai has two daughters: Nhu Y who is her biological daughter and Thanh Loan who was adopted. Thanh Loan enjoys tailoring ao dai while Nhu Y prefers designing Westernized outfits, since she claims ao dai is old-fashioned and doesn't have variety of designs. Thanh Mai advises Nhu Y to focus on learning how to make ao dai but she neglects, because she only likes Western style. One day, Thanh Mai uses a unique piece of fabric passed down from her ancestor, to make a beautiful ao dai. Nhu Y sees it (due to her name is embroidered on that ao dai) and decides to try it on. Strange thing happens as soon as she tries it, the piece of jade sends her to the year of 2017. Nhu Y falls on An Khanh (as Nhu Y in 2017) as she is about to attempt suicide, causing the piece of jade to detach from the ao dai. Nhu Y is shocked to know that the tailor house Thanh Nu has been closed and barely believes that An Khanh is her in the future, and how Sai Gon has become greatly modernized. Her house is empty and quiet. It's revealed that after Thanh Mai had died, Thanh Loan was told to leave the house by An Khanh so An Khanh could open a Western tailor house, however the business failed shortly afterward. This causes An Khanh to become an alcoholic. Thanh Loan opened her own business mainly focusing on tailoring ao dai, she later has two kids: Helen and Tuan. Helen is a famous fashion designer while Tuan is working at Helen's company. Helen agrees to help An Khanh keep the house, however Nhu Y must work for her in exchange. Nhu Y works as a cleaner while Tuan helps her adapt to modern life. The company needs some 1960s inspired designs which is An Khanh's specialty so she helps Helen. Being impressed by Nhu Y's talent, Helen assigns her to ao dai designing. This is her big challenge since she has always hated ao dai and doesn't know how to do that. At the same time, she would like to tailor ao dai following Thanh Nu's traditional way, which will help Thanh Nu regain its reputation. An Khanh meets Thanh Loan in order to apologize and ask Thanh Loan how to tailor ao dai properly. Later, Thanh Loan gives An Khanh an envelope which is the letter from Thanh Mai attaching ao dai tailoring method. An Khanh and Nhu Y together practice on how to make ao dai. In the fashion event, model Trang Ngo and many models wear Nhu Y's collection on the catwalk. While the show is going on, Helen intends to switch Nhu Y as the designer into her name in the script, however Tuan catches and confronts her to carefully consider about her decision. Finally, the show is a success as Nhu Y expresses her thought on the collection, sends her thank to Helen. Right after that, the tailor house Thanh Nu is reopened. Nhu Y wears the ao dai with the piece of jade attached, the magical jade sends her back to 1969. She meets her mom again and apologizes her, saying she's knows how to make ao dai. Both of them joyfully dance together.  Cast  * Ninh Duong Lan Ngoc as Nhu Y, Thanh Mai's daughter, who is passionate about Western fashion and wants to get rid of traditional values by not wanting to become ao dai tailor * H·ªìng V√¢n as An Khanh, Nhu Y in the year of 2017 * Ngo Thanh Van as Nhu Y's mother. * Diem My as Thanh Loan * Diem My 9X as Helen * S.T 365 as Tuan * Oanh Kieu as young Thanh Loan * Tung Leo as Hien * Hai Trieu as Baby Nana * Kaylee Hwang as Ngoc * Thanh Tu as Thuy * Thuy Vy as Yen * Thuy Huong as Most Famous Celeb 1969 * Trac Thuy Mieu as Fashionista Host 1969 * Kim Thu as The Queen of Rice * H√† Truc as Givenchy * Ha Anh as Trang Ngo * Aaron Toronto as Mr. President * Bui Thi My Canh as Fashion show's VIP Guest * Dong Nhi as the 20th generation of Thanh Nu House Production The movie's location is Saigon in 2017. The foundation for the movie was from a conversation between Ngo Thanh Van and fashion designer Thuy Nguyen, as both wanted to make movie about Vietnamese women. Especially, Ngo Thanh Van owns an admiration toward ao dai in general. In Lunar New Year 2017, there were many discussions leading Ngo Thanh Van come to realize that \\"the young generation don't know much about ao dai and their interest for ao dai becomes less\\". Therefore, she and Thuy Nguyen decided to bring \\"ao dai to big screen\\" so everyone could recognize \\"the dreamy beauty of one woman in ao dai\\". After quite a time working on the script and tons of idea switching, Ngo Thanh Van had to rewrite the whole script sometimes. It wasn't not until reading the complete script from script writer Kay Nguyen, she \\"was relieved to receive a script in which honors ao dai, also following the previous spirit at the same time\\" In order to portray character Nhu Y, actress Ninh Duong Lan Ngoc shared that she'd had to research and practice on speaking and behaving like a girl in 1960‚Äì1970, also study little French. The costume was specially designed by fashion designer Thuy Nguyen. She shared that \\"my idea for ao dai in the movie, especially the familiar tile details was inspired from Sai Gon itself and my lovely old house\\", as \\"a longing for The Pearl of The East in 60s with a fresh and delicate spirit\\". Beside ao dai, the movie also mentioned popular Western style in the 1960s such as A-line skirt, pencil skirt and straight skirt. In the explanation for the title (Vietnamese title: Co Ba Sai Gon), Ngo Thanh Van stated that the term \\"Co Ba\\" is used to remind the image of Southern women back in the day, not an actual name and confirmed that she'd registered trademark for this name in order not to be confused with other cosmetic or cuisine brand names. = Soundtrack = The main soundtrack with same title as the movie is presented by Dong Nhi, composed by Nguyen Phuc Thien and produced and written by Only C ‚Äì which he described as \\"typical pop song, catchy tune but the lyric has alot to say\\", with an encouraging message \\"which makes everyone fall in love with ao dai even more\\". \\"Tan Thoi\\" is the soundtrack at the end of the movie was presented by Jun Pham, mixed by Huynh Hien Nang in classic and retro style. According to Tuoi Tre, the song tells \\"a difference\\" between last decades and the modern world, where \\"it seems like people are neglecting others' existence, nor no longer using old methods of communication like before\\". S.T composed and presented the song \\"Vi Anh Luon O Day\\" (Because I'm Always Here). This is a gift from him, written by Lou Hoang and produced by Tuan Mario. Nguoi Lao Dong Newspaper describes the song is \\"a soft and deep ballad talking about a man's confusion when in love. Hoping for a happy ending; although going through how many obstacles and challenges anyway, he is still willing to protect and stand by her side till the end\\". Before the official release, the producer introduced two songs \\"Co Ba Sai Gon\\" and \\"Tan Thoi\\" in October 20 and November 7, 2017. The complete soundtrack album was exclusively released on nhac.vn on November 29, 2017. Three music videos of three songs \\"Co Ba Sai Gon\\", \\"Tan Thoi\\" and \\"Vi Anh Luon O Day\\" were released on 16, 19 and 22 November 2017.  Introduction and Marketing  On October 20, 2017, the crew had a special appearance in the opening night of 2017 Fashion and Technology Festival, the theme was Ban Sac phuong Dong at Nguyen Hue Walking Street, they had talk regarding encouraging young generation to be confident in ao dai. To share with Marketing & Family Magazine, the crew said that for one movie to participate in this festival \\"had never happened before\\" and this was \\"a chance for The Tailor to truly confirm all the values they're looking for; their position in fashion world and the audience\\". Also in that night, singer Dong Nhi did a live performance of \\"Co Ba Sai Gon\\" before the release for pop art inspired lyric music video including her and some from the cast. On November 1, 2017, fashion designer Thuy Nguyen introduced her collection \\"Co Ba Sai Gon\\" in the second night of International Vietnam Fashion Week Fall Winter 2017. Ngo Thanh Van was the first face of the show, portraying in 1960 inspired ao dai next to a traditional sewing machine and began \\"slowly yet mysteriously walking\\" on the catwalk. November 5, 2017, the crew hold a meet up named \\"Ao Dai Day\\" with chosen audiences at BHD Vincom Mega Mall box office in Thao Dien, where the early premiere of the movie and teasers of two music videos were also released. Five days before the release date, a short clip of Thanh Nu tailor house was revealed. On November 10, 2017, Ninh Duong Lan Ngoc, Diem My 9x, Oanh Kieu and S.T appeared in TV shows from Vietnam Television such as: Chuyen Dong 24 Gio Trua and Bua Trua Vui Ve. The crew also had cinetour at many cinema theaters in Ho Chi Minh City, starting at Lotte Go Vap from November 11, 2017. On November 20, 2017, Co Ba Sai Gon Music Festival was held at The Garden Mall, Ho Chi Minh City included Ninh Duong Lan Ngoc, Diem My 9x, S.T, Dong Nhi, Phuong Vy, Will and Jun Pham. Along with the performances from participated singers and Top 6 from Tieng Hat Co Ba Sai Gon Contest, the show also included Dance Cover Contest for Co Ba Sai Gon's soundtrack. Some agencies cooperated with Co Ba Sai Gon to produce merchandise solely inspired by the movie. EPOMi, a sponsor of the meet up at 2017 Fashion & Technology Festival, produced beauty box with two versions: Premium and Standard inspired by Classic and Modern styles (or also known as \\"Co Ba\\" and \\"Chi Ba\\" style). Co Ba Sai Gon Perfume Box included three products such as: Pearl of the East perfume, Lily scented balm and Co Ba Sai Gon soap. Vascara, one of the sponsors, introduced a classic gift included a card, sewing box and the letter from Thanh Mai to Nhu Y. Mono Concept released phone case, USB, luggage tag and water bottle which were decorated with pop art inspired illustration of the cast. Sai Gon Giai Phong Newspaper stated that the crew has \\"greatly made a nice branding\\" from the project announcement to the official release by \\"skillful PR campaigns\\", for example \\"female cast often appeared in traditional ao dai and classic make up style in big events such Busan Film Festival, Golden Kite Award,...and many supplementary events\\" or how the announcement regarding the postpone of the official release was demonstrated in classic newspaper style.  Release = Release at film festivals = The Tailor competed in 22nd Busan International Film Festival for Asian Film Window category with three showtimes which restricted children under 12 in October 14, 15 and 17 2017, at Starium of CGV Centum City cinema, number 2 and 7 room of Lotte Centum City cinema. Before the premiere, two directors, Ngo Thanh Van, Ninh Duong Lan Ngoc, Diem My 9x and Oanh Kieu had a meet up with the guests of Film Festival at BIFF Village stage by the beach of Haeundae. According to the producer, the first showtime was sold out with 1,000 tickets and received many positive reviews from critics and the audience as they complimented \\"such a nice and meaningful movie reserving the culture\\". At the end of November 2017, The Tailor participated and competed in 20th Vietnam Film Festival in Da Nang. After the premiere of 20th Vietnam Film Festival Welcoming Week at National Cinema Center on November 11 at Hanoi, the movie was released afterward at Le Do Cinema, on November 27, 2017 at Da Nang. According to Tien Phong Newspaper, the showtime belonged to Film Festival was completely crowded, the audience streamed down to the cinema before showtime was so many that two line of supplementary seats were placed inside, and no one left during the movie. The Tailor continued to participated in Vietnam- Korea Film Festival with two showtimes on November 19 and 20 2017 at BHD Bitexco Cinema, Ho Chi Minh City. At 13th Osaka Asian Film Festival, the movie competed and had two showtimes at room number 4 of Cine Libre Umeda Cinema and ABC Hall, on March 11 and 15 2018. The movie also joined in Vietnam Film Week by Vietnam Consulate at Argentina in cooperation with Argentina representative office, in May 2018 at Buenos Aires Capital as 45 year anniversary of foreign communication between Vietnam and Argentina. = Release at the cinema = The Tailor was official released at all the cinemas in Vietnam from November 10, 2017 and early showtime from November 9, 2017, which was the only Vietnam film release during that time, among 16 foreign movies. According to Tuoi Tre, VAA Agency had agreed on the 50% revenue rate agreement with CGV Vietnam to have The Tailor released at CGV after the incident of Tam Cam: Chuyen chua ke in August 2016 previously. The early premiere for artists and the press was operated at BHD Vincome Mega Mall Thao Dien, on November 8, 2017 in Ho Chi Minh City and on November 9, 2017 at Ha Noi.

Internment  Szmajzner arrived at Sobib√≥r extermination camp on 12 May 1942 in a transport of about 2,000 Jews from the Eastern Poland Ghetto of Opole Lubelskie, together with his parents, a sister, brother, cousin, and nephew. = Occupations = On arrival, he was not sent to death in the gas chambers because he proved to be a goldsmith, having carried along his bag of tools. He also managed to protect his brother, cousin, and nephew, insisting he needed their assistance. Given a makeshift goldsmith workshop, he was tasked by camp deputy commander Gustav Wagner to create golden accessories for the members of the SS at Sobib√≥r using stolen coins, jewelry, or dental gold of murder victims. Orders included rings displaying SS runes and an ornamental knob for the whip used by Kurt Bolender in beating the prisoners. Under Franz Stangl's command of the camp, Szmajzner was made foreman in a mechanics workshop, tasked with general maintenance. Later, he and others were forced to produce the very mines laid around the camp's outer fence. His job gave him wide access, except for camp III, the area of gassing and burning of victims. = Revolt = 16-year-old Szmajzner learned about the mass killings at Sobib√≥r through messages from a friend forced to work at the gas chambers, secretly delivered by a Volksdeutsche guard. He then joined the camp's underground committee of Polish Jews around Leon Feldhendler that planned an escape. He later took part in the camp-wide uprising on 14 October 1943 led by Soviet POW Alexander Pechersky, after over 17 months at Sobib√≥r. In the advent of the revolt, he was part of a group of four prisoners that killed the camp's Chief Kapo to prevent denunciation. For armament, the team at his workshop stole and hid several carpentry axes that had been sent for sharpening. Szmajzner also stole three rifles from the armory after convincing the watchman on guard that he was on a repair mission. He handed two rifles to Soviet POWs and insisted on keeping the third. In the turmoil of the escape, Szmajzner shot a tower guard. = Escape = Szmajzner belonged to the roughly 200 prisoners, of about 600, who managed to escape from the camp into the nearby woods. He was part of Pechersky's group, consisting of 57 persons. To avoid discovery, the escapees split into smaller groups. Pechersky and seven other Russian POWs left to purchase food and make contact with partisans, with the remaining persons waiting for their return. After Pechersky did not return, they split into smaller groups and sought separate ways. Of Szmajzner's group of 15 or 16 survivors, 12 or 13 were later shot in a confrontation with Polish nationalists. He survived by dropping to the ground and acting dead.  After World War II  Shlomo Szmajzner confronts Gustav Franz Wagner (Jornal do Brasil, 1978) In 1947, Szmajzner emigrated to Brazil, where in 1967 he recognized Franz Stangl.Jules Schelvis & Dunya Breur: Biographies of SS men, sobiborinterviews.nl NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies In May 1978, he also confirmed the identity of Gustav Wagner in a S√£o Paulo police station. He visited West Germany multiple times to testify in trials, including against Stangl. Szmajzner authored a book about his experiences as an adolescent in the death camp, which was published in 1968 in Brazil. Along with fellow survivors Thomas Blatt and Esther Terner-Raab, he also contributed to the screenplay of the 1987 film Escape from Sobibor.

The Cairngorms National Park extends across a much wider area than the Cairngorms massif itself and hence displays rather more varied geology. The majority of the rocks within the National Park belong to the Dalradian Supergroup, a thick sequence of sands, muds and limestones that were deposited between about 800 and 600 million years ago on the margins of the former continent of Laurentia. Rocks now ascribed to the Moine Supergroup occur along the northwestern edge of the Park. The Dalradian and Moine successions were intensely faulted, folded and metamorphosed during the Caledonian Orogeny between about 490 and 430 million years ago Geologists recognize a ‚ÄòGrampian event‚Äô, centred around 470 million years ago, which was responsible for the initial deformation of the Dalradian and relates to the collision of a volcanic island arc with Laurentia over a period of about 20 million years. The subsequent collision of Baltica with Laurentia caused the ‚ÄòScandian event‚Äô which involved further folding and faulting of the Dalradian rock sequence. The Great Glen, Ericht-Laidon and Glen Tilt faults were all active as strike- slip faults at this time and may have played a part in allowing large plutons of granite to rise up amongst the Dalradian rocks and then cool in situ. The largest of these plutons is the granite mass which forms the Cairngorms themselves and which was emplaced around 427 million years ago. It is thought that the pluton had been unroofed within 20 million years of its emplacement and that the present landscape of the Cairngorms had begun to form by 390 million years ago. Evidence suggests that the granite currently at the surface was initially to be found at a depth of between 4 and 7km. Other than a small outlier of Old Red Sandstone, there are no younger solid rocks within the National Park. The ice ages of the last 2.5 million years have however left their mark both in terms of erosional and depositional features. Post-glacial features include peat and landslips. Moine Supergroup The metamorphic rocks of the Moine are generally identified with the Northwest Highlands west of the Great Glen Fault but there are some similar rocks east of the fault which are tentatively assigned to the Moine succession. The Markie Gneiss is a unit of micaceous psammite within fault-bounded blocks on the western margin of the National Park. It is of Neoproterozoic age but its exact relationship to other strata continues to be debated.https://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=MARK =Badenoch Group= The oldest rocks within the area are those of the Tonian age Badenoch Grouphttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BADN, which occur along the northwestern edge of the national park. These rocks were formerly referred to as the Central Highland Division or Central Highland Migmatite Complex and have been included both within the Moine and Dalradian successions at various times. Estimates of age have varied but an age of around 900 million years is suggested by the British Geological Survey.http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/images/a/a4/P915452.png They are largely psammites and semipelites which have been intensely deformed and which are generally heavily migmatised. The group is divided into a lower part, the Dava Subgroup (previously the ‚ÄòDava Succession‚Äô and named after the Dava district between Grantown-on-Spey and Inverness) and an upper part, the Glen Banchor Subgroup (named after Glen Banchor which extends west from Newtonmore). Though its lower (western) boundary is not seen, the whole sequence is believed to be several kilometres thick. The nature of its upper boundary with Grampian Group rocks in the east has been disputed. The latter may rest unconformably on the Glen Banchor rocks or else the relationship may be wholly tectonic in nature i.e. faulted or sheared. http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DAVA Within the groups are various named formations: *Glen Banchor Subgroup *Dava Subgroup **Slochd Psammite Formation http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=SLCD **Flichity Semipelite http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=FLTY **Beinn Bhreac Psammite **Creag Buidhe Semipelite Badenoch Group rocks crop out northwest of a line running southwest from the Grantown Pluton towards the Boat of Garten and Monadhliath plutons. Within this area, a broad band of non-migmatised psammites extends beneath Carrbridge area and is well exposed further north at Creag an Righ, west of Grantown. Dalradian Supergroup Besides intrusive igneous rocks, the rest of the National Park is almost exclusively formed in metamorphosed strata collectively known as the Dalradian Supergroup or simply the Dalradian. They are a complex mix of psammites, phyllites, pelites, semipelites, quartzites and meta-limestones and other lithologies originally laid down as marine sand, mud, silt etc in a depositional basin which alternately deepened and was filled over an extended period of time. The total thickness of this sequence is estimated at 25km or more though the full thickness is unlikely ever to have accumulated at any one locationWoodcock and Strachan p73-4 A variety of dates have been suggested for the age of the succession but sedimentation perhaps took place broadly between about 750 and 500 million years ago.http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/images/a/a4/P915452.png The Dalradian is divided into four groups which stretch across the Grampian Highlands from Argyll in the southwest to northeast Scotland. All four groups and their various constituent subgroups and formations are seen within the National Park. The broad stratigraphy of the Dalradian is (oldest at bottom of list, youngest at top): *Southern Highland Group *Argyll Group **Tayvallich Subgroup **Crinan Subgroup **Easdale Subgroup **Islay Subgroup *Appin Group **Blair Atholl Subgroup **Ballachulish Subgroup **Lochaber Subgroup *Grampian Group **Glen Spean Subgroup **Corrieyairack Subgroup **Glenshirra Subgroup =Grampian Group= The Grampian Group is the oldest division of the Dalradian and is recognized from Islay to Nairn and is also seen on the Atlantic coast of Ireland. It is itself divided into three parts; the Glenshirra, Corrieyairack and Glen Spean subgroups. The succession is considered to be 7-8km thick and composed of psammites and semipelites and quartzites. The lowermost (i.e. oldest) strata within the group (overlying the rocks of the Badenoch Group) are meta-limestones and pelites, referred to at one time as the Ord Ban Subgroup but now referred to as the Grantown Formation and placed within the Glenshirra Subgroup. They may have originated as shallow marine shelf deposits.Woodcock and Strachan p76-77 Overlying these are the rocks of the Corrieyairick Subgroup which are thought to have originally been turbidites and represent a time of rifting and basin development. The following formations are recognized within the subgroup: Creag Meagaidh Psammite, Ardair Semipelite, Elrick Psammite and Semipelite, Loch Laggan Psammite, Kincraig, Coire nan Laogh Semipelite and Ruthven Semipelite formations. The youngest Grampian Group rocks are those of the Glen Spean Subgroup, originally nearshore and tidal deposits laid down at a time when the depositional basin was gradually filling. Within this subgroup are the Grantown Formation, Feshiebridge Formation, Coylumbridge Formationhttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=COYB and Pityoulish Formationhttp://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=PITY. The following formations are recognised within the undivided Grampian Group: Tormore Psammite, Nethybridge Psammite, Knockando Quartzite, Pityoulish and Dallas Psammite formations. =Appin Group= Overlying the Grampian Group is the Appin Group which is divided into three subgroups, the oldest being the Lochaber and the youngest the Blair Atholl with the Ballachulish separating the two. It was formerly referred to as the Lower Dalradian or Lower Dalradian Group.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=APP The rocks of the Lochaber Subgroup, sometimes encountered in earlier references as the Lochaber (Transition) Subgroup http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DALO Much of this succession represents tidal and shelf deposits as the basin gradually subsided and deepened. The subgroup includes the Tom na Fianaig, Fodderletter Calcareous Flag, Riabhach Banded and Dalvrecht Slate formations. The Ballachulish Subgroup was formerly referred to as the Ballachulish Group. http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DABH It includes the Ailnack Phyllite and Limestone, Corryhabbie Quartzite and Mortlach Graphitic Schist formations. The youngest Appin rocks are those of the Blair Atholl Subgroup, previously referred to as the Blair Atholl Series.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DABA These were laid down during a period of basin filling. They include the Glenfiddich Pelite, Tornahaish Dark Schist and Limestone, Inchrory Limestone, Clashnoir Semipelite and Neilead Limestone formations. =Argyll Group= The Islay Subgroup is the oldest/lowermost division of the group and includes the Kymah Quartzite, Auchnahyle, Ladder Hills and Nochty Semipelite and Limestone formations. Overlying this is the Easdale Subgroup which includes the Badenyon Schist and Limestone, Reppachie Semipelitic Schist, Glenbuchat Graphitic Schist, Lynavoir Semipelite and Culchavie Striped formations. Within the overlying Crinan Subgroup is the Queens Hill Gneiss Formation (or Queen‚Äôs Hill Formation). The youngest part of the Argyll Group is the Tayvallich Subgroup. It contains the Deeside Limestone Formation. Certain stratigraphic relationships within the Argyll Group are uncertain but the group also includes the Craigievar, Blackwater and Scors Burn Schist formations. =Southern Highland Group= The Southern Highland Group is the youngest part of the Dalradian and occurs in the southeast of the park around Glen Prosen and from Glen Clova east to Loch Lee in Glen Esk, Its wider extent stretches from Northern Ireland to the North Sea coast including southern Shetland. The larger part of Glen Clova is cut into rocks of the Southern Highland Group rocks whilst the neighbouring mountains of Mayar and Driesh are formed from these same rocks. It includes the Clashindarroch and Suie Hill formations. Old Red Sandstone An outlier of the Lower Old Red Sandstone occurs around the Tomintoul area. Principally Devonian age sandstones, they contain siltstones too and a basal conglomerate. These strata are collected together as the Tomintoul Group and consist of a lower Delnabo Conglomerate Formation, an overlying Raebeg Sandstone Formation and an upper Conglass Sandstone Formation. The lower part of this sequence may be latest Silurian in age.British Geological Survey 1996 ‚Äò‚ÄôGlenlivet‚Äô‚Äô. Scotland Sheet 75W Solid geology 1:50,000 (Keyworth, Nottingham: BGS) Theses rocks form hills such as Carn na Farraidh, Carn Meadhonach and Tom na Bal to the west and south of Tomintoul. No solid rocks of late Devonian or succeeding periods are recorded within the area of the National Park. Plutons Numerous plutons were emplaced within the Dalradian sequence at the close of the Caledonian Orogeny from late Silurian to early Devonian times. These have been be divided into a ‚ÄòCairngorm suite‚Äô, an ‚ÄòArgyll and Northern Highland suite‚Äô and a ‚ÄòSouth of Scotland suite‚Äô on the basis of different geochemical characteristics.Highton, A.J. 1999 Solid Geology of the Aviemore District Memoir of the British Geological Survey Sheet 74E (Scotland) p57 There are also variations in lithology within individual plutons. The largest pluton within the National Park (by area) and the one which has the most dramatic effect on the landscape is the centrally located Cairngorm pluton. It extends over an area of about 365 square kilometres and was emplaced around 427 million years ago. The Mount Battock pluton is of a similar size but only the western portion of it falls within the national park. Structure The geological structures within the area are complex, being the product of multiple deformational events. Two late Proterozoic events were followed by a further event during the Ordovician and Silurian. Metamorphism was associated with some of the deformational events. The Ericht-Laidon Fault is a major northeast-southwest aligned structure passing through the west of the Park. Though little exposed at the surface, it has been mapped passing beneath Grantown-on-Spey and, outside the Park‚Äôs southwestern border, running the length of both Loch Ericht and Loch Laidon from which it takes its name. The similarly aligned Loch Tay Fault is a major landscape-forming feature running through the centre of the Park. It is mapped along the length of the notably straight Glen Tilt, passing out of the Park immediately west of Blair Atholl, en route for the Highland border via the central alignment of the loch which gives it its name. It also runs through Clais Fhearnaig, a glacial meltwater channel which connects Glen Lui and Glen Quoich. It defines the eastern margin of the Cairngorm pluton before running into Glen Builg at its northeastern end. The Bridge of Garry-Loch Balgie Fault is a third member of this group entering the Park from the southwest in the vicinity of Dalnaspidal Lodge. They are considered to be members of a family of faults with associated movement histories which includes the Great Glen Fault with which they run in parallel. The Grampian Shear Zone, otherwise referred to as the Grampian Slide Zone juxtaposes rocks of the Badenoch Group against those of the Grampian Group. It has been dated to around 750 million years ago. Quaternary Within Britain, the Cairngorm landscape is considered to be of the very highest importance for its glacial geomorphology.http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2284.pdf p17 It displays a large number and wide range of features associated with glaciation and periglaciation including corries and glacial troughs, moraines, kames, eskers and other depositional features, pro-talus ramparts, meltwater channels. Corrie lakes of glacial origin occur at Loch nan Eun and Lochnagar beneath the mountain of Lochnagar, Loch Brandy and Loch Wharral above Glen Clova, Lochan nan Gabhar beneath Ben Avon and Dubh Lochan beneath Beinn a Bhuird. There are several Lochan Uaine‚Äôs within the central Cairngorms alongside Loch Etchachan and Loch Coire an Lochain. Loch Kander is another with a glacial origin near the head of Glen Callater. On the eastern margins of the Monadhliath are Lochan a Choire beneath Geal Charn and Loch Dubh. Besides corries, nivation hollows are present such as that at Ciste Mhearaid.http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2284.pdf p13 Amongst the most significant glacial troughs are those of Loch Avon, Glen Einich, the Lairig Ghru and Strath Nethy within the Cairngorm massif and those of Lock Muick and Glen Clova in the wider Park. http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2284.pdf p15 Meltwater channels are common, notable examples being those at Chalamain Gap and Eag a‚Äô Chait east of the Lairig Ghru, the Ryvoan Pass east of Glenmore and Clais Fhearnaig between Glen Lui and Glen Quoich. The various deposits associated with the Devensian (last) ice age are collectively known as the Caledonia Glacigenic Group and include the Central Grampian and East Grampian Glacigenic subgroups in this area. =Tors= Tors are a common feature of the Cairngorm granite massif, being especially frequent on Ben Avon and Beinn Mheadhoin and impressively high on Bynack More. They represent masses of granite which are less closely jointed than surrounding rock and which have therefore been less susceptible to underground weathering associated with fluid percolation along joints. The present tors have been exhumed, over a long period of time, not least by periglacial processes associated with ice ages during the Quaternary period.http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2284.pdf p3 References Cairngorms Cairngorms Cairngorms ","title":"Geology of the Cairngorms National Park"},{"id":"56485808","text":"Overview map of the Viking raids in the Rhineland. Key: Wikingerlager = \\"Viking camp\\", Wikinger√ºberfall = \\"Viking raid\\", Wikinger√ºberfall auf ein Kloster = \\"Viking raid on a monastery\\", Schlacht = \\"battle\\" The Viking raids in the Rhineland were part of a series of invasions of Francia by the Vikings that took place during the final decades of the 9th century. From the Rhineland, which can be regarded as the nucleus of Frankish culture, the Franks had previously conquered almost the whole of Central Europe and established a great empire. During these raids, the Vikings plundered the ancient Roman cities of Cologne, Bonn, Xanten, Trier and also the imperial city of Aachen, in which Charlemagne was buried and on whose throne the Frankish kings were crowned in Aachen Cathedral. In addition to these cities, numerous monasteries were also destroyed, together with entire libraries in which collections of writings from several centuries had been preserved. This shook the essence of Frankish culture. Similar raids affected the Scandinavian regions where the Vikings had originally settled: the British Isles, Baltic Sea region, Russia and the Mediterranean region. Many inhabitants of the affected regions were carted off as slaves.Willemsen (2004), 132, 156-157.  The Rhineland  The Frankish realms after the Treaty of Meersen in 870 ‚Äì the Rhineland was located in Lorraine (yellow) The term Rhineland is used to describe areas on the Middle and Lower Rhine that are not defined in more detail. It was not designated as such until 1798, when French Revolutionary troops occupied this territory. Previously, this region was mostly named after towns or counties, for example, the Gelderland, or Land of Cleves (Klever Land). The Franconian Frankish kingdoms c. 880; the Rhineland lies in the western part of East Francia The area known today as the Rhineland begins at the confluence of the Moselle and the Rhine and ends at Emmerich, where the Rhine divides into the Lek and the Waal to form a delta. In the east, the Rhineland ends close to the Rhine itself, being bounded by low mountain ranges such as the Siebengebirge or Bergisches Land. To the west its boundary is less well defined, but in general parlance it runs beyond the present state border with the Netherlands, i.e. east of the Meuse. Because the modern state of Rhineland-Palatinate lies south of the Moselle, the low mountain range of the Eifel north of the river is usually seen as belonging to the Rhineland. Areas south of the Moselle, such as the Hunsr√ºck, are also considered to be part of the Rhineland.  The Rhineland in the Carolingian period  The heartland of the Carolingians lay, for the most part, in territories that were part of the Rhineland. As a result, important sites of Carolingian culture are located here. Of particular note are the city of Aachen, where Charlemagne had his imperial palace built, and also the Benedictine abbey in Pr√ºm ‚Äì the latter mainly because of its scriptorium and associated library. The old Roman cities of Trier, Cologne, Xanten and Bonn were also located in the Rhineland and were used by the Franks as centres of trading and episcopal seats. In 843 AD, the Frankish Empire was divided into three kingdoms. Most areas of the Rhineland fell into the dominion of Lothair I and were named Lothringen. This was the middle kingdom that ran from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea with no border crossings between East and West Francia. After this division of the empire, almost all areas of the former great empire experienced conflicts over power of a civil warlike nature. The Rhineland was also affected by this. When Lothair I died in 855 without an heir to his throne, the power struggles intensified. In 870, following the Treaty of Meersen, the Rhineland was assigned to East Francia. Ten years later, theTreaty of Ribemont specified the boundaries more precisely. The map opposite shows the result.Jennifer Striewski: Wikinger am Mittelrhein.  Vikings and Franks  After the defeat of Saxony (772‚Äì804) the empire of Charlemagne extended to the mouth of the Elbe and beyond. By this time at the latest, the first contacts with the Vikings who, like the Saxons, worshipped pagan gods, took place. Entry into Valhalla (relief from Gotland) These contacts were often warlike in nature. The Frisian islands were affected as well as the Frisian mainland. To ward off the attacks, Charlemagne set up a march on the northern border of his empire, the name of today's state of Denmark being derived from it. Despite the warlike situation on the northern border, many Vikings were used as mercenaries in Frankish campaigns. The Vikings were bold raiders, perhaps because of the code of honour they are purported to have had, According to legend, the god of war, Odin, from the Asa line of gods, prepared to fight for the world and its survival. He sent his messengers, the valkyries, to escort the bravest warriors killed in a battle to Valhalla. The warriors who gathered there, called Einherjar, practised the art of warfare during the daytime. In the evening, after their wounds had healed, the army of the dead moved into Odin's hall together, where there was always a filled drinking horn and a good meal. Whether this code of honour existed or not, much of their fighting was, in any case, against civilian populations and weakly defended towns and monasteries.Willemsen (2004), 155‚Äì157. One of the first Viking kings to be baptized was Harald Klak who, in 826, became a vassal of King Louis the German at Ingelheim am Rhein and was baptized in Mainz with his wife and son. During this time, the Vikings attacked the Frankish Empire sailing their ships up the big rivers from the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Such raids mainly affected areas on the Seine and in modern-day Netherlands and Belgium. Previously, the Vikings had raided England (Lindisfarne, 793) and Ireland (Dublin, 795). In 820, the first major attack by Vikings on the Frankish Empire was recorded, taking place around the mouth of the river Seine, and at the same time other Vikings probably invaded Flanders. In 845, Paris was attacked for the first time with about 700 longships up the Seine. The Parisians bought the raiders off with 7,000 pounds of silver. By 926, thirteen of these payments have been documented in the Frankish Empire.Thorsten Capelle: Nicht nur Nacht- und Nebelaktionen. In: Ulrich L√∂ber (Hrsg.): Die Wikinger. Begleitpublikation zur Sonderausstellung ‚ÄûDie Wikinger‚Äú des Landesmuseums Koblenz und des Statens Historiska Museums Stockholm. Koblenz 1998, pp. 87-94, here p. 88. The Elbe estuary and the already fortified city of Hamburg were attacked by Danish warriors in 845. Initially, the attacks took the form of raids and the Vikings withdrew to their homeland afterwards. In the 860s, they changed tactics and established permanent bases in Francia, from where they coordinated their raids, and sometimes overwintered in their fortified army camps. The Rhineland, the heartland of the Frankish Empire, was little affected by the Vikings at that time. The Vikings were not a united people, but a collection of warring tribes; small wars between Viking tribes were frequent, united large-scale attacks were preceded in principle by purposeful diplomatic negotiations. Since the Vikings could only be driven out of the occupied territories at great cost, attempts were occasionally made to involve their leaders in the Empire by means of rich gifts and the granting of fiefdoms. As a rule, these Viking leaders were expected to be baptized beforehand, since the Frankish empire was considered by the Frankish nobility to be a gift from God and so there were no thrones for higher nobles who were unbelievers.  Raids of 862 and 864  Between 834 and 863 the Vikings laid waste eight times to the trading post of Dorestad on the Lek river, a town that competed with the Danish town of Haithabu. In 862, Vikings attacked up the Rhine for the first time and plundered Cologne. In 863, the Normans conquered Utrecht and Nijmegen and established permanent winter camps in both towns; Dorestad was razed during the campaign. In 864, they left there on a second campaign into the Lower Rhine territories and ambushed and plundered the city of Xanten which had been founded by the Romans.Willemsen (2004), 119.  Trade and navigation on the Rhine between 864 and 881  Reconstructed Viking ship, Havhingsten fra Glendalough, mid-11th century The Franks were not real seafarers ‚Äì although there were types of ship (e.g. the Utrecht ship) which, in good weather, were suitable for coastal navigation. However, since no wrecks of such boats have been found in the North Sea to date, their use for coastal navigation must be assumed to be rare.Willemsen (2004), 62. There were different construction methods for boats. Some were made of large, hollowed out, tree-trunks; others were more like rafts. Both types were difficult to manoeuvre and were used for transporting heavy goods such as rocks. The quarries were often ruined Roman buildings near the Rhine, but there were also quarries in the neighbouring mountain ranges. These boats floated down the river with the current or were hauled upriver as barges pulled by horses or oxen, a technique known as treideln. The main building material in the Frankish Empire was wood. Logs were tied together and rafted downriver to the markets, and other commodities and travellers were transported on rafts which, in some cases, were very long and wide.Willemsen (2004), 55‚Äì61. When the Vikings settled on the banks of the Rhine delta, they had a competitive advantage as traders, because their outstanding shipbuilding technology enabled them to overcome strong[currents like those of the Rhine, so they were able to ship goods quickly. As a result, trade in the Rhineland flourished. Since Vikings had also settled in Ireland, England and Russia at the same time, trade goods expanded to include products from and beyond the more distant regions.Willemsen (2004), 64-71.  Winter raids of 881/882  Viking helmet, probably damaged by a cutting weapon The situation changed when the so-called Great Heathen Army suffered a severe defeat in 878 at Edington in southwest England at the hands of King Alfred the Great (reigned 871-899) and his army suffered a severe defeat. The defeated Vikings then set off for continental Europe and transferred their theatre of war to the coastal region of the English Channel, Northern France and Flanders. On 3 August 881, the West Francian king Louis III with his army also won victory over the Normans at Saucourt-en-Vimeu in central France. The Vikings then turned their aggression eastwards towards the Rhineland. Charles III was residing in Italy at this time because of his imperial coronation which had taken place on 12 February 881 in Rome. For the celebrations he was accompanied by numerous armoured knights; thus many of his best armed warriors were not available to defend their homeland in the winter of 881. Despite the invasion of West Francia by the Great Army in 878, no defensive measures had apparently been taken in East Francian Rhineland, since the city walls of individual cities were only reinforced when the Vikings were almost at the city gates. Thus, because of the imperial coronation of Charles III in Rome, the population of the Rhine was almost defenceless and at the mercy of the Vikings' attack, and fleeing was the best course of action to save lives and goods. As a result, the Vikings often captured entire towns, villages and monasteries without fighting. = Raids in the Rhine-Meuse area = In late 881, Vikings, who had overwintered in Flanders, set off on a military expedition to neighbouring lands. They raided numerous villages in the area of the Meuse and razed the towns of Li√®ge, Maastricht and Tongeren to the ground.Willemsen (2004), 2 Hoard from the Viking period In December 881, Vikings of this group sailed on at least three ships under their leader, Godfrid, up the Rhine. As they went, they plundered villages and towns or extorted money from their inhabitants (Brandschatzung). Particularly affected were the cities of Cologne, Bonn, Neuss, J√ºlich and Andernach. On their first visit to Cologne in January 882, after tough negotiations, Cologne paid a fortune in silver for their withdrawal (see also Danegeld). On their return journey, the same group again demanded payment of a sum of money, which the destitute citizens of Cologne could not afford, whereupon the city was burned to the ground.Fuchs (1990), 89-90. The Normans, presumably from Denmark, probably also carried horses on their Viking ships. In any case, they were very mobile, something that was aided by being able to utilise the old Roman roads of the Rhineland on the left bank of the Rhine. The Vikings turned westwards following this road system and plundered towns from Z√ºlpich to Aachen. = Raids on cultural centres in the Aachen area = Artist's impression of the Palace of Aachen (c. 800) with the octagon of the cathedral (top left), the thermal spa (bottom left) and the palace (bottom right) When they had stormed the imperial city, the conquerors, presumably with calculated, strategic intent, desecrated St. Mary's Church (now the cathedral), the tomb of Charlemagne and the royal stables. After committing these outrages, they set the palace and the imperial baths on fire. In late December 881, they plundered the imperial abbey of Kornelim√ºnster, not far from Aachen, as well as the monasteries of Stablo and Malmedy in the Ardennes. = First attack on Pr√ºm Abbey = On 6 January 882, Three Kings' Day, a detachment of Vikings which, according to historical reports, was about 300 strong, attacked the largest Frankish abbey, Pr√ºm in the Eifel mountains. In the abbey church was the grave of Emperor Lothair I who died there in 855 after concluding the Treaty of Pr√ºm. Attached to the monastery was a hospital and an important monastic school in which the offspring of the Frankish nobility were educated.Willemsen (2004), 109 The Abbey also housed one of the most extensive libraries in the Empire with its scriptorium. Apart from Aachen, Pr√ºm was the cultural centre of the Frankish Empire. The abbey had extensive estates; more than a hundred churches were under its administration; its lands extended far into the present-day Netherlands, and the forests along the Moselle also belonged to the monastery. A band of peasants from the area resisted the attackers, but were massacred. As a result, the Vikings set all the buildings of the monastery on fire. The abbey burned down to the ground, \\"since there was no one left alive to fight the fire\\"Regino of Pr√ºm, 882. Among the monastery's greatest treasures was one of the most precious relics of Western Christianity, the Sandals of Christ, which were carried to safety before the Viking onslaught. Of the manuscript collection, however, which was often praised by chroniclers before, only about one tenth of the collection was able to be rescued in front of the marauding Vikings; the rest perished in the flames. = 882 Moselle raid = The King of East Francia, Louis III raised an army and rushed to help the Rhinelanders. On 20 January, the king died unexpectedly in Frankfurt, whereupon the army he led against the Vikings was disbanded. The Vikings then moved further up the Rhine. In the course of February and March 882 they attacked as far as Koblenz, pillaging and murdering, but the city was able to resist them thanks to strong fortifications dating back to Roman times. However, the lands outside its walls were devastated. At the same time, in Mainz, the dilapidated Roman walls were quickly fortified again and the citizens of Mainz began to dig a ditch around the city. The Vikings, however, did not move from Koblenz to Mainz, but sailed up the Moselle and reached the Trier countryside during Easter week. The city gate of Porta Nigra in Trier. Despite its Roman fortifications, Trier was conquered twice by the Vikings. In Easter Week, 882, the Nordic raiders attacked and destroyed the monasteries, churches and farmsteads outside the city walls of Trier. The imperial monastery of St. Maximin and the abbeys of and St. Symphorian, north of the ancient city wall, were destroyed; the latter never being rebuilt. The monastery of St. Paulinus was spared.Gabriele B. Clemens, Lukas Clemens: Geschichte der Stadt Trier. Beck, Munich, 2007, , pp. 70-71. On Maundy Thursday, 5 April, 882, the Vikings captured the city itself. After a few days of rest, they plundered Trier on Easter Sunday.As in Pr√ºm, the attack occurred on a major holiday. Since it was the most important Christian holiday and there had been a break in the fighting after Trier was captured, it can be assumed that the pause and subsequent devastation of Trier were deliberately timed to coincide with Easter. Among their targets was Trier Cathedral. Regino of Pr√ºm records numerous victims among the population, but Archbishop Bertulf of Trier managed to escape to Metz with a few of his followers. Afterwards, some of the Vikings went down the Moselle with their booty to Koblenz, while the rest marched on Metz. The Vikings advancing to Metz were met on 11 April 882 by an army led by the Bishop of Metz, Wala, the Archbishop of Trier, Bertulf, and Count Adalhard II of Metz in the Battle of Remich. The battle was won by the invaders and Bishop Wala fell on the battlefield, alongside many armoured knights and peasants. However, their violent resistance and resultant Viking casualties caused the invaders to turn back, and they retreated north through the Eifel towards their army encampment.E. Ewig: Das Trierer Land im Merowinger- und Karolingerreich. pp. 284‚Äì286.B. Apsner: Die hoch- und sp√§tkarolingische Zeit (9. und fr√ºhes 10. Jahrhundert). pp. 273‚Äì274.  Ceasefire of Ascloha in Spring 882  Coin with image of Charles III After his return from Italy, Emperor Charles III held an Imperial Diet at Worms in May 882, and raised a large army, in which Franks, Bavarians, Swabians, Thuringians, Saxons, Frisians and Lombards participated. The army marched up before the fortified Viking camp named in one source as Ascloha (Asselt in the Annales Fuldenses, 882).For identification see also The Annals of Fulda, edited and translated by Timothy Reuter, Manchester/New York, 1992, p. 92, note 7. Another contemporary source, however, refers to Haslon as the place of negotiation, which is often equated with Elsloo an der Maas (Regino of Pr√ºm, Chronica, 882, specifically mentioned in the entry for the year 881).Willemsen (2004), 164. Charles III besieged the Normans with his army at a safe distance and, after twelve days, began negotiations with thems. The result was a withdrawal of the invaders who were also paid from the church's goods. On the condition that the Viking leader Godfrid was baptised, he was given Frisia as a fief. The peace agreement was additionally sealed by his wedding to a Frankish princess. The princess, Gisla (Gisela) is said to be a daughter of King Lothair II. The Vikings left behind under the leadership of Sigfrid in Ascloha were initially discouraged from further pillaging by payments of money.  Raid of Summer 882  As early as summer 882, Godfrid returned to the Rhineland with an army reinforced from his homeland for a second raid and devastated Cologne, Bonn and Andernach. Around Andernach, many churches and monasteries were looted and set alight. Zutphen on the River IJssel and nearby Deventer were also torched during this rampage.Willemsen (2004), 132‚Äì136 Near Mainz, the Vikings were defeated by an army under Count Henry of Babenberg and the Archbishop of Mainz, Liutbert (episcopate 863‚Äì889); they probably set fire to Cologne afterwards.  Raid of Autumn 883  The news of Godfrid's successes in the Rhineland and his acquisition of Frisia attracted other Vikings from Denmark. In autumn 883 they landed in Frisia, rowed up the Rhine with Godfrid's consent and set up camp near Duisburg. Once again, they devastated numerous villages that had just been rebuilt.W. Vogel: Die Normannen und das Fr√§nkische Reich bis zur Gr√ºndung der Normandie. p. 300. The people of Cologne had previously strengthened their walls and were spared this time. When the Vikings passed by, Cologne's churches and monasteries were still charred ruins.Willemsen (2004), 9. That year, the Vikings withdrew from the Middle Rhine and settled permanently on the Lower Rhine. They occupied Xanten and Duisburg and made small raids from there into the surrounding area, especially the region of Xanten and the Ruhrgebiet.J.H. Withof, A. Blank: Chronik der Stadt Duisburg. p. 118 (online).  884 Frankish campaign against the Vikings  In 884, a body of troops led by Count Henry of Babenberg succeeded in recapturing Duisburg, and the Vikings withdrew from the rest of the Lower Rhine region in return for more payments.

In 1967 Tr√©fim√©taux was acquired by Pechiney and in 1987 was sold to the Italian company SMI. Various plants were closed or sold over the years, leaving two factories in France at Givet (copper and brass tubes) and Niederbruck (copper bars). These factories are now operated by Tr√©fim√©taux SAS, a subsidiary of Cupori (60%) and SMI (40%). Independent company The Soci√©t√© J. Laveissi√®re et Cie was founded in 1812 to manufacture copper products. In 1881 it was merged with the Soci√©t√© anonyme des √©tablissements Secr√©tan to form the Soci√©t√© industrielle et commerciale des m√©taux. In 1900 it became the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux, employing 500 workers in a factory in Saint-Denis. Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre has its origins in the Soci√©t√© Lazare Weiller, created in 1883 by Lazare Weiller (1858‚Äì1928) to manufacture copper wire in Angoul√™me, which grew into a major metallurgy conglomerate. In 1962 the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux merged with the Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre to form Tr√©fim√©taux. In 1966 the wire drawing and steel cabling operations of Plant 2 at Le Havre were taken over by the Soci√©t√© des hauts fourneaux de Chiers-Ch√¢tillon, which opened a casting and rolling mill to manufacture small aluminum alloy cables in 1968. In 1969 Chiers-Ch√¢tillon merged with Cousin fr√®res to form the Soci√©t√© Seine et Lys, which closed in 1972, laying off 425 people. Many of those who lost their jobs were women. In 1967 Tr√©fim√©taux was acquired by Pechiney and became the copper division of that group, contributing 8% of the group's total. Pechiney subsidiary In 1971 Pechiney merged with Ugine Kuhlmann to form Pechiney Ugine Kuhlman (PUK). From 1974 PUK suffered serious losses. The threat of mass dismissals was first aired in 1974. Between 1980 and 1987 the Tr√©fim√©taux subsidiary reduced staff from 6,000 to 2,500 and closed the factories in Le Havre and Dives sur Mer. In 1980 it sold its cable production activities to Pirelli. In 1982 PUK was nationalized and restructured, resuming the name of Pechiney, and in 1986 under Jean Gandois the state-owned group began a major expansion. Successor operations in Le Havre The Tr√©fim√©taux copper mill in Le Havre closed in 1980, and in 1981 Tr√©fim√©taux closed its remaining operations in Le Havre. It was succeeded by three companies: Cuivres et Alliages; Chiers, Ch√¢tillon Gorcy (which later became Hauts Fourneaux de la Chiers and then Technor); and Thomson Cables. Cuivres et Alliages was closed in 1984. In 1986 Tecnor, manufacturing wire cables and conductors, took an area of of the La Havre factories, of which were covered, with a line of casting, continuous rolling and wire drawing machines. Technor ceased operations in 1989‚Äì90. In January 2003 Tr√©fileries et C√¢bleries du Havre had 72 employees, falling to about 30 in April 2003. SMI subsidiary In 1987 P√©chiney sold 100% of Tr√©fim√©taux to the Italian company SMI. In 1989 the Soci√©t√© Cuivre et Alliages, a subsidiary of Tr√©fim√©taux since 1987, became a completely separate division. In 1990 the SMI subsidiary Europa Metalli acquired a majority of the shares of KM-Kabelmetal and became the largest copper processor in the world. In 1992 Tr√©fim√©taux reorganized its rolled products division and consolidated its French distribution activities. In 1993 Europa Metalli and Tr√©fim√©taux combined their management, which were divided into three operating segments: rolled products, tubes, and brass and copper bar. In 1995 Tr√©fim√©taux, Europa Metalli of Italy and KM-Kabelmetal of Germany merged to become KME, a wholly owned subsidiary of SMI. In 2005 production of bars was moved into subsidiaries, with the French subsidiary taking the name Tr√©fim√©taux Brass SAS. On 1 May 2007 Tr√©fim√©taux SA was renamed KME France SAS, and Tr√©fim√©taux Brass SAS was renamed KME Brass France SAS. Cupori subsidiary In 2016 European Copper Tubes (ECT), the parent of Cupori OY(fi) of Finland, became partners in the French operations of KME, covering the Givet (Ardennes) tube factory and the Niederbruck (Haut-Rhin) copper bar factory. The KME Italy tube factory in Serravalle Scrivia was included in the agreement. Cupori's Pori unit in Finland was also included.

Description This hydroid branches rather sparsely and irregularly compared with Sertularella gayi. The main stems and side branches are thin, wavy, and of a pale straw colour. As in all Sertularella species, the side branches support alternate hydrothecae, one to each internode. The hydrothecae are bulbous at the base and become narrower towards the rim which has four cusps, and an operculum that consists of four triangular flaps. The gonothecae are generally ovate in shape and slightly rugose in texture. A raised tubular structure with four vertically projecting denticles surrounds the aperture. Although the male and female gonothecae are similar in shape the male is considerably smaller and is white, whilst the female is yellow in colour.

Fong coached Julissa Gomez and Christy Henrich, Olympic hopefuls for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, who died after a competition accident and from anorexia, respectively. He has since coached two Olympic silver medalists: Terin Humphrey and Courtney McCool. Personal life Fong is a second-generation Chinese-American, born and raised in Seattle, Washington. He was a gymnast and earned a gymnastics scholarship to Louisiana State University. Fong is married to former Soviet gymnast Armine Barutyan- Fong, who is a gymnastics coach at GAGE Center. Together they have a daughter, Athena. Career 1970s Fong graduated from Louisiana State University in 1975, and became a gymnastics coach that same year. In 1979, Fong started his own gym, the Great American Gymnastics Express (also known as GAGE Center), in Blue Springs, Missouri. 1980s and 1990s In the 1980s, Fong coached Julissa Gomez and Christy Henrich. Gomez died after breaking her neck while performing a Yurchenko vault. Henrich died from complications of anorexia nervosa. After Henrich's death, Fong stopped coaching elite gymnastics and instead taught after school programs. 2000s He coached Olympic silver medalists Terin Humphrey and Courtney McCool at his gym, GAGE Center, in Blue Springs. Fong has said his coaching style has changed: \\"There is no yelling or screaming[...]If anybody who knew me 20 years ago saw this, they'd say 'Bulls----\\". At a selection camp for the 2003 World Championships, Humphrey was selected as a second alternate. She was not allowed to practice with the U.S. team. Fong commented that the experience was very painful and said Humphrey should have been selected to compete. Fong was involved in a scoring controversy concerning the men's all around competition at the 2004 Athens Olympics when Korean Olympic officials lodged a protest against American gymnast Paul Hamms score. 2010s Fong currently coaches Leanne Wong and Kara Eaker. Athlete deaths Julissa Gomez and the Yurchenko vault Julissa Gomez broke her neck while performing a Yurchenko vault in 1988 during the World Sports Fair in Japan, just before the 1988 Olympic trials. She died as a result of her injuries in hospital.\\"Tales from the vaults\\" Rebecca Seal, Guardian Unlimited, 4 December 2005, url = http://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3027224 After the accident Fong said: \\"One thing is certain...Julissa certainly wouldn't want national team members to stop competing, or want me to quit being the coach that I am\\". After the accident some coaches supported banning the vault entirely, but Fong said that \\"a lot of the coaches are concerned about the hysteria going on about this vault[...]This could hamper the development of the sport.\\" He said that banning the vault would put the United States even further behind the Soviets and suggested that coaches should teach the vault to gymnasts when they are younger so they will have more time to develop it. Another one of Fong's gymnasts Karen Tiereny cracked the C-1 vertebra in her neck when she landed on her head performing the Yurchenko vault at the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1987. Tiereny decided she would not perform the vault anymore and has said that Fong continued to encourage her to perform it anyway. Fong insists that he did not pressure Tiereny to continue performing the Yurchenko. Christy Henrich He coached Christy Henrich, who missed the 1988 Seoul Olympics by .188. Henrich developed anorexia nervosa after a judge told her she was too heavy at 93 pounds to make the Olympic team. As a result of her illness, she was unable to compete after 1990. She retired from the sport in 1991 and died from multiple organ system failure in 1994 at 22 years of age. Fong had stopped coaching Christy in 1989 and has said that he \\"kicked her out of the gym for her own good\\" adding that she had lost the strength needed to complete her routines safely. Henrich has said that Fong called her the \\"Pillsbury Dough Boy\\", which Fong has denied. Fong stopped coaching elite gymnastics for a time after Henrich's death. The best gymnasts left his gym and his reputation as a coach was damaged. He taught after school programs for a time, until he met nine year old Terin Humphrey.

As a two-year-old in 1918 she won the Cheveley Park Stakes and was placed in several other races against male opposition. In the following year she was beaten in the 1000 Guineas before recording an upset victory in the Epsom Oaks. Her racing career was ended by injury later that year. As a broodmare she produced very few foals, but exerted an enduring influence on the breed as the female-line ancestor of Sharpen Up. Background Lady James Douglas with Jessica in 1919. Bayuda was a \\"small\\", but \\"handsome\\" bay mare bred in England by Lady James Douglas, who owned her during her racing career. Born Martha Lucy Hennessy, Lady James Douglas was the widow of Lord James Douglas, a younger son of the 8th Marquess of Queensberry. The filly was sent into training with by Alec Taylor, Jr. at Manton, Wiltshire. She was sired by Bayardo, the best British racehorse of his era whose wins included the Eclipse Stakes, St. Leger Stakes Champion Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included the Triple Crown winners Gay Crusader and Gainsborough. Bayuda's dam Jessica was a granddaughter of Bayolia, a half- sister to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Morion. Racing career=1918: two- year-old season= Bayuda was one of the best British two-year-old fillies of her year. Whe matched against male opposition in the Autumn Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in September, she finished three quarters of a length second to the season's best juvenile colt The Panther with Galloper Light (later to win the Grand Prix de Paris) in third. In October, ridden by Joe Childs, she started the 11/10 favourite for Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at the same track and reportedly won \\"in a canter\\", from Beresina and Mapledurham. In her two other races that year she raced against colts, finishing fourth in the Soltikoff Stakes (to Grand Parade) and third in the Free Handicap. =1919: three-year-old season= In May 1919, Bayuda ran in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Starting the 7/2 second choice in the betting she led till half way but then faded and finished fourth behind Roseway, Britannia and Glaciale. On 6 of June Bayuda contested the 141st running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. With Childs in the saddle she started at odds of 100/7 (just over 14/1) in a ten-runner field headed by Roseway, who went off at odds of 4/7. After racing towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Britannia set the pace from Lady Pergrine, Beresina and Roseway, but began to make rapid progress approaching the final turn. Bayuda took the lead a furlong out and won the race by one and a half lengths from Roseway with Mapledurham the same distance away in third. Her winning timeof 2:37.2 was a new record for the race. On her next appearance Bayuda ran in the St George Stakes over eleven furlongs at Liverpool Racecourse in July. She was beaten a head by Lord Derby's colt Rothesay Bay, to whom she was conceding 21 pounds in weight.
