It is owned by Trifords Ltd, and is headquartered in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Working predominantly with insurers, brokers and fleet management customers, the company operates a nationwide fitting centre network that utilises a mobile fleet of trained technicians. It is one of the largest windscreen replacement operations in the United Kingdom, with hundreds of employees working across its sites and at its Chesterfield based customer service contact centre. Auto Windscreens was established in March 2011, after the collapse of the previous company, which had operated since 1971. Auto Windscreens (1971‚Äì2011) =History= The company was founded by an entrepreneur (Brian Holmes) in 1971. It was incorporated on 20 May as Auto Windscreens (Chesterfield) Ltd, as company number 01011907. was part of national windscreens. In 1982, it opened its own manufacturing facility in Chesterfield. In 1986, it was purchased by the holding company, Heywood Williams, whose businesses portfolio at the time included the largest glass distribution company in the United Kingdom. In 1988, the company was renamed to just Auto Windscreens Ltd, and in 1989 to Heywood Williams Automotive Ltd. Having sold the glass distribution business in 1990 to Pilkington, Heywood Williams sold the Auto Windscreens company to HSBC Private Equity in August 1998, for ¬£77.2m, reverting to the name Auto Windscreens Ltd. HSBC left the existing management structure in place, with the intention of a trade sale or flotation at a later date. A trade sale by HSBC followed in March 2001, with the company being sold to the group Lex Service plc for ¬£112m. Lex were also the owners of RAC Motoring Services Ltd, one of the largest automotive road side repair recovery companies in the United Kingdom, alongside The Automobile Association, and re branded and renamed the company as RAC Auto Windscreens and RAC Auto Windscreens Ltd. The takeover positioned the company as the contracted supplier to other Lex Group insurance companies, and expanded the visibility of the RAC brand through the Auto Windscreen's vehicle fleet. Having purchased the RAC business from the Royal Automobile Club in September 1999, Lex Group renamed themselves RAC plc in 2002. The RAC Auto Windscreens business was included as part of the deal to buy RAC plc by the global insurance group Aviva in March 2005. In December 2008, as their first acquisition in the United Kingdom, the business was purchased from Aviva by the German private equity company Arques Industries AG, a business restructuring and development specialist, for a \\"symbolic purchase price\\". After the purchase, the company reverted to the name Auto Windscreens Ltd, and was re established as an independent brand, with a redesigned logo. In December 2009, the company was sold to Moguntia Invest, a German investment fund controlled by Christian Daumann. Daumann was the Arques executive responsible for their original purchase of the company a year before. Administration On 14 February 2011, the company entered administration, suspending trading and sending staff home. With a turnover of ¬£63m, the company had run out of cash after a drop in business leading to an unnamed creditor filing a winding up order. Cash flow problems had arisen after their former owner Aviva, still a major client, terminated their supply contract, and after IT related delays affected the implementation of a restructuring programme. As the appointed administrators, Deloitte sought to find a source of short term trading capital, pending a sale of the business. Both before and after the suspension of trading, several other companies took over Auto Windscreen's share of the market, with Autoglass gaining the Aviva contract, as well as National Windscreens, Nationwide Windscreen Services and AA AutoWindshields, being chosen as alternative suppliers by both fleet and private customers. Liquidation On 7 February 2011, Trifords Ltd was formed as a business by the parent company Markerstudy Group Insurance, the details of the purpose of this business are still a little vague but by the dates we can see, it was ready for the purchase of AW before the liquidators were called. After failing to find a buyer for the business as a going concern, Deloitte announced on 25 February 2011 that it had been closed and would be liquidated, with 1,042 staff being made redundant. On 3 March 2011, it was announced that Trifords Ltd that they had purchased some parts of the former Auto Windscreens business, including the rights to use the Auto Windscreens brand name. See #Auto Windscreens (2011 onwards) Deloitte put the manufacturing facility in Chesterfield up for sale on 15 March 2011, with a guide price of ¬£1m. If no buyer was found for the site as a whole, then the machinery, stock and materials was to be auctioned off separately, over 28‚Äì30 March 2011. =Operations= At the time of administration, the company had 1,000 staff, and operated a fleet of 550 fitting vehicles and 68 fitting centres. Based in Chesterfield, there was also a distribution centre in Birmingham, and a customer services call centre. The company's clients were a mixture of private motorists, car insurers and fleet vehicle operators. As the only replacement windscreen specialist in the United Kingdom with its own manufacturing facility, it could produce and stock its own small batches of standard replacement windows and windscreens to the same specifications as the original equipment manufacturers, as well as serve as an original manufacturer itself in specialist niche markets such as limousines, hearses and the police, as well as producing value added versions of standard products. It also produced one off products for the vintage and replica markets. The parent company of Trifords, Markerstudy Group, knew this was running at a loss and had to wait for the company to go into liquidation to remove all the debt before selecting which parts of the company it wanted to keep under the newly formed umbrella of Trifords Ltd. =Football Sponsorship= Partick Thistle, who they sponsored from 1997 to 1999. The company was involved in English football sponsorship, acting as the title sponsor of The Football League's cup competition Football League Trophy for six seasons, from 1994‚Äì95 to 1999-00. For this period, the competition was officially called the Auto Windscreens Shield, although the name Auto Windscreens trophy was also common. The company had replaced their main competitor Autoglass as the sponsor, with the competition previously known as the Autoglass Trophy. After 2000, the competition became the LDV Vans Trophy. The company was also a corporate partner (although not main shirt sponsor) of their local football team Chesterfield F.C. (The Spireites), signing deals in 2008 and 2010. Auto Windscreens (2011 onwards) =History= On 3 March 2011, it was announced that Trifords Ltd had purchased some parts of the former Auto Windscreens business including the rights to the brand name Auto Windscreens, and the freehold on three sites including the Chesterfield headquarters. The new company was incorporated as Trifords Limited (No. 07518924). Trifords is part of the Markerstudy Group, a privately owned composite financial services organisation established in 2001 and based in Sundridge, Kent. The former sales and marketing director Nigel Davies was appointed managing director of the new company. The trade press speculated the purchase had possibly happened as early as 25 February, based on the resurrection of the old Auto Windscreens website, but with updated company information. =Operations= The new company planned to initially create 250 jobs and grow the business under the already established and recognised brand, trading as Auto Windscreens. It would continue to serve both fleet, insurance and private customers, with the operation being complemented by the parent Markerstudy Group's existing core insurance businesses. While the freehold to the old company's Chesterfield HQ was bought by Trifords, the new company was registered to an office in Crawley, West Sussex. Auto Windscreens, still headquartered in Chesterfield, employs hundreds of people and has gradually rebuilt its customer base, with companies including Admiral, BGL Group, Sixt, Morrisons and Pendragon Contracts now using its services. It has a team of around three hundred technicians and added to its fitting centre network in March 2013, with new sites at Lingfield, Rochester and Guildford. More have since opened. When the new company was established, Metrix service management software (now IFS Field Service Management) was implemented with the aim of improving efficiency and the customer journey. Personal digital devices (PDAs) for technicians and a mobile insurance application were also introduced to aid operations. In August 2011, Auto Windscreens‚Äô technical training facility in Chesterfield re affirmed its GQA accreditation and two of its technicians took gold and silver at the UK Master Fitter in November 2012. On 17 May 2017, it was announced that Auto Windscreens would become the new shirt sponsor of AFC Rushden & Diamonds for the season of 2017/18.

It was located on Middleton Island, in the Gulf of Alaska, south of Anchorage, Alaska. History Middleton Island AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. The station was constructed on Middleton Island, an isolated island about miles long and 1/2 mile wide in the Gulf of Alaska. Unlike the other AC&W; stations in Alaska, the extreme arctic cold was moderated by the Pacific Ocean water and did not fall to sub-freezing levels. The weather, however, was frequently overcast and heavy rain and wind were common. Plans were made for a permanent radar site beginning in late 1956. In 1957, the island was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management to the Department of Defense for construction of the station. A dock facility was initially constructed which allowed Naval LSTs and barges to land construction equipment and material on the island, and several gravel roads were constructed to the several construction sites. In addition, an airstrip was constructed on the island, allowing cargo transports and personnel to fly in and out. With the relative moderate climate on Middleton Island, the buildings were not all connected by hallways. However, as with all remote AC&W; sites in Alaska, tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 720th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the station in May 1958 and operated AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-6, AN/FPS-8, and AN/FPS-4 radars. As a surveillance station, its mission was to monitor the airspace for aircraft activity and provide information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Fire Island AFS near Anchorage, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, speed, and whether aircraft were friendly or hostile. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, constructed a White Alice Communications System communications site at the station, operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Middleton Island site was activated in 1958. Middleton Island Air Force Station was very expensive to maintain, and was inactivated due to budget reductions on 15 May 1963, its mission being taken over by other AAC surveillance radar sites with upgraded and more capable equipment. Today the site remains abandoned and deteriorating. Photography of the island shows abandoned buildings, radar towers and communications antennas, all in a highly deteriorated state.

Girl in White has been part of the Chester Dale Collection in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. since 1963. Auvers-sur-Oise In May 1890, Van Gogh traveled from Saint-R√©my to Paris where he had a three-day stay with his brother, Theo, Theo's wife Johanna and their new baby Vincent. Van Gogh found that unlike his past experiences in Paris, he was no longer used to the commotion of the city and was too agitated to paint. His brother, Theo and artist Camille Pissarro developed a plan for Van Gogh to go to Auvers-sur-Oise with a letter of introduction for Dr. Paul Gachet, a homeopathic physician and art patron who lived in Auvers. Van Gogh had a room at the inn Auberge Ravoux in Auvers and was under the care and supervision of Dr. Gachet with whom he grew to have a close relationship, \\"something like another brother.\\" Gachet and his daughter were both subjects for Van Gogh's paintings. For a time, Van Gogh seemed to improve. He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings. From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings. Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as The Church at Auvers, portraits, and the nearby fields. \\"But for all his appearance of a renewed well-being,\\" observes Wallace, \\"his life was very near its end.\\" Illness struck Theo's baby, Vincent. Theo had both health and employment issues; he considered leaving his employer and starting his own business. Gachet, said to have his own eccentricities and neurosis, caused Van Gogh sufficient concern to question, \\"Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both end up in the ditch?\\" After visiting Paris for a family conference, Van Gogh returned to Auvers more bleak. In a letter he wrote, \\"And the prospect grows darker, I see no future at all.\\" The painting Vincent van Gogh, Young Peasant Woman with Straw Hat Sitting in the Wheat, June 1890Of the paintings Van Gogh completed in Auvers, there were two of the same woman. He describes her as \\"a peasant woman, big yellow hat with a knot of sky-blue ribbons.\\" The second painting may be Young Peasant Woman with Straw Hat Sitting in the Wheat. Van Gogh uses the \\"picture plane\\" for dramatic effect. \\"How painters use the 'picture plane' is a telling measure,\\" Harrison explains, \\"of the usually intended effects of their work and their disposition toward the spectator.\\" Having the woman fill most of the pictorial space, she appears closer to the audience. Van Gogh further shadowed her face and gave her a \\"distant, unfocused\\" gaze. By also having the woman in close proximity, her emotional distance is \\"poignant\\". Comparison to literal likeness John Liston Byam Shaw, 1900 Boer War In Primitivism, Cubism, Abstraction: The Early Twentieth Century, the authors compare Van Gogh's Girl in White to the portrait of a woman in John Byam Shaw's 1900 Boer War. They make the comparison by identifying desired characteristics of modernistic art, such as works \\"emphasizing formal aspects, and as embodying what they took to be a 'primitive' or 'direct' vision such as Vincent van Gogh's Girl in White. To modernists, this is desirable over the \\"exhibited skill and sophistication of literal likeness,\\" such as John Byam Shaw's 1900 Boer War. The more primitive and direct works, they say, provide a richer feeling, whereas the literal interpretation represents a lack of \\"emotional content\\". Provenance * Johanna van Gogh-Bonger (1862-1925), the artist's sister-in-law, of Amsterdam sold the painting in August 1908 to J.H. de Bois. Five of the paintings that were sold by Johanna became part of the National Gallery of Art collection. * J.H. de Bois, an art dealer and director of The Hague branch of the C.M. Van Gogh gallery had the painting for a portion of 1908. C.M. van Gogh was Vincent's uncle. * Richard Kisling (1862-1913) of Z√ºrich, an avid collector with 4000 paintings, purchased the painting in 1908 from J.H. de Bois. * Hedwig Glatt-Kisling of Z√ºrich had the painting from 1908 to 1929. * Max Bollag, a gallery owner, of Z√ºrich then had the painting. He sold it in 1951 to Chester Dale. * Chester Dale (1882-1962) of New York owned the painting from 1951 to 1963. * In 1963 the painting was bequeathed to the National Gallery of Art and placed in the Chester Dale Collection. Chester Dale, as passionate and successful in his art collection as he was on Wall Street, bequeathed in 1962 to the National Gallery of Art some of the most important French painting from the late 19th and early 20th centuries in America.

Testimony The Chicago Hearing panel The testimonies of the witnesses and the subsequent questions fell into three categories: Property Rights; Freedom of Movement, Association and Speech; and Military Aid and Armaments. A speaker explained the context of each topic and introduced the speaker(s). =Property Rights= This issue was introduced by Mezna Qato, a Palestinian-American and human rights activist completing her doctorate at Oxford University. Jeff Halper of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions spoke extensively about the property right issues which came into being following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and how they continue today. \\"In 1948, 94 percent of the country that was called Palestine...was owned by Palestinians. By the end of 1949...94 percent of the land that became Israel was now in Israeli Jewish hands.\\"YouTube video of Part 3 of the hearing: \\"Property Rights & Land\\" =Freedom of Movement, Association and Speech= Lisa Kosowski, daughter of a Holocaust survivor and a board member of the Arab-Jewish Partnership, introduced this topic. Jad Isaac spoke about the physical and administrative obstacles which impede Palestinians' freedom of movement within the occupied territories. He used as a case example the time it takes to travel between the cities of Jenin and Hebron in Israel-Palestine, a distance of about 80 miles. For an Israeli, Isaac said the trip would take about an hour. For a Palestinian, who must travel on separate roads and go through many more security checkpoints, the trip would take about four hours, said Isaac. =Military Aid and Armaments= The witnesses were introduced by Josh Ruebner, National Advocacy Director for the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation. Cindy Corrie and Amer Shurrab both gave their personal testimonies on this issue. Shurrab told the panel that IDF soldiers had fired, unprovoked, on a vehicle containing his father and two brothers, leading to the death of the brothers. He also described how the IDF would not allow an ambulance to enter the area for 11 hours after the shooting, leading to one of his brothers dying from blood loss due to a non-fatal leg wound. Corrie related the story of her daughter's activism in Gaza. Rachel Corrie stood in front of a Caterpillar bulldozer in order to prevent it from demolishing a Palestinian home. The bulldozer continued on its path, crushing Rachel to death. Findings and Conclusions The Chicago Hearing's Organizing Committee published a 28-page Final Report which includes summaries of the testimonies as well as detailed maps, charts and statistics regarding U.S. policy in Israel and Palestine.

It is about a woman named Lillian, and her self- psychoanalysis. The setting is taken from Ana√Øs' diary account of her first trip to Acapulco in 1947, and the novel repeats much of the first part of The Diary of Ana√Øs Nin volume V. Since the author was concerned with psychology rather than physical adventure, there is actually less violence in the novel than in the diary account. The exception is that the doctor allows himself to be shot because he is loved only as a doctor and never as a man, perhaps patterned after her understanding of Otto Rank's death.

Shishman, who was bestowed the title of \\"despot\\" by Bulgarian emperor George Terter I, was a Cuman, and may have been established as lord of Vidin as early as the 1270s. In 1291, he came under Golden Horde (\\"Tatar\\") suzerainty and in 1292 he was in charge of an unsuccessful campaign against neighbouring Serbia. Even though the Serbs captured Vidin in their counter-offensive, perhaps thanks to Tatar influence Shishman was placed once more as the ruler of the region, this time as a Serbian vassal. However, he continued to rule his lands largely independently. As his son and successor as despot of Vidin Michael Shishman acceded to the Bulgarian throne in 1323, Shishman was the progenitor of the last medieval Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Shishman dynasty. Bulgarian despot and Tatar suzerainty Shishman's early life and rise through the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility are poorly documented. He was a Cuman, considered to have been a descendant of the wave of Cumans that settled in Bulgaria after 1241, when ethnic conflicts with the Hungarians caused them to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. It has been accepted in Bulgarian historiography that Shishman's first wife was an unnamed daughter of Anna-Teodora and sebastokrator Peter and thus a maternal granddaughter of Emperor Ivan Asen II (r. 1218‚Äì1241) of the Asen dynasty.–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 21–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, pp. 112‚Äì113 In contemporary sources, Shishman is variously described as a prince (knyaz), king or even emperor (tsar) of Bulgaria, though his only official title was that of \\"despot\\".–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, p. 395 According to historian John V. A. Fine, Shishman may have established his authority over the Vidin region as early as the 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav.Fine, p. 220 He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280‚Äì1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I. Shishman's domain comprised \\"much of the Bulgarian land\\" as well as \\"adjacent countries\\", as reported by the account of Serbian archbishop Danilo. Indeed, his lands constituted the largest autonomous province of Bulgaria at the time. Bulgarian historian Yordan Andreev estimates the lands ruled by Shishman to have extended from the Iron Gates gorge of the Danube in the west to the towns of Lom and Vratsa in the east. Shishman also controlled territories north of the Danube, in western Wallachia (Oltenia), as chroniclers describe the Danube River as running through the middle of his lands. In 1285, increasing Tatar pressure from the northeast had forced the Second Bulgarian Empire to come under the political dependence of Nogai Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde. At the time Shishman's realm centred at Vidin was largely independent from the Bulgarian tsars in Tarnovo, though he retained a degree of loyalty to Bulgaria and maintained friendly relations with Serbia. However, in 1291 Shishman too was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Nogai in order to counter the increasing Serbian pressure from the west. In the same year, the joint forces of brothers, one Hungarian vassal Stefan Dragutin, and Serbian king Stefan Milutin (r. 1280‚Äì1321), had managed to oust two Cuman‚ÄìBulgarian nobles and allies of Shishman, Darman and Kudelin, who were in control of the Braniƒçevo region. As result, SHishman failed to repel the brothers forces, and accepted Serbian suzerainty.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 88 Anti-Serbian campaign and Serbian vassalage The medieval Baba Vida castle in Vidin, the capital of Shishman's semi-independent realm Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman launched a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks to the support of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno (in Kosovo). After attempting to conquer the fortress of ≈Ωdrelo near Peƒá to no avail and burning the ≈Ωiƒça monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains.Fine, p. 221 Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube to the safety of his Tatar suzerains. Instead of annexing Shishman's lands, Milutin reinstalled Shishman as the despot of Vidin and concluded an alliance with him. To confirm the alliance, Shishman married the daughter of Serbian veliki ≈æupan Drago≈°. The future marriage of Shishman's son and future Bulgarian emperor Michael Shishman (r. 1323‚Äì1330) to Milutin's daughter Ana-Neda was also arranged at the time with the intention of further sealing the union. It is quite apparent that Shishman's unlikely reinstallment in Vidin and alliance with Serbia were dictated by Nogai, as at the same time Serbia also came under Tatar dependence. Milutin was even forced to send his son Stefan Deƒçanski into captivity in order to prevent a Tatar attack. Although Shishman's realm was nominally a Serbian client state for an unknown time, he retained his prior semi-independence and he was completely in charge of his lands. He maintained good relations with Bulgaria and, according to Andreev, his political activity was mainly concentrated in dealing with Bulgaria. He also retained his close ties with Nogai and his descendants. In 1301‚Äì1302, Shishman provided political refuge to several of Nogai's relatives, including his grandson Qara-Kesek, who fled to Vidin along with a 3,000-strong cavalry and remained there until after 1325. These Tatar nobles were fleeing from the persecution of the new khan, Toqta, who had defeated and murdered Nogai in 1299‚Äì1300. Contrary to Andreev's opinion, Fine believes that the death of Nogai increased Serbia's influence over Vidin.Fine, p. 261 Shishman died in the early 14th century but before 1308 or 1313.Fine, p. 268 He was succeeded as ruler of Vidin by his son Michael, who in 1323 was elected to the Bulgarian throne due to the childless death of Emperor George Terter II (r. 1321‚Äì1322). Besides Michael, Shishman's other progeny included Belaur, another despot of Vidin, and Keratsa Petritsa, the mother of Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371). Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov classifies all of Shishman's known children as descendants of the Asen dynasty, thus indicating that they were born to his first wife, the daughter of Anna‚ÄìTheodora.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, pp. 119, 134, 136 The descendants of Shishman of Vidin, known collectively as the Shishman dynasty, ruled the Second Bulgarian Empire from 1323 until it was ultimately subjugated by the Ottomans at the turn of the 15th century.Fine, p. 269 References Sources  13th-century births 13th-century Bulgarian people 14th-century Bulgarian people 14th-century deaths Medieval Bulgarian nobility Medieval Bulgarian military personnel People from Vidin Shishman dynasty Cumans Despots (court title) Tsardom of Vidin People of the Kingdom of Serbia (medieval) ","title":"Shishman of Vidin"},{"id":"31253204","text":"Catherine of Castile (Castilian: Catalina de Castilla; 5 October 1422 - 17 September 1424) was suo jure Princess of Asturias and heiress presumptive to the Castilian throne all her life.

Sugimoto became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1952.Branham, Erin. \\" Henry Yuzuru Sugimoto (1900‚Äì1990),\\" (September 4, 2008) Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture. Retrieved November 4, 2014. Early life and career Sugimoto was born in Wakayama in central Japan, the grandson of a displaced samurai. His father emigrated to the United States soon after he was born, and his mother followed nine years later, leaving Sugimoto and a younger brother to be raised by their maternal grandparents. In 1919, he immigrated to the United States and changed his name to Henry, joining his parents in Hanford, California. After graduating from Hanford Union High School in 1924, he briefly attended the University of California, Berkeley before transferring to the California College of Arts and Crafts, where he studied oil painting, graduating with honors in 1928. Sugimoto continued his studies at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) but later that year went to France to study at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. He eventually quit the Acad√©mie and moved to the French countryside to paint landscapes; one of these paintings was accepted for exhibition at the 1931 Salon d'Automne. Sugimoto returned from France to California in 1932. He mounted a one-man show at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. This show, which was expanded in size and extended for a longer run due to its popularity, became the foundation of an evolving professional career.Kim, Kristine. (2000). Sugimoto continued to exhibit his work around the Bay Area, and in 1934 he married Susie Tagawa and moved back to Hanford, where he worked in a laundry and taught art classes. Internment Sugimoto was living in Hanford when the United States declared war on Japan after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Following Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to evict \\"any or all persons\\" from the West Coast, Sugimoto was removed with his wife and daughter to the Pinedale Assembly Center. He was later transferred to the Jerome War Relocation Center in October 1942, and again to Rohwer in June 1944, where he remained until August 1945. Soon after arriving in camp, Sugimoto began painting on sheets, pillowcases and other scrap materials, hiding his early work from administrators because he feared his critical depictions of camp life would be confiscated. However, after receiving encouragement from WRA officials (who went so far as to include him in a propaganda film), he began to paint openly, creating some 100 oil paintings, watercolors and sketches during his confinement. He taught art classes to other inmates, and in February 1944 he was able to exhibit some of his camp work at the nearby Hendrix College. Postwar years Sugimoto was released from Rohwer in 1945. He briefly returned to San Francisco to reclaim about 100 paintings he had left in storage, but found that they had been auctioned off while he was in camp. After failing to recover the proceeds from the sales, he relocated to New York, where he continued painting and worked on the side as a textile designer and book artist. During this time he illustrated books by Japanese Christian missionary Toyohiko Kagawa and Japanese American author Yoshiko Uchida. He participated in various exhibitions, including a 1960 show of the Society of Washington Printmakers at the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1962 his work appeared at New York's Galerie Internationale. The Galerie exhibit was his first solo show in nearly twenty years, but due to a concurrent newspaper strike it received little public attention and attracted few buyers. Sugimoto was again featured at the Galerie in 1965, but this show was again largely unsuccessful. However, around this time his work began to receive renewed attention from artists and activists connected to the redress movement and the establishment of Asian American Studies programs. In 1972, two murals he had created in Topaz were highlighted in Months of Waiting, 1942-1945, an exhibition of artwork from the camps, and the Los Angeles Times reproduced both. Sugimoto began to create new woodblock prints exploring camp themes and became involved in the redress movement himself, testifying before the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in 1981.

At that time Sourmilk Hill Lane continued across Church Road and onto what is today Larne Crescent, the asylum occupied the land on the corner of modern-day Larne Crescent and Church Road. It operated during the nineteenth century and provided isolation and medical care to hundreds of patients at a time when disease and illness in England were treated predominantly through isolation and asylum.Carlton, 1974: 55 At least two patients escaped from the institution, which closed around 1880.  Conception and opening  Ordnance Survey map of Sheriff Hill in 1862 showing the asylumSheriff Hill Lunatic Asylum was situated on Sour Milk Hill Lane, Sheriff Hill, during the nineteenth century.Manders, 1973: 241 Wesleyan records circa 1830 note that \\"Sheriff Hill Lunatic Asylum is pleasantly situated on an ninence, about two-and-a-half miles south of Gateshead, from which a fine aspect of Ravensworth and its vicinity may be obtained\\".Manders, 1973: 242 The old site of Sheriff Hill Asylum lies dormant today. Surviving archive photographs show that the asylum was designed in a rough square, with buildings on all four sides enclosing a courtyard.Available at Gateshead Council's public archives at I-See Gateshead The exact date of opening remains the subject to debate. Contemporary sources indicate that the asylum opened in 1817,Roberts, 2001 This database is a resource maintained by Andrew Roberts, a professional academic at the University of Middlesex (retrieved 18 March 2011) yet others note that when the asylum was advertised in 1834 the posting revealed that \\"this institution has been established for over thirty years\\".This advertisement from the Newcastle Evening Chronicle (dated 13 June 1834) has been retained, in original form, in the third of four books of scraps at Gateshead Central Library.  Ownership and Operation  The site of the asylum It is likely that the asylum was opened by a Mrs Orton and that at some stage soon after ownership was transferred to Jacob Gowling and his wife, who soon moved onto nearby Wrekenton to open a new asylum in a similar vein.Manders, 1973: 211 In 1834, the asylum was in the hands of Samuel Kent, a wealthy local man who owned Beacon Lough Farm and who remained proprietor until the asylum was closed. According to the 1841 census there were 81 inmates at that time. In 1844, records show that the asylum had 86 patients. Of these, some eighty are recorded as being \\"pauper\\" whilst the other six are listed as \\"private\\". The weekly charge for the receipt and treatment of paupers was \\"8/- including clothes\\". In 1855, the asylum was contracted to receive paupers requiring treatment from neighbouring Newcastle. This increased the patient numbers to ninety-four, with eighty-eight paupers. In 1817, Jonathan Martin, the brother of artist John Martin, was committed to the asylum after threatening to shoot the Bishop of Oxford. He escaped via the roof three years later.Manders, 1973: 212 Another, more notorious incident occurred in December 1842: > An epileptic lunatic escaped from Mr. Kent's asylum at Gateshead Fell ... He > was immediately pursued but was not retaken ... He escaped on Saturday night > and on the Monday after his escape he murdered his wife and his daughter in > a violent paroxysm of epileptic mania, in a most savage and horrid manner. > This wretched man is now a furious criminal maniac...The Earl of > Shaftesbury, 1844: 72  Closure  The exact date of closure is unknown. However, once the asylum closed, the buildings survived and were renamed to the less conspicuous \\"Kent's buildings\\" and the rather more so \\"Asylum Square\\". The buildings were to prove durable and as late as 1932, local historian D. Lumley wrote that \\"a great part of the building still remains\\".Paraphrased by Manders, 1973: 213 It is not known when the building was finally demolished, but the present site is derelict.

Individuals can also engage in local and political advocacy around issues of climate change. , emissions budgets are uncertain but estimates of the annual average carbon footprint per person required to meet the target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees by 2100 are all below the world average of about 5 tonnes -equivalent. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report emphasises that behavior, lifestyle and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change. In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact, with the richest 10% of people emitting about half the total lifestyle emissions. Several scientific studies have shown that when people, especially those living in developed countries but more generally including all countries, wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key \\"high-impact\\" actions they can take such as having one fewer child (58.6 tonnes), living car-free (2.4 tonnes), avoiding one round- trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes), and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tonnes). These differ significantly from much popular advice for \\"greening\\" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the \\"low-impact\\" category. Some commentators have argued that individual actions as consumers and \\"greening personal lives\\" are insignificant in comparison to collective action, especially actions that hold the fossil fuel corporations accountable for producing 71% of carbon emissions since 1988. The concept of a personal carbon footprint and calculating one's footprint was popularized by oil producer BP as \\"effective propaganda\\" as way to shift their responsibility to \\"linguistically...remove itself as a contributor to the problem of climate change\\". Others say that individual action leads to collective action, and emphasize that \\"research on social behavior suggests lifestyle change can build momentum for systemic change.\\" Suggested individual target amount Global average greenhouse gas per person per year in the late 2010s was about 7 tonnes  including 0.7 tonnes CO2eq food, 1.1 tonnes from the home, and 0.8 tonnes from transport. Some estimates of the annual carbon footprint per person required to meet the Paris Agreement are: 4.5 tonnes by 2030, 3 tonnes and 2.1 tonnes by 2050. this is somewhat more than the average person in India, somewhat less than the average person in France or China, and vastly less than the average person in the USA or Australia. Per capita emissions also vary significantly within countries, with wealthier individuals creating more emissions. A 2015 Oxfam report calculated that the wealthiest 10% of the global population were responsible for half of all greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-richest-10-produce- half-carbon-emissions-while-poorest-35-billion-account. Family size Although having fewer children is arguably the individual action that most effectively reduces a person's climate impact, the issue is rarely raised, and it is arguably controversial due to its private nature. Even so, ethicists, some politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and others have started discussing the climate implications associated with reproduction. It has been claimed that not having an additional child saves \\"an average for developed countries\\" of 58.6 tonnes-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year and \\"a US family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.\\" This is based on the premise that a person is responsible for the carbon emissions of their descendants, weighted by relatedness (the person is responsible for half their children's emissions, a quarter of their grandchildren's and so on). This has been criticised: both as a category mistake for assigning descendants emissions to their ancestors and for the very long timescale of reductions. An April 2020 study published in PLOS One found that, among two-adult Swedish households, those with children increased carbon emission in two ways, by adding to the population and by increasing their own carbon emissions by consuming greater quantities of meat and gasoline for transportation than their counterparts without children; an increase of some 25% more than the latter. According to one of the contributors to the study, University of Wyoming economist Linda Thunstrom, \\"If we're finding these results in Sweden, it's pretty safe to assume that the disparity in carbon footprints between parents and non-parents is even bigger in most other Western countries.\\" Two interrelated aspects of this action, family planning and women and girl's education, are modeled by Project Drawdown as the #6 and #7 top potential solutions for climate change, based on the ability of family planning and education to reduce the growth of the overall global population. In 2019, a warning on climate change signed by 11,000 scientists from 153 nations said that human population growth adds 80 million humans annually, and \\"the world population must be stabilized‚Äîand, ideally, gradually reduced‚Äîwithin a framework that ensures social integrity\\" to reduce the impact of \\"population growth on GHG emissions and biodiversity loss.\\" The policies they promote, which \\"are proven and effective policies that strengthen human rights while lowering fertility rates,\\" would include removing barriers to gender equality, especially in education, and ensuring family planning services are available to all. Travel and commuting In the early 21st century perception towards climate change influenced some people in rich countries to change their travel lifestyle. =Air transport= Avoiding air travel and particularly frequent flyer programs has a high benefit because the convenience makes frequent, long distance travel easy, and high-altitude emissions are more potent for the climate than the same emissions made at ground level. Aviation is much more difficult to fix technically than surface transport, so will need more individual action in future if the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation cannot be made to work properly. =Surface transport= thumb Amish kick scooters *Walking and running are among the least environmentally harmful modes of transportation. *Cycling follows walking and running as having a low impact on the environment. *Public transport such as electric buses, metro and electric trains generally emit less greenhouse gases than cars per passenger. *Electric kick scooters could also be a low-impact form of transportation, with emerging startups such as Bird and Lime providing shared scooters allowing for last- mile transportation. However, their short lifespan caused by rough usage and vandalism could mean additional resources spent on replacement units. Some models provide higher range (35+ miles, 56+ km) and speed (40+ mph, 64+ km/h), which can be used in areas with poor public transportation infrastructure where cars and motorcycles would have previously been the only option. * Cars: Using an electric car instead of a gasoline or diesel car helps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. *Going car-free may be the most effective action an individual can take, according to the BBC. Diet and food Vegan pho ingredients Agriculture is very difficult to fix technically so will need more individual action or carbon offsetting than all other sectors except perhaps aviation. Eating less meat, especially beef and lamb, reduces emissions. A diet which is part of individual action on climate change is also good for health, averaging less than 15g (about half an ounce) of red meat and 250g dairy (about one glass of milk) per day. The World Health Organization recommends trans-fats make up less than 1% of total energy intake: ruminant trans-fats are found in beef, lamb, milk and cheese. In 2019, the IPCC released a summary of the 2019 special report which asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Ecologist Hans-Otto P√∂rtner, who contributed to the report, said \\"We don't want to tell people what to eat, but it would indeed be beneficial, for both climate and human health, if people in many rich countries consumed less meat, and if politics would create appropriate incentives to that effect.\\" Eating a plant-rich diet is listed as the #4 solution for climate change as modeled by Project Drawdown, based on avoided emissions from the production of animals and avoided emissions from additional deforestation for grazing land. A 2018 study indicated that one fifth of Americans are responsible for about half of the country's diet-related carbon emissions, due mostly to eating high levels of meat, especially beef. Home energy, landscaping and consumption Reducing home energy use through measures such as insulation, better energy efficiency of appliances, cool roofs, heat reflective paints, lowering water heater temperature, and improving heating and cooling efficiency can significantly reduce an individual's carbon footprint. In addition, the choice of energy used to heat, cool, and power homes makes a difference in the carbon footprint of individual homes. Many energy suppliers in various countries worldwide have options to purchase part or pure \\"green energy\\" (usually electricity but occasionally also gas). These methods of energy production emit almost no greenhouse gases once they are up and running. thumb Solar thermal roof thumb thumbInstalling rooftop solar, both on a household and community scale, also drastically reduces household emissions, and at scale could be a major contributor to greenhouse gas abatement. =Low energy products and consumption= Labels, such as Energy Star in the US, can be seen on many household appliances, home electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, windows, residential light fixtures, and other products. Carbon emission labels describe the carbon dioxide emissions created as a by- product of manufacturing, transporting, or disposing of a consumer product. Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) \\"present transparent, verified and comparable information about the life-cycle environmental impact of products.\\" These labels may help consumers choose lower energy products. =Landscape and gardens= thumb Protecting forests and planting new trees contributes to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the air. There are many opportunities to plant trees in the yard, along roads, in parks, and in public gardens. In addition, some charities plant fast-growing trees‚Äîfor as little as $US0.10 per tree‚Äîto help people in tropical developing countries restore the productivity of their lands. Turfgrass lawns can contribute to climate change through the impacts of fertilizers, herbicides, irrigation, and gas-powered lawnmowers and other tools; depending on how lawns are managed, the impact of emissions from maintenance and chemicals may outweigh any carbon sequestration from the lawn. Reducing irrigation, reducing chemical use, planting native plants or bushes, and using hand tools can all reduce the climate impact of lawns. In addition to planting Victory Gardens which provide locally grown food, gardeners may wish to experiment with companion planting of diverse species of plants and trees, in order to develop novel carbon sequestration and NOx reduction techniques suitable for their local area.. In the Eastern US, maples, sassafrass, and tulip poplar, which are associated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria known to \\"emit reactive nitrogen from soil,\\" push out the beneficial oak, beech, and hickory, which are associated with microbes that \\"absorb reactive nitrogen oxides. = Laundry and choice of clothing = Using a shorter, cold water wash cycle can conserve energy by as much as 66%, while simultaneously reducing color loss and shedding of microfibers into the environment. Hanging laundry to dry also saves energy and reduces carbon footprint. Purchasing well-made, durable clothing, and avoiding \\"fast fashion\\" is critical for reducing climate impact. = Choice of stove = The choice of stove may vary depending on location. Electric stoves are preferable to natural gas in locations where the electric grid has a high proportion of renewable energy, such as California. Rocket stoves and other biomass stoves are important in developing countries to conserve wood. The UN seeks to phase out wood-burning cookstoves. Solar cookers are an environmentally sound choice. Solar cooking has been practical for households in the highlands of China and Tibet, where \\"solar irradiation levels are high, cooking traditions correspond to the use of a solar cooker\\" and biomass is not readily available. Institutional level solar cooking has enabled temples in India to earn money through carbon credits. In Vermont, an EPA compliant woodstove or pellet stove, which uses sustainably harvested local wood, may be optimal despite its black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions, as it reduces the state's fossil fuel use. = Digital hygiene = Curbing unnecessary use of digital data, such as binge-watching streaming video, the use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and sending \\"e-mails with long and tiresome attachments\\" has a small but measurable impact on individual carbon emissions. = Consumption by urban residents = National Geographic has concluded that city dwellers can help with climate change if they (or we) simply \\"buy less stuff.\\" Lloyd Alter suggests that one way to get a practical sense of embodied carbon is to ask, \\"How much does your household weigh?\\" Individual purchase of carbon offsets The principle of carbon offset is this: one decides that they don't want to be responsible for accelerating climate change, and they've already made efforts to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, so they decide to pay someone else to further reduce their net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies. Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees‚Äîor not emitted due to your funding of renewable energy deployment‚Äîoffsets the emissions from their fossil fuel use. In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or tree planting ‚Äî particularly in developing nations‚Äîcan be a relatively cheap way of making an individual \\"carbon neutral\\". Citizen participation in climate change policy advocacy Will Grant of the Pachamama Alliance describes \\"Four Levels of Action\\" for change: # Individual # Friends and family # Community and institutions # Economy and policy Grant suggests that individuals can have the largest personal impact on climate by focusing on levels 2 and 3. Others posit that individual citizen participation in groups advocating for collective action in the form of political solutions, such as carbon pricing, meat pricing, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and animal husbandry, and ending laws mandating car use, is the most impactful way that an individual can take action to prevent climate change. One Fast Company article notes that \\"Focusing on how individuals can stop climate change is very convenient for corporations,\\" and calls for holding industries and governments accountable on climate. It has been argued that climate change is a collective action problem, specifically a tragedy of the commons, which is a political and not individual category of problem. Reform of subsidies and taxes discouraging individual action Fossil fuel and other subsidies, and taxes which discourage individual action include: * India is considering abolishing its subsidy of kerosene, which discourages individuals switching to other fuels * The UK CCC has advised cutting farm subsidies for livestock, which discourage individuals shifting to a plant based diet: * The UK CCC has advised rebalancing the taxes and regulatory costs, which are currently higher for electricity than gas and thus discourage individuals from switching from gas boilers to heat pumps * Turkey's free coal for poor families discourages them switching to natural gas in cities. * Redirecting the money which would have been spent as subsidies, together with any carbon tax, to form a carbon dividend in equal shares for everyone or for poor people has been suggested by the International Monetary Fund and others to encourage individuals to take action as part of a just transition away from a high carbon lifestyle. However, sudden removal of a subsidy by governments not trusted to redirect it, or without providing good alternatives for individuals, can lead to civil unrest. An example of this took place in 2019, when Ecuador removed its gasoline and diesel subsidies without providing enough electric buses to maintain service. The result was overnight fuel price hikes of 25-75 percent. The corresponding fare hikes for Ecuador's existing gas and diesel powered bus fleet were met with violent protests. Lack of information, or misleading information on individual actions As recently as 2008, \\"about 40% of adults worldwide ... [had] never heard of climate change, or nearly 2 billion people.\\" = Focus on climate change effects, without information on taking action = Climate change education, which became mandatory in Italy in 2019, is completely absent in some countries, or fails to provide information on action that individuals can take. In some countries media coverage of global warming reports the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather, but makes no mention of either individual or government actions which can be taken. = Presenting plant based diets as strict vegetarianism = The suggestion that eating a plant based diet requires a person to become strictly vegetarian is also misinformation.  The question of what individual actions could make a difference  thumb = Media focus on low impact rather than high impact behaviors is concerning for scientists = The most impactful actions for individuals differ significantly from the popular advice for \\"greening\\" one's lifestyle. Popular suggestions for individual actions include: * Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); * washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); * recycling (0.21 tonnes); * upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. -- all lower impact behaviors. Researchers have stated that \\"Our recommended high-impact actions: * one fewer child, * living car-free * avoiding one trans-Atlantic flight * eating a plant-based diet are more effective than many more commonly discussed options. For example, eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs.\\" Public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and as of 2017, the mention of high-impact individual behaviors to impact climate was almost non-existent in mainstream media, government publications, K-12 school textbooks, etc. = The impact of \\"climate conversations\\" with friends and family = ‚ÄúDiscussing global warming leads to greater acceptance of climate science,‚Äù according to a 2019 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Yale Climate Communication Program recommends initiating \\"climate conversations\\" with more moderate individuals. Patient listening is key, to determine the personal impacts of climate events on an individual, and to elicit information about the other person's core values. Once personal climate impacts and core values are understood, it may become possible to open a discussion of potential climate solutions which are consistent with those core values. = No effort may be too small, according to other advocates = Every single solution, large and small, presented in the Project Drawdown comprehensive plan must be implemented before carbon dioxide levels can be reversed. Drawdown advocate Bill McKibben is joined by many others in his opinion that \\"no effort is too small\\" with regards to climate change.

Lampooning both Superman and Captain Marvel, it revolutionized the types of stories seen in Mad, leading to greatly improved sales. Writers such as Alan Moore have cited this story as an influence. Characters and story The plot parallels the Superman scenario of the period: \\"Clark Bent\\" is a lowly assistant to the copy boy at The Daily Dirt newspaper, where he tries, unsuccessfully, to woo the disgusted \\"Lois Pain.\\" Meanwhile, an 'unknown monster' is stalking the streets of the city. Bent changes into Superduperman to help save the day, but \\"boy reporter Billy Spafon\\" reveals himself to be the monster, \\"Captain Marbles.\\" Superduperman is unable to harm Captain Marbles until he provokes Marbles into punching himself in the head. Hoping this victory will be enough to sway Pain, he reveals his alter ego, only to be rejected again; the story closes with Pain's putdown: \\"Once a creep, always a creep.\\" Kurtzman's script subverts the admirable image of the superhero. Clark Bent uses his X-ray vision to peer into the women's bathroom, and Captain Marbles has abandoned good deeds for the pursuit of money. The conflict between the two characters also parodies the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications trial.Geissman, Grant, \\"When Better Drawrings Are Drawrn\\", page 115. In Stewart (2003). Reception Until Mad #4, the magazine had not been one of EC's top-selling titles, but \\"Superduperman\\" revolutionized their format and led to sales success. In his book Comics, Manga, and Graphic Novels: A History of Graphic Narratives, Robert Petersen observes, \\"In April 1953, Mad #4 included a parody of Superman, 'Superduperman,' which originated a new formula that would significantly raise the popularity of the new magazine. Instead of broadly lampooning a genre of comics, 'Superduperman' levelled its sights on a specific and recognizable comic character.\\"Peterson, 2010, page 206 National, the owners of Superman's copyright, threatened to file a lawsuit over the parody. EC and National shared the same lawyer, who advised Gaines to quit publishing parodies. While Gaines was weighing this advice, Kurtzman located a legal precedent that backed his and Mad's right to publish. Gaines hired the author of that precedent to write a brief substantiating EC's position, but the companies' shared lawyer disagreed, siding with National over EC. Gaines consulted a third lawyer, who advised Gaines to simply ignore the threat and continue publishing parodies. National never filed suit,Reidelbach, Maria, Completely Mad, Little Brown & Co., 1991, pg. 23 and this legal cover establishing the basis for Kurtzman's new editorial direction became the bedrock of Mad's humor. After the eponymous eight-page story in Mad #4, the character made a cameo appearance in the comic's \\"Popeye\\" parody, \\"Poopeye\\" (Mad #21). In 1968, Mad and DC Comics became part of the same corporate conglomerate, but this did not prevent the magazine from publishing spoofs of the Superman film series, including Superduperman (Mad #208, July 1979), Superduperman II (Mad #226, October 1981), and Stuporman ZZZ (Mad #243, December 1983). Influences The story was an influence on Alan Moore when creating Watchmen. Moore has said, \\"We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees ‚Äì dramatic, instead of comedic,\\" but it also influenced the art: \\"I think that we probably settled upon the kind of Wally Wood 'Superduperman' style. You know, super-heroics, lots of details, heavy blacks, of a distinctive style.\\"Khoury, 2003, page 110 When asked about the influence of Superfolks on his work like the earlier Marvelman, Moore said, \\"I‚Äôd still say that Harvey Kurtzman‚Äôs Superduperman probably had the preliminary influence.\\" He went into more detail in Kimota! the Miracleman Companion: The story would also influence John Shelton Lawrence. As a child he dressed as a superhero and got himself into trouble but \\"[h]is understanding of superpowers matured, however, when he read Mad Magazine's' \\"Superduperman\\" in the early 1950s. That teenage skepticism grew into a philosophical teaching career, resulting in his current position as a professor of philosophy, emeritus, at Morningside College in Iowa.

The lampoon depicted newspaper copyboy Clark Bent, aka Superduperman, and his conflict with rival comic book hero Captain Marbles. Although I know I could not hope to duplicate the scope of the Mad story, I wanted to at least attempt capturing on film some of its flavor. And so, in the fall of 1962, I shot a very short color send-up titled Superduperman.\\" See also * History of Mad Notes References   External links Superduperman at Comic Vine Characters created by Wally Wood Comics by Harvey Kurtzman Comics characters introduced in 1953 Comics superheroes Mad (magazine) Metafictional comics Metafictional characters Parody superheroes Parody comics Satirical comics Self-reflexive comics Male characters in comics Parodies of Superman Captain Marvel (DC Comics) ","title":"Superduperman"},{"id":"31253468","title":"Gypsy Heart Tour"},{"id":"31253489","text":"A modern mehter marching band Eski Ordu Mar≈üƒ± (\\"Ancient Army March\\") is a Rast Mehter song composed by Muallim ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Bey (1865-1927).ESKƒ∞ ORDU MAR≈ûI Lyrics :Ey ≈üanlƒ± ordu, ey ≈üanlƒ± asker :Haydi gazanfer umman-ƒ± safter :Bir elde kalkan, bir elde han√ßer :Serhadde doƒüru ey ≈üanlƒ± asker. :Deryada olsa her≈üey muzaffer :Dillerde tekbir, Allah√º ekber :Allah√º ekber, Allah√º ekber :Ordumuz olsun daim muzaffer. =English= :O glorious army!

His pupils there included Joanne Rowling, whose mother worked for some time as an assistant in his department. He has been stated to be a major inspiration for the character of Severus Snape in Rowling's Harry Potter series of fantasy novels. Life Nettleship was born in Nottingham, the son of Albert Victor Nettleship and Lilian (n√©e Slack). He studied Chemistry at the University of Leeds in the late 1950s. He joined the Labour Party at that time, and remained an active member for the rest of his life. After leaving university, he taught in Birmingham, where he married and had three children; the marriage later ended in divorce and he remarried in the 1980s. In 1970 he began teaching at Caldicot School in Monmouthshire, Wales, moving to become Head of Science at Wyedean School in Sedbury, Gloucestershire, a few miles away, in 1974. Joanne Rowling began studying at the school in September 1976, and her mother Anne worked as a technician in the Science department from 1978. He was often known as \\"Stinger\\" by pupils due to his last name being \\"Nettleship\\". This led to the practical joke of telling first years to ask for \\"Mr Stinger\\", which ended up with them getting in trouble. Nettleship described himself in hindsight as \\"a short-tempered chemistry teacher with long hair...[and a] gloomy, malodorous laboratory..\\".John Nettleship, Harry Potter's Chepstow, 2009 He was first questioned about his links to Rowling's character of Snape by journalists, saying: \\"I was horrified when I first found out. I knew I was a strict teacher but I didn't think I was that bad.\\" Rowling herself stated that Snape was \\"loosely based on a teacher I myself had\\". After being initially unhappy about the comparison, Nettleship came to terms with the connection, and wrote a short book, Harry Potter's Chepstow, about Rowling's connections with Chepstow. He also gave talks on the connections that the Chepstow, Wye Valley and Forest of Dean areas had with the Harry Potter books. Nettleship retired in 1997. As well as being an active member of the Labour Party, he was a member of Caerwent community council, serving as its chairman in 1991. He was instrumental in setting up Caerwent Historic Trust, becoming its secretary and researching the history of the area. He died of cancer in 2011, aged 71, after having been diagnosed in 2006. A spokeswoman for J. K. Rowling said that the author was sorry to hear of his death. He was played by Andrew Kavadas in the J.K. Rowling biopic Magic Beyond Words.

It was a 2 m (6 ft) long predator which lived in what is now southern Brazil. Its exact phylogenetic placement within Archosauriformes is uncertain; it was originally classified as a doswelliid, but subsequently it was argued to be an erpetosuchid archosaur.  Discovery  It is only known from the holotype CPEZ-239a, which consists of partial skeleton (including vertebrae, partial right front and hind limbs, a partial hip, and an undetermined bone which may be part of a tibia) and braincase. It was found in the Santa Maria 1 Sequence, previously known as the Santa Maria Formation, in Chiniqu√° region, S√£o Pedro do Sul of Rio Grande do Sul State. It was first named by Julia B. Desojo, Mart√≠n D. Ezcurra and C√©sar L. Schultz in 2011 and the type species is Archeopelta arborensis. The generic name comes from archeo, ancient in Greek and pelta, armoured, in reference to its thick osteoderms. The specific name is derived from arbor, tree in Latin, in reference to Sanga da √Årvore where the fossils were found.  Description  CPEZ-239a's braincase is low, without an occipital neck. The exoccipitals do not meet each other medially. The paraoccipital processes extend outwards and slightly downwards, and the supraoccipital has a ridge. Uniquely, a very deep fossa is present in the corner of the opisthotics. The exit of the hypoglossal nerve is a single opening. The basal tubera are very low and separated by a deep notch. The parabasisphenoid is short and its exits for the internal carotid arteries are small and pushed to the rear edge of the bone. The basipterygoid processes are close to each other and project anterolaterally. The exit for the facial nerve is present on the vestibule, and the lamina separating the metotic foramen and the fenestra ovalis is very thin. The back vertebrae are only slightly elongated and are not constricted from the sides. The diapophyses are thick, subrectangular, and elongated. The prezygapophyses are short while the neural spines are long and oval-shaped in cross section. The first 'primordial' sacral vertebra (likely the second sacral) is low and wide, with characteristically-shaped sacral ribs. The sacral ribs expand anteroposteriorly at their tips, with the anterior expansions being large and subtriangular. The first primordial's unique prezygapophyses are very large and circular, with their faces pointing upward and inwards. On the other hand, the postzygapophyses are short, downwards-pointing, and connected by a V-shaped hyposphene. Although incomplete, the second 'primordial' sacral (likely the third sacral) is also low, with sacral ribs similarly shaped to those of the first 'primordial' sacral. The humeral head is offset from the humeral shaft, and the right humerus as a whole is wide and distally tapering (although missing the distal portion). A thin bone has been interpreted to be a right ilium, with an unusual illiac blade which is S-shaped in posterior view. However, this interpretation is uncertain and the bone's shape may be a result of postmortem deformation. The right ischium has a long and deep pubic peduncle but a very short illiac peduncle. The ischial shaft is thin and the lower edge bends towards the midline. The right femur is S-shaped from the front, with a transversely very wide distal end and poorly developed condyles and tubercules. The right tibia is anteroposteriorly wide but distally tapering and missing its distal tip. An unusual rod-like bone may be the distal part of a tibia. Several osteoderms are preserved with CPEZ-239a. At least two rows of osteoderms attached to each neural spine of the vertebrae, and there is evidence that additional rows of lateral osteoderms were also present. The osteoderms are very thick and quadrangular in shape, with straight posterior and medial borders and rounded anterior and lateral borders. They were rough and covered in deep, circular pits, with each possessing an anterior articular lamina (a smooth area where the preceding osteoderm would have overlapped the front edge of the following osteoderm). Although they had serrated edges, they did not possess a raised keel or peak (a dorsal prominence) on their surface. Small, circular plates attached to the femur may be appendicular osteoderms, although poor preservation makes this uncertain. Classification An outdated reconstruction of Archeopelta as a doswelliid. Upon the initial description of Archeopelta, it was placed as a close relative of Doswellia in the newly created family Doswellidae. This referral was due to the structure of its osteoderms, which were very similar to those of Doswellia. In addition, Archeopelta shared several other features with Doswellia which were unknown in Tarjadia, which was rather incomplete at the time of Archeopelta's description. Among these features are the wide first primordial sacral, a long and laterally deflected illiac blade, and anterolaterally-projected basipterygoid processes. This is the cladogram from the study, after Desojo, Ezcurra & Schultz, 2011: A 2017 analysis found that Archeopelta, rather than being a doswelliid, was actually an archosaur closely related to this genus, Erpetosuchus. In 2013, Lucas, Spielmann, and Hunt claimed that Archeopelta was a junior synonym of Tarjadia due to a lack of distinguishing features between the two. However, Ezcurra (2016) provided several differences between the two genera. For example, Archeopelta has unconstricted dorsal vertebrae and a ridge on the supraoccipital, while Tarjadia has the opposite traits. Nevertheless, Ezcurra observed that both genera had very thick osteoderms, and he considered that both of them were doswellids more closely related to each other than to Doswellia. New specimens of Tarjadia described in 2017 provided a phylogenetic analysis that argued that Tarjadia and Archeopelta were not doswellids, but rather pseudosuchian archosaurs of the family Erpetosuchidae. The strict consensus tree of this analysis is given below. Erpetosuchid osteoderms are similar to Doswellid osteoderms, which explains the earlier classification of Tarjadia and Archeopelta. Even in non-parmonious phylogenetic trees of the analysis which forced them to be recovered as doswellids, Tarjadia and Archeopelta still formed a clade with Erpetosuchus. Despite the change in Archeopelta's classification, it still forms a clade with Tarjadia as an erpetosuchid. This is due to both of them possessing a very short or absent occipital neck and osteoderms without a dorsal prominence.

The tomb lies on a ridge overlooking a small tributary of the Annagh river. History Court-tombs are among the earliest megalithic monuments to be built in Ireland. There are more than three hundred court tombs in Ireland today, primarily located in northern Ireland. Identifying features of a court tomb are a ceremonial courtyard, which is set in front of a burial vault which is divided into two or more burial chambers. The courtyard can be on the eastern end of a long stone cairn, or it can be placed at both ends. Courts were built in a variety of shapes, with oval or circular forms predominating. County Cavan has a large number of megalithic tombs, including eighteen court tombs. Cohaw was excavated by archaeologist, Howard Kilbride-Jones, in 1949. The excavation finds consisted of teeth, skull fragments, and the cremated remains of a child. A carinated, round-bottomed Neolithic bowl was also uncovered. An unusual feature to the site at the time of excavation was a bow-shaped bank across the entrance to the north court. The tomb lies on a ridge overlooking a small tributary of the Annagh river. Description Cohaw is a neolithic double court tomb located 4 kilometres south-east of Cootehill, County Cavan, Ireland and is visible from the R192 road between Shercock and Cootehill. The tomb is known locally as the \\"Giant's Grave\\" and was originally built as two single tombs. Each tomb consists of a court at each end, connected by a long, five chambered burial gallery.

Origin of the name  The Rehburg Hills and their foothills give the impression of being several small neighbouring hills. The little village of Bad Rehburg was a well-known spa and bathing resort in the 18th and 19th centuries. As a result, they have been referred to for centuries as the Rehburger Berge or Rehburg Hills.  Geography  = Geographical location = The Rehburg Hills occupy the southern part of the district of Nienburg and northern part of the district of Schaumburg on the southwestern edge of the Steinhuder Meer Nature Park. They lie between Rehburg-Loccum (to the northwest), Hagenburg (to the east) and Sachsenhagen (to the south) and run close by the village of Bad Rehburg that gives them their name. The latter, like the settlements of Loccum, Rehburg, M√ºnchehagen in the west and Winzlar in the east belong to the borough of Rehburg-Loccum. The municipalities of W√∂lpinghausen (including Bergkirchen) and Auhagen (including D√ºdinghausen) in the south also lie on the ridge. Away to the south is the Schaumburg Forest, whilst to the northeast is Lake Steinhude (Steinhuder Meer). Not far to the north of the Rehburg Hills runs a section of the stream known as the Steinhuder Meerbach; to the south is part of the Mittelland Canal, to the west is part of the upper course of the Fulde and about 10 km west of the ridge are the middle reaches of the River Weser. = Individual hills = The highest elevation in the Rehburg Hills is the Brunnenberg at . Other summits include the W√∂lpinghauser Berg (136 m; with its Wilhelm Tower), in the far east, the D√ºdingh√§user Berg (121 m), the Loccumer Berg (118.7 m) and the Atgeberg (101.0 m). From the high points of the Rehburg Hills there are views across to the River Weser, Lake Steinhude, the Deister, B√ºckeberg, Schaumburg Forest, Stemweder Berg and Wiehen Hills.  Geology  The bowl-shaped Rehburg Hills were formed by relief inversion. They fall steeply away to the north, but its southern slopes are more gently. The ridge is, from a geological viewpoint, a saddle (the Rehburg Saddle or Rehburger Sattel), which consists of solid rock. The bulging of the saddle occurred as a result of the movement of Malm Salt (not Zechstein Salt) deep underground that forced the overlying, younger layers of solid rock upwards. In later times the softer rocks in the centre of the saddle (clay and marl, Upper Jurassic) weathered away, creating a morphological depression (relief inversion). The weather-resistant sandstones (Wealden Sandstones of the Lower Cretaceous) form the flanks of the saddle and produce a bowl-shaped ridge. In the Wealden Sandstone there are coal deposits of low quality and thickness. After 1945 some of this coal was mined. Sandstone was quarried in D√ºdinghausen and to a large extent near M√ºnchehagen. The Rehburger Berge are covered by a mixed woodland of beech and spruce and surrounded by large areas of moor and lowland. Of the many small streams and becks that drain the ridge, the most notable are the H√ºlsebeeke in the west near Loccum and the Winzlaer Grenzgraben in the west.

He was born in Laisterdyke, Bradford. He wrote 39 books using the name W. Riley, mostly fiction and mostly published by Herbert Jenkins Ltd. Gravestone of Willie Riley and his first wife Clara at Silverdale After an education at Bradford Grammar School he entered his father's business in textiles, but two years later the firm diversified and William led the innovative new business in the sale of magic lantern slides and equipment. The business was successful until 1914, when, with the onset of World War I, it failed: Riley then developed a second career as a writer, having already published Windyridge. His first novel Windyridge was written as a series of weekly chapters, in the winter of early 1911, to entertain his wife and two friends, the Bolton sisters, whose parents and third sister had all recently died. He quotes himself as saying \\"I tell you what I'll do, I'll write a story and read each chapter to you as I go along, week by week. It may help to keep us from brooding\\". The story is set in the village of Hawksworth near Baildon. He completed the tale in early 1912, having paused in his writing over the summer, and was persuaded to submit it for publication. He agreed to send it to just one publishing house, and chose this by writing on slips of paper the names of three established houses and the novice publisher Herbert Jenkins. It was this last slip which he selected, and Jenkins agreed to publish the book, as his firm's first publication. In 1919 he moved to Silverdale, Lancashire for the sake of his wife's health, and named his house Windyridge after his novel. In his autobiography, Sunset Reflections (1957), he recalls tales of life in Silverdale, where amongst other activities he was chair of the Building Committee for the Gaskell Memorial Hall. Bradford University Library's Special Collections department holds an archive of Willie Riley's manuscripts and other papers and a collection of his books. His death was recorded in obituaries in The Times and other local and national newspapers. He was buried in the village graveyard at Silverdale, along with his first wife Clara.

Powell was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He was a prominent member of Bath Cricket Club, and eight of his 10 first-class matches were played at Bath. His debut in 1927, however, was at Taunton and the three Lancashire wickets he took in that game amounted to more than half his first-class career total. In his Obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1996, Powell's batting in this match was also discussed: \\"He was... forced to face Ted McDonald in full cry when he went out to bat (at) No 10...: the senior pro Tom Young noticed his pads were not good enough, loaned him his and Powell made 22.\\" Powell played a couple of matches in 1927 and then one in 1928, but reappeared more regularly in matches at Bath from 1934 to 1938. His first match on his return was his most successful: still batting at No 10, he made 52 against Hampshire sharing a ninth wicket stand of 97 (Wisden says 101) with Jack White. Powell also played rugby union for Bath and for Somerset. A ubiquitous figure in Bath sport, Louis Powell trophies are still competed for at Bath Cricket Club and Bath Golf Club at Sham Castle, and he was the first to broadcast cricket commentary on a hospital radio system at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, covering cricket from the Recreation Ground alongside Bill Andrews.

He was shot down on 6 September 1918 and taken prisoner and his right leg was amputated. He was repatriated on 20 December 1918 and invalided out of the RAF. Early life John Doyle was born in South Africa where his father was the chaplain to the Governor of Cape Province. He was employed at the Bank of South Africa for two years but left in mid-1914 because he saw a recruiting advertisement for the Royal Naval Air Service. He was not taken due to a lack of trigonometry and then, since the war had started on 4 August, he applied to the Royal Flying Corps where he was told the war would be over by Christmas and anyway they had plenty of applicants. He then joined the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps as a cavalry officer candidate. He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps on 24 May 1915. First World War left Once in France in mid-1915, Doyle frequently applied to join the RFC, but was always told by his commanding officer that he was essential to the ASC. By 1916, when the RFC was very short of candidates and COs were no longer allowed to stop transfers, he joined the RFC in England. Doyle was appointed a flying officer on 22 February 1917 and transferred to the General List. Training was haphazard at RAF Doncaster and he flew the Maurice Farman Shorthorn, Avro 504, B.E.2c, B.E.12 and Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8. The \\"Wings\\" test had four components; a climb to 10,000 feet then an engine out descent to landing, a cross-country with landings at two other airfields, two airborne photos of navigational landmarks, and two night landings. Having passed he was asked to fetch a new type of aircraft from the Daimler Works at Coventry, an R.E.8. He crashed on takeoff, as all previous 12 aircraft had done, since there was not enough yaw control to counter the P-factor and keep the aircraft with its powerful V-12 engine straight. He was badly concussed and the aircraft withdrawn for redesign of the vertical stabilizer and rudder. After recovery and convalescence at Osborne he was sent to 40 Squadron at Port Meadow, Oxford to fly Nieuports but was soon sent to a medical board that classified him as \\"Light Duty - No Flying\\". right Doyle was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1917. After hanging around back at Oxford with several other LD officers they were all sent to Hounslow where you \\"booked in\\" by writing your classification in a book on arrival. He found that his medical records had not preceded him and booked in as General Service and so could fly. After 11 hours a new medical board again classified him as LD, but he was soon transferred to Harling Road where he again signed in as GS and was made an instructor, eventually being certified by Gosport. He was called before another medical board and was asked what he was complaining of, he said \\"nothing\\" and was at last classed GS. He finally reached a fighter squadron in March 1918, 18 months after joining the RFC and Major Balcomb-Brown noticing his very unusual many hours of flying picked him for No. 56 Squadron where he joined 'B' Flight commanded by Captain Cyril Crowe. He had no confirmed victories while with 56 Squadron, but must have done well since after two weeks he was leading patrols and before long was promoted to captain. After Major McCudden, CO of No. 60 Squadron, was killed. Crowe became CO of the squadron on 9 July and asked Doyle to join him as 'A' Flight commander. On 30 July Crowe was in a car crash that killed Captain Owen Scholte the senior flight commander of 60 Squadron, and so Doyle became acting commander of the squadron. After a few weeks Major Clarke, from Harling Road, arrived as CO although he had never been seen to fly there nor at the squadron, he was however an Old Etonian. In the few weeks he was in combat in 60 Squadron (he was not allowed to cross the lines while CO) he had nine confirmed victories and two balloons that are not recorded for some reason. He was shot down on 5 September after getting two Albatros D.VIIs himself. His last flight was just before he was to go on home leave by the end of which the war would be over. He was taken prisoner and his right leg, which had become gangrenous from a bullet wound in his ankle, was amputated at the upper thigh. He was repatriated on 20 December 1918 to the Prince of Wales Hospital for Officers, Marylebone. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross from King George V in May 1919. Doyle was eventually invalided out of the RAF, being transferred to unemployed list on 12 November 1919. After the War left As a one-legged ex-pilot with minimal formal education the post-war years were extremely difficult and he had many different low-paying jobs including driving a tour bus from Exeter where he met his wife, Grace Burd, daughter of an Okehampton doctor. In the mid-1930s he wrote 31 flying adventure stories for such magazines as Air Stories, \\"The Scout\\", \\"Popular Flying\\", \\"The Aeroplane\\", \\"Flying\\", Boys' Ace Library, Mine, Modern Wonder and War Stories, and technical articles for Popular Flying. Never having lost his love of aircraft and flying he regained his pilot's licence, #3236, in 1930 able to fly \\"all types of landplanes\\". In addition to his autobiography, published privately, he wrote two books. Skies Unknown was published by Wright & Brown in 1939 but most copies were burned in a warehouse fire caused by a German bombing raid on London. The second, Castle Cumulus a children's book concerned with flying and meteorology, never received interest from a publisher but 20 copies were printed for family members. His distinguished service to the Crown enabled him to gain a place for his son at Christ's Hospital under the Clause 100 programme. In 1940 he was hired as a civilian Link Trainer instructor and wrote most of the instructor's manual for the device. He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 12 August 1941; his first CO remarked that he must be the only acting pilot officer on probation with a DFC in the RAF. He was promoted to flying officer on 1 October 1942, and served as Chief Ground Instructor at bomber stations throughout the UK. He wrote in his autobiography that \\"on becoming a Link instructor my financial state ceased to be a source of constant worry ... and I was never again financially embarrassed to any serious extent\\". Doyle resigned his commission on 21 April 1943, retaining the rank of flight lieutenant, and kept two pubs in England before retiring to Kyrenia, Cyprus, in 1953. There he took up painting and had a well-received one man show in 1959. As the Greek-Turkish conflict intensified, he and his wife returned to England, finally living in the home of her mother-in-law in Devon with one of their daughters. Doyle painted and wrote his autobiography, and finally died in 1974 three weeks after his wife's death.

Vietnam Combat Artists Program  At the age of 19, Rickert was drafted into the U. S. Army where he applied for assignment with the Vietnam Combat Artists Program. He was accepted and deployed to Vietnam in August 1966 where he was assigned to Combat Art Team I, serving from August 15, 1966 to December 15, 1966 under the supervision of Frank M. Sherman.  Post-military art career  Following his discharge, Rickert enrolled in Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, graduating in 1974. During this time he also studied privately with artist Nelson Shanks. While still a student, Rickert's works garnered the 1972 Gold Medal of Honor from the Allied Artists of America and the 1972 Edgar Whitney Award from the American Watercolor Society. In the Summer 1999 issue of Watercolor Magazine, Rickert explained the challenges of painting using the medium, \\"It is a very technical medium in that one needs to plan the whole painting before beginning to apply paint to paper. It works so fast and changes so radically, it's hard to control. Almost every step has to be anticipated, including the choice of brushes and colors. That is the key to watercolor.\\"Margaret Kelly Trombly, Paul Rickert on the Nature of Watercolor, Watercolor Magazine, Summer 1999 Many of his pieces feature architectural elements, an interest Rickert developed as a student. He maintains a residence in Stonington, Maine, a location that has served as subject of much of his work as well including Mansard, Shadows, Red Victorian, Grand Night and Through Houses. Rickert became attracted to Maine after reading Eliot Porter's book, Summer Island, that included photographs of coastal Stonington and Penobscot Bay. In the 1970s, Rickert began spending summers in Stonington and nearby Brooksville, eventually buying a vacation home there. His renderings of nocturnal scenes with soft illuminations and moonlit reflections have generated comparisons of his work with that of English Romantic landscape artist, watercolorist and printmaker, Joseph Mallord William Turner. Rickert's scenes of industrial sites reflect the bustle of his native Pennsylvania, where he spends the other half of his time. Rickert's influences include Edward Hopper, Mark Rothko, Caspar David Friedrich, Nicholas Poussin and Richard Diebenkorn.A Conversation with Paul Rickert, Paul Rickert: Industrial Visions, Rider University Art Gallery exhibit catalog, Jan 28 ‚Äì February 28, 2010 In February 2010, a selection of Rickert's industrial landscapes were featured at the exhibit, Industrial Visions at the Rider University Art Gallery. In an interview with Professor Harry I Naar, gallery directory, Rickert explained that he was influenced by the drama captured in the landscapes of 19th-century artist Joseph Mallord William Turner (April 23, 1775 ‚Äì December 19, 1851), an English Romantic landscape painter, watercolorist and printmaker. In June 2010, one of Rickert's watercolors was featured on the cover of the American Artist Magazine's special edition, \\"The Best of Watercolor\\".  Awards  Rickert has received a number of awards including: * Edith Ogden Harrison Award (Memorial Prize for Figure Painting) Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia, PA * 1971 Windsor Newton Award, National Arts Club, New York * 1973 Franklin Mint Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Watercolor Art, The Franklin Mint Gallery of American Art, Franklin Center, PA * 1979 First Prize, Los Angeles Art Center College of Design, Los Angeles, CA * 1997 Charles Knox Smith Founders Prize, Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia, PA * 2000 Maybelle Longstreet Prize, Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia, PA  See also  Vietnam Combat Artists Program  References   External links  * Paul Rickert's works at the Fischbach Gallery in New York, NY * American Watercolor Society * Artist Conversation: Paul Rickert, 30 min. podcast 1947 births Living people Vietnam Combat Artists Program American army personnel of the Vietnam War American watercolorists Painters from Pennsylvania United States Army soldiers ","title":"Paul Rickert"},{"id":"31254005","text":"Munira (also, meaning luminous, bright, shining) is a female given name and may refer to: *Munira A.

This synopsis from Al Jazeera gives a sense of what the media war was like as of 12 March:\\"Libya: The propaganda war\\", Listening Post, Al Jazeera, 12 March 2011 > When protests first began in Libya the media presence there was scarce so > the story filtered out via social media thanks to courageous citizen > journalists.

Media conditions prior to the civil war According to a BBC overview of Libyan media , \\"the state strictly controls the media\\", \\"the Libyan Jamahiriya Broadcasting Corporation is the state broadcaster\\", and \\"most Libyan newspapers are either directly or indirectly owned by the government\\". The Libyan government authorized non-governmental media in 2007, leading to the launch of newspapers and a satellite TV service by a company affiliated with one of Colonel Gaddafi's sons. But the nationalization of these ventures in 2009 signaled the end to several years of improving conditions for the media. In January 2010 Libya began censoring the Internet. YouTube was blocked on 24 January following the posting of videos of demonstrations by the families of prisoners in the city of Benghazi, and of footage of members of Muammar Gaddafi's family attending parties. Other independent opposition websites were blocked at the same time.\\"Country report: Libya\\", Reporters Without Borders, accessed 1 October 2011 In 2009 Libya had 1.1 million fixed-line and 5.0 million mobile-cellular telephone subscribers for a combined fixed-mobile density approaching 100 telephones per 100 persons.\\"CIA World Factbook: Libya\\", U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 27 September 2011 In 2009 a single government-owned service-provider offered Internet access to an estimated 5.5 percent of the population.\\"2010 Human rights Report: Libya\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011 Libyan law provided for freedom of speech \\"within the limits of public interest and principles of the Revolution\\", but in practice freedom of speech and the press was severely limited, particularly criticism of government officials or policy. Penalties included life prison-sentences for spreading news or information that could \\"tarnish the country's reputation or undermine confidence in it abroad\\" and the death penalty for \\"whoever spreads within the country, by whatever means, theories or principles aiming to change the basic principles of the Constitution or the fundamental structures of the social system or to overthrow the state's political, social or economic structures or destroy any of the fundamental structures of the social system using violence, terrorism or any other unlawful means\\". Given the broad nature of these prohibitions and the harsh penalties attached, Libyan journalists practiced a considerable degree of self-censorship. Television Libya's state-owned TV made no mention of the anti-government protests in the east of the country on 16 February and continued with its usual programming on 17 February. During its morning bulletin, Libyan TV continuously showed demonstrations in support of leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, which the TV said had been held \\"across Libya\\". There were about 200 to 300 demonstrators, the vast majority of whom were men, at each protest shown. At one point, a crowd could be heard chanting anti-Al Jazeera TV slogans. The TV started broadcasting a pro-Gaddafi demonstration live from Sirte, his home town, at around 1000 GMT. The numbers demonstrating were significantly greater than the previous day, with the crowd chanting: \\"Oh Jazeera! You despicable one.\\" The TV aired live coverage of a speech by Gaddafi from the evening before, in which he denounced both the United States and their \\"Zionist\\" allies in front of a cheering crowd. The signal of the TV satellite operator Nilesat was jammed starting 23 February. The stations carried by Nilesat included U.S.-based Al-Hurra, Qutar-based Al-Jazeera, and UAE-based Al-Arabiya, which had been providing live coverage of the recent events and interviewing residents by telephone. Libya Alhurra TV (), meaning Free Libya TV, is an Internet television channel founded by Mohamed Nabbous at the start of the Libyan civil war to provide news and on-ground footage from Benghazi. It was the first private television station in Benghazi, in the east of the country and the only TV broadcast from Benghazi when the internet was shut down as the war began. Alhurra TV was able to bypass government blocks on the Internet in order to broadcast live images from Benghazi across the world. On 19 March, Nabbous was killed by pro-Gaddafi troops during the Second Battle of Benghazi. Libya TV, also known as Libya Al-Ahrar TV, is a satellite TV channel broadcast from Doha, Qatar. It was created in late March 2011 by the National Transitional Council, after the NTC media minister, Mahmum Shammam, recruited a small group of volunteers via Facebook. With headquarters in Doha and studios in Doha, Benghazi, and London, Libya TV has correspondents throughout Libya. Libya TV admits to being a propaganda tool in the effort to dislodge the country's long-time leader, but show hosts have welcomed pro- Gaddafi loyalists to call in and air their views. The channel expected to make a decision sometime in October 2011 about staying in Doha or moving to Tripoli.\\"Libya tunes in to first TV station without Qaddafi's shadow\\", Anealla Safdar, The National (Abu Dhabi Media), 19 September 2011 In September 2012 Libya TV was broadcasting from Doha and had studios in Benghazi and Tripoli.\\"About us\\" Libya TV, retrieved 13 September 2012 NATO air strikes on the Tripoli headquarters of the state-owned national TV broadcaster Al- Jamahiriya and two of its installations on 30 July killed three of its journalists and wounded 21 others, according to reports by Al-Jamahiriya which could not be immediately verified. NATO said it carried out the air strikes in order to silence the regime's \\"terror broadcasts\\" and put a stop to its \\"use of satellite television as a means to intimidate the Libyan people and incite acts of violence against them.\\"\\"NATO attacks on national TV headquarters and installations in Tripoli\\", Reporters Without Borders, 1 August 2011, updated 3 August 2011 Al Urubah, a pro-Gaddafi television station, broadcast messages from the deposed leader and his information minister, Moussa Ibrahim, following the fall of Tripoli in August 2011.\\"Gadhafi Urges Libyans to Drive Away 'Infidels'\\", Leila Hatoum, Wall Street Journal, 25 August 2011 Al Urubah, Al-Jamahiriyah, and Al-Shababiyah have been off the air since late August 2011. Radio The Voice of Free Libya (Arabic: Sawt Libya al-Hurra) or sometimes Radio Free Libya (Arabic: Idha'at Libya al-Hurra) are the names used by several radio stations aligned with the Libyan rebels. The stations began operating from the cities of Benghazi,\\"Finding a voice in Libya\\" BBC World Service 7 March 2011 Bayda, and Misrata in February 2011. Other rebel- controlled radio stations are reported to operate in Tobruk, Nalut, Jadu, Derna, and Zliten. The outlets operate independently and with separate programing, although they share similar aims. They all carry material strongly supportive of the rebels and firmly critical of Gaddafi. Output is in Arabic, with the Nalut station also said to use Berber (Tamazight).\\"Future for Libya: Radio Free Libya\\", blog from March 2011 onwards In May 2011, an English- language station, Tribute FM, began broadcasting from Benghazi. There is no evidence that this station has any connection with the Voice of Free Libya station in the same city.\\"Radio free Benghazi ‚Äì the war of words\\", Zoe Williams, Guardian, 15 May 2011 The former youth station, Al-Shababiyah FM, was re-launched under the new name, Al-Shababiyah 17 February FM, in late August 2011. Newspapers Headlines on 17 February in state-owned Libyan papers continued to highlight pro-Gaddafi demonstrations or his public engagements. Quryna, which was previously part of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's Al- Ghad Media Corporation but is now state-owned, carried an upbeat report about order being restored in Benghazi. One article reported on the families of \\"17 February 2006 martyrs\\" who met the Libyan leader and condemned the protests. The front page of state-owned Al-Jamahiriya was dedicated to pro-Gaddafi demonstrations and his public appearance at the Ahly football club in Tripoli the day before, while state-owned Al-Shams led exclusively with coverage of this event. The Libyan civil war has brought forth many new magazines and newspapers, including Al-Jazirah Al-Libiyah, Intifada Al-Ahrar, Al-Kalima, Libya Hurriya (Free Libya), Akhbar Al-Aan and many others. At the end of March there were half a dozen or so new publications. By the beginning of May that had grown to 28, by late May to 65, and in August it was over 120. So far all are weeklies and almost all are in Arabic. The Libya Post is the first all English language publication.Libya Post, official website, accessed 1 October 2011 Staffs run the gamut from enthusiastic amateur to professional.\\"Libyan newspapers mushroom in an outpouring of pent-up frustration\\", Michel Cousins, Arab News, 8 June 2011 In spite of the large number of new publications, much of the coverage of the Libyan conflict has been left to international media outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera, in part due to a lack of experienced professional staff, in part to years of living under a repressive media regime, and in part due to a shortage of financing.\\"Libyan media not covering its own war\\" , International Media Support, 22 August 2011 Yosberides () is a privately owned Libyan newspaper published weekly in print and on the internet. Based in Benghazi, the country's second largest city, its original name was Quryna (). It was part of Al-Ghad Media Corporation owned by Colonel Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam until it was nationalized in 2009. Its reporting was sympathetic to Gaddafi until rebel forces took control of Benghazi in early 2011. After that, it reported more openly and claimed to be impartial. On 23 February Reuters described it as \\"Libya's most reliable media outlet\\". However, there have been reports that the paper was seized by protesters and its web site shows the flag of the Libyan Republic, which the rebels use. After opposition forces went into Tripoli on 21 August, publication of state- owned newspapers, such as Al-Shams, ceased.\\"Libya media: Gaddafi mouthpieces fall silent\\", BBC News, 2 September 2011 International media At the start of the conflict in late February and early March 2011, few international journalists operated in Libya. They worked under the close supervision of government minders and could not travel freely. As a result, international news organizations frequently relied on phone reports from people actually on the ground. This in turn meant that the media could not independently verify accounts and so reported them as \\"claims\\" or \\"allegations\\" rather than as \\"facts\\".\\"The difficulty of reporting from inside Libya\\", Jon Williams, BBC World News, 20 February The restrictions on and the attempts to control the media by the Gaddafi-regime continued until the government fled from Tripoli.\\"Close your window\\", The Economist, 1 July 2011\\"Trapped journalists in Libya freed\\", Wikinews, 25 August 2011 The opposition badly wanted to get its story out to the rest of the world and so, as soon as they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever and to talk to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for what they see as genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.\\"Libya: Media on the frontlines of revolution\\", Listening Post video report (1:01‚Äì8:22), Al Jazeera, 3 September 2011 According to Reporters Without Borders, the Libyan authorities continue to stigmatize the foreign media. On 21 February Muammar Gaddafi referred to foreign TV stations as \\"stray dogs\\", while the Foreign Minister warned that the pro-Gaddafi forces would regard any journalists illegally entering Libya as agents of Al-Qaeda.\\"Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected\\", Reporters Without Borders, 4 March 2011 On the morning of 4 March the foreign journalists present in Tripoli were barred from leaving their hotels. Security agents blocked all attempts by reporters to leave the Rixos Al Nasr Hotel in the center of the capital, which housed 130 journalists invited by the government. Threatening to arrest all those who went out without permission, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the presence of journalists on the street could provoke violence. On 11 March Brazilian reporter Andrei Netto of the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper was released by pro-Gaddafi forces after being held for eight days. Netto, who is normally based in Paris, was arrested by pro-Gaddafi forces at the Tunisian- Libyan border as he was trying to resolve problems regarding the way he had entered the country. His newspaper said he was beaten and kept blindfolded during the eight days he was held in Sabratha, a town 60 km west of Tripoli. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson and his crew were detained on 11 March in Tajura, east of Tripoli, by forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. According to Robertson \\"This was no accidental arrest, no fortunate stumbling across a news team. They [Gaddafi enforcers] had planned this all along.\\" The taxi driver, who was driving the crew and Robertson, was also held. According to Robertson the taxi driver had \\"done nothing more than give us a ride. He had no idea he might get into trouble.\\" Robertson and his crew were released later the same day. Unidentified gunmen shot and killed Ali Hassan al-Jaber, a cameraman working for the Qatar-based satellite TV station Al-Jazeera, on 12 March in an ambush on the outskirts of the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi. Al-Jazeera said Al Jaber was returning to Benghazi after reporting in a nearby town when the gunmen opened fire on his car, killing him and another passenger. Wadah Khanfar, the director-general of Al Jazeera, said that the killing came after \\"an unprecedented campaign\\" against the network by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. \\"Al Jazeera staffer killed in Libya\\", Al Jazeera, 12 March 2011 On 7 April, following a series of individual arrests and deportations in previous weeks, the Libyan government decided to deport 26 foreign journalists, who had all been invited to Tripoli by the government, on the grounds that their visas had expired. As of 18 April several journalists being held by the government had been released. While the exact number of journalists still being held remained unknown, at least five foreign journalists were still being detained. On 18 May Libya released four foreign journalists, one day after a suspended sentence of one year and a $154 fine were imposed for their illegal entry to Libya. The British, Spanish, and two American journalists were captured on 4 April by Muammar al-Gaddafi's military and detained for six weeks. The journalists worked for The New York Times, GlobalPost, the Atlantic, USA Today, and the BBC.Libya releases four foreign journalists, Wikinews, 21 May 2011 While foreign journalists reported from opposition-controlled areas in relative freedom, there were regular reports of opposition fighters preventing reporters from covering events they considered embarrassing. Such incidents seemed to increase in May and June as the push to overthrow Gaddafi stalled. For example in the rebel enclave of Misrata, 188 kilometres (117 miles) from Tripoli, opposition officials prevented journalists from traveling to the front and required them to use only \\"approved\\" translators, a condition not imposed in other areas under opposition control.\\"Libya's Rebels Grow Wary of Western Journalists\\", Steven Sotloff, Time, 1 July 2011\\"Libya: Media on the frontlines of revolution\\", Listening Post video report (4:31‚Äì5:04), Al Jazeera, 3 September 2011Libyan rebels in Misrata restrict press freedoms, Wikinews, 24 June 2011 On 24 August, four Italian journalists were kidnapped by Gaddafi loyalists on the road to Zawiya, about 40 km west of Tripoli and were taken to an apartment in the capital. Their abductors killed their Libyan driver in front of them. The journalists say they were roughed up and their equipment and material confiscated. Their abduction came on the eve of a visit to Italy by Mahmoud Jibril, the Prime Minister of the opposition National Transitional Council, for a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The four journalists were released by their captors the next day.\\"Four Italian journalists released after being held for 24 hours\\", Reporters Without Borders, 25 August 2011 Seven foreign journalists were wounded in late August and September. Russian journalist Orkhan Djamal, of the daily Izvestia, sustained a non-life-threatening leg-injury during fighting in Tripoli on 22 August. Paris Match photographer Alvaro Canovas was shot in the thigh while covering a rebel assault in Tripoli on 23 August. France 2 cameraman Bruno Girodon was shot near the Bab al-Azizia complex in Tripoli on 24 August. Mohamed Ballout, a journalist with dual French and Lebanese nationality working for the BBC, was injured in Bani Walid on 16 September when a round fired by a pro-Gaddafi sniper killed one man, passed through the body of another man, and hit Mohammed under the arm, in a gap in his bullet-proof vest. Shrapnel from an exploding shell seriously injured the French freelance photographer Olivier Sarbil in the face, arms and legs during fighting between pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces on 17 September in Sirte. \\"Convictions in Muscat, cameraman on life support in Sanaa, journalists injured in Libya and arbitrary arrests in Syria\\", Reporters Without Borders, 21 September 2011 Internet :Further information: Internet censorship in Libya On 1 February 2011 state security police arrested the writer and political commentator Jamal al-Hajji, who had used the Internet to call for peaceful protests in Libya.\\"Libyan writer detained following protest call\\", Amnesty International, 8 February 2011 At the start of the uprising on 16 February, state security police arrested the director of local news-site Irasa, Taqi Al-Din Al-Chalawi, and its editor, Abdel Fattah Bourwaq.According to the daily paper Libya Al-Youm Blogger Mohammed Al-Ashim Masmari was also arrested after he reported on the demonstrations for the BBC and Al-Jazeera.\\"Libya: Col Muammar Gaddafi has launched a fierce attack on the Internet as the country teeters on the brink of civil war\\", Reporters Without Borders, 11 March 2011 On 18 February, the day after the first protests that lead to the civil war, Libya withdrew all of its BGP prefix announcements from the Internet for a short period, cutting Libya off from the rest of the Internet.

At 6:00 am on 3 March, Internet traffic effectively ceased, except for a very limited amount of traffic carried on satellite links, when the government severed the underwater backbone fiber-optic cable that runs along the coast and links networks in the east to servers in the west of the country. Engineers believed that the break occurred between the cities of Misrata and Khoms, and could be a physical or electronic rupture.\\"How 'rebel' phone network evaded shutdown\\", Evan Hill, Al Jazerra, 23 April 2011 From 10 July Internet traffic began increasing again and, after a brief shutdown on 15 July, it reached roughly 15% of its previous levels. On 12 August the Gaddafi regime announced that \\"any citizen in possession of a Thuraya [satellite telephone] must hold an authorisation to use it in accordance with the laws and regulations\\" and otherwise would \\"be punished according to the law that criminalizes communicating with the enemy in time of war, and stipulates penalties up to the death penalty\\".\\"Libya threatens death for unauthorised Thuraya use\\", Middle East Online, 12 August 2011 After 22 August, the day Tripoli fell to the rebels, Internet traffic began increasing again and by 2 September had reached daily levels in excess of 50% and often as high as 75% of pre-war levels.For graphs of Google traffic, which give a reasonable picture of all internet traffic, see \\"Libya Traffic Divided by Worldwide Traffic and Normalized\\", Google, accessed 1 October 2011 \\"The Battle for Tripoli's Internet\\", James Cowie, rensys blog, 21 August 2011 Social media networks are used in two distinct ways during conflicts: as organizing tools and as broadcasting platforms. During the civil war in Libya the emphasis was on broadcasting to the rest of the world, because only a relatively few Libyans (5%) had access to the Internet, because the Internet was already being filtered by the government prior to the start of protests in mid-February, and because the Internet in Libya was almost completely shutdown by the government starting in early March.\\"Did Twitter, Facebook really build a revolution?\\", Jina Moore, Christian Science Monitor, 30 June 2011 Citizen journalists provided an alternative to the official media in their portrayal of the protests and the turmoil across the country. While state media showed only pro-Gaddafi protests, pictures and video from mobile phones that made their way from Libya onto Facebook pages told a different story. When Facebook and Twitter were blocked inside the country, users managed to circumvent restrictions by using satellite connections, proxy servers, and other means. Various other anti-government citizens compiled the amateur videos, pictures, and other sources of media onto websites to continue the protest. Early in the revolt some activists crossed into Egypt to post online videos and photos taken with mobile phones or tweeted news about events in the country. The hacker group Anonymous provided Libyans with tools to get round the censorship and some of its members reportedly managed to set up parallel networks. The group also helped people to pass on photos and videos.\\"Countries Under Surveillance: Libya\\", Reporters Without Borders, accessed 1 October 2011 NATO used Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other online media as part of a wide range of sources of information, ranging from unmanned aerial drones to television news, to help determine potential targets for air- strikes in Libya and to assess their success. \\"Anti-Gaddafi forces add Twitter to armoury\\", Tim Bradshaw and James Blitz, Financial Times (London), 15 June 2011 See also * Internet censorship in the Arab Spring  References  Libyan Civil War War and the media Libyan Civil War Libyan Civil War (2011) Libyan Civil War Mass media in Libya ","title":"Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan Civil War"},{"id":"31254026","text":"James Priddy (3 December 1909 - 12 July 1994) played first-class cricket for Somerset between 1933 and 1939.

A more detailed description of the experiment is available at the scholarpedia.  Antiproton Beam  A proton beam will be provided by the existing GSI facility and will be further accelerated by FAIR‚Äôs SIS100 ring accelerator up to 30 GeV. By the beam hitting the antiproton production target, antiprotons with a momentum of around 3 GeV/c will be produced and can be collected and pre-cooled in the Collector Ring (CR). Afterwards the antiprotons will be injected into the High Energy Storage Ring (HESR). This race track shaped storage ring will host the PÃÑANDA experiment. The antiprotons can be cooled using stochastic and later also electron cooling and afterwards slowed down or further accelerated to momenta from p = 1.5 GeV/c up to p = 15 GeV/c. There are two operation modes of the HESR. In the high-resolution mode a momentum resolution of frac{Delta p}{p}=5cdot10^{-5} and a luminosity of mathcal{L}=1.6cdot10^{31}mathrm{cm} ^{-2}s^{-1} can be achieved.

It is situated in Darmstadt in Germany. FAIR will be based upon an expansion of the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, the details of which have been laid out in the FAIR Baseline Technical Report 2006. On October 4, 2010 the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe limited liability company (German GmbH), abbreviated as FAIR GmbH, was founded which coordinates the construction of the new accelerators and experiments. The construction begun at summer of 2017. Commissioning is planned for 2025. The original budget had been estimated at 1262 million euro (2005 price level), in 2018 the German Federal Court of Auditors stated that the cost of FAIR had increased to at least 1669 million euro (2005 prices), in 2019 a further report by the Federal Court of Auditors quoted results from a review board that an additional 850 million euro (2019 prices) would be needed to finish building the facility.https://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/de/veroeffentlichungen/produkte/beratungsberichte/entwicklung- einzelplaene/2020/langfassungen/2019-bericht-information-ueber-die- entwicklung-des-einzelplans-30-bundesministerium-fuer-bildung-und-forschung- fuer-die-beratungen-zum-bundeshaushalt-2020-pdf FAIR science case Aerial view on the FAIR construction site The four scientific pillars of FAIR are: * Atomic, Plasma Physics and Applications - APPA, * Compressed Baryonic Matter - CBM, * Nuclear Structure, Astrophysics and Reactions - NUSTAR, * antiProton ANnihilation at DArmstadt - PANDA. Those are described on the web pages of FAIR (see and links therein). FAIR accelerators The FAIR construction area from the far east of the GSI ground (spring 2013). On the left, the tree free circle, will give room for the future heavy ion synchrotron SIS100, middle after the container housing two rotary drilling machines (each 100 tons \\"light\\") for the approximately 1400 piles, each max 40m deep and appr. 1,2m in diameter, right of the image the place for the future other accelerators and experimental areas. Beams of protons will be prepared in the proton linear accelerator, p-LINAC, while heavy ions will be prepared in the UNILAC. Both of them will be fed into the SIS18. From there they will be directed into SIS100 (and SIS300 if applicable). Protons will be used either to produce antiproton beams by directing them on a dedicated production target or directly used for experiments within APPA. These antiprotons will be captured and cooled in the Collector Ring, CR (and RESR when available) before being injected into HESR, where they will be utilised within the PANDA experiment. High energetic heavy ions will either be used directly for studies with the CBM or APPA experiments or to produce unstable ion beams. The latter will be produced in the Rare Isotope Production Target and filtered the Super-FRS, where the NUSTAR experiments will take place. FAIR partner = Countries = Roughly 3,000 scientists from more than 50 countries are already working on the planning of the experiment and accelerator facilities. This project is realised by partners from Finland, France, Germany, India, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia and Sweden that have signed an international treaty, the FAIR Convention, which formally entered into force in March 2014.

Participism is intended as an alternative to both capitalism and centrally-planned state socialism. Participism has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society. Overview Advocates of participism envision remaking all of human society from the bottom up according to principles of direct participatory democracy and replacing economic and social competition with cooperation. Supporters of what is termed a \\"participatory society\\" support the eventual dissolution of the centralized state, markets, and money (in its current form) placing it in the tradition of anti-authoritarian libertarian socialism. To elucidate their vision for a new society, advocates of participism categorize their aspirations into what they term a \\"liberating theory\\". Liberating theory is a holistic framework for understanding society that looks at the whole of society and the interrelations among different parts of people's social lives. Participism groups human society into four primary \\"spheres\\", all of which are set within an international and ecological context, and each of which has a set of defining functions: *The political sphere: policy-making, administration, and collective implementation. *The economic sphere: production, consumption, and allocation of the material means of life. *The kinship sphere: procreation, nurturance, socialisation, gender, sexuality, and organisation of daily home life. *The community sphere: development of collectively shared historical identities, culture, religion, spirituality, linguistic relations, lifestyles, and social celebrations. Within each sphere there are two components. The first component is the Human Centre, the collection of people living within a society. Each person has needs, desires, personalities, characteristics, skills, capacities, and consciousness. The second component is the Institutional Boundary, all of society‚Äôs social institutions that come together to form interconnected roles, relationships, and commonly held expectations and patterns of behaviour, that produce and reproduce societal outcomes. These institutions come together to help shape who people are as individuals. =Participatory politics= Parpolity is the political system first proposed by Stephen R. Shalom, professor of political science at William Paterson University in New Jersey. Shalom has stated that Parpolity is meant as a long range vision of where social justice should reach its apex within the field of politics and should complement the level of participation in the economy with an equal degree of participation in policy and administrative matters. A diagram of the nested council structure. The values on which parpolity is based are: *freedom *self- management *justice *solidarity *and tolerance. The goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate, as much as possible in a direct and face to face manner. The proposed decision-making principle is that every person should have say in a decision proportionate to the degree to which she or he is affected by that decision. The vision is critical of aspects of modern representative democracies arguing that the level of political control by the people isn't sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society. In a country or society run according to participism, there would be local councils of voting citizens consisting of 25-50 members. These local councils would be able to pass any law that affected only the local council. No higher council would be able to override the decisions of a lower council, only a council court would be able to challenge a local law on human rights grounds. The councils would be based on consensus, though majority votes are allowed when issues cannot be agreed upon. Each local council would send a delegate to a higher level council, until that council fills with 25-50 members. These second level councils would pass laws on matters that effect the 625 to 2500 citizens that it represents. A delegate to a higher level council is bound to communicate the views of her or his sending council, but is not bound to vote as the sending council might wish. Otherwise, Shalom points out that there is no point in having nested councils, and everyone might as well vote on everything. A delegate is recallable at any time by her or his sending council. Rotation of delegates would be mandatory, and delegates would be required to return to their sending councils frequently. The second level council sends a delegate to a third level council, the third level councils send delegates to a fourth level and so on until all citizens are represented. Five levels with 50 people on every council would represent 312,500,000 voters (around the population of the United States). However, the actual number of people included would be even higher, given that young children would not be voting. Thus, with a further sixth level nested council, the entire human population could be included. This would not however be equatable to a global world state, but rather would involve the dissolution of all existing nation-states and their replacement with a worldwide confederal \\"coordinating body\\" made of delegates immediately recallable by the nested council below them. Lower level councils have the opportunity to hold referendums at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of lower level councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to lower level councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to referendum democracy. There would be staff employed to help manage council affairs. Their duties would perhaps include minute taking and researching issues for the council. These council staff would work in a balanced job complex defined by a participatory economy. =Participatory economics= Parecon (participatory economics) is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist Michael Albert and radical economist Robin Hahnel. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. It is described as \\"an anarchistic economic vision\\", and a form of socialism, the means of production are owned in common. The theory is proposed as an alternative to both contemporary capitalist market economies and centrally planned socialism. It distinguishes between two parts of the working class. The 'coordinator class' that does the conceptual, creative and managerial work and the rest of the class doing rote work. This situation is deemed 'coordinatorism', which the theory claims it to be a major flaw with Marxism. The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management and efficiency. (Efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets.) It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: * workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions, * balanced job complexes, * remuneration according to effort and sacrifice, and * participatory planning. In place of money parecon would have a form of currency in which personal vouchers or \\"credits\\" would be awarded for work done to purchase goods and services. Unlike money, credits would disappear upon purchase, and would be non- transferable between individuals, making bribery and monetary theft impossible. Also, the only items or services with a price attached would most likely be those considered wants or non-essentials and anything deemed a need would be completely free of charge (e.g.: health care, public transportation). Albert and Hahnel have stressed that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of politics, culture and kinship. The authors have also discussed elements of social anarchism in the field of politics, polyculturalism in the field of culture, and feminism in the field of family/kinship and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. Since the publication of Albert's book \\"Parecon\\", other thinkers have come forward and incorporated these concepts which have rounded participism into a more fully formed political and social ideology. =Feminist kinship= See also Nurture kinship and Free love Outside of both political and economic relations there still exists the sphere of human kinship. Participism sees this as a vital component in a liberated society and applies feminist principles to this aspect of human relations. Feminist kinship relations are seen to seek to free people from oppressive definitions that have been socially imposed and to abolish all sexual divisions of labour and sexist and heterosexist demarcation of individuals according to gender and sexuality. Participism holds that a participatory society must be respectful on an individual‚Äôs nature, inclinations, and choices and all people must be provided with the means to pursue the lives they want regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or age. Feminist kinship relations are dependent on the liberation of women, LGBTQ persons, youth, the elderly, and intersex (hermaphroditic and pseudohermaphroditic) individuals. To extend liberation into daily home life, a participatory society aims to provide the means for traditional couples, single parents, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, and intersex parents, communal parenting, polygamy (especially polyandry), polyamorous and multiple parenting arrangements to develop and flourish. It is believed that within the home and the community, the task of raising children must be elevated in status. Highly personalised interaction between children and adults should be encouraged, and responsibilities for these interactions must be distributed equitably throughout society without segregating tasks by gender. A participatory society would provide parents with access to high quality day-care, flexible work hours, and parental leave options allowing them to play a more active role in the lives of their children. The liberation of women and society from patriarchal and heteronormative oppression, according to participism, requires total reproductive freedom. Society must provide all members with the right to family planning, without shame or guilt for performing or soliciting an abortion or for engaging in alternative sexual behavior and without fear of sterilization or economic deprivation; the right to have or not to have children and to terminate undesired pregnancies through unhindered access to birth control and unregulated abortion, respectively; and the right to comprehensive sexual education and healthcare that provide every citizen with information and resources to live a healthy and fulfilling sex life. In such sex-positive participatory societies the full exploration of human sexuality, with the possible exception of child sexuality, would be accepted and embraced as normative. Participism encourages the exercise of and experimentation of different forms of sexuality by consenting partners. =Polycultural community= Human society is held to have long and brutal history of conquest, colonisation, genocide, and slavery which cannot be transcended easily. To begin the step-by-step process of building a new historical legacy and set of behavioural expectations between communities, a participatory society would construct intercommunalist institutions to provide communities with the means to assure the preservation of their diverse cultural traditions and to allow for their continual development. With polycultural intercommunalism, all material and psychological privileges that are currently granted to a section of the population at the expense of the dignity and standards of living for oppressed communities, as well as the division of communities into subservient positions according to culture, ethnicity, nationality, and religion, will be dissolved. The multiplicity of cultural communities and the historical contributions of different communities would be respected, valued, and preserved by guaranteeing each sufficient material and communicative means to reproduce, self-define, develop their own cultural traditions, and represent their culture to all other communities. Through construction of intercommunalist relations and institutions that guarantee each community the means necessary to carry on and develop their traditions, a participatory society assists eliminating negative inter- community relations and encourages positive interaction between communities that can enhance the internal characteristics of each. In a participatory society, individuals would be free to choose the cultural communities they prefer and members of every community would have the right of dissent and to leave. Intervention would not be permitted except to preserve this right for all. Those outside a community would also be free to criticize cultural practices that they believe violate acceptable social norms, but the majority would not have the power to impose its will on a vulnerable minority. Criticisms =Anarchism= Certain anarchists of the libcom community (an internet community of libertarian communists) have criticized the parpolity aspect of participism for deciding beforehand the scale and scope of the councils whilst only practice, they argue, can accurately indicate the size and scale of anarchist confederations and other organizational platforms, especially since each region is unique with unique residents and unique solutions and unique wants. Anarchists argue that such blueprints containing detailed information are either dangerous or pointless. Furthermore, some anarchists have criticized the potential use of referendums to challenge decisions taken by higher councils as this implies both a top-down structure and an absence of vis-√†-vis democracy as they argue that referendums are not participatory.Parecon or libertarian communism?. libcom.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. They have also criticized the enforcement of laws passed by councils rather than the use of supposed voluntary custom or customary law which develops through mutual recognition rather than being enforced by an external authority, as they argue the laws passed by such councils would need to be. =Capitalism= The criticism of socialism could be applied to participism as well, as advocates of capitalism object to the absence of a market and private property in a hypothetical participatory society. However, in a debate with David Horowitz, Michael Albert argued that those criticisms could not apply to parecon, as it was especially designed to take them into account. New specific criticisms should then be formulated. For instance, in an answer to the comments of David Kotz and John O'Neill about one of their articles on the subject, Albert and Hahnel assert that they designed parecon understanding \\"that knowledge is distributed unequally throughout society\\", hypothetically answering to the famous criticisms of Friedrich Von Hayek on the possibility of planning.

Cape Coast is known for many reasons, including for its UN World Heritage Site ‚Äì Cape Coast Castle ‚Äì and its senior high schools, and is also popular because of its market. Kotokoraba Market is the economic hub of the region, with all major trading stores located around it. Part of the market has a big transport yard from where various buses and cars transport traders and their wares, as well as individuals, to different parts of the country. The market is bordered to the north-west by Mfantsipim School and the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation hill. On the east is Tantri, a busy transport yard and the major departure point for travellers moving out of the city. History The market has existed for years, and was a major trading site during the pre-independence era, continuing to grow to is present size. It served as a major point for all trade in the region. Its position made it a hotspot for economic activity, as major activities in the city went on in and around the area. This led to the area quickly filling up with building for stores. Various trading houses brought their businesses close as it brought them closer to buyers. The name of the market, which could mean \\"crab village\\", is believed to derive from early settlers who made their living from the abundance of crabs in the bay. Fires As with many big markets in Ghana, most destruction to the Kotokoraba market is attributable to fire: two major fires have razed parts of the market since 2000. In 2002 fire gutted the market, destroying goods worth thousands of cedis. About 104 stalls and goods including textiles, provisions, toiletries and foodstuffs were completely destroyed. It took a combined team of personnel of the Ghana National Fire Service drawn from Cape Coast, Mankessim, Apam and Takoradi more than two hours to bring the fire under control. The fire started at about 7 pm. On 24 April 2010, fire destroyed several shops and a number of temporary structures at the Kotokoraba Market. In both case the central government had to put in funds to rebuild the market, and in some cases paid some money as disaster relief to traders who had lost their wares. Calls for expansion On 8 January 2009 a cross-section of residents in the Cape Coast Township expressed their desire for the establishment of a new market to ease the congestion at the Kotokoraba market. The call for a new market was mainly made by traders and market women who complained that the Kotokoraba market was overcrowded with people and vehicles, each struggling for space, while traders who are unable to get stalls within the market can only display their wares in the streets, causing traffic jams. Though the concerns raised are true, lack of space around the market does not permit its expansion; a bigger market could only be set up elsewhere. Sanitation As in many big markets in Ghana, waste and its management is a major preoccupation of the authorities in charge. Normally, cleaners start work at dawn when the market is the least busy, sweeping and gathering the previous day's refuse. They also clean the gutters every three months, more often in the rainy season, to prevent them from getting blocked.

Life Edith was born on 21 November 1876, in Oxton, Birkenhead. She was one of six children of nursery and seedman James Smith and his wife Harriet. in 1897 she married stationer and tobacconist William Smith. They had three daughters and a son together. She worked for a time as a sub-postmistress. Her husband died in 1907. The 1911 Census shows Smith had moved to London and was training to be a midwife. Her daughters were at various schools and her son was in an orphanage near Blackburn. Shortly after this she took up a post as a matron at a nursing home. Founded in 1914, the Women Police Volunteers (WPV) was staffed by volunteers such as Edith Smith. It was founded by Nina Boyle and Margaret Damer Dawson, who fell out over its anti-prostitution role in London and elsewhere in February 1915, with Boyle leaving the organisation and Dawson reforming it as the Women's Police Volunteers (WPS) with herself as head. Smith remained with the WPS and in August 1915 she was appointed the first woman police constable in England with full power of arrest. Her duties were to deal with cases where women were involved. She was concerned with trying to reduce the number of prostitutes in Grantham who were attracted there by the nearby army base. She received 28 shillings (¬£1.40 a week). In April 1917 this was raised to ¬£2 10 shillings (¬£2.50 a week). This was more than the oldest male police Constable in the force due to the fact that her \\"duties were most onerous\\" and took into account that she was also a qualified nurse. In 1916, PC Smith cautioned 100 wayward girls in larceny cases, 16 women and 15 girls were found to be drunk. Ten prostitutes were convicted, 10 were handed over to their parents and 50 were cautioned. Smith wrote of her time in Grantham: \\"The appointment has made such a vast difference - the prostitutes have found that it does not pay and the frivolous girls have bowed down.\\" Edith travelled around Britain giving talks about women's policing at conferences and writing pamphlets. The legitimacy of policewomen was often questioned during World War One due to their blurred status and limited powers. Their role was left in the hands of individual Chief Constables leading to extreme conservatism in some areas and to daring innovations in others. Smith left the WPS (renamed the Women's Auxiliary Service after the war) after working seven days a week for a period of two years. She left in 1918 due to chest trouble. Until January 1919, Smith was also the matron nurse at Lindis Nursing Home, Dudley Road in Grantham where she worked seven days a week. Edith moved to Runcorn in Cheshire to work for a Nursing Association. Finding it to be low on funds, she gave lectures, organised whist drives and conducted shorthand classes to raise money. However, there were some local concerns, who ‚Äúdid not complain about the nurse's work, but about her methods‚Äù. She died on 26 June 1923 after she took an overdose of morphia, five years after leaving the force. The coroner returned a verdict that she took her own life while temporarily insane. Her life is commemorated in Grantham Museum. Her grave at Halton Cemetery in Runcorn was unmarked until two policewomen launched a fundraising campaign to buy a headstone in 2018. She shares it with her niece, Marjorie, who died 10 days after Edith aged two years.  Commemoration  In 2014, a blue plaque was unveiled in Grantham where she had worked as a policewoman. Deputy Chief Constable Heather Roach, of Lincolnshire Police, said: \\"She spent time getting to know the people in her area and thoroughly understood the concept of 'neighbourhood policing'.‚Äù On 16 June 2018 a blue plaque was erected on 18 Palm Hill, Oxton, where she had lived. The plaque was unveiled her granddaughter Margaret Smith. On 8 March 2019 a blue plaque was erected on St Mary's Church Hall, Halton village, Runcorn, on the site of the old almshouses where Edith had been living at the time of her death.

A figure similar to that of Figure 1 of Broerse, Vladusich, and O‚ÄôShea (1999), demonstrating what became known as the watercolor illusion. The vertical gratings are black and white with a thin line of red along each black bar. The horizontal gratings are black and white with a thin line of green along each black bar. The illusion is that the red and green appear to spread over the black and white regions of the vertical and horizontal gratings respectively. Figure 2. Figure 1 from Pinna (2008). Purple undulated contours adjacent to orange ones are perceived as a map of the Mediterranean Sea (picture a) and the Gulf of Mexico (picture b) evenly colored by a light veil of orange tint spreading from the orange contours (coloration effect). The two shapes show a strong figure-ground segregation and a solid figural appearance comparable to a bas-relief illuminated from the top and to rounded surfaces segregated in depth and extending out from the flat surface (figural effect). On the contrary, the complementary regions appear as empty spaces with the appearance of holes. The watercolor illusion, also referred to as the water- color effect, is an optical illusion in which a white area takes on a pale tint of a thin, bright, intensely colored polygon surrounding it if the coloured polygon is itself surrounded by a thin, darker border (Figures 1 and 2). The inner and outer borders of watercolor illusion objects often are of complementary colours (Figure 2). The watercolor illusion is best when the inner and outer contours have chromaticities in opposite directions in color space. The most common complementary pair is orange and purple. The watercolor illusion is dependent on the combination of luminance and color contrast of the contour lines in order to have the color spreading effect occur. History Baingio Pinna discovered the watercolor illusion in 1987, reporting it in Italian.Pinna, B. (1987). Un effetto di colorazione. In V. Majer, M. Maeran, and M. Santinello, Il laboratorio e la citt√†. XXI Congresso degli Psicologi Italiani, 158. Jack Broerse and Robert P. O'Shea independently discovered it in 1995, reporting it in English, although they called it \\"spread colour\\", relating it to neon colour spreading. Broerse, Tony Vladusich, and O‚ÄôShea, demonstrated the phenomenon in 1999 (Figure 1). Pinna, Gavin Brelstaff, and Lothar Spillmann published the first account of the phenomenon in English in 2001, giving it its current name. Since the discovery many experiments have been performed and analyzed to understand the concept of perception of the illusion compared to various Gestalt factors and the neural processes that create the illusion. =Watercolor illusion compared to Gestalt principles= The watercolor illusion has had much debate over whether it can be described by Gestalt psychology. Watercolor illusion has been considered a case of the Gestalt principles by some because of the similarity principles that describe the figure-ground (perception). According to the similarity principles (principles of grouping),Wertheimer, M. (1923). Untersuchungen zur Lehre von der Gestalt II, Psychologische Forschung 4, 301‚Äì350. elements are grouped together based on its color, brightness, size and shape. There are seven Gestalt factors that the Watercolor Illusion filling of the figure- ground organization were compared to: proximity, good continuation, closure, symmetry, convexity, amodal completion, and past experience. These seven factors were tested in a series of experiments by Pinna, Werner, and Spillman to determine the strength of each factor compared to the illusion. The first experiment tested the watercolor effect versus proximity to determine the figure-ground segregation. According to the Gestalt factor of proximity, closer elements are more likely to be grouped together. The stimuli had different spacing between the set of contour/flank lines. Each stimuli used had a vastly different response, but the watercolor illusion held true even in the wide spaces of the illusion. In some cases, the figure-ground areas were reversed as the filling-in of the orange flank was stronger than the filling in of the purple. The second experiment tested the watercolor effect versus good continuation. In good continuation, the smooth continuation areas tend to be grouped together. With different variations of a square-wave pattern and basic contours with fringes, the good continuation of the stimuli was studied. It was determined that the uniform watercolor illusion is seen in only closed space. The third experiment studied the watercolor illusion stimulus against the idea of closure and surroundness. According to the closure principle, piece creating a closed figure are grouped together. When one region encompasses another region completely, the surrounding region is perceived as ground, and the feature that is perceived as figure according to the surroundness principle. When the four purple rectangles were surrounded by a larger rectangle, the large rectangle was rarely perceived as figure while the four rectangles were seen as figures. When orange contours bordered the inside of the large rectangle, but outside the four smaller rectangles, the larger rectangle was perceived as figure while the small rectangles were perceived as holes. This showed that the closure and surroundness were weaker than the watercolor illusion. The fourth experiment was watercolor effect versus symmetry. Parallel contours are grouped together according to the Gestalt principle of symmetry. Parallel wavy lines (rivers) were spaced apart with the purple contours on the inside and orange on the outside. Opposite of the principle, the rivers were not perceived as filed in, but the interspaces between the rivers were perceived to be filled in, or as figure in this case. The fifth experiment was watercolor illusion compared to convexity. According to the ‚Äúlaw of the inside‚Äù the concave regions of the stimulus should be perceived as ground and the convex ones perceived as figure. The stimuli used had different sets of concave and convex arcs alternating between two horizontal lines. The concave regions were typically perceived as figure whether the purple was flanked by red or orange fringes. However, as the curvature was increased the effect was decreased when the red fringes were used. The sixth experiment was amodal completion compared to the watercolor illusion. Amodal completion is not a classical principle of figure-ground segregation that helps explain the perception of an object‚Äôs hidden regions. This applies to both figure and ground in the organization. From the experiments, amodal completion does not hold true when the watercolor illusion reversed the perceived segregation of components. The seventh experiment was to determine if the observer would see the color spread effect if the stimulus was of a common object. From this, it was determined that spaces with prior knowledge (familiar words, shapes, etc. ) are more likely to be grouped together.Pinna, B., & Spillmann, L. & Werner, J. (2002). The watercolor effect: A New Principle of Grouping and figure-ground organization. Vision Research, 43-52 =Strength of color spread effect experiments= Several experiments were performed to determine the necessary criteria to have the watercolor illusion viewed. The outcome of the experiments affected the properties that were defined by the coloration effect (below). The first experiment was done to determine the distance over which the color spreading effect occurred. 25 stimuli of different dimension were hand‚Äìdrawn with magic markers: purple for the outside border and orange for the inner fringe. The stimuli were presented 50 cm away from the observer with no time limit on determining the color spread. It was determined that the color spreading reported from the experiment decreased with increasing length of the shorter axis. The determined threshold was a height of 45 degrees of visual angle for the height of the surface. The second experiment was to determine the duration of the exposed stimuli to see the illusion. Again, the stimuli were shown to the observer 50 cm away in an ambient lighted room. An electromagnetic shutter was in front of one eye. The smallest interval for the electromagnetic shutter was 100 ms, and the continuous color could be seen at the time duration. It was determined that the watercolor illusion could be perceived instantaneously in the given conditions. The third experiment was to determine the optimal line thickness. Various thicknesses of the border and fringe were drawn for the stimulus pattern. The observers compared the strength and uniformity of the illusion between the various stimuli. The color spreading was perceived the strongest when the contour and fringe subtended a visual angle of 6 arcminutes; The strength of the illusion was discovered to decrease as the thickness of lines increased. The fourth experiment was evaluating the waviness of the lines used compared to the strength of the illusion. The stimulus patterns varied in frequency of sinusoidal waves. The results showed increase of strength with increasing spatial frequency of the sinusoidal waves. The effects are the strongest with the wave patterns, however, the watercolor illusion is still strong for a stimulus with straight borders. The fifth experiment tested inducing color. The colors were drawn with magic marker with pairs of red, green, blue, and yellow lines. Red and blue pairs produced the strongest effects while green and yellow produced the weakest illusion effect. All combinations of two colors produced a clearly visible spreading effect. The sixth experiment tested the contrast between the different color lines to see which produced the most striking effect. Pinna first discovered the watercolor illusion with high contrast lines (a black outer line and lighter fringe). When the luminance between the two lines is different, the color spreading effect is the strongest. As the luminance between the two lines becomes closer, the spreading effect grows weaker but is still present. Limitations of the watercolor illusion were studied. The color- spreading effect occurs on colored backgrounds in addition to the white or gray. In the case of a colored background, the watercolor illusion color spread does not mix with the background color but does get superimposed onto the colored background. For lighting conditions, the color spreading effect declines as the illumination in the room increases. It is the strongest at medium illumination. Lastly, the watercolor illusion persists even when dotted lines are used for the purple contour and orange fringe instead of continuous lines.Pinna, Baingio, Gavin Brelstaff, and Lothar Spillmann. \\"Surface Color from Boundaries: A New ‚Äòwatercolor‚Äô Illusion.\\" Vision Research 41.20 (2001): 2669-676. Web.  Watercolor illusion and its phenomenal effects  =The coloration effect= The coloration effect is one of the phenomenal effects of watercolor illusions. Pinna and Reeves, (2006) identified thirteen properties of the coloration effect through experiments of the water color illusion. All of the main properties can be seen with any pair of complementary (opposite in color space) contour lines. However, from the experiment described above, purple and orange have been found to produce the strongest effects. The thirteen properties are: the stimulus (1) is uniform, (2) solid and (3) can be perceived on a white, black or, colored background (the background does not affect the experiment as the color spread effect is superimposed on it without any mixing). (4) The orange hue is best observed if the object contains wiggly lines, though it is perceived with straight or dotted lines. (5) The effect can work with all basic colors, though (6) the effect is shown better when the lines have a high luminance contrast. (7) The line with the less luminance to the background will always produce the coloration effect. For example the light orange line spreads to produce the color spreading effect. (8) If the lines were reversed and the orange was on the outside than the orange hue would appear to be penetrating outward of the object while the purple line would be on the inside. Some other properties are the following: (9) the coloration extends about 45 visual degrees (found in experiments listed above); (10) the coloration is complete by 100 millisecond the smallest possible measurable unit due to the experiment equipment; (11) the line width that produces the best coloration effect is 6 arc minutes; (12) the color also spreads in directions other than the line; (13) and lastly it can induce a complementary color when one of the lines is achromatic and the other is chromatic. =Figure-ground effect and object-hole effect= The figure-ground effect makes an object appear solid and opaque.Pinna, B., Grossberg, S. (2005). \\"The watercolor illusion and neon color spreading: a unified analysis of new cases and neural mechanisms.\\" Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 22(10), 2207-2221. Retrieved from http://cns.bu.edu/~steve/PinGro2005JOSA.pdf The object appears as if it can be either the background or the figure. Through switching the two contour lines, reverses the perception of the stimuli. For example, if the purple contour fringed by orange perceives a figure, when the colored contours are reversed, ground is perceived. In other words, the color spreading effect determines how the figure-ground effect is perceived. In most cases, the color spread tint is perceived as figure and the surrounding area is perceived as ground. As in the coloration effect, the watercolor illusion can show a figure-ground effect on white, black and colored backgrounds.Pinna, B., & Reeves, A. (2006). Lighting, backlighting and watercolor illusions and the laws of figurality. Spatial Vision, 19(2-4), 341-373. doi:10.1163/156856806776923434 The object-hole effect happens when the object of the watercolor illusion has a hole inside of it. The hole appears 3D and can help define what is figure and what is background. This can be difficult in determining if the boundaries of the hole belong to the background or the watercolor region because it appears that both options can be true. This effect can also be increased by increasing the number of lines. Dissociation between coloration and figure-ground effects Coloration and figure-ground are two of the effects that can be observed within the watercolor illusion. Dissociation implies that coloration can be observed without the figure-ground effect, and that the figure-ground effect can be observed without color spreading into the inside edges. Border ownership assignment mechanisms (the consistency of color border and the asymmetric shape of edge) determine the figure-ground effects while the surface color from visual cortex lead to the color illusion.Von, D. H., & Pierson, R. (2006). Dissociation of color and figure‚Äìground effects in the watercolor illusion. Spatial Vision, 19(2-4), 323-340. doi:10.1163/156856806776923416 Coloration without the figure-ground effect can be acquired by using equal luminance adjacent contours that show a flat and reversible figure-ground organization. This coloration is dependent on the luminance and colors of the inducing contour lines. In the figure-ground effect, the asymmetric luminance profile between the two lines gives a 3-D perspective with the lower contrast side appearing to bulge Figure-ground effect without coloration, the result is a figure that appears flat (does not appear 3-D). The coloration is most likely absent because of a blending of the two colored lines and not a high enough contrast between the two colors. Neural processing The coloration and figural effects from above come from parallel processes occurring in the brain. The two stages are the feature processing stage and the parallel boundary processing stage. At the feature processing stage, the area around the lines produces small interactions between the lines which leads to the color spreading. The parallel boundary processing stage organizes the geometrical structure of the stimulus into the color spreading of the watercolor illusion. However, the neural mechanisms are more complex as reducing the geometric structure of the stimulus changes the appearance and strength of the watercolor illusion. According to Pinna and Grossberg, the FA√áADE model better models the brain activity that occurs when the watercolor illusion is viewed. The FA√áADE model illustrates that the boundary contour system (BCS) and feature contour system (FCS) in parallel. The BCS does boundary grouping and the FCS does the surface filling in. These two processes occur within the regions V1 (primary visual cortex) through V4 (V2 through V4 are three extrastriate visual cortical areas). The FA√áADE model is weakened when the edges are low contrast to each other. Another modeling of neural processes of the brain that occur when the watercolor illusion stimulus is seen is the LAMINART model. This model demonstrates that stimulus is processed in the layers 6 and 4 of the cortical areas V1 and V2. The LAMINART model betters explains spatial competition which occurs when the boundary is weakened (e.g. dotted line). Also, the LAMINART model does not completely reduces the illusion visualization if the stimulus is low-contrast. Application Applications of the watercolor illusion capitalize on the limitation of the human visual system. The watercolor effect can be used by artists or illustrators who want to create the effect that the illusion gives off. If they want to create a light hue of a color they can take advantage of this effect and do not have to use any color to make it look like the object is filled in. Another possible application is in computer graphics rendering. If a certain tint or light color wants to fill a small space, the watercolor illusion can be applied to reduce rendering time as well amount of color used.

A blue inner circle appears within the black contours. In the actual image this area is white, which is made evident if the image is magnified. Blue circles replace the intersecting blue lines, especially when viewed from a distance. Neon color spreading (also referred to as neon-like color spreading) is an optical illusion in the category of transparency effects, characterized by fluid borders between the edges of a colored object and the background in the presence of black lines. The illusion was first documented in 1971 and was eventually rediscovered in 1975 by Van Tuijl. \\"Neon\\" references a neon tube and the bright colors that appear within one. \\"Color spreading\\" references how the colors seem to spread out from the center of the colored portion of the object. Neon color spreading is similar to the watercolor illusion, though the two are not to be confused with one another as they are produced in different ways. Causes The exact causes of the neon color spreading illusion are not known. It seems to occur most often when black lines are substituted with colored lines on a white background. One theory as to why this happens is that the simultaneous stimulation between the visual processing of lines and the color receptors in the eyes are not congruent. For this reasoning to work neon effects would only be possible if all black lines and colored lines were in contact, however there are illusions where this is not the case. Another theory about the illusion is that it occurs due to aberrations of perceptual mechanisms. If this were the case, the effect would not require such specific conditions to occur and would often be perceived when viewing colors under normal conditions. This reasoning works to discount chromatic aberration as the cause. Other theories about reasons for the effect have proposed that it occurs within non-random patterns. Others state that it is necessary for there to be straight lines for the effect to occur. This is not the case as many neon effects happen within random patterns and on curved lines. Neon color spreading is not an effect that usually occurs naturally. It is speculated that the effect occurs due to failings in visual processing. Since human beings would never see the effect naturally, there would be no reason to evolve in such a way that the trait disappears. Some studies theorize that the factors that make up the effect occur within the primary visual cortex and the V2 visual area where image contours are enhanced. Illusory contours An example of a circle created by color spreading. Kanizsa's Triangle is created by illusory contours. The neon color spreading effect works in a similar way to another illusion: illusory contours. Illusory contours are characterized by the appearance of contours due to the implication that they are there. Neon color spreading is better characterized by the generation of contours by the changing color of black lines. They can both create the perception of contours where there are none. Although the effects of both are similar, they can occur under different conditions. Targets under separate lighting conditions have been shown to exhibit either the color spreading effect or the illusory contour effect. This suggests that they are in fact two different effects. Illusory contours and neon color spreading are often difficult to differentiate. Neon color spreading is characterized by the color being used to create the visual phenomena. This tricks the visual system into thinking that there is color where there is not. Illusory contours cause a similar fooling of the visual system into perceiving contours by causing effects where the contours should be. They are both fooling the visual system in similar ways, but are characterized differently. Color effects Another aspect of neon color spreading that can affect the magnitude of the illusion are the colors used within the illusion. Different colors tend to cause a less or more intense illusion. Changing the color of the background can also enhance or inhibit the effect. If contrasting colors are used, such as a yellow background with blue and black lines, the effect will be enhanced. If similar colors are used, the effect will be inhibited. =Blue and red versus green and yellow= Long and short wavelength light, where the human eye is less sensitive to spatial detail, seem to enhance the effect. This means that if the illusion is created with red or blue lines, black lines, and a white background, the effect will be more intense. This is particularly notable when the colors are more saturated. In contrast to this, green and yellow tend to suppress the effect of neon color spreading when used in the same way. An example of different colored Ehrenstein figures. =Luminance= The brightness conditions under which the color spreading figures are viewed change the perceived intensity of the effect. Under bright lighting the effect will be inhibited and under dim lighting the effect will be enhanced. Another important factor is the luminance of the color causing the effect. Studies have shown that the color should be higher in luminance than the dark lines supporting the effect and it should be lower in luminance than the background. =Ehrenstein figures= Ehrenstein figures are a good way of easily making persistent color spreading effects. They are good for showing both the neon color spreading illusion and illusory contours. They are also good for showing examples of differences in hue between inner and outer lines and how they affect the neon color spreading illusion.

In 1976 he co-founded the Liederkreis Ensemble, whose members included a quartet of vocalists with Smith as pianist. The ensemble was dedicated to performing lieder, particularly rarely heard works, and was awarded the Naumburg Award in 1980. He also actively performed with other music ensembles in New England during the 1970s, including singing in the world premiere of Robert Schumann's Requiem with the New Hampshire Sinfonietta (1975) and performances of Harrison Birtwistle's Down by the Greenwood Side with Boston Musica Viva (1978). Maddalena made his first forray into opera as Mr. Gedge in a student production of Benjamin Britten's Albert Herring at the NEC in March 1975. In the summers of 1975, 1976, and 1977 he performed with the Wolf Trap Opera Company, a prestigious program for young opera singers at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts. His professional opera debut was made in February 1977 with the Boston Lyric Opera (BLO) during that company's first season as Allazim in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Zaide. He later returned to the BLO several more times during his career, performing such roles as John Sorel in Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul (1981), Albert (1981) in Jules Massenet's Werther, the Music Master in Richard Strauss' Ariadne auf Naxos (1982), Somarone in Hector Berlioz's B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict (1993), Don Alfonso in Cos√¨ fan tutte (2004), and Baron Duphol in La traviata (2006). In 1979 he starred in a production of George Frideric Handel's Atalanta at the American Repertory Theater under conductor Herbert von Karajan. In 1980 Maddalena created the title role in Tony Schemmer's pop opera Phaust at Harvard University's Sanders Theater under the baton of Philip Morehead. That same year he portrayed the role of Death in Gustav Holst's Savitri with Boston Cecilia. He sang as a soloist in several other performances with Boston Cecilia, including in concerts of Handel's Athalia (1982, Abner) and Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor (1983). In 1983 he performed the role of Abramane in the United States premiere of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Zoroastre with Boston Baroque (then known as Banchetto Musicale) at the Sanders Theater under conductor Martin Pearlman. He performed with the ensemble again in December 1984 as a soloist in Handel's Messiah for performances in both Boston and at New York City's Carnegie Hall. Working with Sellars and Adams In September 1980 Maddalena portrayed the title role in a controversial production of Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Palace Theatre in Manchester, New Hampshire with the New Hampshire Symphony Orchestra for the Monadnock Music Festival (MMF). The production used a modernized staging which was conceived by director Peter Sellars, just 23 years old at the time. It was the first professional opera directed by Sellars. While Opera News dubbed the production as \\"an act of artistic vandalism\\", The New York Times was more positive in its review, with critic Peter G. Davis hailing the staging as \\"remarkably stimulating and provocative\\" and stating that \\"Maddalena was an appropriately loathsome Don, and he sang the part with a fine, firmly modulated baritone.\\" The 1980 production of Don Giovanni marked the beginning of a long and fruitful artistic partnership between Sellars and Maddalena which continues to this day. In 1981 he sang the role of Idreno in the United States premiere of Joseph Haydn's Armida at the MMF in which Sellars staged the opera during the Vietnam War. Other roles Maddalena performed in Sellars productions included Guglielmo in Cos√¨ fan tutte (1984, Castle Hill Festival and 1986, Pepsico Summerfare), Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro (1984, MMF and 1988, Pepsico Summerfare), and Achilla in Handel's Giulio Cesare (1987). In 1987 Maddalena entered the annals of opera history when he created the role of President Richard Nixon at the premiere of John Adams's opera Nixon in China at the Houston Grand Opera. Directed and initially conceived by Sellars, the opera was belittled by many critics at its premiere. However, the opera's enduring popularity has since changed critical evaluation of the work, and it is now considered a classic. Maddalena, who physically resembles Nixon, has become closely associated with the part he created in the premiere. Soon after the Houston premiere, he performed the role at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, De Nederlandse Opera and the Washington National Opera. He has subsequently performed the role at the Edinburgh International Festival (1988), the Los Angeles Opera (1990), (fee for article) the Maison de la Culture di Bobigny, Paris (1991), the Frankfurt Opera (1992), the Adelaide Festival (1992), the English National Opera (2000 and 2006), and the Greek National Opera (2007) among others. He sang Nixon for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 2011, and most recently performed the role with the Lyric Opera of Kansas City in March 2012. Maddalena teamed up with Sellars again for performances in two more world premieres of operas by composer John Adams: creating the parts of the Captain in The Death of Klinghoffer (1991, La Monnaie)Michael Steinberg. \\"The Death of Klinghoffer\\", The John Adams Reader, pg 127 and Jack Hubbard in Doctor Atomic (2005, San Francisco Opera). He subsequently recorded the role of the Captain and sang that role in productions at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Op√©ra National de Lyon, the San Francisco Opera, and at the Vienna Festival. Other work Maddalena has created roles in several other world premieres, including Hobson in David Carlson's The Midnight Angel (1993, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis), a variety of roles in Stewart Wallace's Harvey Milk (1995, Houston Grand Opera), Art Kamen in Wallace's The Bonesetter's Daughter (2008, San Francisco Opera), the title role in Kirke Mechem‚Äôs John Brown (2008, Lyric Opera of Kansas City), Howard Joyce in Paul Moravec's The Letter (2009, Santa Fe Opera), and Clotaldo in Lewis Spratlan‚Äôs Life is a Dream (2010, Santa Fe Opera). In 2001 he performed the role of Gideon March in Mark Adamo's Little Women in Houston, a performance which was broadcast live on PBS's Great Performances. In October 2010 he sang the role of Simon Powers in the premiere of Tod Machover's science fiction opera Death and the Powers at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. In 1995 Maddalena sang in the premiere of Elliot Goldenthal's Fire Water Paper: A Vietnam Oratorio and also recorded that work with cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

Its range spans from western Europe into western Siberia. The species was introduced recently (circa 1975) in the eastern areas of Canada and has spread farther south and west into the United States.Holland, John M. 2002. ‚ÄúCarabid Beetles: Their Ecology, Survival and Use in Agroecosystems.‚Äù The Agroecology of Carabid Beetles As a member of the family Carabidae, Broscus cephalotes is generally considered beneficial to humans due to its predatory habits. Their varied diet often includes crop pests and other small organisms. Description Broscus cephalotes has a dull black coloration, without any metallic hue, and it can be quite large: between 16 and 23 mm. The morphology of the beetle is similar to other beetles in its family. B. cephalotes is flightless and flatter than many other species of Carabidae, which helps it hide in close spaces (e.g. crevices under stones or under bark).Ingerson-mahar, Joseph. 2002 ‚ÄúRelating Diet and Morphology in Adult Carabid Beetles.‚Äù The Agroecology of Carabid Beetles. Body shape and presence or absence of the ability of flight can provide clues to diet of beetles, but does not provide conclusive evidence. Although mouth-parts are a better indicator of the type of food consumed by the beetle, the best method of determining the diet of a beetle is gut dissection. The asymmetric mandibles of B. cephalotes are blunt and twice as long as they are wide.Forsythe, Trevor G. 1982. ‚ÄúFeeding Mechanisms of Certain Ground Beetles‚Äù (Coleoptera: Carabidae). The Coleopterists Bulletin.: 36.1: 26-73 _The Coleopterists Society._ The mandibles are curved to a rounded point at the end, with the left mandible is slightly longer and wider than the right mandible. These mandibles are multi-purpose tools. The beetle uses them to create and maintain the tunnels in which they spend most of their lives. The opened mandibles can act as shovels or pull dirt and debris from the walls of their tunnels and deposit it outside the burrow. Additionally, the mandibles can act as shovels in the loose sand of the beetles‚Äô coastal habitat. Another critical use of the mandibles is in feeding, as discussed below. Feeding Broscus cephalotes are primarily carnivorous beetles; however they will consume a wide variety of food. They are generalists, and the adults do not discriminate much in what they consume.Hengeveld, R. 1980. ‚ÄúPolyphagy, Oligophagy, and Food Specialization in Ground Beetles‚Äù Netherlands Journal of Zoology 30(4): 564-584. A recent study showed that B. cephalotes in laboratory conditions will attack everything that runs across the opening of its burrow, though they preferred to attack and eat woodlice and ants.Mossakowski D. 2003. ‚ÄúFeeding and fighting behavior in Broscus cephalotes‚Äù (L.). Baltic J. Coleopterol. 3 (2): Some of what has been found in various beetles‚Äô digestive tract include: plant material and various types of insects: ants, wolf spiders, Aphididae, caterpillars, Diptera, Acarina, Bibionidae, Coleoptera, adult Lepidoptera, and Heteroptera. However, there has been no evidence of cannibalism in this species of beetle. The diet of the larvae of this family has not been as widely studied because the larvae spend their time in tunnels and are difficult to identify even when not hidden in the soil. Carabidae larvae are usually more carnivorous than adults and have a more restricted diet.Toft, Soren and Trine Bilde. 2002. ‚ÄúCarabid Diets and Food Value.‚Äù The Agroecology of Carabid Beetles. The limited diet may be due to their subterranean habitat and their small size. Additionally, the larvae of Carabidae beetle tend to be fluid feeders, regardless of their status as adults. B. cephalotes has two main methods to detect prey: tactile cues and olfactory cues. The olfactory cues, however, do not seem to be very specific, as the responses to the cue do not correspond strongly to preference of prey. The beetle, once in possession of its prey, holds the organism with its forelegs and tears off pieces of the organism to consume. The mandibles are used to tear open the cuticular structures of its meal and expose the soft tissue areas within the organism. Fluid is produced in the mouth during feeding that causes the discoloration of flesh and begins the digestive process. This fluid is composed of a variety of enzymes that begin the digestive process before the prey has entered the beetle‚Äôs digestive tract. Many samples of B. cephalotes were found to have sand in their digestive tract in addition to prey. Sand in the digestive tract may help the beetle grind up the tougher parts of the prey, although it has not yet been determined if the sand is ingested for this purpose. Habitat and habits B. cephalotes can be found all across temperate western and central Europe, extending into western Siberia. Specimens are usually found in the coastal regions, but can also be found more rarely inland. It generally can be found in the vegetated dunes on the coast, but prefers the more sparsely vegetated areas. The first appearance of B. cephalotes in North America was recorded in Nova Scotia in 1978.Larivi√®re, M.-C. and A. Larochelle 1989. First Records of Broscus cephalotes (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Broscini) for North America The Coleopterists Bulletin. 43.1:69-73. _The Coleopterists Society._ It seemed as though the species was well established in the area at the time, but still a relatively new arrival. The species is still confined to the eastern seaboard in North America and is less common than in Europe. B. cephalotes are mostly nocturnal, although they have been seen scurrying from one hiding place to another during the day. They hide during the day burrowed under logs and stones in loose, dry sand. They have been known to rest in groups, but no evidence points to that being the norm or anything but a matter of convenience. Their nocturnal lifestyle may be helpful in the acquisition of prey. As the beetles are active during the night, they can more easily capture prey that is diurnal. Nocturnal habits also reduce the number of predators active while the beetle is active. Most adults do not live through the winter, but the larvae develop during the winter months and emerge as adults in the spring and summer. Fighting in the species has been observed under artificial daylight, but the purpose of the fighting has not been determined. Fighting could be over resources like food, burrows, or mates. Reproduction and life cycle B. cephalotes breed in the early autumn, when the temperature is still warm and the air still dry. The eggs are deposited deep into the sandy soil during late summer and early autumn.Lindroth, Carl. 1985. The Carabidae (Coleoptera) of Fennoscandia and Denmark, Part 1 The site of oviposition is determined and prepared by the female beetle.Lovei, G. L., and K. D. Sunderland. 1996. ‚ÄúEcology and Behavior of Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae).‚Äù Annual Review of Entomology 41.1: 231-56. After the eggs are laid there is no parental care. The eggs hatch and the larvae develop in the tunnels during the winter and early spring. The larvae spend all their time below the surface, and consequently, are not well studied. The adult beetles emerge from the burrows in the late spring and early summer. All individuals generally emerge by early July.Matalin, Andrey. 2008. ‚ÄúEvolution of biennial life cycles in ground beetles.‚Äù 'Proceedings of the XIII European Carabidologists Meeting, Blagoevgrad, August 20‚Äì24, 2007', pp. 259-284. The period of reproduction generally spans from the end of July to mid-September, with the first larvae developing at the end of August. This can lead to some individuals developing on a one-year schedule and others developing on a two- year schedule. However, most die after their first year of life, and only reproduce once. Some specimens have been kept alive in laboratories for much longer than one year. In many beetles in this family, higher temperatures correlate to long reproductive periods and more eggs laid. Lower temperatures correlate to a shortened reproductive period and fewer eggs produced, despite the presence of an abundance of food. However, laboratory settings may give a skewed view of the reality of these beetles. There have not been comprehensive field studies on effect of temperature on reproductive success in carabid beetles of any type. Predators Birds are major predators of B. cephalotes, which use invertebrates to provide a protein-rich diet for their chicks. Some species of corvid and raptor birds eat carabid beetles as adults as well. Farmland birds depend heavily on carabids for food. Small mammals, amphibians and reptiles may also prey on B. cephalotes. Mammals, such as hedgehogs, shrews and mice inhabiting areas far from crops often consume these beetles. The beetles constitute a significant (20%) portion of these mammals‚Äô diet in June. This is primarily due to the beetles‚Äô life cycle, as they are most numerous in June. Humans and Broscus cephalotes In Britain, there has been a large reduction in the area covered by heath lands over the past 150 years. This reduction has been largely due to human activity; expanding industrial and residential areas have reduced the available and habitable heath land.Telfer, Mark G. and Brian C. Eversham. 1996. ‚ÄúEcology and conservation of heathland Carabidae in eastern England‚Äù Ann. Zool. Fennici 33: 133-138. While the heath lands are not known for diversity in flora, the invertebrate fauna in the region rely on the heath lands for survival. The remaining habitats in Britain are cut through and connected by roadways. There has been concern in the past that roadways disrupt the habitats of B. cephalotes and that the roads interfere with breeding. However, recent studies show that the sandy roadsides can link habitats and create refuges for the beetles. This leads to greater survival and reproduction in the ground beetle population. It is in farmers‚Äô interests for these beetles to continue surviving and reproducing successfully. B. cephalotes have been recognized as useful to farmers since the early nineteenth century. Many of their prey fall under the category of crop pests, such as aphids, slugs and dipteran eggs. However, farmers have only recently begun to consider these beetles in their crop rotations. Renewed interest in the role of beetles in crop rotations can partially be explained by the decreased value of crops and pressure from environmental groups use more environmentally friendly farming practices. Most of the more recently adopted farming practices (e.g. selective insecticides and augmenting non-crop habitat) will affect the population of ground beetles, but not immediately. Pest management effects will not be noticeable until more extensive measures are implemented.

Sir David Henry KBE was responsible for negotiations on behalf of the Henry Family that saw the creation of New Zealand Forest Products. The company continued to expand following World War II and was a large-scale manufacturer of structural timber, board and other packaging products. Following the construction of the Kinleith Mill at Tokoroa in 1953, NZFP became a substantial manufacturer of pulp and paper products. The company owned some 250,000 hectares of forestry plantations, with a further 300,000 hectares under long-term Crown leases from the New Zealand Government. The company and its tenacious Managing Director were consumed by a long, drawn-out battle to create a vertically integrated forestry and pulp and paper industry based in the North Island. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, he clashed frequently with government agencies designed to limit the licensing of specific industries. He also had to face the hard realities of potential competition from Tasman Pulp and Paper (today, a division of Norwegian forestry major, Norske Skog) which, with A. R. [Pat] Entrican, head of the State Forestry Service and considerable government financial backing, was positioned to take advantage of new international markets in the post-war economy. Despite this government-backed obstacle, the company developed all of its own infrastructure independently inclusive of company housing, water supply, railway lines, transport networks, and plant machinery. The result of this was that, by the 1960s, New Zealand Forest Products was the largest single manufacturer in New Zealand - producing cardboard, kraft paper, wrappings, and multiwall bags, to newsprint, fine printing papers, stationery, and specialty papers. Beyond the fact of being New Zealand's largest private enterprise, New Zealand Forest Products had a profound effect on New Zealand's post-war economy which had verged on economic depression by replacing the once mighty British Empire-developed triumvirate of wool, meat and dairy, with a forestry industry that was focussed on providing product not only to well-established Commonwealth export markets but to then-new emerging New Zealand trade destinations such as Japan and the United States. This marked a significant change in the psyche of post-war New Zealand industry. By the time of his death, Sir David Henry had put New Zealand on the map in terms of a viable, vertically integrated, forest-based operation. As the company magazine, March of Pine [1951-64], suggested after the opening of the Kinleith processing complex: ‚ÄúWhat has been happening at Kinleith may well prove as important in the long run to New Zealand‚Äüs economy as the first shipment of refrigerated beef from Dunedin in 1882.‚Äù Another member of the family, Jack Henry, was the Director of the Kinleith Division and the Forests Division. He pioneered new methods in silviculture which saw the company achieve major efficiency gains that turned NZFP into one of the largest forestry companies globally. He was the last Henry to sit on the board of NZFP retiring in 1986 as corporate raiders circled. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, NZFP was the target of several takeover attempts including a joint bid by Goodman Fielder (the Australian/New Zealand flour miller) and Watties Industries (the New Zealand canned food manufacturer) given its strong asset profile. This joint bid failed, but was soon followed by another unsuccessful $1.9 billion bid by Fletcher Challenge in 1985. NZFP was successful in defending itself against these local corporations, however, in 1986 the company was finally acquired by the Australian conglomerate Elders Resources, a subsidiary of Elders IXL (the vehicle of Australian corporate raider, John Elliot). Elliot mounted a successful hostile takeover that valued the company at $3.0 billion and the company became known post-acquisition as Elders NZFP Corporation. Following a bitter battle over the bid, the Henry family agreed to sell to the Australian raider and this effectively ended the Henry family's 110 years of involvement in New Zealand industry. The assets of NZFP continue to operate to this day. Following the collapse of Elders NZFP in 1988 following the stockmarket crash, the assets were purchased by Carter Holt Harvey (CHH), another smaller New Zealand forestry company. The purchase of the NZFP assets tripled the size of CHH and boosted its revenues by 60% to top NZ$7.0 billion, then a record for any New Zealand company.

Independent Troops of Horse, 1678‚Äì1682 The regiment had its origin in three Independent Troops of Horse established on 23 September 1678, each with four officers and sixty men.Dalton, Scots Army The first troop to be issued with its royal warrant was commanded by the veteran Cavalier James Ogilvy, 2nd Earl of Airlie and his nephew Adam Urquhart of Meldrum, who had previously been the officers of the Lord Chancellor's Troop of the Life Guard, disbanded two years earlier. The second troop was led by two young noblemen, James Home, 5th Earl of Home and the Master of Ross. The third commission went to Captain John Graham of Claverhouse, a man of less exalted rank, but a highly regarded officer of the Dutch Life Guards, who had gained the powerful patronage of the king's brother, the Duke of York.Linklater, \\"Graham, John\\" Although Scotland had lent military assistance to both sides in the ongoing Franco-Dutch War, the Independent Troops seem to have been raised for garrison duty in Scotland,Ross, \\"Scottish Regiments Disbanded to guard against the perceived threat of the Covenanters ‚Äì committed Presbyterians who rejected any government that did not obey their religious principles, but were perhaps further radicalized by state repression. In 1679, they formed a small army and defeated an outnumbered Claverhouse at the Battle of Drumclog, but the Independent Troops played a key role in the repulse of their assault on Glasgow. Subsequently, tensions emerged between the Independent Troops and Lieutenant-General Tam Dayell, the senior professional soldier in Scotland, who became commander in chief before the year's end. It seems that Dayell did not get on well with Airlie or Graham,Patton, \\"Ogilvy, James\\" and tactically, he seems to have favoured the dragoons, companies of mounted infantry armed with muskets and polearms, clad in plain hodden grey uniforms. In 1681, Dayell had the dragoon companies combined as a regiment under his own command, the famous Scots Greys, in response, Captain Graham seems to have proposed to his patron the Duke of York that the Independent Troops of Horse should be similarly re-organized into a unified regiment. Regiment of Horse, 1682‚Äì1689 On Christmas Day 1682, King Charles informed the Scottish Privy Council that \\"Our Three (formerly Independent) Troops of Horse\\" were \\"to be formed a Regt. of Horse\\", with John Graham of Claverhouse as Colonel. A fourth troop was added, funded by reducing the strength of each unit to around fifty men, and by demobilizing two hundred infantrymen in the foot regiments. An attempt to pay Claverhouse's salary as colonel by dismissing all the staff officers of the Scots Greys was not successful, and deepened the existing hostility between the Horse and the Dragoons. In 1684, two more troops were added, raised from the House of Douglas and their followers. The troop commanders now included two Earls, a Lord of Parliament and a Duke's son, a concentration of aristocracy unparalleled in Scotland's other regiments at that time. Colonel Graham was still only a laird, but in 1685, his patron the Duke of York became king. As a sign of royal favour, the regiment was renamed on 21 December 1685 as the King's Own Regiment of Horse, sometimes subsequently referred to as the Royal Regiment of Horse. Soon after, the regiment was exempted from the purview of the Inspector of the Forces alongside the Life Guard, suggesting that like the similarly named unit in England, it shared some of the prestige of the Household troops. Revolution and Rebellion In 1688, the Scottish army marched south to defend King James against a Dutch invasion, led by his son-in-law William of Orange. Claverhouse was ennobled as Viscount Dundee, and the Royal Regiment of Horse and the Royal Scots were willing to put up a fight, but the king was discouraged by large numbers of military and political defections, and London was occupied by Dutch troops; English resistance collapsed, and James agreed to go into exile, leaving the country on 23 December.Morris, Claverhouse In the confusion, it is not entirely clear what happened to the King's Own Regiment of Horse. Claverhouse remained firmly committed to King James, but his second-in- command, the Earl of Drumlanrig went over decisively to William of Orange, and was rewarded with command of the Scottish Troop in his Life Guard.Young, \\"Douglas, James\\" In spite of the defections among the Scottish soldiers and politicians in England, James still remained in theory as King north of the Border, where loyal commanders controlled the main fortresses, so Claverhouse and one of his troop commanders, the Earl of Balcarres, resolved to ride north in February 1689 ‚Äì almost certainly accompanied by Claverhouse's own troop, and perhaps by other elements of the regiment. In March, Claverhouse's troop acted as his bodyguard at the Convention of Estates, dramatically riding out of Edinburgh with him when it became clear that the Parliament would accept William as king; in April, they formally took up arms in the name of King James. William III had appointed Charles Douglas, 2nd Earl of Selkirk as the new commander of the King's Own Regiment of Horse, and planned to send them to fight in Ireland; but any meaningful force of troopers that remained seems to have drifted away. Some perhaps joined their old Colonel (the Royal Scots also attempted to march north), but a number may have followed Drumlanrig into the Williamite Life Guard, while others simply laid down their arms.

Transposon tagging has been used with several species to isolate genes. Even without knowing the nature of the specific genes, the process can still be used. In plants By molecular separation of transposons, from a cell nucleus, the cloning is enabled for genes which contain the transposons. By using transposon tagging, researchers have been able to add genetic elements from maize (corn) and Antirrhinum into some other species (such as tobacco, aspen and others). A gene responsible for a particular phenotype can be cloned within a given species, when movement is accompanied by the presence of a mutant phenotype.

Scientists discovered that more than 90% of coastal p≈çhutukawa stands had been eliminated. The tree had entirely disappeared in many areas along the west coast of Northland. Disturbed by these findings, staff from Northland Department of Conservation and New Zealand Forest Products now Carter Holt Harvey) came up with the idea of creating a community-based project to help p≈çhutukawa. In 1990 the Project Crimson Trust came to life. Today Project Crimson is a leading environmental organisation, with support from sponsors and the help of thousands of New Zealanders around the country. These people believe that p≈çhutukawa, rƒÅtƒÅ, and many other native trees in New Zealand, are an essential part of who New Zealanders are. Project Crimson has made impressive progress re-establishing p≈çhutukawa and rƒÅtƒÅ nationwide by planting over 300,000 trees, coordinating and supporting a wide range of maintenance activities, scientific research, possum control programmes and public education. From 2011‚Äì2015, Project Crimson co-sponsored Living Legends, a reforestation program.

He is a general in the Yemeni Army and was the commander of the northwestern military district and the 1st Armoured Division. He played a leading role in the creation of the General People's Congress. He was appointed as a Deputy Supreme Commander of Yemeni Armed Forces on February 22, 2016. \\"Yemen's Hadi appoints top general in bid to rally tribes\\". After that President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi appointed him Vice President of Yemen on April 3, 2016. This assignment created a large controversy between objectors and supporters, but most of them considered it a strong message from President Hadi and the Saudi-led Coalition for the intention of using the military to regain control of the Capital. This was possible because of the flexible and strong relationship Mohsen had with figures from the tribes surrounding the Capital, Sana'a, and some military commanders who will be loyal to the side of legitimacy because of this assignment. Early life and education Born in Sanhan, a southeastern suburb of Sana'a, he received his primary and secondary education there. He is not a member of the al-Ahmar immediate ruling family of the Hashid tribe. =Military training= Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar joined the 4th Military brigade of the Army of the Kingdom of Yemen in 1961. He was promoted as a first lieutenant in the Mechanized forces of the Army of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1968, and participated in the North Yemen Civil War from 1962‚Äì1967, fighting on the Republican side. Then he joined the Yemen Military Academy in 1971 and got his bachelor's degree in 1974. After his graduation from Yemen Military Academy, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He joined Al-Tholaya Institute in Taiz and got a certificate of Battalions Leadership in 1969. He got his Ph.D. from Nasser Military Academy‚ÄìCairo in 1974. He continued to get promotions until he became a major general in 2007, A presidential decree issued by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel and he was subsequently appointed as the Deputy Supreme Commander of the Yemen Armed Forces on February 22, 2016.\\"Yemeni president sacks prime minister, appoints new senior team: state media\\", reuters.com,. Career =Political and military career= Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar started his military career in Al-Maghawir Brigade, as a leader of an infantry company in 1970, then he joined the 1st Armored Brigade and became a commander of a tank company in 1975, he became a commander of the independent 4th Tank battalion in 1977. He was close to Ali Abdullah Saleh since 1973, and when Saleh seized power in 1978, Mohsen was promoted to full colonel in 1979 and given command of one of the Armoured Brigade. In 1983 he became Chief of Staff of the 1st Armoured Division, as well as the command of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Armored Division. He became a commander of North-Western Military District on 8 January 1995. On 22 January 2001, he was appointed as a commander of 1st Armoured Division and North-Western Military District. He became a President's Advisor for Defence and Security Affairs on 10 April 2013. In 2004 President Ali Abdullah Saleh assigned him to lead the military operations against the Houthi militia. He served as a chief of the Local Council for Cooperative Development of Sanhan District ‚Äì Sana'a Governorate in 1975, for three sessions‚Äîeach one for a period of three years. In 1980 he was a member of the committee of National Dialogue that drafted the National Covenant which was considered the universal document for all political components that were subject to General People's Congress party. In 1980 Mohsen participated in establishing the General People's Congress party, chaired by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and he was a member of the Standing Committee of GPC for three consecutive sessions from 1980 to 1989. Afterwards he became a member of the Defense Committee of GPC party. Mohsen was a primary and effective member of the preparing committee for the Yemeni unification during the negotiation process, and he participated in the integration and restructuring of the Armed Forces of Yemen after unification. He was assigned as a Deputy Chief of joint Yemeni-Saudi Military Committee for addressing the security and military balance between the two countries, and resolving the border issues. Mohsen is known to have Salafi leanings and to support a more radical Islamic political agenda than Ali Abdullah Saleh. He has powerful supporters in Saudi Arabia and has aided the Saudis in establishing Wahhabi/Salafi institutions in the Zaydi heartland of Sa'dah creating internal tension. =Vice presidency= On April 3, 2016, President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi appointed Mohsen to the position of Vice President of Yemen. Mohsen has been serving the nation of Yemen in that capacity ever since. After he was appointed Vice President, he played an important role in activating the fighting fronts against the Houthis and Saleh, as well as supervising many battles including Marib, Midi, Taiz and Shabwah. In October 2017, Mohsen as Vice President of Yemen headed a meeting for the Security Taskforce, an offshoot of the Friends of Yemen Group that formed to lead the fight against terrorism in Yemen. The agenda of the meeting focused on the latest developments in the country and the progress of the task force's work. Since then, Ali Mohsen become the head of counter-terrorism group in Yemen that include the United States of America, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Mohsen shared with the group efforts in transferring expertise in security, military and intelligence fields to the ground and coordination for building military units to fight terrorism and clamp down on smugglers. =Business ventures= According to ambassador Thomas C. Krajeski, Mohsen was a major beneficiary of diesel smuggling and amassed a fortune in the smuggling of arms, food staples, and consumer products. Together with Sheikh Abdullah al Ahmar's sons and Ali Abdullah Saleh, were making millions working the diesel smuggling and black market, using military vehicles and National Security Bureau and Central Security Organization staff to move the fuel to markets in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. This accusations are absolutely denied by Mohsen: the favoritism and the smugglings operations was a common defect in the army units and the decision to fight that was under the authority of President Saleh\\", Mohsen pointed out. 2011 Revolution The massacre of (Friday of Dignity) occurred in the Square of Change in Sana'a which was the Square for protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh. After the demonstrators had finished Friday Prayer, masked gunmen began shooting at them for more than three hours. They killed about 45 demonstrators and wounded about 200. According to Human Rights Watch the number of dead may have reached 54 following injuries on those affected. Furthermore, about 40 of the injured persons were shot on the head, chest and other parts of upper body by semi- automatic weapons which were described by medical officials, lawyers and protesters as the work of skilled snipers. Relations between Saleh and Mohsen had reportedly soured years before the uprising due to his rivalries with two of the president's sons. This souring of relations led to an apparent attempt by President Saleh to kill Mohsen by asking Saudi Arabian military commanders to bomb an alleged rebel base which was in fact Mohsen's headquarters. On March 21, 2011, Mohsen said he would protect the anti-government Yemeni protesters, along with other top Yemeni army commanders, in a move that was later condemned as 'mutinous' by President Saleh. On December 19, 2012, Mohsen was effectively dismissed from his position by President Hadi as part of Hadi's efforts to restructure the military and remove the political and military elite remnant from former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule. The forces previously under Mohsen's command, most notably the First Armoured Division, were absorbed into the Defence Ministry. 2014 Houthi takeover of Sana'a On September 16, armed clashes broke out in northwest Sana'a between the Houthi militia and some army units led by Moshen. After four days of fighting, al-Ahmar moved toward the headquarters of Military Region VI (the previous First Armored Division, which Ahmar used to lead before he was dismissed and appointed to be an adviser to the president for defense and security affairs in 2012). He did not comply with the president's and defense minister's directives and he led the battles against the Houthis himself, in what was seen as a possible coup attempt. Mohsen did not achieve any victories, and in two days the Houthis were in control of most major government buildings in Sana'a, including the buildings of state television, state radio, the prime minister's office, the armed forces general command, the Ministry of Defense, the Central Bank of Yemen and Military Region VI. =Rumored exile= Following the Houthi takeover of the Yemeni capital Sana'a, it was rumored that Sadiq al-Ahmar, members of the al-Ahmar family and Hashid tribal elders fled Yemen to Saudi Arabia or Qatar. But Sadiq appeared in a videotape later in Sana'a and was still there. Mohsen was also believed to have sought refuge in either Saudi Arabia or Qatar. However, he noticed that the Saudi Embassy in Sana'a prepared a helicopter and coordinated his departure to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia following the Houthi ascension to power. His absence has seen his homes in the Hadda neighborhood of Sana'a seized by Houthi fighters. 2015 Yemeni Civil War After he left Yemen as a result of the Houthi takeover, Mohsen returned to Yemen to lead the military operation in Yemen's northern Hajjah Governorate in December 2015 and relocated his headquarters to Ma'rib Governorate in 2016. Since he was appointed Vice President in 2016, he has played an important role in activating the fighting fronts against the Houthis and Saleh, as well as supervising many battles including the Ma'rib campaign, the Battle of Port Midi, the Taiz campaign, and in Shabwah Governorate. Mohsen is in regular meetings and talks with the ambassadors of the USA, UK and the ten sponsor countries of the Gulf Initiative, followed by his successive statements supporting the peace talks held in Kuwait in April 2016.

Since 1999, she has been a professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Her main areas of interest are philosophy of mind, theory of knowledge and philosophy of language. The major part of her published work is concerned with the special status of conscious individuals and aims at developing a non- materialist account which avoids the weaknesses of traditional dualism. Phenomenal consciousness, identity of conscious beings through time and across possible worlds, and the active role of the subject in its doings are central themes of her research. Rational intuitions and phenomenological reflexion play a prominent role in her philosophical approach.

It visits 3 additional corners on average. The Klee‚ÄìMinty cube is a perturbation of the cube shown here. In mathematical optimization, the criss-cross algorithm is any of a family of algorithms for linear programming. Variants of the criss-cross algorithm also solve more general problems with linear inequality constraints and nonlinear objective functions; there are criss-cross algorithms for linear-fractional programming problems, quadratic- programming problems, and linear complementarity problems. Like the simplex algorithm of George B. Dantzig, the criss-cross algorithm is not a polynomial- time algorithm for linear programming. Both algorithms visit all 2D corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension D, the Klee‚ÄìMinty cube (after Victor Klee and George J. Minty), in the worst case. However, when it is started at a random corner, the criss-cross algorithm on average visits only D additional corners.The simplex algorithm takes on average D steps for a cube. : Thus, for the three-dimensional cube, the algorithm visits all 8 corners in the worst case and exactly 3 additional corners on average. History The criss- cross algorithm was published independently by Tamas Terlaky and and by Zhe- Min Wang; related algorithms appeared in unpublished reports by other authors. Comparison with the simplex algorithm for linear optimization vertex. The criss-cross algorithm considers bases that are not associated with vertices, so that some iterates can be in the interior of the feasible region, like interior-point algorithms; the criss-cross algorithm can also have infeasible iterates outside the feasible region. In linear programming, the criss-cross algorithm pivots between a sequence of bases but differs from the simplex algorithm of George Dantzig. The simplex algorithm first finds a (primal-) feasible basis by solving a \\"phase-one problem\\"; in \\"phase two\\", the simplex algorithm pivots between a sequence of basic feasible solutions so that the objective function is non-decreasing with each pivot, terminating when with an optimal solution (also finally finding a \\"dual feasible\\" solution). The criss- cross algorithm is simpler than the simplex algorithm, because the criss-cross algorithm only has one phase. Its pivoting rules are similar to the least- index pivoting rule of Bland. Bland's rule uses only signs of coefficients rather than their (real-number) order when deciding eligible pivots. Bland's rule selects an entering variables by comparing values of reduced costs, using the real-number ordering of the eligible pivots.Bland's rule is also related to an earlier least-index rule, which was proposed by Katta G. Murty for the linear complementarity problem, according to . Unlike Bland's rule, the criss- cross algorithm is \\"purely combinatorial\\", selecting an entering variable and a leaving variable by considering only the signs of coefficients rather than their real-number ordering. The criss-cross algorithm has been applied to furnish constructive proofs of basic results in real linear algebra, such as the lemma of Farkas. While most simplex variants are monotonic in the objective (strictly in the non-degenerate case), most variants of the criss- cross algorithm lack a monotone merit function which can be a disadvantage in practice. Description The criss-cross algorithm works on a standard pivot tableau (or on-the-fly calculated parts of a tableau, if implemented like the revised simplex method). In a general step, if the tableau is primal or dual infeasible, it selects one of the infeasible rows / columns as the pivot row / column using an index selection rule. An important property is that the selection is made on the union of the infeasible indices and the standard version of the algorithm does not distinguish column and row indices (that is, the column indices basic in the rows). If a row is selected then the algorithm uses the index selection rule to identify a position to a dual type pivot, while if a column is selected then it uses the index selection rule to find a row position and carries out a primal type pivot. Computational complexity: Worst and average cases The worst-case computational complexity of Khachiyan's ellipsoidal algorithm is a polynomial. The criss-cross algorithm has exponential complexity. The time complexity of an algorithm counts the number of arithmetic operations sufficient for the algorithm to solve the problem. For example, Gaussian elimination requires on the order of D3 operations, and so it is said to have polynomial time-complexity, because its complexity is bounded by a cubic polynomial. There are examples of algorithms that do not have polynomial-time complexity. For example, a generalization of Gaussian elimination called Buchberger's algorithm has for its complexity an exponential function of the problem data (the degree of the polynomials and the number of variables of the multivariate polynomials). Because exponential functions eventually grow much faster than polynomial functions, an exponential complexity implies that an algorithm has slow performance on large problems. Several algorithms for linear programming‚ÄîKhachiyan's ellipsoidal algorithm, Karmarkar's projective algorithm, and central-path algorithms‚Äîhave polynomial time-complexity (in the worst case and thus on average). The ellipsoidal and projective algorithms were published before the criss-cross algorithm. However, like the simplex algorithm of Dantzig, the criss-cross algorithm is not a polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. Terlaky's criss-cross algorithm visits all the 2D corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension D, according to a paper of Roos; Roos's paper modifies the Klee‚ÄìMinty construction of a cube on which the simplex algorithm takes 2D steps. Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits all 8 corners of the three-dimensional cube in the worst case. When it is initialized at a random corner of the cube, the criss-cross algorithm visits only D additional corners, however, according to a 1994 paper by Fukuda and Namiki. Trivially, the simplex algorithm takes on average D steps for a cube.More generally, for the simplex algorithm, the expected number of steps is proportional to D for linear-programming problems that are randomly drawn from the Euclidean unit sphere, as proved by Borgwardt and by Smale. Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits exactly 3 additional corners of the three-dimensional cube on average. Variants The criss-cross algorithm has been extended to solve more general problems than linear programming problems. =Other optimization problems with linear constraints= There are variants of the criss-cross algorithm for linear programming, for quadratic programming, and for the linear-complementarity problem with \\"sufficient matrices\\"; conversely, for linear complementarity problems, the criss-cross algorithm terminates finitely only if the matrix is a sufficient matrix. A sufficient matrix is a generalization both of a positive-definite matrix and of a P-matrix, whose principal minors are each positive. The criss-cross algorithm has been adapted also for linear- fractional programming. =Vertex enumeration= The criss-cross algorithm was used in an algorithm for enumerating all the vertices of a polytope, which was published by David Avis and Komei Fukuda in 1992. Avis and Fukuda presented an algorithm which finds the v vertices of a polyhedron defined by a nondegenerate system of n linear inequalities in D dimensions (or, dually, the v facets of the convex hull of n points in D dimensions, where each facet contains exactly D given points) in time O(nDv) and O(nD) space.The v vertices in a simple arrangement of n hyperplanes in D dimensions can be found in O(n2Dv) time and O(nD) space complexity. =Oriented matroids= The max-flow min-cut theorem states that the maximum flow through a network is exactly the capacity of its minimum cut. This theorem can be proved using the criss-cross algorithm for oriented matroids. The criss-cross algorithm is often studied using the theory of oriented matroids (OMs), which is a combinatorial abstraction of linear-optimization theory.The theory of oriented matroids was initiated by R. Tyrrell Rockafellar. : Rockafellar was influenced by the earlier studies of Albert W. Tucker and George J. Minty. Tucker and Minty had studied the sign patterns of the matrices arising through the pivoting operations of Dantzig's simplex algorithm. Indeed, Bland's pivoting rule was based on his previous papers on oriented- matroid theory. However, Bland's rule exhibits cycling on some oriented- matroid linear-programming problems. The first purely combinatorial algorithm for linear programming was devised by Michael J. Todd. Todd's algorithm was developed not only for linear-programming in the setting of oriented matroids, but also for quadratic-programming problems and linear-complementarity problems. Todd's algorithm is complicated even to state, unfortunately, and its finite-convergence proofs are somewhat complicated. The criss-cross algorithm and its proof of finite termination can be simply stated and readily extend the setting of oriented matroids. The algorithm can be further simplified for linear feasibility problems, that is for linear systems with nonnegative variables; these problems can be formulated for oriented matroids. The criss-cross algorithm has been adapted for problems that are more complicated than linear programming: There are oriented-matroid variants also for the quadratic-programming problem and for the linear-complementarity problem. Summary The criss-cross algorithm is a simply stated algorithm for linear programming. It was the second fully combinatorial algorithm for linear programming. The partially combinatorial simplex algorithm of Bland cycles on some (nonrealizable) oriented matroids. The first fully combinatorial algorithm was published by Todd, and it is also like the simplex algorithm in that it preserves feasibility after the first feasible basis is generated; however, Todd's rule is complicated. The criss-cross algorithm is not a simplex-like algorithm, because it need not maintain feasibility. The criss-cross algorithm does not have polynomial time-complexity, however. Researchers have extended the criss-cross algorithm for many optimization- problems, including linear-fractional programming. The criss-cross algorithm can solve quadratic programming problems and linear complementarity problems, even in the setting of oriented matroids. Even when generalized, the criss- cross algorithm remains simply stated.

Fairbairn as a version of the Fairbairn‚ÄìSykes fighting knife. The blade has a similar double-edged dagger profile, but is wider and more durable. It features a different handle, made most commonly of lexan plastic with adjustable lead weights which can change the knife's balance-point. Later models and some custom variants included weights made from pure Teflon, tungsten, stainless steel and aluminum. The blade profile was also changed from a V-grind to a convex, or \\"appleseed\\" profile. While this changed the overall effectiveness of the blade to puncture, cut and slice, it does not lend itself to be field sharpened by an inexperienced user. History While Applegate was a student of Fairbairn, he came up with a series of modifications to Fairbairn's Dagger and worked with Fairbairn on implementing them. Applegate first approached Randall Made Knives with their design. Bo Randall made a handful of prototypes based on his \\"Model 2 Dagger\\" and sent them to soldiers for field testing; they proved not to be popular with the troops and Randall declined to produce the knife beyond the original prototypes. Applegate took the design to custom knifemaker Bill Harsey, Jr. who made several prototypes for Al Mar Knives.

J. Duffin and A. C. Schaeffer in 1941. It states that if f : mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{R}^+ is a real- valued function taking on positive values, then for almost all alpha (with respect to Lebesgue measure), the inequality : left  alpha - frac{p}{q} right  < frac{f(q)}{q} has infinitely many solutions in co-prime integers p,q with q > 0 if and only if : sum_{q=1}^infty f(q) frac{varphi(q)}{q} = infty, where varphi(q) is the Euler totient function. A higher-dimensional analogue of this conjecture was resolved by Vaughan and Pollington in 1990.Harman (2002) p. 69 Progress The implication from the existence of the rational approximations to the divergence of the series follows from the Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemma.Harman (2002) p. 68 The converse implication is the crux of the conjecture. There have been many partial results of the Duffin‚ÄìSchaeffer conjecture established to date. Paul Erd≈ës established in 1970 that the conjecture holds if there exists a constant c > 0 such that for every integer n we have either f(n) = c/n or f(n) = 0.Harman (1998) p. 27 This was strengthened by Jeffrey Vaaler in 1978 to the case f(n) = O(n^{-1}).Harman (1998) p. 28 More recently, this was strengthened to the conjecture being true whenever there exists some varepsilon > 0 such that the series :sum_{n=1}^infty left(frac{f(n)}{n}right)^{1 + varepsilon} varphi(n) = infty . This was done by Haynes, Pollington, and Velani.A. Haynes, A. Pollington, and S. Velani, The Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture with extra divergence, arXiv, (2009), https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1234 In 2006, Beresnevich and Velani proved that a Hausdorff measure analogue of the Duffin‚ÄìSchaeffer conjecture is equivalent to the original Duffin‚ÄìSchaeffer conjecture, which is a priori weaker.

A standout player in high school, she received a Gatorade Player of the Year award, was named Miss New York Basketball and earned a spot on the 1999 USA Today All-USA high school basketball team. Heavily recruited by colleges, Kaczmarski eventually enrolled at UCLA and played one season for their women's basketball team. Kaczmarski then enrolled at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Afterward, she had brief stints with two WNBA teams, the New York Liberty and the Los Angeles Sparks. In 2011, she became a color commentator for basketball telecasts. Kaczmarski's high school career and college recruitment were chronicled in the documentary film Running Down a Dream.  High School career  A Long Island native, Kaczmarski first gained national recognition at Longwood High School, where she was named women's high school basketball Freshman of the Year by ESPN RISE. She led the team at Longwood to a 10-2 record and a three-way tie for the league title before falling in the quarterfinals of the Class A Playoffs against Walt Whitman High School. Kaczmarski, also known by her nickname \\"Kaz\\" subsequently had a brief stint playing for Christ The King Regional High School alongside future University of Connecticut and WNBA star Sue Bird. She played most of her high school basketball at Sachem High School, where she set a Long Island women's high school basketball record with 2,583 career points. Kaz played her first varsity basketball game at Sachem as an eighth grader. She led Sachem to the state title as an eighth-grader. She Helped lead Sachem to state title over Lockport in March 1995.. During her high school career, she was named both Gatorade Player of the Year and Miss New York Basketball and was a selection to the 1999 USA Today All-USA high school basketball team. In the Suffolk final in 1999 as a senior, she had 45 points, 18 rebounds, seven assists and six steals in a win over previously undefeated Bellport. Highly recruited, she decided to attend UCLA. One of the last games she played as a high school player was the Women's Basketball Coaches Association All- America game. Kaczmarski's high school career and entrance into college basketball were documented in the 1999 film Running Down a Dream.  College and WNBA career  At UCLA, Kaczmarski started at point guard early in the 1999-2000 season due to an injury to regular starter Erica Gomez. Eventually, she was shifted to the shooting guard position. Kaczmarski faced some early season struggles,but improved later in the season, ending with an average of 11.7 points per game and having set a school record by hitting seven three pointers during a game at Washington State University. Kaczmarski was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week during the final week of the regular season and was a selection to the conference all-freshman team. Kaczmarski did not return to UCLA for her sophomore year as she had been suffering from lyme disease, as well as plantar fasciitis due to an injury she suffered at trials for the USA Basketball World University Games team.Kaczmarski returned to school at the State University of New York at Stonybrook, but never returned to college basketball. In 2003, Kaczmarski was drafted in the 3rd round of the 2003 WNBA Draft as the final pick of her hometown WNBA team, the New York Liberty. She was unaware that she had been drafted until a friend called to congratulate her. Kaczmarski did not make the Liberty's regular season roster but started playing professionally in Austria and Greece. She then had a brief stint with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2005.  Post-playing career  Kaczmarski pursued a career in healthcare and graduated from Stony Brook University with a degree in health science. In 2011, she returned to basketball as an analyst for the Cablevision channel MSG Varsity and for the St. John's Red Storm. The following year, Kaczmarski became the first female athlete to have her jersey retired by Sachem High School and only the fifth ever. As of October 2020, she ranks third for most career points scored in Long Island women's high school basketball.

Kesselring was assigned to supporting Army Group Centre, which was to capture Minsk, Smolensk and Moscow. Kesselring was given Fliegerkorps VIII (a specialised ground attack Corps, commanded by tactical specialist Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen), Fliegerkorps II (commanded by Bruno Loerzer) and the 1st Anti- Aircraft Corps (1st AA Corps under Walther von Axthelm). Army Group South was supported by Luftflotte 4, containing Fliegerkorps V (under Robert Ritter von Greim) and Fliegerkorps IV (under Kurt Pflugbeil). The Air Fleet and Army Group were responsible for capturing Kiev, the Crimea and the Caucasus oilfields. Army Group North was supported by Luftflotte 1, and Luftflotte 5. Luftflotte 5 conducted operations in the Arctic near Murmansk. Luftflotte 1 supported operations in the Baltic Sea, Baltic States and near, in and over Leningrad. Luftflotte 1 contained Fliegerkorps I under the command of Helmuth F√∂rster.Plocher 1968, pp. 9, 28-29. =Other Axis air forces= The Romanian Air Force was considered weak by the OKL, and therefore unlikely to play a great role in the ground fighting. Far more attention was given by the OKW to training and preparing the Romanian Army. Hitler, on 18 June 1941, declared that the primary mission of the Romanian air arm was to defend Romania and the Romanian oilfields. Only when those forces were sufficient, could they divert the remaining forces to ground support operations for Barbarossa. On 21 June 1941, it possessed a balanced fleet of 53 Squadrons; 11 bomber (five modern), 17 fighter (nine modern), 15 reconnaissance, six liaison, two flying boat, one transport and one air ambulance unit. On the 22 June, there was 160 fighters and 82 bombers in service. Total strength amounted to 380 aircraft. Only 30 of the Romanian fighters were Bf 109s, of the E model.Statiev 2002, pp. 1091-1092. However, this small force did not remain inferior in numbers for along. Despite a weak inter-war economy, the aircraft industry was run very efficiently, and they were able to produce some very capable aircraft; such as the IAR 37 and IAR 39. Unlike the army that stagnated, it was able to garner the cream of the Romanian officer corps. With the right support, organisation and modern equipment, it was able to grow in number and match its enemies in quality. In air defence and ground support operations it performed well, but failed in strategic bomber and naval operations owing to a lack of doctrine.Statiev 2002, p. 1112. Within a few weeks of Barbarossa beginning, it was able to put up 1,061 aircraft, including 400 trainers.Statiev 2002, p. 1093. The modern combat aircraft were focused into one unified Air Combat Command, or GAL (Gruparea Aeriana Lupta), while the obsolete types were given the Romanian Fourth Army, operating under the German Army Group South.Statiev 2002, pp. 1093, 1097. =Soviet= Organisation Since 1935, Soviet military aviation had been divided between the army (VVS KA) and the navy (VVS VMF). The VVS KA had been split into four different organisations owing to faulty conclusions drawn from the Winter War. Owing to a lack of coordination in close support operations with the Red Army, the entire VVS KA was subordinated to the field armies. The existence of too many different branches under separate commands in Soviet air power caused coordination problems (made worse by Axis bombing during Barbarossa). Most Soviet bomber units could not coordinate with fighter aviation, consequently they did not have fighter escort for long periods.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 134. The total strength of the VVS amounted to 61 divisions; 18 fighter, nine bomber and 34 mixed. Five brigades were also included. The Front Air Forces were divided into Districts (later 'Fronts') and the home defence, the PVO. This element had 40.5 per cent of the Soviet air strength. The Army Air Forces comprised 43.7 per cent of the VVS' strength. The liaison squadrons were a collection of individual squadrons assigned to different army corps of the ground army (KAE).

Homologs of sRNA-Xcc1 are found in a few bacterial strains belonging to alpha- proteobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria, and delta- proteobacteria. In Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, sRNA-Xcc1 is encoded by an integron gene cassette and is under the positive control of the virulence regulators HrpG and HrpX.  Origin and phylogenetic distribution  sRNA-Xcc1 is encoded by a gene cassette in the integron of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and homologs of sRNA-Xcc1 are frequently found in integron gene cassettes cloned from uncultured bacterium, it is possible that sRNA-Xcc1 is originally captured by integrons from natural environments. sRNA- Xcc1 homologs are found in a few taxonomically far related strains across alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria but not in close related bacteria, implying that sRNA-Xcc1 is transferred via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). sRNA-Xcc1 homologous gene are found located on Tn5542, a transposon carried by the plasmid pHMT112, indicating that the horizontal transfer of sRNA-Xcc1 is realized by means of transposons and/or plasmids.  Potential biological function  The expression of sRNA-Xcc1 is under the positive control of the two important virulence regulators HrpG and HrpX of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, indicating that sRNA-Xcc1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of the pathogen.

With the opening of Japan to the West in the Meiji era, the Japanese wooden structure was replaced with a permanent building that was constructed out of brick and mortar in the Western Renaissance style in 1895. This structure was enlargened by the 1920s with a pillared porch added to the front. The old theatre was destroyed during the Bombing of Nagoya in World War II. The new structure was constructed in the 1970s. A number of curtains, called doncho, were designed for the theatre. The artist Tamako Kataoka designed one of the curtains called \\"Flowers at Mount Fuji\\" (ÂØåÂ£´„Å´ÁåÆËä±), which was sponsored by Matsuzakaya.http://www.misonoza.co.jp/wp/?p=520http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASGCT6W6PGCTOIPE02S.html Downstairs there are a number of restaurants open for customers during the break.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82305 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Partridge in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Partridge was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Partridge included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1960, Point Partridge was assigned a homeport of Jonesport, Maine, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Partridge was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Partridge was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the Rung Sat Special Zone.Kelley, p 5-450Larzelere, p 80 Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board. In February 1966 Operation Jackstay was conceived. The operation was a plan to deny food and water to the Viet Cong (VC) hidden in the Rung Sat Special Zone by cutting off resupply junks that had to cross the So√†i R·∫°p River.Scotti, p 179 The interdiction efforts depended on using boats that were heavily armed, highly maneuverable and had a shallow draft; all characteristics of the Point Class cutter.Larzelere, p 80 Some of the Squadron One cutters were assigned in March 1966 to the operation and began 24-hour patrols on 10 March. The operation ended on 6 April; however, Point Partridge remained on the river patrol and had several contacts with VC supply junks during April and May 1966.Larzelere, p 83 From 1 to 6 May she was involved every night with enemy junks or attacks from the shoreline.Larzelere, p 83 During the rest of the month she managed to capture two junks; one loaded with weapons and the other containing of rice.Scotti, p 170Tulich, p 6 In early 1970, Point Partridge and Point Jefferson acting as a team made over 300 boardings.

Preparations for the railroad bed had made it as far as Wartime by 1914 and resulted in a few buildings being built. The outbreak of the First World War occurred at this time so the town was named Wartime. The rails were laid in 1915 and the post office opened that same year and operated until 1990.

Its history goes back to 's acquisition of in 1988. In 1995, Nicolas Industrie joined the group, followed by in 2004 and TII India, which is represented by the brand Tiiger, in 2015. Transporter Industry International is the global market leader and known for transports on behalf of NASA, for example.  History  one of the first low- bed trailers of Scheuerle Otto Rettenmaier, founder of Transporter Industry International In 1988, Otto Rettenmaier acquired one of the oldest and internationally leading manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles. The German company (Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik) was experiencing economic difficulties. Rettenmaier had already been active as an entrepreneur: He expanded his parents' mill business to become the world market leader in the production of wood fibers (cellulose). After the successful restructuring of Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik, Rettenmaier bought the French competitor Nicolas Industrie in 1995, which also produced heavy-duty vehicles. To create the legal and organizational conditions for further growth, a holding company called Transporter Industry International was established. This was also intended to illustrate the global market position. The subsidiaries themselves retained their regional character and continued to operate independently, but cooperated in sales, for example. In 2004, Rettenmaier was given the opportunity for further expansion. Due to the insolvency of , the subsidiary (Kamag Transporttechnik) specialized in smaller industrial vehicles and modular transporters had to be sold. With the takeover and integration into the holding company, Rettenmaier completed the product range of Transporter Industry International. Scheuerle, Nicolas, and Kamag developed joint products for high demanding projects. All three companies set world records in terms of the loads to be transported and in other areas. In 2015, Transporter Industry International acquired the civilian sector of the Indian trailer manufacturer Tratec, thus securing its first local presence outside Europe, with access to emerging markets in Asia; subsequently, the company was renamed.  Holding  Transporter Industry International operates as a private limited company (Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung) with its headquarters in Heilbronn, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. There are manufacturing facilities in Germany, France and India, service and sales offices in China and Moscow, a production sites in United States. It is fully owned by the Rettenmaier family holding. The management consists of Otto Rettenmaier, Susanne Rettenmaier, and Gerald Karch. In addition to the parent company (TII Group), there is a joint venture for sales and customer services (TII Sales) of all divisions, operating as a private limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).  Divisions  = Scheuerle = Lore antenna transporter manufactured by Scheuerle Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik was founded in 1869 and is headquartered in Pfedelbach, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The company invented the modern low-bed trailer concept in 1949. Numerous other innovations followed, for example in the field of hydraulic and electric four-way steering. In 1960, Scheuerle achieved international attention with the relocation of historic Abu Simbel temples in Egypt. Today, the portfolio includes self-propelled modular transporters, modular and compact vehicles for road transportation, as well as power boosters, for example. Besides, there are various services for maintenance and training. = Nicolas = Nicolas Industrie is headquartered in Champs-sur- Yonne, Auxerre, France. The company was founded in 1855 and therefore has the longest history of all Transporter Industry International subsidiaries. Its first patent covers wheel motors and dates back to 1884. Nicolas developed the modern heavy-duty transporters with pendulum axles. Today, the company's product and service range are almost identical to Scheuerle. = Kamag = Kamag Transporttechnik was founded in 1969 and is headquartered in Ulm, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Its primary goal was to shift heavy transports to the road. Today, Kamag develops and produces specialized transporters and other modular vehicles for a wide range of applications. Space Shuttle Endeavour on Kamag transport modules Solid Rocket Motor transporter vehicle manufactured by Kamag NASA has been a customer of Kamag Transporttechnik since the year 1979. The company provides vehicles to move rockets, boosters, and satellite payloads. The Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) transporter, for example, moved the Space Shuttle segments between refurbishment and storage facilities on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the Vehicle Assembly Building. Payload Canister Transporters (PCT) moved payload canisters between space shuttle payload processing facilities, the vertical processing facility, and the launch pad. = Tiiger = Since 2015, Transporter Industry International builds and distributes heavy transportation equipment in Bawal, Haryana, India. The most important product of Tiiger (formerly TII India) is the Extender, a robust and maintenance-friendly telescopic semi-trailer, which is suitable for the transport of bulky loads such as bridge sections and wind turbine blades.

The hamlet is located at along Highway 44 approximately southwest of the City of Saskatoon. History The first settlers arrived in the area around 1907. The settlement of the region was eventually speeded up by the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1913. The first school in the district of Hughton was built 6 miles east, while around 1910 a second school was built nearer to the future town site, about 1 mile south east. A post office was opened on the homestead John G.Ritchie in July 1911 and named Stoford. The Office was moved to the town site by F.A.Cameron in April 1914. After the CNOR's arrival in 1913 a town site was hurriedly settled and quickly counted an assortment of businesses ranging from a 3-story hotel, the station, a Union Bank, stores, elevators, the restaurant, a lumber yard, a butcher, a blacksmith and a barber shop/poolroom to name a few. By 1916 there was a curling rink and skating rink, baseball field and later still a hall and tennis court. Incorporated as a village from its initial conception in 1913, the population of Hughton grew from 80 residents in 1916 to 111 in 1926. According to Wrigley's community directory of Saskatchewan in 1922 the place contained no less than 27 business, while 6 elevators competed heavily for the regions grain production. Although the business district was hard hit by the depression of the 1930s Hughton continued to grow. The school built in 1916 had grown to 3 rooms and contained 100 pupils from every grade (High School included). By 1941 higher grain prices brought on by the Second World War and a return to better harvest, Hughton swelled to 141 residents. Though only a dozen businesses remained the community bounced back from the dreary depression years. A highway was completed to town in 1945. A new larger hall was completed in 1949 as well as a new curling rink and several other improvements such as concrete sidewalks. By the turn of the 1950s a down turn was evident and by 1961 there were only 86 residents. Hughton was finished as many left the community for larger centres. By 1966 there were less than 40 souls and the village was dissolved. In 1976 there was only a single store left, it soon closed as did the post office that year. In the 1980s only a few homes, hall/curling rink and elevators were left. Today even those have mostly disappeared. The elevators have all vanished, 2 families remain as do the hall and the curling rink. Two abandoned homes, a garage and a shed are the remains of Hughton's remaining vestiges as are many empty streets. Name The hamlet was originally named Stoford, probably after a village of that name in Somerset, England. In 1913, the name was changed to its current name, which is a portmanteau of Hugh and Milton Winters, sons of O. O. Winters, the first village overseer. Demographics There are less than ten residents in Hughton.

History Trooper was born in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and raised in nearby Little Silver. As a teenager in the early 1970s, Trooper would frequent the folk clubs of Greenwich Village taking in the burgeoning singer/songwriter and blues scene. In 1976, he moved to Austin, Texas, and then to Lawrence, Kansas, where he entered college at the University of Kansas and continued to hone his guitar, singing, and songwriting skills. Trooper moved to New York City for the 1980s and part of the 1990s, where he formed The Greg Trooper Band along with Larry Campbell on guitar, Greg Shirley on bass, and Walter Thomson on drums. During this time he recorded his first two records: We Won't Dance on Wild Twin Records in 1986 and the critically acclaimed Everywhere produced by Stewart Lerman. He also met songwriter/publisher Earl Shuman, who secured Trooper's first publishing deal with CBS Songs. Trooper's records caught the attention of Steve Earle, who recorded Trooper's \\"Little Sister\\", and Vince Gill, who covered the title track from Trooper's \\"We Won't Dance\\" on his 1989 release \\"When I Call Your Name\\". In the early 1990s, Trooper met fellow New Jerseyite and E Street Band bassist Garry Tallent who, like Trooper, would move to Nashville. Tallent produced Trooper's 1996 album Noises in the Hallway and released it on his D'Ville Record Group label. Popular Demons followed in 1998, on Koch Records and produced by Buddy Miller. After the release of that album, Trooper signed with Nashville indie Eminent Records, which released Straight Down Rain in 2001. 2002 saw the release of Trooper's first live record Between A House and a Hard Place ‚Äì Live at Pine Hill Farm with Eric \\"Roscoe\\" Ambel at the controls. He moved on to the esteemed Sugar Hill Records label in 2003 with the release of Floating followed by the Dan Penn-produced Make It Through This World in 2005. Back Shop Live, another live recording, was released in 2006. In 2008, Trooper moved back to New York City and in 2009 put out the previously unreleased 1995 recording The Williamsburg Affair. In 2011 he released Upside-Down Town on 52 Shakes Records. In August 2013, Trooper released his album Incident on Willow Street, also on 52 Shakes Records. According to Trooper, \\"In these songs, there seemed to be characters that were trying to break away from a bad situation into a better situation or trying to grow out of a stale and stagnant life into a richer life.\\"from an interview on episode 205 of the Americana Music Show, published September 1, 2014.

It was produced by Matt Allison and is their first album with drummer Neil Hennessy, who joined the band in 2008. It is a concept album, with all of the songs written from the perspective of a single teenage boy dealing with the growing pains of adolescence. Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Josh Caterer described it as \\"kind of a concept album about a teenage life. All of the songs are written from the point of view of a high school student, and they explore aspects of teenage life. This would be [about] a contemporary teenager. It's not specifically autobiographical of my high school experience. Obviously, those things are incorporated into what I write, but I tried to create a character who is the protagonist in these songs.\\" Concept and writing This Is Only a Test explores themes of identity, musical aspirations, love, and teen suicide. The idea to write a concept album about teenage life came to Caterer while thinking about successful contemporary bands who cited the Smoking Popes as an influence: > I was thinking about some of the younger bands who claim Smoking Popes as > one of their influences and have gone onto become very successful in this > generation. I [thought about] how their music is different than ours, and > what they're doing differently than what we've done. I realized that one of > the things I've never done is write from an explicitly teenage point of view > --even when I was a teenager. I was always trying to pretend like I was > older. I was trying to emulate the kind of perspective and sophistication of > the older generation. It occurred to me that it would be funny if now, while > I'm in my late 30s, I would actually start writing songs from a teenage > perspective. As soon as that thought occurred to me, I got ideas for, like, > the first five songs on the record. They just sort of started coming to me. > So I went home and started writing and they just came out. That became the > beginning of the next record. With the idea in place to write from a teenage perspective, \\"the individual songs came really quickly\\", said Caterer, \\"I wrote a song a day for five days. That's half the album in less than a week. I never write that fast! Each song stands alone as a snapshot from this kid's life. The story doesn't unfold like a narrative. It's more like a collage.\\" According to Caterer, the album's main character is not autobiographical, but \\"definitely a creation. He's not me. Well...he's similar to me, but he's not limited by the realities of my own experience. I created a character that basically has the same view of the world that I had when I was in high school, but he‚Äôs his own person and he does some things that I never did.\\" Recording and promotion This Is Only a Test was recorded at Atlas Studios in Chicago beginning in April 2010. The album's title and release date were announced that November. In February 2011 the band streamed the song \\"Punk Band\\" exclusively through Alternative Press, followed several weeks later by streaming the entire album through Punknews.org. The band embarked on a supporting tour of the United States from February to April of that year. A music video for \\"Punk Band\\" premiered March 1, 2011. Reception Rick Anderson of Allmusic gave This Is Only a Test four stars out of five, remarking that \\"While [the songs] deal with some predictable themes ‚Äî obsessive and unrequited love ('Wish We Were,' 'Diary of a Teen Tragedy'); ambivalence about the future ('College'); mono ('I've Got Mono'), and rock & roll itself ('Punk Band') ‚Äî [Josh] Caterer addresses them with a refreshing lack of either eye-rolling or rhapsodic mystification.\\" He also praised the band's musical maturity, noting \\"the blend of smoothly crooning vocals and meat-and-potatoes, punk-inflected pop that has always been the hallmark of the Smoking Popes' sound and has only become tighter, richer, and more hook-wise over the years.\\" Jon Gilbertson of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel compared the album's concept to The Who's Quadrophenia, which also structured its themes around the difficulties of teenage life: \\"Although This Is Only a Test doesn't try to match Quadrophenia, it does convey the same realization that there's no such thing, for the young, as the folly of youth. And Caterer's voice, perhaps the most tunefully expressive in the entire pop- punk subgenre, brings across the way small things grow gigantic under the influence of hormones.\\" Bryne Yancey of Alternative Press was critical of the band's musical divergences on the album, stating that \\"Unfortunately, much like adolescence itself, This Is Only a Test isn't without its moments of awkwardness. Whether it's piano-heavy power ballads ('College'), spoken-word verses written as diary entries ('Diary of a Teen Tragedy') or five-minute electronic tracks about not being able to participate in P.E. class ('Excuse Me, Coach'), Smoking Popes occasionally veer off their tried and true template of catchy, soulful pop-punk, and do so with mixed results.\\" However, he noted that \\"there are still plenty of hooks to be found on the album, especially it its loaded first half\\", comparing the band to Weezer and calling the album \\"a mostly successful experiment.\\" Tori of Punknews.org had similar criticisms, saying of \\"Excuse Me, Coach\\" that \\"I'm not sure what they were thinking, and I'm not sure I want to know\\", and calling the spoken-word verses in \\"Diary of a Teen Tragedy\\" \\"downright cringeworthy\\": \\"The reality remains that the Caterer brothers are not high schoolers. Hearing a man in his late 30s sing about how he can't get a prom date is a little off-putting.\\" However, he called these \\"small complaints\\", concluding that \\"Aside from a couple blunders, This Is Only a Test is a thoroughly enjoyable pop-rock album. At a brisk 10 songs totaling less than 40 minutes, it leaves you wanting more. Plenty to sing along to here.\\" Track listing Personnel =Band= *Josh Caterer ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar, keyboards *Eli Caterer ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals *Matt Caterer ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals *Neil Hennessy ‚Äì drums, backing vocals =Additional musicians= *Jacob Sooter ‚Äì piano on \\"College\\" *Matt Allison ‚Äì drum programming on \\"Excuse Me, Coach\\" *Stefanie Caterer ‚Äì female vocal on \\"Letter to Emily\\" *Jenny Choi ‚Äì cello on \\"Letter to Emily\\" =Production= *Matt Allison ‚Äì record producer, recording engineer, mix engineer *Justin Yates ‚Äì assistant engineer *Colin Jordan ‚Äì mastering References Smoking Popes albums 2011 albums Asian Man Records albums ","title":"This Is Only a Test"},{"id":"31255739","text":"Woman to Woman is a 1921 play by the British writer Michael Morton.Low p.411 During the First World War, a British officer and a French dancer meet in a doomed romance.

The collection was to be housed at the Anatomy Institute at the Reich University of Strasbourg in the annexed region of Alsace, where the initial preparation of the corpses was performed. The collection was sanctioned by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and designed by and under the direction of August Hirt with Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, general manager of the Ahnenerbe, being responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses. Work by Hans-Joachim Lang published in 2004 revealed the identities and family history of all the victims of this project, based on discovery of the prisoner numbers found at Natzweiler-Struthof in records of those vaccinated against typhus at Auschwitz. The list of names has been placed on a memorial at the cemetery where all were buried, at the facility used to murder them, and at the Anatomical Institute where the corpses were found in 1944. Selection Mug shot of Rudolf Brandt, 1946 The project was designed by August Hirt, who directed the phases that were performed before the end of the war ceased the project prior to its completion. Originally the \\"specimens\\" to be used in the collection were to be Jewish commisars in the Red Army captured on the Eastern front by the Wehrmacht. The 86 individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at Auschwitz concentration camp in Occupied Poland. They were chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. The initial selections and preparations were carried out by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Dr. Bruno Beger and Dr. Hans Fleischhacker, who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by June 15, 1943. Due to a typhus epidemic at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were quarantined in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In that time, the physical measurements were taken from the selected group of people. An excerpt from a letter written by Sievers in June 1943 reports on the preparation and the typhus epidemic: \\"Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under quarantine in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz.\\" In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by General Telford Taylor, Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg: Preparation Ultimately, 87 of the inmates were shipped to Natzweiler- Struthof. These people were kept for about two weeks in Block 13 of the camp so that they might eat well to improve their appearance for the desired casts of their corpses. The deaths of 86 of these inmates were, in the words of Hirt, \\"induced\\" in an improvised gassing facility at Natzweiler-Struthof, and their corpses were sent to Strasbourg ‚Äî 57 men and 29 women. The gassing occurred on August 11, 13, 17, and 19th, conducted by commandant Josef Kramer, who directed the victims to undress, placed the poison in the ventilation, and watched the people fall to their deaths. One victim was shot for fighting to avoid being gassed and thus was not part of the collection. Josef Kramer, acting commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof (who became the commandant at Auschwitz and the last commandant of Bergen Belsen), personally carried out the gassing of the victims, per his testimony at his post-war trial. It is believed that three men died in transport from Auschwitz to Natzweiler- Struthof. The next part of the process for this \\"collection\\" was to make anatomical casts of the bodies prior to reducing them to skeletons. With the approach of the Allies in 1944, there was concern over the possibility that the corpses could be discovered, as they had still not been defleshed. In September 1944, Sievers telegrammed Brandt: \\"The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing ‚Äì at least in part ‚Äì and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards.\\" Some work had been done at the Anatomical Institute, but the project was never completed. The body casts were not made, and the corpses were not defleshed as skeletons. When the Allies arrived, they found the corpses, some complete and some beheaded, preserved by formalin. Aftermath Memorial plaque at the Institute of Anatomy, University of Strasbourg Memorial plaque with names of the victims outside of the gas chamber at Natzweiler- Struthof Concentration Camp Brandt and Sievers were indicted, tried, and convicted in the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg, and both were hanged in Landsberg Prison on June 2, 1948. Josef Kramer was convicted of war crimes and hanged in by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint on December 13, 1945. August Hirt, who conceived the project, was sentenced to death in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953. It was unknown at the time that Hirt had shot himself in the head on June 2, 1945 near the town of Schluchsee, while hiding in the Black Forest. In 1974, Bruno Beger was convicted by a West German court as an accessory to 86 murders for his role in procuring the victims of the Jewish skeleton collection. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, the minimum sentence, but did not serve any time in prison. According to his family, Beger died in K√∂nigstein im Taunus on October 12, 2009. For many years, only a single victim was positively identified through the efforts of Serge and Beate Klarsfeld: Menachem Taffel (prisoner no. 107969), a Polish born Jew who had been living in Berlin. In 2003, Dr. Hans-Joachim Lang, a German professor at the University of T√ºbingen, succeeded in identifying all the victims by comparing a list of inmate numbers of the 86 corpses at the Reichs University in Strasbourg, surreptitiously recorded by Hirt's French assistant Henri Henrypierre, with a list of numbers of inmates vaccinated at Auschwitz. The names and biographical information of the victims were published in the book Die Namen der Nummern (The Names of the Numbers). Rachel Gordon and Joachim Zepelin translated the Introduction to the book into English at the web site where the whole book is posted in German, including the biographies of the 86 people. Lang recounts in detail the story of how he determined the identities of the 86 victims gassed for Dr. August Hirt's project of the Jewish skeleton collection. Forty-six of these individuals were originally from Thessaloniki, Greece. The 86 were from eight countries in German-occupied Europe: Austria, Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Belgium, and Poland. In 1951, the remains of the 86 victims were re-interred in one location in the Cronenbourg-Strasbourg Jewish Cemetery. On December 11, 2005, memorial stones engraved with the names of the 86 victims were placed at the cemetery. One is at the site of the mass grave, the other along the wall of the cemetery. Another plaque honoring the victims was placed outside the Anatomy Institute at Strasbourg's University Hospital. On July 9, 2015, French doctor Raphael Toledano discovered at the Forensic Institute's Museum of Strasbourg several tissue samples hidden away, presumed to be from Menachem Taffel. These last remains were buried in the Jewish cemetery of Cronenbourg on September 6, 2015. As journalist and researcher Lang stated, once his long research was published on the identities of the 86 people killed under Hirt's orders, \\"The perpetrators should not be allowed to have the final word.\\" See also *Ahnenerbe *Bullenhuser Damm *Hans-Joachim Lang *Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics *Nazi human experimentation *Research Materials: Max Planck Society Archive References External links *The Names of the Numbers - A Project of Hans-Joachim Lang.

Her Kosher By Design series of cookbooks was a runaway best-seller for ArtScroll, with over 500,000 copies sold.Marcus, Ariella. \\"Kosher by Design Cooking Coach: Susie Fishbein's eighth in the KBD series emphasizes cooking knowledge and skills\\". Binah Magazine, 29 October 2012, p. 43. In 2008 she was included on the Forward 50 as one of the 50 most influential Jews. Biography Susie Fishbein was born in 1968 in Oceanside, New York. She was raised in a strictly kosher home. She earned an MA in science education and taught fourth-grade science in a public school for four years. In 2000 she co-edited The Kosher Palette: Easy and elegant modern kosher cooking, a 308-page hardcover, spiral- bound, community cookbook produced as a fundraising tool for the Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy of Livingston, New Jersey, where her first child was a student. The book went through four printings comprising 36,000 copies from April 2000 to December 2001. After this project, Fishbein sought to upgrade her cooking knowledge by taking lessons and collecting recipes from professional chefs. Professing an interest in bringing to the kosher cookbook market \\"something like what Martha Stewart does - meals that are easy to prepare, and elegant and healthful, and that appeal to all the senses\\", she assembled the team of Renee Errich, a Manhattan event planner, to choreograph table settings, Larry Sexton, florist at the Plaza Hotel, to provide flower- arranging tips, and John Uher, a professional food and lifestyle magazine photographer, to direct the photo shoots for a new kosher cookbook titled Kosher By Design. This team continued to work with her on subsequent books, along with other experts such as Bonnie Taub-Dix, spokeswoman for the American Diabetic Association (the nutrition consultant on Kosher By Design Lightens Up) and kosher caterer Moshe David (who contributed many recipes for Passover By Design). =Kosher By Design= Between 2003 and 2016 Fishbein produced nine cookbooks in the Kosher By Design series.Bensoussan, Barbara. \\"Going Out with a Bang: Susie Fishbein ends her cookbook series with a new blockbuster\\". Mishpacha, February 10, 2016, pp. 42-44. The Kosher By Design series combines elegant yet easy-to-prepare kosher recipes approved by two rabbis with full- color glossy photographs to appeal to the growing segment of American Jewish women with disposable income who want to produce contemporary kosher fare. Fishbein put a new spin on kosher and Jewish holiday classics with her creative recipes, such as Tri-Colored Matzah Balls, Challah Napkin Rings, and Beer-Braised Brisket. Though her recipes sport exotic names such as Broccoli and Almond Bisque, Pecan Crusted Grouper over Amaretto Whipped Potatoes, Kalamata and Mustard Crusted Roast Beef, Sweet Potato Wedges with Vanilla Rum Sauce, and Chocolate Mint Dalmatian Cookies, Fishbein emphasizes the use of simple ingredients that can be found in any supermarket and markets herself as an \\"everyday cook\\". In addition to recipes, Fishbein's books feature sample table settings and floral arrangements, party themes, wine lists, and explanations of Jewish traditions and kashrut laws which are an educational aid for non-Orthodox readers. In media interviews, Fishbein explains that her recipes aren't necessarily \\"Jewish\\", but they are all kosher. She claims that her popularity is even greater among Conservative and Reform Jewish women who do not have a kosher kitchen but are interested in cooking gourmet. ArtScroll has realized the books' saleability by extending beyond its traditional Orthodox Jewish market into the mainstream market, including sales on Amazon.com, at Barnes & Noble and Christian evangelical booksellers, in Williams Sonoma stores, and in supermarkets. In 2016 Fishbein announced that the ninth book in the series, Kosher By Design Brings It Home, would be the last. =Media personality= Concurrent with her cookbook career, Fishbein developed a public career as a celebrity chef with cooking demonstrations at Jewish benefits, bake sales, kosher cruises, and food festivals, appearing before a new or repeat audience almost every week. She has also appeared nationally on The Today Show, Living It Up! With Ali & Jack, Martha Stewart Living Radio, and the Nachum Segal Show, earning her the sobriquets of \\"the Jewish Martha Stewart\\" and the \\"kosher diva\\". She has become the darling of the Jewish media, which quotes her and her recipes in pre-holiday features and lauds her easygoing and gracious personality. The kosher industry that Fishbein rode to stardom used her success to help promote its own products. At the 21st Annual Kosherfest 2009 in the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, for example, Fishbein held a book-signing at the Kolatin Real Kosher Gelatin booth and produced a complete dessert recipe supplement based exclusively on the new gelatin product. =Cooking coach= In addition to her cooking demos, Fishbein has led \\"culinary tours\\" to Israel, Europe, and other destinations.

Designer Dixon Kemp intended her to be 'fast and a good seaboat' and her successful sea trials were recorded in the several editions of his definitive Yacht Architecture (First Edition published in 1885). In 2011, Amazon was listed as one of the world's Top 40 Classic Yachts and was the oldest vessel honoured. Construction Carvel planked in teak and pitch pine on oak frames, with alternate wrought iron strap floor reinforcement, bronze fastenings, lead keel and copper sheathing, the Amazons hull is still largely original. History Her builder and first owner, Tankerville Chamberlayne, an English gentleman, personally supervised her construction by his own Arrow Yard at Northam on the River Itchen. This small private facility was established by the Chamberlayne family for the maintenance of the famous cutter Arrow, which was adapted continuously and thereby kept racing competitively into the 1890s. Amazons engine and boiler were supplied by the adjacent works of Day, Summers and Company. Amazon was used for summer cruising, to attend sailing regattas along the south coast of England, and to visit France. Having been prepared appropriately for the occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Royal Fleet Review in 1897 (at which Turbinia made her debut), she was shortly after sold to a prominent French yachtsman and was based at Saint Malo as Armoricain until 1900, when she returned to British ownership. Amazon circa 1910 Already too old (and with a coal-fired compound engine thought to be rather too old- fashioned) for the First World War, she remained in south coast ports as a private yacht. A new owner took her to London and after 52 years of service her original engine and boiler were removed on her conversion to diesel in 1937. The Second World War put paid to pleasure cruising and she subsequently became a houseboat for some years in a west London Yacht Basin. The actor Arthur Lowe bought her as a houseboat in 1968 and, encouraged by his surveyor's positive report, made her ready for sea again in 1971; at first a private yacht she then pursued a successful charter business in the 1980s, before migrating to northern Scotland in 1990. In 1997 she made passage from Scotland to Malta, where her new owners used her for cruising in the Mediterranean. In 2009 Amazon crossed the Atlantic Ocean via the Cape Verde Islands and travelled in the Caribbean and to Bermuda. Amazon at Mystic Seaport, Connecticut, US, in December 2009. She arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, United States from Bermuda on Labor Day 2009. Amazon was hosted by the Herreshoff Marine Museum at Bristol, Rhode Island in October 2009. She spent time in Narragansett Bay. The yacht subsequently travelled to Mystic Seaport in late 2009 and was based there in early 2011. Amazon remained at Mystic Seaport until mid-2011. Amazon acted as flagship for the commodore of the Mystic River Yacht Club for a charity regatta in Long Island Sound in June 2011 and visited Canada in July 2011 In August 2011 the yacht made a trans- Atlantic passage from Newfoundland to Ireland, and arrived at Waterford on 2 September 2011 where she was described by a local boat owner as the \\"classiest motor boat I have ever seen!\\". She remained at Waterford for the winter. In May 2012 she visited Bristol before sailing to London, where she took part in the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on Sunday 3 June 2012. She was the only vessel present that had also witnessed the Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review for Queen Victoria at Spithead on 26 June 1897. The Director of National Historic Ships referred to her in his public letter of criticism concerning the BBC's coverage of the event. She was subsequently at the Ramsgate Maritime Museum until late June, at Shoreham on 28 June 2012, then at Cowes and in the Bassin Vauban at St Malo, France in late July 2012. In August and September 2012, Amazon was in the Channel Islands, visiting Alderney in August and Jersey in September, berthing in St Helier and Gorey Harbours; on 13 September she was in St Aubin's Bay to watch the 2012 Jersey International Air Display. She was in Bristol during the winter and at the Southampton Maritime Festival on 5 & 6 May 2013. On 23 May she was in the Bristol Channel en route to Gloucester where she arrived on 24 May for the city's Tall Ships Festival on 25 & 26 May, and was on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal during June. She was at Gorey, Jersey on 22 July 2013 and had returned to Malta by October that year.

Etymology Mount Albert was named after Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert, following a petition in 1866 to the Superintendent of Auckland Province, Frederick Whitaker. The main MƒÅori name of the peak is ≈åwairaka, which means 'Place of Wairaka'; she was the daughter of Toroa, the commander of one of the great voyaging canoes, MƒÅtaatua. Wairaka is renowned for naming Whakatane, a town in the Eastern Bay of Plenty where she saved the waka from drifting out to sea. Wairaka subsequently moved to Tamaki-Makaurau to avoid an arranged marriage and set up her own pƒÅ at ≈åwairaka. The MƒÅori name Te Ahi-kƒÅ- a-Rakataura refers to the Tainui priest Rakataura aka Hape. Geography View of volcanic scoria cone Mount Albert, in a postcard from around 1910. The peak, in parkland at the southern end of the suburb, is in height, and is one of the many extinct cones which dot the city of Auckland, all of which are part of the Auckland volcanic field. The age of the volcano is currently unknown. The peak was formerly the site of a MƒÅori pƒÅ, a fortified settlement. Extensive quarrying has reduced the height of the scoria cone by about and significantly altered its shape, but a few remnants of MƒÅori earthworks such as terracing are still visible. Current uses of the cone include several playing fields, an archery club and a water reservoir buried in a paddock on the mountain's southern side. Treaty settlement In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and the NgƒÅ Mana Whenua o TƒÅmaki Makaurau collective of 13 Auckland iwi and hapu (also known as the TƒÅmaki Collective), ownership of ≈åwairaka / Te Ahi-kƒÅ-a-Rakataura / Mount Albert was vested to the collective. It is now co-governed by the collective and Auckland Council through the T≈´puna Maunga o TƒÅmaki Makaurau Authority in common benefit of the iwi \\"and all other people of Auckland\\". Vehicle access Due to the spiritual and cultural significance of the (mountain) to MƒÅori the summit road was permanently closed to most vehicles in March 2019. Native tree regeneration As part of a large works plan to regenerate the , the T≈´puna Maunga Authority plans to remove 345 exotic trees and plant 13,000 new native trees and shrubs. 183 of the exotic trees are classified as pest or weed species.

Family Alexion was a monarch of Arab, Greek, Armenian, Medes, Berber and Roman ancestry. He was the child born to the monarchs Sohaemus of Emesa and Drusilla of Mauretania. The father of Alexion, Sohaemus was an Emesene Prince and ruled as Priest King from 54 until his death in 73. He was the second son of the previous ruling Emesene Monarchs Sampsiceramus II and his wife Iotapa. Alexion's late paternal uncle was the childless Emesene King Gaius Julius Azizus who was the first husband of the Herodian Princess Drusilla, while he had two paternal aunts, Iotapa who married the Herodian Prince Aristobulus Minor and Mamaea.Levick, Julia Domna, Syrian Empress, p.xx The mother of Alexion was Drusilla of Mauretania, a Princess from Mauretania, North Africa. Drusilla was the child of the late Roman Client Monarchs Ptolemy of Mauretania and Julia Urania. The mother of Drusilla may have been a member of the Royal family of EmesaPtolemaic Genealogy - Cleopatra Selene, Footnote 10 and her father was a maternal grandson of the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony.

Alexion ruled as a Priest King from 73 until his death in 78, thus he was a contemporary of the ruling Roman emperor Vespasian. He was the priest of the Emesene Sun God Elagabalus. Little is known on him.

Constructed in the early twentieth century, it is a simple building that has served as the core of Paulding County's library system since its construction, and it has been designated a historic site. History As late as the 1890s, Paulding lacked a library of any sort. Finding this situation undesirable, members of a local women's club subscribed money to establish a small collection in 1893. Ten years later, multiple groups of local citizens met to organize a public library, which began with a collection of six hundred books. In its earliest years, the library had no fixed home: it itinerated among downtown storefronts and different homes, including the house of the librarian herself.About the Library , Paulding County Carnegie Library, n.d. Accessed 2011-03-21. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the construction of public libraries was proceeding rapidly, due in part to the generosity of steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. Many large and small cities, such as the Ohio communities of Columbus and East Liverpool, constructed libraries with money donated by Carnegie, but none had been built in small villages such as Paulding. Nevertheless, local residents worked to secure money from Carnegie, and their efforts succeeded where all before them had failed: his grant provided for the establishment of a library to serve the entirety of Paulding County. Built with this donation, the Paulding County Carnegie Library was the first Carnegie library to serve an entire county instead of a single city.Renck, Melissa. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Paulding County Carnegie Library. National Park Service, 1982-09-30. The process of obtaining the money for the library and constructing the building with the resulting funds occupied approximately three years, beginning in 1912 and concluding in 1914. Since its completion, the library has never been significantly modified, and it remains a significant part of the community. Located on South Main Street near downtown, the library remains one of Paulding's most important community buildings and a center of local pride. Architecture In 1911, Andrew Carnegie's private secretary, James Bertram, published a set of guidelines that he saw as ideal for library architecture. Since three years previously, he had required libraries to submit plans for his approval before releasing money, due to what he saw as overly ornate designs being built with his employer's money. The Paulding County Carnegie Library is one of the best examples of Bertram's guidelines: instead of ornate entryways and runaway detailing, its design maximizes the amount of space devoted to the interior, and the floor plan is designed for maximum efficiency. The library board chose a design submitted by a Columbus company, Howard and Merriam, which had already produced the design for the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center. Howard and Merriam chose a design built primarily with brick walls and elements of stone., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2011-03-21. Although the main floor is elevated above ground level, the building is a single-story structure; its full basement is elevated partially above the surface of the ground. The brickwork is primarily built in a French fashion; the gray bricks are matched by details of similarly-colored limestone from Bedford, Indiana. Patrons enter the library by climbing a stairway with a stone balustrade to a central entrance that sits within a stone archway; small Palladian windows with stone pediments are placed on each side of the entrance. Among the details visible on the building's exterior are pilasters on all of its corners, string courses that parallel the lintels, multiple cartouches, and an elaborate cornice. Inside, the library features six rooms: three large book rooms, a vestibule, a lobby, and an office. The design of the interior includes elements such as marble in the vestibule, oak panels and decorations in the reading rooms, fireplaces, and Tuscan pilasters. Although its architecture is restrained, the library remains a fine example of Neoclassical architecture with a Beaux-Arts influence. Historic designation In 1983, the Paulding County Carnegie Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture and its place in local history. Most important to its place in local history was its role as the first county-level Carnegie library: its establishment prompted many other small communities to apply for library grants from the Carnegie Corporation, making it an example of the spread of the self-improvement and adult education movements to rural areas in the early twentieth century. Today, the library is one of four Paulding County historic sites on the National Register, along with the nearby Paulding County Courthouse, the former train station in Antwerp, and a round barn near Paulding. The Paulding County Carnegie Library is the center of the Paulding County library system, which also operates branches in the villages of Antwerp, Oakwood, and Payne.Contact the Library , Paulding County Carnegie Library, n.d.

It was caused when a combination of the tide and high winds from the extratropical storm Martin led to the seawalls of the Blayais Nuclear Power Plant in France being overwhelmed.Generic Results and Conclusions of Re-evaluating the Flooding in French and German Nuclear Power Plants J. M. Matt√©i, E. Vial, V. Rebour, H. Liemersdorf, M. T√ºrschmann, Eurosafe Forum 2001, published 2001, accessed 2011-03-21 The event resulted in the loss of the plant's off-site power supply and knocked out several safety- related systems, resulting in a Level 2 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale.COMMUNIQUE N¬∞7 - INCIDENT SUR LE SITE DU BLAYAIS ASN, published 1999-12-30, accessed 2011-03-22 The incident illustrated the potential for flooding to damage multiple items of equipment throughout a plant, weaknesses in safety measures, systems and procedures, and resulted in fundamental changes to the evaluation of flood risk at nuclear power plants and in the precautions taken. Background The Blayais plant, equipped with four pressurized water reactors, is located on the Gironde estuary near Blaye, South Western France, operated by √âlectricit√© de France. Due to records of over 200 floods along the estuary dating back to 585 AD, some 40 of which had been particularly extensive, the location of the plant was known to be susceptible to flooding, and reports of the 1875 floods mentioned that they were caused by a combination of a high tides and violent winds blowing along the axis of the estuary.L'inondation dans la basse vall√©e de la Garonne et l'estuaire de la Gironde lors de la \\"temp√™te du si√®cle\\" (27-28 d√©cembre 1999) / Flooding in the Garonne valley and the Gironde estuary caused by the \\"storm of the century\\" (27-28 December 1999) Salomon Jean-No√´l, G√©omorphologie : relief, processus, environnement, Avril-juin, vol. 8, n¬∞2. pp. 127-134, doi : 10.3406/morfo.2002.1134, accessed 2011-03-25 The area had also experienced flooding during storms in the recent past, on December 13, 1981 and March 18, 1988. An official report on the 1981 floods, published in 1982,Crue de la Garonne, d√©cembre 1981 : √©l√©ments pour une analyse, A Dalmolin, D√©l√©gation r√©gionale √† l'architecture et √† l'environnement d'Aquitaine, published 1982 noted that it 'would be dangerous to underestimate' the combined effects of tide and storm, and also noted that the wind had led to 'the formation of real waves on the lower flooded floodplain'. When the Blayais plant was designed in the 1970s, it was on the basis that a height of above NGF level would provide an 'enhanced safety level', and the base on which the plant was built was set at above NGF, although some components were located in basements at lower levels. The protective sea walls around the Blayais plant were originally built to be above NGF level at the front of the site, and along the sides.Rapport sur l'inondation du site du Blayais survenue le 27 d√©cembre 1999 Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety, published 2000-01-17, accessed 2011-03-21 The 1998 annual review of plant safety for the plant identified the need for the sea walls to be raised to above NGF, and envisaged that this would be carried out in 2000, although EDF later postponed the work until 2002. On 29 November 1999, the Regional Directorate for Industry, Research and the Environment sent a letter to EDF asking them to explain this delay. Flooding On December 27, 1999, a combination of the incoming tide and exceptionally high winds produced by Storm Martin caused a sudden rise of water in the estuary, flooding parts of the plant. The flooding began at around 7:30 pm, two hours before high tide, and it was later found that at its height the water had reached between and above NGF. The flooding also damaged the sea wall facing the Gironde, with the upper portion of the rock armour being washed away. Prior to the flooding, units 1, 2 and 4 were at full power, while unit 3 was shut down for refuelling. Starting from 7:30 pm all four units lost their 225 kV power supplies, while units 2 and 4 also lost their 400 kV power supplies. The isolator circuits that should have allowed units 2 and 4 to supply themselves with electricity also failed, causing these two reactors to automatically shut down, and diesel backup generators started up, maintaining power to plants 2 and 4 until the 400 kV supply was restored at around 10:20 pm. In the pumping room for unit 1, one set of the two pairs of pumps in the Essential Service Water System failed due to flooding; had both sets failed then the safety of plant would have been endangered. In both units 1 and 2, flooding in the fuel rooms put the low-head safety injection pumps and the containment spray pumps, part of the Emergency Core Cooling System (a back-up system in case of coolant loss) out of use. Over the following days, an estimated of water would be pumped out of the flooded buildings. Response decay heat to subside after a reactor is SCRAMed, during which the heat must be removed by cooling systems Around two and a half hours after the flooding began, a high-tide alarm for the estuary was triggered in the observation room of plant 4, although those in the other plants failed to activate. This should have caused the control room operators to launch a 'Level 2 Internal Emergency Plan', however this was not done as the requirement had been omitted from the operation room manual; instead they continued to follow the procedure for the loss of the off-site power supply, so failing to shut down the operating reactors at the earliest opportunity to allow the decay heat to start to dissipate. At 3:00 am on December 28, the power plant's emergency teams were called to reinforce the staff already on site; at 6:30 the management of the Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety (now part of the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute) were informed, and a meeting of experts was convened at the IPSN at 7:45 am. At 9:00 am the Level 2 Internal Emergency Plan was finally activated by the Directorate of Nuclear Installation Safety (now the Nuclear Safety Authority) and a full emergency management team of 25 people was formed, working in shifts around the clock. At noon on December 28, the incident was provisionally rated at 'level 1' on the International Nuclear Event ScaleCOMMUNIQUE N¬∞ 2 - INCIDENT SUR LE SITE DU BLAYAIS ASN, published 1999-12-28, accessed 2011-03-22 before being reclassified at 'level 2' the following day.COMMUNIQUE N¬∞ 4 - INCIDENT SUR LE SITE DU BLAYAIS ASN, published 1999-12-29, accessed 2011-03-22 The team was scaled back during December 30, and stood down around 6 pm the same day. During the morning of December 28, the Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety estimated that, if the emergency cooling water supply failed, there would have been over 10 hours in which to act before core meltdown started. On 5 January, the regional newspaper Sud-Ouest ran the following headline without being contradicted: \\"Very close to a major accident\\", explaining that a catastrophe had been narrowly avoided.Sud-Ouest, 5 janvier 2000 - Centrale de Blaye : Tr√®s pr√®s de l'accident majeur A report on a number of samples taken after the flooding on January 8 and 9 found that the event had had no quantifiable effect on radiation levels.Point radio√©cologique de l'estuaire de la Gironde imm√©diatement apr√®s l'inondation du 27 d√©cembre 1999 (Pr√©l√®vements des 8 et 9 janvier 2000) Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety, published 2000-01-17, accessed 2011-03-21 Aftermath The Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety issued a report on January 17, 2000, calling for a review of the data used to calculate the height of the surface on which nuclear power stations are built. It suggested that two criteria should be met: that buildings containing equipment important for safety should be built on a surface at least as high as the highest water level plus a safety margin (the cote major√©e de s√©curit√© or 'enhanced safety height'), and that any such buildings below this level should be sealed to prevent water ingress. It also contained an initial analysis which found that, in addition to Blayais, the plants as Belleville, Chinon, Dampierre, Gravelines and Saint-Laurent were all below the 'enhanced safety height' and that their safety measures should be re-examined. It also found that although the plants at Bugey, Cruas, Flamanville, Golfech, Nogent, Paluel, Penly and Saint-Alban met the first criterion, the second should be verified; and called for the plants at Fessenheim and Tricastin to be re-examined since they were below the level of major adjacent canals. The consequent upgrading work, implemented over the following years, is estimated to have cost approximately 110,000,000 euro.Lessons Learned from 1999 Blayais Flood: Overview of the EDF Flood Risk Management Plan, Eric de Fraguier, EDF, published 2010-03-11, accessed 2011-03-22 In Germany, the flooding prompted the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety to order an evaluation of the German nuclear power plants. Following the events at Blayais, a new method of evaluating flood risk was developed. Instead of evaluating only the five factors required by Rule RFS I.2.e (river flood, dam failure, tide, storm surge and tsunami), a further eight factors are now also evaluated: waves caused by wind on the sea; waves caused by wind on river or channel; swelling due to the operation of valves or pumps; deterioration of water retaining structures (other than dams); circuit or equipment failure; brief and intense rainfall on site; regular and continuous rainfall on site; and rises in groundwater. In addition, realistic combinations of such factors are taken into account. Among the remedial actions taken at Blayais itself, the sea walls were raised to above NFG, ‚Äì up to higher than before ‚Äì and openings have been sealed to prevent water ingress. =Protests= Twelve days prior to the floods, a local anti-nuclear group was formed by St√©phane Lhomme under the TchernoBlaye banner (a portmanteau of the French spelling of Chernobyl and Blaye, the nearest town).L'histoire de TchernoBlaye TchernoBlaye, accessed 2011-03-29 The group gained support following the flood and their first protest march of between 1,000 and 1,500 people took place on April 23, but was blocked from reaching the plant by police using tear gas.In brief WISE, accessed 2011-03-29 The group continue their opposition to the plant, still under the presidency of St√©phane Lhomme. Ongoing concerns Due to the remedial works the plant is now believed to be adequately protected from flooding, however the access roadway remains low-lying and vulnerable. Due to this, particularly since the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents in Japan, concerns have been raised over the potential difficulty of getting help to the plant in an emergency.Inqui√©tudes sur la centrale du Blayais Sud-Ouest, published 2011-03-14, accessed 2011-03-22La centrale nucl√©aire du Blayais suscite l'inqui√©tude, actualit√© Reuters Le Point, published 2011-03-21, accessed 2011-03-22 The seawalls at Blayais are now higher than the tsunami that hit Japan, knocking out the cooling systems at Fukushima Dai-ichi. The adequacy of the sea walls has, however, been disputed by Professor Jean-No√´l Salomon, head of the Laboratory of Applied Physical Geography at Michel de Montaigne University Bordeaux 3, who believes that, due to the potential harm and economic cost that would result from a future flood-related disaster, the sea walls should be designed to withstand simultaneous extreme events, rather than simultaneous major events.

According to the Constitution of India, the Governor is a state's head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the State Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) in a state, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints and swears in the chief minister, whose Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Based on the Westminster system, given that he retains the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term can last for the length of the assembly's life‚Äîa maximum of five years. There are no limits to the number of terms that the chief minister can serve.Durga Das Basu. Introduction to the Constitution of India. 1960. 20th Edition, 2011 Reprint. pp. 241, 245.

Selection process  = Eligibility = The Constitution of India sets the principle qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the chief minister. A chief minister must be: * a citizen of India. * should be a member of the state legislature. If a person is elected chief minister who is not a member of the legislature, then he/she must take sign from governor. * of 25 years of age or moreConstitution of India, Article 173 An individual who is not a member of the legislature can be considered as the chief minister provided he/she gets himself/herself elected to the State Legislature within six months from the date of their appointment. Failing which, he/she would cease to be the chief minister. = Election = The chief minister is elected through a majority in the state legislative assembly. This is procedurally established by the vote of confidence in the legislative assembly, as suggested by the governor of the state who is the appointing authority. They are elected for five years. The Constitution of India article 164, clause 1 The chief minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor. = Oath = Since, according to the constitution, the chief minister is appointed by the governor, the swearing in is done before the governor of the state. The oath of office. The oath of secrecy = Resignation = In the event of a Chief Minister's resignation, which conventionally occurs after a general election or during a phase of assembly majority transition, the outgoing Chief minister holds the informal title of \\"caretaker\\" chief minister until the Governor either appoints a new chief minister or dissolves the assembly. Since the post is not constitutionally defined, the caretaker chief minister enjoys all the powers a regular chief minister, but cannot to make any major policy decisions or cabinet changes during his/her short tenure as caretaker. Remuneration  By Article 164 of the constitution of India, remuneration of the chief minister as well as other ministers are to be decided by the respective state legislatures. The Constitution of India, article 164,clause 5 Until the legislature of the state decides salary, it shall be as specified in the second schedule. The Constitution of India, Article 164, Clause 5The salaries thus vary from state to state. As of 2019, the highest salary is drawn by chief ministers of Telangana, which is and lowest by the chief ministers of Tripura which is legally.  Deputy chief minister  Various states throughout the history have appointed Deputy Chief Ministers. Despite being not mentioned in the constitution or law, the Deputy-Chief minister office is often used to pacify factions within the party or coalition. It is similar to the rarely used Deputy-Prime minister post in Central government of India.

She was the founder and chairperson of the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF), a non-profit organization. Early years Abdi was born in Mogadishu, and lived in south-central Somalia. Her mother died when she was 12 years old. Abdi thereafter took on family chores, including raising her four sisters, as the eldest child in the family. Her father was an educated professional who was employed in the port of the capital city. For her early schooling, Abdi attended local elementary, intermediate and secondary academies. In 1964, she received a scholarship from the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union. Abdi subsequently studied medicine at a Kiev Medical Institute, graduating in 1971. The following year, she began law studies at Mogadishu's newly opened Somali National University. She would practice medicine during the morning and work toward her law degree in her spare time, eventually earning it in 1979.  Personal life  When Abdi was twelve years old, she entered into a forced marriage with a significantly older man who was a police officer. The short-lived planned marriage ended several years later, before she left Somalia for Moscow and then, Kiev. During her years in the USSR, she met Aden Mohammed, a fellow Somali student. In 1973, Abdi married Aden and gave birth to her first child two years later. They had three children: Deqo, Amina, and Ahmed. Ahmed died in a 2005 car crash in Hargeisa, while on a visit to his father who had since separated from Abdi. Both Deqo and Amina became physicians. Abdi died on 5 August 2020, at her home in Mogadishu. She was 73; no cause of death was specified. Career =Rural Health Development Organization= In 1983, Abdi opened the Rural Health Development Organization (RHDO) on family-owned land in the southern Lower Shebelle region. It began as a one-room clinic offering free obstetrician services to around 24 rural women per day, and later evolved into a 400-bed hospital. When the civil war broke out in Somalia during the early 1990s, Abdi stayed behind at the behest of her grandmother, who had advised her to use her qualifications to assist the vulnerable. She subsequently established a new clinic and school for the displaced and orphans. The RHDO was renamed the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF) in 2007. It gradually expanded to include a relief camp, which during the 2011 drought housed 90,000 people on the 1,300 acres surrounding Abdi's hospital. Two years prior, at the height of the Islamist insurgency in southern Somalia, militants had laid siege to the compound and attempted to force Abdi to shut it down. She stood her ground and the rebels left within a week, following pressure from local residents, the UN and other advocacy groups. The militants again stormed the area in February 2012, leading Abdi to temporarily suspend services until their eventual departure. =Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation= Hawa Abdi Center C The Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF) was run by Abdi and her two physician daughters, CEO Deqo Adan (also known as Deqo Mohamed) and assistant Adan (also known as Amina Mohamed), who followed in their mother's footsteps as ob/gyn specialists. As of 2012, the organization has a multinational staff of 102 workers, augmented by a 150-member team comprising volunteers, fishermen and farmers. DHAF is a non-political organization that is not affiliated with any government, political movement, religion or clan. DHAF decides what projects to undertake and what relief to provide based on the ground needs of the village. DHAF is also a financially independent organization. All of the funding is provided through donations from the people around the world and other charitable endowments. Government funding is prohibited. Since 1991, DHAF has provided services to Somalis who are independent of their clan. Services are provided to the people of Somalia at no cost. The DHAF compound includes a hospital, school and nutritional center, and provides shelter, water and medical care to mostly women and children. Since its establishment in the early 1980s, the complex has served an estimated 2 million people. Although services are offered at no charge, Abdi operates several fishing and agricultural projects within the compound to inculcate self-sustenance. The hospital also contains a small plot of land, where vegetables and maize are grown and later in part sold to cover some of the facility's maintenance costs. Funding for the compound's equipment and medical supplies is mainly secured through remittances from Somali expatriates as well as general contributions to the DHAF. Since 2011, the organization has also received support from the Women in the World Foundation. Awards Abdi was named Hiiraan Onlines Person of the Year in 2007. Glamour magazine later named her and her two daughters among its 2010 \\"Women of the Year\\". Two years later, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.Dr. Hawa Abdi nominated for the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize She also received the Women of Impact Award from the WITW Foundation, BET's Social Humanitarian Award, and the John Jay Medal for Justice. In 2014, Abdi received the Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in Middelburg, the Netherlands. She was conferred the Pilosio Building Peace Award one year later. Abdi was granted an honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of Pennsylvania in May 2016.

The laws of many jurisdictions void incestuous marriages, even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, DNA testing may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records. Causes People may be unaware of a kinship relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, artificial insemination with an anonymous donated sperm may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used. Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father, while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings. Taiwan allows those conceived by artificial means to find out if they are related to a person they are considering marrying. Accidental incest may also arise in the following situations: * Children separated from their family at birth * Child abandonment * Sexual exploration Genetic sexual attraction is a pseudoscientific explanation offered for cases of sexual attraction and relations between adults who were not aware of their close blood relations. Notable cases *In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret. Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true. *An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.

Mad Max references are deeply embedded in popular culture; references to its dystopian, apocalyptic, and post- apocalyptic themes and bizarre landscape and desolate wasteland imagery have inspired some artists to emulate the look and feel of some aspect of the series in their work. Mad Max * Manga author Buronson cited Mad Max as an inspiration for his manga and anime series Fist of the North Star (1983 debut), illustrated by Tetsuo Hara. Buronson cited Bruce Lee films and Mad Max as the two biggest influences on Fist of the North Star. However, both Mad Max and Fist of the North Star may have also been influenced by an earlier post- apocalyptic manga series, Violence Jack (1973 debut). * James Wan and Leigh Whannell credit the film's final scene, in which Johnny is given the option of cutting off either the resistant chain or his own foot to escape, for inspiring the entire Saw series.McDonough, Maitland. \\"Not Quite Hollywood: the Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!\\". Film Journal International. Vol. 112, no. 8., Aug. 2009. p.73 * The music video for the 2001 single \\"Addicted to Bass\\" by Puretone was heavily inspired by the opening chase sequence in Mad Max featuring a Pursuit Special. Two Falcon XB coupes were used in the video - one painted in the livery of the MFP vehicles seen in the film. * In 2009, artist Shaun Gladwell showcased MADDESTMAXIMVS at the Venice Biennale. The exhibition brought together numerous works of art inspired by the Mad Max film series, including a video art piece that displayed a sculptural replica of Max's Pursuit Special. *In Michael D. O'Brien's novel, Eclipse of the Sun, the semi-main character of Father Ron watches the \\"Road Warrior\\" for about twenty minutes, before turning it off. He describes it as well done, yet couldn't concentrate. This happens in Chapter 11. * Pop singer Kesha noted that the vibe of her Get $leazy Tour (2011) was \\"very heavily influenced\\" by the Mad Max series. Several of the costumes she and her friends wear throughout the show are very reminiscent of characters throughout the Mad Max franchise. * The animated series Ben 10: Omniverse explores an alternate universe that strongly resembles that of Mad Max. In this universe, Ben Tennyson (known in this universe as Mad Ben) uses the Omnitrix to establish himself as a warlord and tyrannical master over the remaining people in a post-apocalyptic Bellwood, turned to a desert wasteland. He also has an Australian accent, similar to that of Max Rockatansky, the protagonist of the Mad Max series. *An episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012) features an alternate universe in which Raphael loses his memory and tries to protect a girl that has a secret while finding his brothers on a trek takes inspiration from Mad Max. * A Breton chariot racer is named \\"Madmax\\" in the 2017 Asterix comic book Asterix and the Chariot Race *The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019) features the city of Bricksburg turned into a post-apocalyptic wasteland called \\"Apocalypseburg\\", which parodies Mad Max in its tone, aesthetic, and costumes.  Mad Max 2  * Filmmakers Guillermo del Toro, David Fincher, and Robert Rodriguez and video game director Hideo Kojima have cited Mad Max 2 as one of their favorite movies. James Cameron also credits the movie, along with Star Wars, for having a major influence on him. * Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin, creators of the comic heroine Tank Girl, describe her as \\"Mad Max designed by Vivienne Westwood\\" * Waterworld co-writer David Twohy cited Mad Max 2 as a major influence on the film. Both films share the same cinematographer, Dean Semler. * The music video for Phil Collins' \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" features a sequence inspired by Mad Max 2. * In the episode of Nickelodeon's Rugrats (\\"The Sky is Falling\\"), there is a post-apocalyptic scene which parodies Mad Max 2. The main characters are seen heading down a road in the desert toward an abandoned city. Their vehicles are engineered out of other things (cribs, tricycles, etc.). One of the characters, Chuckie, is piloting a gyrocopter and is dressed very similarly to the gyro captain (leather cap, shirt, tan colors, etc.). * In the level creator DLC for Portal 2, Cave Johnson, the narrator says \\"Cave Johnson here. Just a reminder that the core goal of Aperture Gas-Finding Science is to find gas, so make sure you let us know if you see any. If we meet our quarterly gas-finding target, I promise you we will don our bondage gear, fuel our death cars, and drive around in circles, whooping it up and shooting arrows at people. Who is ready to rule the wasteland? All right, start looking.\\" * The Fallout series of video games, which has a post-apocalyptic world as their setting, lists Mad Max as one of its influences. For example, in the first and second games, one of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that closely resembles the jacket worn by Mel Gibson in the film. Also, in the series the player character can acquire various companions that will accompany the player and help him in his quest; one of the companions in the first game is a dog that resembles the one that follows Max in Mad Max 2. A secret location in the second Fallout game allows the player to find the dog character again, and a nearby companion will remark that he'd seen it hanging around with a tough guy wearing black leather. * Other videogames inspired by Mad Max or its sequels include Max Payne, Twisted Metal, Carmageddon, Borderlands, Rage and Fuel. *The animated series ReBoot features an episode titled \\"Bad Bob\\", which is heavily influenced by this film. One of the artists who worked on the episode was Brendan McCarthy, who would later go on to serve as co-writer and concept artist on Mad Max: Fury Road. * Nikki Sixx cited the Mad Max films and Escape From New York as a major inspiration for the early stage shows and costume designs of M√∂tley Cr√ºe in the band's tell-all book, The Dirt. Blackie Lawless from W.A.S.P. cited the film as having a huge effect on the visual theme they were to employ in their 1980s stage shows.http://www.waspnation.com/30yearsofthunder.html#Part2 * Mortal Engines author Philip Reeve stated that the film was an influence on the creation of his particular post apocalyptic universe. * Weird Science's climax includes many characters in costumes bearing strong resemblances to the styles seen in the Road Warrior. This includes Vernon Wells reprising his role as Wez. * The Road Warriors, a professional wrestling tag team, were inspired by the film's villains. * Episode 8 (\\"Mad Tony: The Food Warrior\\") of season 2 of Anthony Bourdain's television series A Cook's Tour is set in Australia and features a Road Warrior theme. The final shot mimics the departing scene from the movie, with Bourdain standing in for Gibson. * In episode 16, season 5 of the TV series Cheers, Frasier Crane is detained after becoming involved in an altercation at a hockey game. Later, when describing the events to the bar patrons, he says \\"the next thing I know I'm in the holding cell of some north- end station house with the cast of The Road Warrior.\\" * In the South Park season 5 episode 7 \\"Proper Condom Use\\" the boys and girls at South Park Elementary get frightened by the fear of STDs and face off against each other with the girls building a refuge like the settlers in Mad Max 2 and the boys trying to chase them out of it like the Marauders. Butters gets on a microphone and delivers an impassioned demand that the girls walk away, and in it he uses much the same speech patterns and voice type as Lord Humungus. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome * The term \\"Thunderdome\\" was adapted by popular culture and appears in various contexts with a meaning similar to that used in the film. * George Costanza mentions the film in the 1998 episode of Seinfeld, \\"The Dealership\\", when Jerry Seinfeld starts to get ripped off on a car deal. * A 2015 television advertisement for NBC's The Voice parodied the \\"Thunderdome\\" concept. * The 1996 music video for 2Pac's \\"California Love\\" includes elements inspired by the Mad Max film, such as car chases in the desert and the Thunderdome itself, according to director Hype Williams. * World Championship Wrestling held a \\"Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal\\" match at their Halloween Havoc 1992 pay-per-view event between Sting and Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts that was based on the film. The match was promoted with a segment where Sting and Roberts met in a tavern full of tough customers that resembled Bartertown. The stipulation of their match would be determined by spinning a wheel, similar to the scene in which Max's punishment is determined by a wheel. The bar patrons repeatedly chant \\"Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal\\" like in the film. * On 1988 Act of God album by Znowhite 5th track is called Thunderdome.https://www.discogs.com/ZnoWhite-Act-Of-God/master/268238 * The film is parodied in the Rick and Morty episode \\"Rickmancing the Stone\\" alongside Mad Max: Fury Road. * The playable hero character Legion Commander in the popular Multiplayer online battle arena video game Dota 2 has an ultimate ability that forces an enemy player to fight her in a 1-on-1 duel.

However, trace fossils and paleopathology can give insight into dinosaur behavior. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. Gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float. Ceratopsian behavior Centrosaurine ceratopsids did not fully develop their cranial ornamentation until fully grown. Scott Sampson argues that comparing ceratopsids to modern mammals with a similar lifecycle can yield insight into the socioecology of the ancient horned dinosaurs. Parental care is implied by the fossilized remains of a grouping of Psittacosaurus consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles. In this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting. Fossil deposits dominated large numbers of ceratopsids from individual species suggest that these animals were at least somewhat social. However, the exact nature of ceratopsid social behavior has historically been controversial. In 1997, Lehman argued that the aggregations of many individuals preserved in bonebeds originated as local \\"infestations\\" and compared them to similar modern occurrences in crocodiles and tortoises. Other authors, such as Scott D. Sampson, interpret these deposits as the remains of large \\"socially complex\\" herds. Modern animals with mating signals as prominent as the horns and frills of ceratopsians tend to form these kinds of large, intricate associations. Sampson found in previous work that the centrosaurine ceratopsids did not achieve fully developed mating signals until nearly fully grown. He finds commonality between the slow growth of mating signals in centrosaurines and the extended adolescence of animals whose social structures are ranked hierarchies founded on age-related differences. In these sorts of groups young males are typically sexually mature for several years before actually beginning to breed, when their mating signals are most fully developed. Females, by contrast do not have such an extended adolescence. Other researchers who support the idea of ceratopsid herding have speculated that these associations were seasonal. This hypothesis portrays ceratopsids as living in small groups near the coasts during the rainy season and inland with the onset of the dry season. Support for the idea that ceratopsids formed herds inland comes from the greater abundance of bonebeds in inland deposits than coastal ones. The migration of ceratopsids away from the coasts may have represented a move to their nesting grounds. Many African herding animals engage in this kind of seasonal herding today. Herds would also have afforded some level of protection from the chief predators of ceratopsids, tyrannosaurids. Ornithopod and Parksosaur behavior Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland.Dinosaur family tracks Footprints show maternal instinct after leaving the nest. =Oryctodromeus= Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. =Iguanodon= The first potential evidence of herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned. =Hadrosauridae= Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the American Bison or the African Springbok. Jack Horner's 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura (\\"good mother dinosaur\\") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the ornithopods. Sauropodomorph behavior Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, although there is not evidence for specific herd structures. There is evidence that Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods (1997 discovery) nested in large groups. A dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur. Theropod behavior The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey.(abstract ) However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs (crocodiles and other reptiles, and birds ‚Äì Harris's Hawk is a well-documented exception), and the taphonomic evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations. In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma they are more likely to be a result of the animal's behavior than fractures obtained during a single injurious event. The distribution of stress fractures also has behavioral significance. Stress fractures to the hand are more likely to result from predatory behavior since injuries to the feet could be obtained while running or migrating. In order to identify stress fractures occurring in the feet specifically due to predatory behavior, the researchers checked to see if the toes which bore the greatest portion of the animals weight while in motion also had the greatest percentage of stress fractures. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would contact the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to suffer stress factors more frequently. The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running, like interaction with prey. They suggested that such injuries could occur as a result of the theropod trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. Contact with struggling prey is also the likely cause of tendon avulsions found in the forelimbs of Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The authors concluded that the presence of stress fractures provide evidence for \\"very active\\" predation-based diets rather than obligate scavenging. Research based on energetic modelling has also backed up the role of active predatory behaviors in theropods and has effectively ruled out obligate scavenging as a likely strategy. However scavenging was still likely to have been an important resource for many theropod with body size playing a key role in its importance. In general, the researchers found that small species, such as coelurosaurs, and species larger than 1000 kg, such as an adult Tyrannosaurs rex, would have been poor scavengers. In contrast intermediate sized species, such as Dilophosaurus, were found to have been capable of gaining significant energy though scavenging. =Majungasaurus= Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus. =Ornithomimid behavior= Sinornithomimus One example of immature dinosaurs forming social groups comes from a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over twenty Sinornithomimus, from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. =Tyrannosauridae= Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding. The partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. =Oviraptoridae= The Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the eggs warm.Oviraptor nesting Oviraptor nests or Protoceratops? =Troodontidae= A recently discovered troodont fossil demonstrates that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. =Dromaeosauridae= Primitive dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor may have been arboreal (tree- climbing). Velociraptor Ra√∫l Mart√≠n showing a featherless Velociraptor battling Protoceratops. (It is now known that Velociraptor had feathers.) From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. =Scansoriopterygidae= The enigmatic scansoriopterygids may have been arboreal (tree-climbing).

David and Jenny meet in their junior year of college and strike up a friendship. David is smitten with Jenny, writing poetry for her and spending hours discussing literature with her. Although Jenny enjoys their friendship, she makes it clear that David's romantic feelings are not returned and dates many other men. David invites Jenny along to a family function. While there, they encounter Alan, who has also been invited. Jenny and Alan feel an immediate chemistry with each other. Alan returns to school shortly thereafter and moves into an apartment. While David and Jenny help Alan move in, they discover that Alan is in possession of a very large amount of marijuana. Alan claims to be holding it for someone who left the country and hides it in a cookie jar. Alan soon asks Jenny out. Jenny accepts the date and soon the two are a couple. David resents this and begins avoiding both of them. Eager to broker a reconciliation, Alan tricks Jenny and David into accompanying him on a trip to the woods. In the woods, Alan brings Jenny and David into a long-abandoned mansion. Alan demands that Jenny and David reconcile; when they initially refuse, Alan cuts the palm of his hand. Horrified, Jenny and David apologize to each other. Alan then takes them on a tour of the property, telling the story of the former owner, a wealthy man with two sons whose rivalry ends in murder. The three end up staying the night in the abandoned house and have a menage a trois of sorts. When they return to school, Alan sets David up with Elise (Estella Warren), a girl who has no interest in literature or poetry. David, who is still in love with Jenny, reluctantly begins seeing Elise. Shortly thereafter, Jenny receives a call from her estranged father who suggests a dinner date. She asks Alan to accompany her. Alan, who is beginning to feel suffocated in the relationship, balks. David offers to go in his place. Jenny's father never shows up for the dinner and David takes a disappointed Jenny home. David makes a play for Jenny's romantic affections; Jenny angrily rejects him and runs into her apartment where she finds Alan and Elise in bed together. Jenny breaks up with Alan. Alan begins stalking her, begging her to take him back. After a confrontation in the library, David and Alan fight with David punching Alan in the mouth. David before leaving. That night, someone throws a large rock through Jenny's window. Convinced that Alan is responsible and fearing for her safety, Jenny asks David to let her stay with him. David eagerly assents. The next day, David witnesses Alan being led out of his apartment in handcuffs. Someone tipped the police about Alan's supply of drugs. Later that night, Jenny declares her affections for David and the two sleep together. Alan is sentenced to eighteen months for drug possession and is institutionalized for a time after his release. Meanwhile, David and Jenny, who have become a couple, graduate from college and move in together, being careful to get an unlisted number. The film resumes in the present. The police, who had already found Alan's car, find Jenny and Alan, both of them clinging to life. Detective Anders briefly puts David under arrest, feeling that he is responsible for what happened. David swears his innocence and asks for an opportunity to finish his story. David claims that Alan kidnaps both he and Jenny, tying both of them up and driving them back to the abandoned mansion. Once there, he leads Jenny into the house, leaving David tied up in the car. David manages to free himself and runs inside to rescue Jenny. Once inside, he hears Alan demanding that Jenny tell him that he and their relationship had meant something to her. When Jenny does as she is asked, Alan, convinced that she was the one to call the police, asks her why she set him up. As David finishes his story, a comatose Alan is wheeled into the hospital, followed by Jenny who has recovered well enough from her injuries to walk unassisted. Jenny corroborates much of David's story. The detectives opt not to charge David with a crime. After David is released from the hospital, he and Jenny look in on Alan who is still unconscious. Jenny tells David that she had been wrong about both Alan and David and that she is glad that she is with David. She asks him to take her home. The two leave the hospital. As they leave the hospital, another flashback begins from David. It is then revealed that David manipulated Elise into going to Alan's apartment during Jenny's dinner with her father and that he, not Alan, had thrown the rock through Jenny's window. And that Jenny admitted she loved Alan back. And David did not shoot Alan in self-defense, but was consumed with jealousy and shot Alan to get him out of the picture so he could have Jenny for himself. At this point, David reveals himself. The two fight and accidentally knock Jenny over the balcony. Convinced that Jenny is dead, Alan rushes down the stairs past David who follows closely. While Alan kneels over an unconscious Jenny, David pulls out his gun and trains it on Alan. It is then that he reveals that he, not Jenny, was the one who called the police. David tells Alan that he resented the fact that Jenny always rejected him in favor of inappropriate men and that he felt that Jenny would finally see that he was the best partner for her if Alan was out of the picture. He then shoots Alan several times. After the shooting, David leaves the mansion in search of help for Jenny. He was then hit by a car and taken to the hospital.

Plot  Newly single and back on Vicodin, House checks into a hotel for the five-star treatment, leaving his team to diagnose a professional bull-rider (Chad Faust) who was attacked by a bull after suffering a seizure. House admits to Wilson that he is taking Vicodin again, and that he needs help - but he insists that prostitutes will help him more than counselling. He proceeds to check in with the team telephonically while in the company of a variety of women. As the episode progresses, House continues to seek more and more thrills, which worries Wilson so he offers that House should move back in with him, which House declines. Wilson asks Cuddy to talk to House but she refuses. Diagnosing the bull-rider is difficult due to his various previous injuries which renders MRI technology and other diagnostics irrelevant. House instructs the team to do more and more aggressive tests with high risk to the patient: an MRI test despite the metal rod in his ribcage, which causes the metal to superheat; removing the plate in his skull to do a CT scan, and finally forcing his aortic valve to rupture during surgery to identify a weak spot in the valve in time to repair it. When the patient wakes up after surgery, Masters asks him out, having been attracted to him for most of the diagnostic process. The patient is embarrassed and does not respond.

Following the Fall of the Republic of Venice in May 1797, the Ionian Islands, a Venetian possession, were occupied by the French Republic. The French instituted a new, democratic regime and, following the Treaty of Campo Formio, annexed the islands to France, forming the three departments of Corcyre (Corfu), Ithaque (Ithaca) and Mer-√âg√©e (Aegean Sea). Originally widely welcomed, French rule began to grow oppressive to the islanders, and aroused the enmity of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire. In 1798, a joint Russo-Ottoman campaign was launched against the islands, culminating in the four-month siege of Corfu. Its fall in March 1799 signalled the end of French rule, and the islands were reorganized as the Russo-Ottoman protectorate of the Septinsular Republic. The islands were again annexed to France in 1807 after the Treaty of Tilsit, but retained many of the institutions of the Septinsular Republic. The French were evicted from most of the islands by the British in 1809‚Äì10; only Corfu resisted until 1814. In 1815, the British established the United States of the Ionian Islands. Background At the end of the 18th century, the Ionian Islands (Corfu, Zakynthos, Cephalonia, Lefkada, Ithaca, and Kythira) along with a handful of exclaves on the Epirote mainland, namely the coastal towns of Parga, Preveza, Vonitsa, and Butrint, were the sole remaining overseas possessions of the once mighty Republic of Venice in the East. Under Venetian rule, the society of the Ionian Islands was divided into three classes, analogous to those of Venice itself: the privileged nobility, the urban middle class (cittadini) and the commoners (popolari). The noble families, who enjoyed full Venetian citizenship, were on top of the pyramid, and provided the members of the ruling council of each island.. Originally restricted to Italian settler families, from the 16th century on this group also included Greek families. As in Venice, Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos each had a Libro d'Oro (English: golden book), where the aristocratic families were inscribed. Their nature differed from island to island: in Corfu, they were obliged to reside in Corfu city; likewise in Kythira and Zakynthos they mostly dwelled in the capital, whereas in Cephalonia a rural nobility persisted, and no clear distinction was evident in Lefkada. Nevertheless, the power of the nobility rested on the ownership of land, and as a class they derided mercantile activity, which was left to the urban burghers; as a result, the latter also came to amass wealth and land. The burghers in turn challenged the nobility's claim to monopolize local authority and aspired to join the ruling class, while the peasantry was largely politically marginalized. The Venetian authorities were left in a position of mediator, but still had to acknowledge the power of the noble families, who often were a law on themselves and could even raise military corps of their own; while the nobles were content to pursue their private feuds and plot and conspire against each other for local office, they were also able of concerted action against the Venetian authorities, when they felt their interests threatened. Venetian writ ran lightly in the cities, and was almost non-existent in the countryside; not infrequently, Venetian official who ventured to the country to arrest some outlaw, were forced back in humiliation. A further distinguishing feature between rulers and ruled was religion, where the official Roman Catholicism of the Venetian authorities was opposed by the popular Greek Orthodox identity, expressed in the veneration of each island's saint or saints. Increasingly during the 18th century, Orthodoxy also provided a link to a rising European power, the Russian Empire. A pro- Russian current emerged, and several Islanders entered Russian service, especially during Catherine the Great's \\"Greek Project\\", and participated in attempts to provoke a Greek uprising against Ottoman rule, such as the Orlov Revolt or the raids of Lambros Katsonis. Nevertheless, support for the Venetian regime was still widespread enough that when the new provveditore generale da Mar, Carlo Aurelio Widmann, arrived in 1795, he could rely on the assistance of the local communes, leading nobles, the Jewish community of Corfu, and both Orthodox and Catholic clergy, to raise the necessary funds to pay for the garrisons and administrative personnel. As the French Revolutionary Wars erupted into northern Italy, Venice was shaken to its core: the spread of radical Jacobin ideals among her subjects, the undisguised hostility of the victorious French armies to the ancient aristocratic republic, and the dismal state of Venetian finances and military preparedness led to the gradual erosion of Venetian rule in its mainland possessions (Terraferma), and the eventual Fall of the Republic of Venice to Napoleon Bonaparte in May 1797. In the Ionian Islands, the news of the French advance into Lombardy in 1796 led Widmann to take extraordinary measures to strengthen the defence of the Islands, even investing his own private fortune for the cause. French agents were already active in the islands, most notably the French consul in Zakynthos, the merchant Constantine Guys, who not only fomented anti-Venetian feeling, but was suspected of orchestrating the arson of his own consulate on 29 October, an event that was used by Napoleon as one of the pretexts for his declaration of war against Venice. Rumours of the self-abolition of the Great Council of Venice on 12 May spread quickly to the islands. While pro-French elements (the karmanioloi) were instructed by Guys on the meaning of concepts like \\"liberty\\" and \\"equality\\", many nobles mobilized against them, with proposals were made to kill all French sympathizers. Despite such agitation, order was kept, and the definite news of the political change in the metropolis, with the establishment of a new, republican , in early June, was met with calm and restraint. Start of the French occupation Bonaparte at the Pont d'Arcole. Napoleon's victories in Italy led to the demise of the ancient Republic of Venice and the French occupation of the Ionian Islands. The fate of Venice and of its possessions was to be decided between France and Austria. No mention of the Ionian Islands was made in the Preliminaries of Leoben. The two sides had different objectives: the Austrians wanted to keep the French out, and welcomed the possibility that the islands would come under the rump Venetian Republic envisaged at Leoben, as a buffer between French and Austrian territories in the Adriatic; whereas for the French, and NApoleon especially, the islands were an important stepping-stone for his ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, which would soon lead to his invasion of Egypt. Consequently, on 26 May, Napoleon ordered his fellow Corsican, the g√©n√©ral de division , to begin preparations for a military occupation of the Ionian Islands. A mixed Franco-Venetian fleet with 3,159 men sailed on 13 June from Malamocco. The ships flew the Venetian flag of St. Mark, since Gentili was ostensibly merely the representative of the new, pro-French Provisional Municipality of Venice, and the expedition intended to avoid possible secession of the colony from the metropolis. In reality, Napoleon instructed Gentili to encourage the local inhabitants to pursue independence, by reminding them of the glories of Ancient Greece; the scholar Antoine-Vincent Arnault was sent along as observer for Napoleon and a political advisor and propagandist. In the meantime, commissioners from the Provisional Municipality of Venice arrived in Corfu, informing Widmann of events and bringing orders to maintain order and begin the democratization of the local administration. Widmann tried to ensure consensus by issuing a notarized declaration of public concord, but only 177 citizens, of whom 71 nobles, signed it. The French fleet arrived on 27 June, and the French troops disembarked on the next day, amidst tumultuous reception by the local populace, led by the Orthodox primate (protopapas), Georgios Chalikiopoulos Mantzaros, who gifted Gentili with a copy of Homer's Odyssey; the nobility reacted to Gentili's proclamation, on 29 June, that the French brought liberty to the Islands with reserve and suspicion. Nevertheless, with the support of the populace and the resigned stance of the Venetian authorities, the imposition of French rule was rapidly accomplished not only on Corfu, but on the other islands as well. The only resistance was provided by some elements of the Venetian garrison troops, but these were quickly disarmed and disbanded; only the volunteer companies at the exposed possessions of Butrinto, Parga, Lefkada, and Kythira, as well as the armatoloi troops in Preveza and Vonitsa, were retained in French pay. Although Widmann nominally remained the head of the administration, actual power lay with Gentili. When Venetian commissioners arrived bearing 60,000 ducats for the payment of army and fleet and the loans Widmann had contracted, the money was simply confiscated by the French. The Austrian court protested the unilateral French occupation, but could do little about it. In the ongoing negotiations, Napoleon for a while pretended that the islands were to be incorporated into the Cisalpine Republic, but in the end, Austria was forced to accept the fait accompli to secure her own control over Dalmatia from the spoils of the Venetian state. Establishment of a democratic regime As in the Venetian metropolis, the French established new administrations in the form of Provisional Municipalities. In Corfu, the body comprised the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Corfu, Francisco Fenzi, the protopapas Mantzaros, a Catholic and an Orthodox priest, two Jews, six nobles, ten burghers, two craftsmen and six peasants. Widmann was appointed to chair the body, but he resigned during its first session, and was replaced by the Corfiot noble . The nobles tried to mobilize anti-Jewish sentiment against the council, and a riot broke out on its second session on 28 June, but was suppressed. With Arnault as its political advisor, the Provisional Municipality of Corfu became the supreme executive authority on the island. Its chairman and vice-chairman were elected by secret ballot among its members for terms of one month. Sessions of the council were opened to the public (but confined to 40 attendees); closed sessions could be held to discuss a subject, but all decision-making had to be public, and every citizen could request to speak during these sessions. Eight committees (comitati) were created for Public Salvation, Health, Food, Commerce and the Arts, Economy, Police, Public Education, and Military Affairs. These committees exercised administration in their respective fields and could propose laws and select their officials, but their approval was the purview of the Provisional Municipality council. Justice was reformed wholesale, with the introduction of French legal principles and the establishment of civil courts‚Äîseven county courts, two courts of first instance, and a court of appeal‚Äîand criminal courts‚Äîtwo magistrate's courts and an appeals court. Their judges selected by the Provisional Municipality, which had also the right to issue pardons. A similar pattern was followed in the other islands, with the notable exception of Cephalonia, which traditionally had been divided into multiple provinces; now no less than five Provisional Municipalities were established on the island, at Argostoli, Livatho, the Castle of Saint George, Asos, and Lixouri. On 5 July, in an official ceremony, the liberty tree was planted in the main square of Corfu city, while the flag of St. Mark was thrown into a pyre, to be replaced by the French tricolour. On the next day, the Provisional Municipality of Corfu ordered the Libro d'Oro, the emblems of the Venetian Republic, the patents of nobility and coats of arms of the noble families to be likewise destroyed. This provoked the reaction of the nobles, who destroyed the liberty tree. Although a bounty of 500 thaler was placed on the unknown perpetrators, they were never found. Similar events spread across the islands: at Zakynthos, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, Francesco Antonio Mercati and the Greek Orthodox protopapas, Gerasimos Soumakis, led the ceremony of planting the tree of liberty on 23 July; at Cephalonia, Jacobin clubs were established, and proposed the abolition of Christianity and the restoration of Ancient Greek religion and of the Olympic Games; everywhere the burning of the Libro d'Oro and the symbols of nobility was accompanied by festivities by the populace. In Zakynthos, the more established presence of pro-French and Jacobin-influenced elements led to some violence against the nobility, but elsewhere the new regime took power mostly peacefully, and proceeded to reform society and administration; following the abolition of the nobility's privileges, proposals were made for debt relief, and a land reform involving the feudal lands, increasing the competences of local government, etc. The French revolutionary songs Carmagnole and the Marseillaise, in their original lyrics or in various translations and adaptations, traditional Greek revolutionary songs, and the works of Rigas Feraios and the democratic Zakynthian poet Antonios Martelaos, enjoyed great popularity. For the first time, extensive use of the Greek language was made in public documents, which were headed with the words \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Equality\\", and dated, in imitation of the French Revolutionary calendar, as the \\"First Year of Greek Liberty\\" (ŒßœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºòŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ±œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ). The new political and administrative reality also demanded that new terms were invented, and thus introduced into the modern Greek language along with the ideas of the French Revolution. All these events signified a complete break from the Venetian regime. The Provisional Municipality of Venice was left to lodge a formal but ineffective protest, on 4 August, to the French ambassador, Lallemant. In August, Gentili began a 40-day tour of the Islands, confirming the firm installation of the new regime. Annexation to France The pro-French elements in Zakynthos soon sent emissaries to Napoleon for an outright annexation of the Islands to France. In Corfu, the pro-Venetian tendency initially prevailed in the Provisional Municipality, hoping to be included in a reorganized Venetian state. Eventually, however, the pro-French faction won out, particularly after attempts to get Austria to intervene in Corfu failed to elicit any response; on 5 October Napoleon declared himself ready to cede Venice itself to the Austrians, but was determined to keep the Ionian Islands. The pro-French faction eventually prevailed in Lefkada as well, while Cephalonia remained divided, and Preveza pro-Venetian. Finally, in the Treaty of Campo Formio of 17 October, the last vestiges of the Republic of Venice were swept away. According to its provisions, Austria annexed most of the mainland domains of Venice, including the city itself. The Ionian Islands, the \\"most valuable part of Venice\\" according to French Foreign Minister Talleyrand, was left to the \\"full sovereignty\\" of France. Very quickly, the Provisional Municipalities of the islands petitioned Napoleon to annex the islands outright, and Gentili's reports to Napoleon also indicated that the population was favourable to a full integration with the French Republic. On 1 November Napoleon's stepson Eug√®ne de Beauharnais arrived at Corfu, and on the same day announced to the Provisional Municipality the terms of the Treaty of Campo Formio, and the annexation of the islands to France. The news was received with great enthusiasm by the council, which awarded Eugene with a sword, and voted to send a delegation to convey its gratitude to Napoleon. Antoine Gentili, first French governor of the Ionian Islands On 7 November, Napoleon issued a decree creating the departments (d√©partements in French, œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒøŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥ŒπŒ± in Greek) of Corcyre, Ithaque, and Mer-√âg√©e. Corcyre comprised the island of Corfu and its neighbouring island groups, and the mainland exclaves of Butrint and Parga; Ithaque comprised Lefkada, Ithaca, Cephalonia and other minor islands, as well as Preveza and Vonitsa on the mainland; Mer- √âg√©e comprised Zakynthos, Kythira and Antikythira, and other minor islands. Each department was run by a five-member committee (commission d√©partementale) and its administration was divided into twelve sections (Commerce and Arts, Police, Gambling, Theatre, National Guard, Waters and Cisterns, Public Buildings, Military Lodgings, Furniture and Food Provisions, Health and Prisons, Public and Private Schools, Mores and Religions). Each department was further subdivided into cantons with a municipal committee for each (five- member for cantons under 5,000 residents, seven-member for above). Cities were also divided into cantons, which received new names evocative of the new ethos: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, France, Greece, Commerce, etc. A French commissioner, who had to sign off on all decisions, was assigned to each department; a commissioner-general of the French Directory was established at Corfu, a post provisionally occupied by Gentili. In turn, each department was to send a representative to the Directory in Paris. As an integral part of the French Republic, the French Constitution of 1795 was applied across the islands, and all Ionian public authorities and vessels were to be issued with French insignia and passports. The defence of the new French possession was assumed by the Division du Levant, whose commanding general was also the supreme police authority, and a naval squadron of ten ships. Gentili was replaced as commanding general by g√©n√©ral de division Louis Fran√ßois Jean Chabot on 22 December, and the lawyer was appointed as commissioner-general on 7 January 1798. He did not immediately come to the Islands, however; informed of the bad state of public finances, he toured Italy for several months trying to secure funds, mostly in vain, until he succeeded in concluding a 500,000-franc loan with the Republic of Ragusa. Comeyras did not arrive in Corfu until 28 July, and engaged in the reorganization of the islands' administration with much energy. His tenure proved brief, however, as barely a month later he was recalled and replaced with . Among his achievements were the establishment of a five-man team of legal experts to revise the appeals process, and of three gendarmerie companies to provide police services. Comeyras left Corfu in early September, before his successor arrived; he died at Ancona of an epidemic. Among the beneficial measures of the French authorities were the great care shown to public health and education. The public school system‚Äîwhich was partly funded by secularizing Catholic Church property‚Äîwas expanded and French-language schools founded, a \\"National Library\\" was founded by Comeyras' secretary, Paris, in May, and a \\"National Printing Office\\" under the Frenchman Jouenne on 11 August. The French also planned to establish further printing offices, send children to France for education, and create a regular shipping route to Italy. Reactions to French rule: From enthusiasm to disenchantment The French occupation of the Islands gave rise to hopes among Greek emigrants and intellectuals in Western Europe that they could be used as a springboard for a liberation of Greece. In July 1797, Rigas Feraios published his Constitution of the Hellenic Republic, based on the French revolutionary constitutions of 1793 and 1795. For a time Napoleon appeared receptive to proposals of a Greek uprising, and entertained contacts with the Maniots in southern Greece, Ali Pasha of Yanina, and Ibrahim Pasha of Scutari. He even sent the Corsican Greek military officer Demetrio Stefanopoli as his envoy to the Ionian Islands and Mani, who on his return in 1798 openly spoke of a restored Byzantine Empire and \\"Franco-Greek liberty\\" up to the Bosporus. At the same time, in Ancona, an \\"Executive Directory for the Commerce of Corsica, Malta, Zakynthos, Cephalonia, Corfu, the French Isles of the Adriatic, the Archipelago, and Egypt\\" was established with Greek and French members, aiming to collect intelligence and foment insurrection. In the event these machinations came to nothing, once the French were committed to the invasion of Egypt, rather than the Balkan provinces of the Ottoman Empire. While initially enjoying broad support, the French regime soon began to loose some of its appeal. The heavy taxation and strict fiscal administration were widely resented, while the dismissive attitude of the French towards religion and the traditions of the Ionian people, coupled with the predatory behaviour of French troops, made them increasingly unpopular. Although the Greek clergy had supported the installation of the democratic regime and even participated actively in it, the French generally treated the clergy with hostility, as can be seen by their demand that all clerics wear the tricolour cockade on pain of execution. The nobles were opposed to the French from the outset, and maintained contacts with Austria, never losing the opportunity to foment popular resentment, but even the new democratic clubs like the \\"Patriotic Society\\" and the \\"Constitutional Club\\", making full use of the very liberty granted by the French, began criticizing Gentili and questioning the necessity of French presence in the Ionian Islands; the Constitutional Club was eventually closed by the French authorities. French diplomatic manoeuvring, notably the cession of Venice to Austria, also estranged parts of the populace: in December 1797, rumours began circulating that the same fate awaited the Ionian Islands, with the mainland exclaves to be sold to the Ottomans. Chabot intervened forcefully to quell the rumours, and expelled the Latin archbishop Francisco Fenzi, who was considered as the instigator of the rumours, on 11 April 1798. Conversely, the news of the French occupation of Malta and Alexandria, as part of Napoleon's invasion of the Ottoman territories in the Levant, were received with enthusiasm. French relations with Ali Pasha The main external concern of the French administration was its relationship to its most important neighbour, the powerful and ambitious Ali Pasha of Yanina, semi-autonomous Ottoman ruler of much of Albania and mainland Greece. Already on 1 June 1797, Ali Pasha himself had taken the initiative, sending a letter to Napoleon expressing his respect and admiration, hopes of friendly relations, and the dispatch of four French artillery NCOs to train the Pasha's own artillery. Both Napoleon and the Directory received this with favour, and instructed Gentili to establish amicable relations with the ruler of Yanina. Louis Dupr√© Gentili met in person with Ali at Butrint during his tour of the islands, and French envoys, notably adjudant-g√©n√©ral Roze, were frequent visitors at his court in Yanina. Roze was even wed to an adopted daughter of Ali's. Ali managed to convince the French of his good intentions, showering them with honours and providing food‚Äîand even feigning interest in Jacobin ideals‚Äîbut his main objective, the cession of the mainland exclaves of the Ionian Islands, was rebuffed. Gentili did, however, lift the prohibition on Ottoman ships from traversing the Straits of Corfu, which had been in place since the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz. This allowed Ali to move over sea against his rival, Mustafa Pasha of Delvino. In July/August 1797 (or in Easter 1798, according to other sources), his forces sailed to Lukovo and committed massacres against the local population, forcing them to submit to Ali's authority. Relations became strained in 1798, after Ali received orders from the Sultan to provide troops for a campaign against another powerful regional ruler, the pasha of Vidin, Osman Pazvantoƒülu. Chabot sent his adjutant, Schaeffer, ostensibly to demarcate the boundaries at Butrint, but in reality to dissuade Ali from obeying, as the French had good relations with Pazvantoƒülu. Ali Pasha used the opportunity to complain of the lack of reciprocation for his friendly gestures, and claimed that only if the French provided him with 10,000 troops and 100,000 sequins would he be able to disobey the Sultan. In mid-June, Napoleon's aide-de-camp, Lavalette, arrived in the Islands, bearing news of the capture of Malta and a letter from Napoleon to Ali Pasha, urging him to put faith in Lavalette and in turn send a trusted envoy of his own to Napoleon. As Ali was absent in the campaign against Pazvantoƒülu, Lavalette was unable to hand over the letter. In reality, Napoleon's invasion of Egypt caused Ali deep concern about ultimate French designs. While the French authorities in the Islands believed in Ali's friendship and considered that his domains shielded them from attack by the Sultan's forces, Ali decided to side with the Sultan, particularly after news of the Battle of the Nile arrived. In preparation for the inevitable conflict, the ruler of Yanina patched up his differences with all neighbouring rulers and magnates, as with the Souliotes. Russo-Ottoman conquest of the Ionian Islands The French invasion of Egypt had upset the balance of power in the East, and caused a rapprochement between the Ottomans and the Russian Empire, who concluded an alliance in July 1798 (although the official treaty was delayed until January 1799). As the joint Russo-Ottoman fleet set sail for the Ionian Islands, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V sent a missive to the clergy and people of the Islands, denouncing the impious and godless French, urging the inhabitants to drive them off, and assuring them that the Sublime Porte would allow them to choose their own form of government, on the model of the Republic of Ragusa. The same assurances were repeated in a proclamation by the head of the Russian fleet, Fyodor Ushakov, who also emphasized that the joint fleets were operating to liberate the Islanders from the \\"heathen French\\". The French fought back in the propaganda war, with pamphlets like the To the Rhomaioi of Greece by the Greek Konstantinos Stamatis and Emile Gaudin's Reflections of a Philhellene (translated into Greek by Stamatis) being printed and circulated in large numbers. =Ali Pasha's attacks on Butrint and Preveza= The French defending the ruins of the ancient theatre of Nicopolis against Ali Pasha's forces Chabot, the military governor of the Islands, received news of the Russo-Ottoman declaration of war on France on 3 October 1798, at Lixouri. At this time, Ali Pasha's forces had already assembled in the settlements around Butrint. Biding his time, Ali invited adjudant-g√©n√©ral Roze for negotiations to Filiates, but once he had learned as much as he could about French strength and dispositions at Corfu and elsewhere, he ordered him taken prisoner to Yanina. Ali tried to repeat the same stratagem with the commandant of Butrint, but he sent only Lieutenant Steil and a Greek priest; both were arrested and brought to Yanina. Ali composed a letter to Chabot, demanding the cession of the mainland exclaves, as well as the Castle of Santa Maura on Lefkada. A second letter followed soon after, where he demanded the surrender of Corfu itself. The new commissioner-general, Dubois, arrived at about the same time, and on 13 October issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of the three departments. During the following days, the commandant of Butrint reported that Ali's troops were moving to occupy the heights around the town, and asked for reinforcements. The attack began on 18 October. Chabot sent g√©n√©ral de brigade with 300 men, and came himself to supervise the defence. Unable to withstand the vastly larger numbers of Ali's troops, on 25 October the French blew up the fortifications and evacuated to Corfu, along with the Greek inhabitants of the town and its environs. At the same time, Ali's forces moved on Preveza. There the French, anticipating an attack, had begun erecting fieldworks at the isthmus leading to the town, at the site of ancient Nicopolis. On 22 October Ali himself, accompanied by his son Mukhtar and some 4,000 foot and 3,000 horse, appeared. The French, under g√©n√©ral de brigade , could muster only 700 French regulars, 200 militiamen, and 70 Souliotes. The ensuing Battle of Nicopolis was extremely bloody, with most of the French troops killed or captured, the latter including La Salcette. After capturing Preveza, Ali had the pro-French inhabitants publicly executed, and torched the town. Using the unsuspecting Metropolitan of Arta, Ali then lured the Prevezans who had fled to Aktion to return, and had them too beheaded. The French prisoners were subjected to torture, and those who survived were sent to Constantinople. Vonitsa too surrendered afterwards, and only Parga was left to resist Ali's forces. General Chabot tried to enlist Mustafa Pasha of Delvino against Ali Pasha, but failed. =Operations of the Russo-Ottoman fleet= The Russo-Ottoman fleet arrived at Kythira on 7 October 1797. The French garrison, 68 strong under Captain Michel, refused repeated offers of surrender. After naval bombardment and attacks by Ottoman infantry, on 13 October the French agreed to surrender the island's fort under terms. From Kythira the fleet sailed to Zakynthos via Koroni. On Zakynthos, the French position was precarious. The nobles on the island were joined by a large pro-Russian faction, while leading members of the French administration were missing at this crucial moment: commissioner was in Paris, the head of the administration was in Corfu for consultations, and general La Salcette was in Lefkada and then Preveza. The burden of defending the island fell on Major Vernier, who disposed of 400 French soldiers and 500 militia. The fleet appeared off the island on 24 October. While many of the inhabitants of Zakynthos town fled to the interior in fear of bombardment, large numbers of peasants, bearing Russian flags, streamed into the town to prevent the French and their supporters from providing any resistance. The latter were forced to retreat behind the walls of the citadel, while the peasants opened the jails, looted the administrative buildings, and burned the tree of liberty along with all official documents at the Square of St. Mark's. The looting spread to the houses of individual pro-democratic citizens, as well as to the Jewish quarter. A delegation of nobles, led by Count Nikolaos Gradenigos Sgouros and the protopapas Soumakis went to Ushakov to offer the capitulation of the island. A detachment of 700 Russians, along with a few Turks, landed on the island and joined the mass assembled in the town, laying siege to the citadel. The French garrison surrendered on 25 October. Vernier and 54 others were left free to return to France, while the rest were moved to Glarentza as prisoners of war, before being shipped to Constantinople. Medal presented by the inhabitants of Cephalonia to Admiral Ushakov in 1800, with his likeness on the obverse and a depiction of the siege of Corfu on the reverse The next target of the Russo-Ottoman fleet was Cephalonia. As in Zakynthos, there too a broad pro-Russian movement, fanned by Russian agents, the clergy, and the nobility, had come into existence. The French under Captain Royer disposed of no more than 350 men, who had to defend the island's two major towns, Argostoli and Lixouri. Given that both were completely unfortified, and amidst daily growing and more blatant hostility by the population, the French decided to withdraw to the Assos Castle, and thence evacuate to Lefkada. Upon their departure from Argostoli, the inhabitants, joined by armed peasants, tore down the French flag and hoisted the Russian one instead. Amidst rioting and violence, the democratic regime was abolished. When the Russo-Ottoman fleet arrived on 29 October, the island was no longer under French control. The French garrison of Lixouri successfully evaded to Lefkada, but was taken captive by armed peasants, while those of Argostoli managed to reach Assos only to surrender to the Russians, and be in turn transported to Constantinople. In Ithaca, the local inhabitants convinced the French garrison, under Captain Millet, that resistance was futile, and urged them to withdraw to Corfu. Unlike the other islands, the withdrawal of the French took place in an orderly and friendly atmosphere. When Ushakov sent two of his ships to the island, the inhabitants submitted. In Lefkada, the anti-French agitation had also had a profound effect; the local authorities informed the French that they could not count on the support of the populace, which was rapidly arming itself, against the Russians. The French, under Major Mialet, withdrew to the Castle of Santa Maura. Reinforced by the garrison of Vonitsa, and some remnants of the garrison of Preveza, he disposed of about 500 men. On 28 October, the Russian flag was hoisted in the town hall, and remained there despite French threats to the inhabitants. A squadron of the Russo-Ottoman fleet arrived soon after, and after the refusal of the French to surrender, began to besiege the fortress. Eventually the rest of the fleet under Ushakov arrived, and after several days of close blockade and bombardment, the French surrendered on 17 November. Ushakov allowed 20 French officers to depart for France immediately, but the rest were sent to captivity in Constantinople. =Siege and fall of Corfu= The fortifications of Corfu city, With the fall of Lefkada, Corfu remained as the last bastion of French control in the Ionian Islands. There too, the anti-French and pro-Russian sentiment had been gaining ground, and the exhortations of commissioner-general Dubois largely failed to have an impact. French forces on the island, augmented by the garrisons of Ithaca and Parga, amounted to 1,500 infantry and some 300 artillerymen, as well as 8 naval vessels. To augment this force, on 23 October martial law was declared and a militia formed, followed by compulsory levies from the wealthy and confiscations of food and animals. On 2 November, the inhabitants of Corfu city were disarmed, but when the French tried to repeat this at the suburb of Mantouki the next day, they met violent resistance, leading to the bombardment and evacuation of the suburb, and the looting of the Platytera Monastery. The rest of the suburbs were disarmed without major incident. Preparations for a siege also included the levelling of the quarter of Sano Rocco at the main entrance to the city, and the fortification of the island of Vido. The first enemy ships arrived off the city on 5 November, landing troops north and south of the city. Russian offers for a capitulation, including the immediate transfer of the garrison to a French port, were rejected. Hostilities began on 9 November with skirmishes between the two sides. On 19 November, Ushakov arrived from Lefkada with the remainder of the fleet. His main priority was to restore order to the island, where the collapse of French authority had unleashed an orgy of looting, murder, and arson. Count Nikolettos Voulgaris was appointed to head the civil administration, while the peasantry was organized to support the siege. The Russo-Ottoman forces were further augmented by 3,000 Turco-Albanians sent by Ali Pasha, while on the French side volunteer detachments from Corfu and Cephalonia distinguished themselves. On 3 February 1799, three French ships managed to break the blockade and went to Ancona, carrying pleas for reinforcements‚Äîas well as art objects looted from Corfu‚Äîbut the reinforcements never arrived. The capture of Vido island on 1 March 1799 signalled the beginning of the end for the besieged, and the garrison capitulated on 4 March, on condition that the French troops be repatriated immediately. Aftermath In all the islands they occupied, the Russians installed provisional administrations of nobles and burghers. Very soon, the Russian authorities invited assemblies of the nobles to undertake the governance of the Ionian Islands, thereby restoring the previous status quo. On 6 May, the commanders of the two fleets announced that the Ionian Islands would comprise a unitary state, governed by a Senate (ŒìŒµœÅŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±) in Corfu city, composed of three representatives each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from Ithaca, Kythira, and Paxoi. The Venetian nobleman , the last Venetian provveditore of Argostoli, was appointed head of the Senate, and entrusted with the creation of a constitution for the new state. Orio's constitution envisaged a thoroughly aristocratic regime, with each island headed by a Great Council composed of the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie. The Great Councils would elected the senators. Each island would retain a local administration and a treasury, but a central treasury would exist in Corfu. The Senate was the ultimate executive authority, and its chairman the head of state. A Minor Council of 40 would be elected by the Great Councils of the three largest islands, and would be responsible for justice, the selection of officials, and advising on legislation. On 21 June, at Ushakov's instigation, a Greek Orthodox archbishopric was re-established on the islands as the Metropolis of Corfu. The aged protopapas Mantzaros elected to fill the post, but died before he could be consecrated. A heated and protracted struggle between the priest Petros Voulgaris and the scholar and former archbishop of Kherson and Astrakhan, Nikiforos Theotokis, followed, but with Ushakov's intervention the new see was finally filled with the election of the Ierotheos Kigalas on 19 February 1800. Flag of the Septinsular Republic On 21 June 1799, the Senate decided to send a twelve-member delegation to Constantinople and Saint Petersburg to express its gratitude to the Sultan and Tsar, but also press for the restoration of the Islands' maritime and land frontier with the withdrawal of Ali Pasha from Butrint, Preveza, and Vonitsa, and their recognition as an independent state. As Angelo Orio participated in the delegation, he was replaced as head of the Senate by Spyridon Theotokis. Once in Constantinople, however, the delegation quickly realized that the Porte was not interested in recognizing the Islands' independence, but rather in creating a vassal state under Ottoman suzerainty. At the suggestion of the Russian ambassador, , the delegation submitted a memorandum to the other ambassadors, requesting the recognition of the Islands as an independent and federal state, under the protection of the European powers. Two of the delegates, the Corfiot Count Antonio Maria Capodistrias and the Zakynthian Count Nikolaos Gradenigos Sigouros Desyllas remained in Constantinople to conduct negotiations with the Porte, while Orio and another delegate, Kladas, were to represent the Ionian cause in Saint Petersburg. The negotiations between Russia, the Porte, and the Islands, led to the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople on 2 April 1800, which created the Septinsular Republic, under joint Russian and Ottoman protection. The new state proved politically unstable, but retained its precarious autonomy. The islands remained de facto under Russian influence and military protection, becoming thus involved in the Russian conflicts with France and Ali Pasha. The Septinsular Republic survived until 1807, when the Treaty of Tilsit once again surrendered the islands to France. While the Republic was abolished, its constitution and forms of governance were retained during this second period of French rule. The renewed French presence in the area aroused the opposition of the British, who instigated a naval blockade of the islands. In October 1809, British forces easily took Zakynthos, Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Kythira, followed by Lefkada in April 1810. Only Corfu, Parga, and Paxoi held out, amidst a deteriorating supply situation, until the 1814 and the resignation of Napoleon. The Islands then passed under British control, and were formed into the United States of the Ionian Islands in 1815.

The Hebrew Gospel hypothesis (or proto-Gospel hypothesis or Aramaic Matthew hypothesis) is a group of theories based on the proposition that a lost gospel in Hebrew or Aramaic lies behind the four canonical gospels. It is based upon an early Christian tradition, deriving from the 2nd-century bishop Papias of Hierapolis, that the apostle Matthew composed such a gospel. Papias appeared to say that this Hebrew or Aramaic gospel was subsequently translated into the canonical gospel of Matthew, but modern studies have shown this to be untenable. Modern variants of the hypothesis survive, but have not found favor with scholars as a whole. Basis of the Hebrew gospel hypothesis: Papias and the early church fathers The idea that some or all of the gospels were originally written in a language other than Greek begins with Papias of Hierapolis, c. 125‚Äì150 CE. In a passage with several ambiguous phrases, he wrote: \\"Matthew collected the oracles (logia ‚Äì sayings of or about Jesus) in the Hebrew language (Hebra√Ødi dialekt≈çi ‚Äî perhaps alternatively \\"Hebrew style\\") and each one interpreted (hƒìrmƒìneusen ‚Äî or \\"translated\\") them as best he could.\\" Some have claimed that by \\"Hebrew\\" Papias would have meant Aramaic, the common language of the Middle East beside koine Greek. A 2014 survey of contemporary texts asserts that \\"Hebra√Ødi\\" meant Hebrew and never Aramaic.R. Buth and C. Pierce \\"Hebraisti in Ancient Texts: Does ·ºëŒ≤œÅŒ±œäœÉœÑŒØ Ever Mean 'Aramaic'?\\" in Buth and Notley, edd., The Language Environment of First Century Judaea, Brill, 2014:66-109. Nevertheless, Matthew's Greek \\"reveals none of the telltale marks of a translation.\\" However, Blomberg states that \\"Jewish authors like Josephus, writing in Greek while at times translating Hebrew materials, often leave no linguistic clues to betray their Semitic sources.\\" Scholars have put forward several theories to explain Papias: perhaps Matthew wrote two gospels, one, now lost, in Hebrew, the other the preserved Greek version; or perhaps the logia was a collection of sayings rather than the gospel; or by dialekt≈çi Papias may have meant that Matthew wrote in the Jewish style rather than in the Hebrew language. Nevertheless, on the basis of this and other information Jerome (c. 327‚Äì420) claimed that all the Jewish Christian communities shared a single gospel, identical with the Hebrew or Aramaic Matthew; he also claimed to have personally found this gospel in use among some communities in Syria. Jerome's testimony is regarded with skepticism by modern scholars. Jerome claims to have seen a gospel in Aramaic that contained all the quotations he assigns to it, but it can be demonstrated that some of them could never have existed in a Semitic language. His claim to have produced all the translations himself is also suspect, as many are found in earlier scholars such as Origen and Eusebius. Jerome appears to have assigned these quotations to the Gospel of the Hebrews, but it appears more likely that there were at least two and probably three ancient Jewish-Christian gospels, only one of them in a Semitic language. = Quotes by Church Fathers = Composition of Matthew: modern consensus The Gospel of Matthew is anonymous: the author is not named within the text and nowhere does he claim to have been an eyewitness to events. It probably originated in a Jewish-Christian community in Roman Syria towards the end of the first century AD, and there is little doubt among modern scholars that it was composed in Koine Greek, the daily language of the time [although this is disputed; see, for example, Carmignac, \\"Birth of the Synoptics\\", and Tresmontant, \\"The Hebrew Christ\\", both of whom postulate early Hebrew gospels.] The author, who is not named in the text itself but who was universally accepted by the early church to be the apostle Matthew, drew on three main sources, the Gospel of Mark, possibly the hypothetical sayings collection known as the Q source, both in Greek, and material unique to his own community, called M. Mark and Q were both written sources composed in Greek, but some of the parts of Q may have been translated from Aramaic into Greek more than once. M is comparatively small, only 170 verses, made up almost exclusively of teachings; it probably was not a single source, and while some of it may have been written, most seems to have been oral. Modern forms of the hypothesis: the synoptic problem The synoptic gospels are the three gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke: they share much the same material in much the same order, and are clearly related. The precise nature of the relationship is the synoptic problem. The most widely held solution to the problem today is the two-source theory, which holds that Mark, plus another, hypothetical source, Q, were used by Matthew and Luke. But while this theory has widespread support, there is a notable minority view that Mark was written last using Matthew and Luke (the two-gospel hypothesis). Still other scholars accept Markan priority, but argue that Q never existed, and that Luke used Matthew as a source as well as Mark (the Farrer hypothesis). A further, and very minority, theory is that there was a single gospel written in Hebrew or Aramaic. Today, this hypothesis is held to be discredited by most experts. As outlined subsequently, this was always a minority view, but in former times occasionally rather influential, and advanced by some eminent scholars: =Early modern period= Richard Simon of Normandy in 1689Histoire critique du texte du Nouveau Testament, Rotterdam 1689. asserted that an Aramaic or Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, lay behind the Nazarene Gospel, and was the Proto- Gospel. J. J. GriesbachCommentatio qua Marci evangelium totum e Matthaei et Lucae commentariis decerptum esse monstratur, Ienae 1794, treated this as the first of three source theories as solutions to the synoptic problem, following (1) the traditional Augustinian utilization hypothesis, as (2) the original gospel hypothesis or proto-gospel hypothesis, (3) the fragment hypothesis (Koppe);Marcus non epitomator Matthaei, Programme Universit√§t Gottingen (Helmstadii, 1792); reprinted in D. J. Pott and G. A. Ruperti (eds.), Sylloge commentationum theologicarum, vol. I (Helmstadii, 1800), pp. 35-69. and (4) the oral gospel hypothesis or tradition hypothesis (Herder 1797).Von Gottes Sohn, der Welt Heiland, nach Johannes Evangelium. Nebst einer Regel der Zusammenstimmung unserer Evangelien aus ihrer Entstehung und Ordnung, Riga, 1797. =18th century: Lessing, Olshausen= Gotthold Ephraim Lessing whose suggested a lost Hebrew Gospel as a free source for the Synoptic Gospels A comprehensive basis for the original-gospel hypothesis was provided in 1804 by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn,Einleitung in das neue Testament, Leipzig, Weidmann 1804. who argued for an Aramaic original gospel that each of the Synoptic evangelists had in a different form.. Related is the \\"Aramaic Matthew hypothesis\\" of Theodor Zahn,Einleitung in das Neue Testament, Leipzig 1897. who shared a belief in an early lost Aramaic Matthew, but did not connect it to the surviving fragments of the Gospel of the Hebrews in the works of Jerome. 18th Century scholarship was more critical. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1778) posited several lost Aramaic Gospels as Ur-Gospel or proto-Gospel common sources used freely for the three Greek Synoptic Gospels.\\"Neue Hypothese √ºber die Evangelisten als blos menschliche Geschichtsschreiber betrachtet\\", in Karl Gotthelf Lessing (ed.), Gotthold Ephraim Lessings Theologischer Nachlass, Christian Friedrich Vo√ü und Sohn, Berlin 1784, pp 45-73. Johann Gottfried Eichhorn posited four intermediate Ur-Gospels, while Johann Gottfried von Herder argued for an oral Gospel tradition as an unwritten Urgospel, leading to Friedrich Schleiermacher's view of Logia as a Gospel source.. Hermann Olshausen (1832) suggested a lost Hebrew Matthew was the common source of Greek Matthew and the Jewish-Christian Gospels mentioned by Epiphanius, Jerome and others.. L√©on Vaganay (1940),. Lucien Cerfaux, Xavier L√©on-Dufour and Antonio Gaboury (1952) attempted to revive Lessing's proto-gospel hypothesis. =Nicholson, Handmann= Edward Nicholson (1879) proposed that Matthew wrote two Gospels, the first in Greek, the second in Hebrew. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1915) in its article Gospel of the Hebrews noted that Nicholson cannot be said ...[to] have carried conviction to the minds of New Testament scholars.\\". Rudolf Handmann (1888) proposed an Aramaic Gospel of the Hebrews but reasoned that this was not the Hebrew Matthew and there never was a Hebrew Ur-Matthew.. =Edwards= James R. Edwards, in The Hebrew Gospel and the development of the synoptic tradition (2009), suggested that a lost Hebrew Ur-Matthew is the common source of both the Jewish-Christian Gospels and the unique L source material (material not sourced from Mark or Q) in the Gospel of Luke. His thesis has not been accepted by other scholars. The Hebrew gospel hypothesis and modern criticism =Multiple Jewish-Christian Gospels= Carl August Credner (1832). identified three Jewish-Christian Gospels: Jerome's Gospel of the Nazarenes, the Greek Gospel of the Ebionites cited by Epiphanius in his Panarion, and a Greek gospel cited by Origen, which he referred to as the Gospel of the Hebrews. In the 20th Century the majority school of critical scholarship, such as Hans Waitz, Philip Vielhauer and Albertus Klijn, proposed a tripartite distinction between Epiphanius' Greek Jewish Gospel, Jerome's Hebrew (or Aramaic) Gospel, and a Gospel of the Hebrews, which was produced by Jewish Christians in Egypt, and like the canonical Epistle to the Hebrews was Hebrew only in nationality not language. The exact identification of which Jewish Gospel is which in the references of Jerome, Origen and Epiphanius, and whether each church father had one or more Jewish Gospels in mind, is an ongoing subject of scholarly debate.Vielhauer, cf. Craig A. Evans, cf. Klauck However the presence in patristic testimony concerning three different Jewish Gospels with three different traditions regarding the baptism of Christ suggests multiple traditions.. =19th century= Eichhorn's Ur-Gospel hypothesis (1794/1804) won little support in the following years. General sources such as John Kitto's Cyclopedia describe the hypothesis but note that it had been rejected by almost all succeeding critics. =20th century= Acceptance of an original Gospel hypothesis in any form in the 20th century was minimal. Critical scholars had long moved on from the hypotheses of Eichhorn, Schleiermacher (1832) and K. Lachmann (1835).. Regarding the related question of the reliability of Jerome's testimony also saw few scholars taking his evidence at face value. Traditional Lutheran commentator Richard Lenski (1943) wrote regarding the \\"hypothesis of an original Hebrew Matthew\\" that \\"whatever Matthew wrote in Hebrew was so ephemeral that it disappeared completely at a date so early that even the earliest fathers never obtained sight of the writing\\". Helmut K√∂ster (2000) casts doubt upon the value of Jerome's evidence for linguistic reasons; \\"Jerome's claim that he himself saw a gospel in Aramaic that contained all the fragments that he assigned to it is not credible, nor is it believable that he translated the respective passages from Aramaic into Greek (and Latin), as he claims several times.\\" However, Lenski and Koster‚Äôs views are in sharp contrast with those of Schneemelcher. Schneemelcher cites several early fathers as seeing Hebrew Matthew including Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 2.9.45 and 5.14.96), Origen (in Joh. vol. II,12; in Jer. Vol. XV,4; in MT. vol. XV,p. 389 Benz-Kloostermann), Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica 3.25.5, 3.27.1-4, 3.39.17. 4.22.8 ‚ÄúRegarding Hegissipus (c. 180) and his memoirs Eusebius reports: He quotes from the Gospel according to the Hebrews and from the Syriac (Gospel) and in particular some words in the Hebrew tongue, showing that he was a convert from the Hebrews‚Äù, 3.24.6, 3.39.16, 5.8.2, 6.24.4, Theophania 4.12, 5.10.3), Jerome (Note by Schneemelcher ‚ÄúJerome thus reluctantly confirms the existence of two Jewish Gospels, the Gospel according to the Hebrews and an Aramaic gospel. That the latter was at hand in the library in Caesareas is not to be disputed; it is at any rate likely on the ground of the citations of Eusebius in his Theophany. It will likewise be correct that the Nazaraeans used such an Aramaic gospel, since Epiphanius also testifies to this. That the Aramaic gospel, evidence of which is given by Hegesippus and Eusebius, is identical with the Gospel of the Nazaraeans, is not indeed absolutely certain, but perfectly possible, even very probable‚Ä¶).Wilhelm Schneelmelcher, New Testament Apocrypha, volume 1, 1991 p. 134-178 New evidence regarding the provenance of Matthew (as well as Mark and Luke) was presented by Jean Carmignac in The Birth of the Synoptics (Michael J. Wrenn, trans.; Chicago: Franciscan Herald Press, 1987). Carmignac in 1963, during his work with the Dead Sea Scrolls, attempted to translate Mark from Greek to Hebrew for his use in a New Testament commentary based on the Dead Sea Scrolls. He expected many difficulties but unexpectedly discovered that the translation was not only easy, but seemed to point to Greek Mark as a translation from a Hebrew or Aramaic original. Carmignac's discovery prompted further investigation, which yielded much evidence for a Hebrew origin for Mark and Matthew, and for a Lukan source. Among the nine types of Semitisms identified among the three Synoptics, Semitisms of Transmission are probably the strongest evidence for at least Mark and possibly Matthew as direct translations from a Hebrew original text. For example, \\"Mark 11:14 speaks of eating of the fruit = YWKL (according to the spelling of Qumran) and Matthew 21:19 to produce fruit YWBL: as the letters B and K resemble each other [in Qumran Hebrew] so greatly, the possibility for confusion is very likely.\\" Carmignac's little book contains dozens of such evidences. He had intended to produce a comprehensive volume but passed away before this work could be produced. Likewise, Claude Tresmontant hypothesized Hebrew originals for all four Gospels in The Hebrew Christ. References Bibliography * . * . * . * . * . * . * . . . . * . * . * . .

Only a lively, vivid performance by Diane Cilento in a contrived role holds much interest, though a sound cast does spartan work in juggling the sparse material\\"; while Sky Movies called it \\"a rather touching and at times richly amusing extended playlet about an 'innocent' football fan from the north, and the night he spends talking to a London prostitute in her flat. Not very plausible, perhaps, but winningly done. As Cyrenne, the streetwalker, Diane Cilento is persuasive and just right. And Harry H Corbett was able to break away completely from his Steptoe image.

Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are not well adapted to locomotion on land. Four species have been recorded in New York. *Red-throated loon, Gavia stellata *Pacific loon, Gavia pacifica (N) *Common loon, Gavia immer (B) *Yellow-billed loon, Gavia adamsii (N) Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. One species has appeared in New York. *Yellow-nosed albatross, Thalassarche chlororhynchos (N) Southern storm- petrels White-faced storm-petrel Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. Two species have been recorded in New York. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus (U) *White-faced storm-petrel, Pelagodroma marina (N) Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. Two species have been recorded in New York. *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous (P) *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro (N) Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

One species has been recorded in New York. *Wood stork, Mycteria americana (N) Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. One species has been recorded in New York. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens (N) Boobies and gannets Northern gannet Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. Two species have been recorded in New York. *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (N) *Northern gannet, Morus bassanus Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas are cormorant-like water birds with very long necks and long, straight beaks. They are fish eaters which often swim with only their neck above the water. One species has been recorded in New York. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga (N) Cormorants and shags Great cormorant Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Cormorants are medium to large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed. Three species have been recorded in New York. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Double-crested cormorant, Phalacrocorax auritus (B) *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus (N) Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are very large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. Like other birds in the order Pelecaniformes, they have four webbed toes. Two species have been recorded in New York. *American white pelican, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos *Brown pelican, Pelecanus occidentalis (U) Herons, egrets, and bitterns Great blue heron Green heron Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the herons, egrets, and bitterns.

The Spanish attempt to raise the siege of the Sagunto Castle failed when the French, Italians, and Poles drove their troops off the battlefield in rout. The action took place during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Sagunto lies a short distance from the east coast of Spain, about north of Valencia. Suchet invaded the province of Valencia in September 1811. He tried to quickly seize Sagunto Castle, but its garrison under Colonel Luis Andriani repulsed two attacks and the French-Allied army was forced to lay siege to the ancient fortress. When Blake's army advanced from Valencia to raise the siege, Suchet posted his somewhat smaller army to resist the Spanish. Blake's attack on Suchet's right flank went awry and soon the poorly-trained Spanish troops were fleeing. The Spanish troops attacking Suchet's left flank were made of sterner stuff, however, and the contest there was more severe. Finally, the Imperial troops gained the upper hand and put almost the entire Spanish army to flight. The garrison of Sagunto Castle soon surrendered and Blake's soldiers limped back to Valencia where they tried to put that city's defences in order. Background =Armies= Under the command of Louis Gabriel Suchet, the French Army of Aragon successfully concluded the Siege of Tortosa on 2 January 1811 and the Siege of Tarragona on 29 June 1811. In the latter operation, the French killed or captured 15,000 Spanish troops, wiping out two-thirds of Catalonia's army. French losses were 4,300 killed and wounded. Tarragona's capture earned Suchet his marshal's baton. Emperor Napoleon desired to subjugate the Province of Valencia, but that campaign had to wait until the French recaptured the Sant Ferran Castle, which sat on a major road between France and Spain. The Siege of Figueras ended on 19 August 1811 with a Spanish surrender. Six days afterward, Napoleon ordered Suchet to advance and seize Valencia. The emperor assumed that the Spanish Army of Valencia was in a panic and that the city would be easy prey for the Imperial French army. Napoleon erred; Sagunto Castle would hold out for weeks. According to historian Charles Oman, the Valencian Army had the \\"worst fighting reputation\\" of all the Spanish armies. During the campaign which ended with the fall of Tarragona, the army proved incapable of assisting the garrison. In October 1811 the army numbered 36,000 men, including the Reserve Division consisting of newly-raised 3rd Battalions of old regiments. The 3rd Battalions suffered from having too few officers. The only first-class formations were the divisions of Major Generals Miguel Lardizabal y Uribe and Jos√© Pascual de Zayas y Chac√≥n, veterans of the Battle of Albuera. When Blake took command of the Army of Valencia, he brought with him from C√°diz these two divisions. It was hoped that the Army of Murcia under Lieutenant General Nicol√°s de Mahy y Romo might help defend Valencia from Suchet's expected attack. Marshal Suchet's Army of Aragon counted 50,000 troops, but after deducting garrisons and sick there were only 31,000 men available in the field. There were also 15,000 soldiers in the divisions of Generals of Division Honor√© Charles Reille and Filippo Severoli in Navarre and western Aragon. These good troops would soon be assigned to Suchet's command. General of Division Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen's French Army of Catalonia numbered 23,000 soldiers. However, because the Catalan miquelets were so active, not a single man could be spared from Decaen's force. Suchet assigned the division of General of Division Bernard-Georges-Fran√ßois Fr√®re, 7,000 men, to protect his rearward communications. Suchet carefully selected 22,000 of his best infantry for the Valencian campaign, leaving 6,800 of his least effective men to garrison his supply line. The only problematic element of the Imperial French field army were the 1,500 Neapolitans under General of Division Claude Antoine Comp√®re. Suchet's invading army included nearly all his available cavalry and field artillery. =Operations= Suchet's left column advanced southwest along the coast road from Tortosa, where the French siege train and the bulk of the stores were kept. In the 11,000-strong coastal column, were General of Division Pierre-Joseph Habert's French infantry division, General of Brigade Louis Beno√Æt Robert's infantry brigade from General of Division Louis Fran√ßois F√©lix Musnier's French division, almost all the cavalry and all the field artillery. General of Brigade Florentin Ficatier's brigade from Musnier's division accompanied the slow-moving siege guns. Musnier did not join the expedition; instead, he commanded the garrisons guarding the French supply line. The center column moved south on the mountain road via Alca√±iz and Morella. The 7,000-man column consisted of General of Division Giuseppe Federico Palombini's Italian infantry division and Comp√®re's Neapolitans. The right column marched southeast on the mountain road from Teruel and comprised 5,000 men from General of Division Jean Isidore Harispe's French infantry division. Harispe faced the greatest danger because his troops were nearest to Blake's Spanish army. As it happened, Blake resigned himself to a passive defense from the beginning. Instead he urged his soldiers to construct a fortified and entrenched line covering Valencia. About twenty miles to the north of Valencia at Sagunto, Blake ordered a powerful fortress to be built. In March 1810, the abandoned site contained only the hilltop ruins of the Roman city of Saguntum which was later occupied by the Moors. On the recommendation of the British officer Charles William Doyle, Spanish workers restored the old walls by filling the gaps with stone blocks from the ancient ruins. The Roman theater, relatively intact up to this time, was dismantled to provide building materials. However, the work was still unfinished when Suchet's army advanced. The fortress was manned by 2,663 soldiers under the command of Colonel Andriani. There were five battalions, including two newly- raised 3rd Battalions. The garrison had 17 cannons of which only three were 12-pounders and the rest lighter pieces. The Spanish also garrisoned Peniscola with 1,000 soldiers and Oropesa del Mar with 500 more. On 15 September, all three Imperial French columns began to move. Two days later, Suchet's left column bypassed Peniscola, leaving one battalion and some hussars to keep an eye on the place. On 19 September, the French coastal column threaded past the two defended towers near Oropesa. That evening, Palombini's center column joined the left column, having encountered no opposition along its route. Blake sent General Jos√© Obispo's division to block Harispe's column at the Barraques pass. Harispe detected the Spanish force and took a side road to the east to avoid Obispo. This French division marched down the valley of the Mijares River to the coast to join the other two columns. On 22 September, Suchet's entire army set out from Castell√≥n de la Plana, brushing aside 500 Spanish troops at Villarreal and the next day was before Sagunto Castle. Siege Sagunto (Saguntum) Castle On 23 September, the Imperial French army invested Sagunto Castle by sending Habert's division around its east side and Harispe's division around its west side. Suchet's cavalry swept the country south to within of Valencia without meeting significant opposition. Palombini's division hovered off to the northwest to intercept any Spanish attempt to trouble the siege. Seeing that the castle's defenses were incomplete and two gaps in the wall were visible, Suchet decided to try a coup de main at midnight on 27‚Äì28 September. Two columns, each of 300 men were formed of volunteers from Habert's division. A third supporting column of similar size was assembled in the town of Murviedro at the base of the castle hill. Habert held 2,000 men ready to support a breakthrough. To mislead the defenders, six companies of Palombini's Italians would mount a diversion against another part of the fortress. Suchet hoped that the assault would be a surprise. Jean Isidore Harispe In the dark, the French storming parties crept forward into a large cistern which was near the old Roman theater. At this point they were from the two gaps. By some accident, firing broke out and the storming columns burst from cover prematurely, only to find the Spanish defenders alert. The attackers were able to plant a number of ladders against the wall, but the Spanish troops fought with desperate courage. Every Frenchman who got to the top of the wall was killed and the ladders knocked down. The French bravely pressed forward but their opponents stoutly held their positions. At midnight Palombini's men launched their diversion, which was met by sharp musketry. However, this did not cause the garrison to transfer troops away from the main attack. The third column was committed to the main assault, but this effort also failed. Finally, the survivors pulled back behind cover. At length, Suchet authorized the storming columns to retreat. The marshal admitted losses of 247 killed and wounded, though another source claimed that 360 men were casualties, including 52 Italians. Spanish losses were only 15 killed and fewer than 30 wounded. After this failure, Suchet ordered Ficatier's brigade and the siege guns to join him. On their slow journey from Tortosa, the heavy guns would first need to blast the two Oropesa towers into submission. The French marshal divided his army into a blockade force to surround Sagunto Castle and a covering force to defend against Spanish interference. While waiting for the siege guns, the French engineering troops began to prepare battery positions and ramps to get their guns up the hill. Blake did not trust his soldiers to fight in the open field against Suchet's veteran army. Mahy, who commanded the Murcian army, complained that his troops had no confidence in their fighting abilities. In this situation, Blake hoped to force Suchet to retreat by cutting his supply line. He sent Obispo's division to Segorbe where it blocked the road from Teruel. The main effort against Suchet's communications was made by the guerillas. Sylvain Charles Val√©e Juan Mart√≠n D√≠ez, Jos√© Dur√°n and their guerilla bands attacked Calatayud, forcing its Franco-Italian defenders into a fortified convent. Mart√≠n's guerillas drove off a 1,000-strong relief column and then the Spanish forced the 560 survivors to surrender on 3 October 1811 by exploding two mines under the walls. At this time, Severoli's 7,000-strong Italian division reinforced the Imperial occupation forces of Aragon, restoring their shaken confidence. Francisco Espoz y Mina with 4,000 guerillas besieged Ejea de los Caballeros, forcing its garrison to cut its way out and join an 800-man relief column led by Colonel Ceccopieri. Not realizing Mina's strength, Ceccopieri marched his battalion of the 7th Italian Line Infantry Regiment to the relief of Ayerbe. On 16 October, Mina ambushed the Italians, killing 200 soldiers and their commander, and capturing the 600 survivors. Mina then herded his prisoners to Mutriku (Motrico) on the northern coast and handed them over to the frigate HMS Iris (44). Nevertheless, these minor disasters failed to distract Suchet from his siege of Saguntum. Poles of the Legion of the Vistula Blake made a few more ineffectual attempts to interfere with the siege. Suchet sent Palombini's division and Robert's brigade to chase Obispo's division out of Segorbe, which was easily done. On 2 October Harispe's division and Robert's brigade drove Lieutenant General Charles O'Donnell's troops out of Benaguasil, inflicting 400 casualties on the Spanish troops while sustaining about 60 casualties. Hearing a rumor that French troops were approaching from Madrid, Blake sent Mahy's Murcians on a fruitless march to Cuenca where they found only one enemy battalion, which got away. On 10 October, Suchet's siege guns reached Oropesa where they forced the surrender of 215 Spanish soldiers in the first tower. The next day, the troops in the second tower were evacuated by the ship-of-the-line HMS Magnificent (74). On 12 October the much-needed siege train reached Sagunto Castle. Ficatier's brigade was spread out to defend Segorbe, Oropesa and Almenara. Generals of Division Sylvain Charles Val√©e and Joseph Rogniat, Suchet's artillery and engineering commanders respectively, arrived with the siege train. It took Suchet's troops four days to drag the heavy guns up the hill and into battery. Because the hill was rocky, the Imperial troops had to bring earth up from the bottom of the hill in order to build parapets. On 16 October, the siege guns opened fire and by the afternoon of the 18th the gunners and engineers reported that there was a breach in the Spanish defenses at the Dos Mayo redoubt. Suchet ordered an assault for that evening. The plan called for 400 men from Habert's division to lead the attack and to be supported by Palombini's Italians. The siege guns pounded the breach until the last minute, causing losses among the defenders, who bravely stood at their posts piling sandbags and other obstructions into the breach. At 5:00 pm, the men of the storming column rushed the defenses and made it halfway up the breach before being stopped by intense fire. The few French soldiers who clawed their way to the top were stabbed or shot. The assault was a complete failure and Habert soon ordered the men to fall back. Suchet admitted losing 173 casualties, but the real total was nearer 300. After the repulse, Rogniat convinced Suchet to rely on siege methods. The defenders continued to fiercely resist and the French lost 15‚Äì20 men every day in their effort to push their works closer to the Spanish fortifications. Meanwhile, Blake again sent Obispo to seize Segorbe. Suchet countered this move by sending Palombini on 20 October with 4,500 Franco-Italian troops to clear the road to Teruel. By the 24th Palombini was back with Suchet's army. Returning from his useless excursion to Cuenca, Mahy joined Blake on 23 October and the next day Blake set out with his army to relieve Sagunto Castle. Blake's strategy of avoiding battle was deeply unpopular in Valencia and he needed to fight a battle or face being removed from his command. Battle Pierre-Joseph Habert Blake planned to attack and hold the Imperial French army with his right wing, while crushing the enemy right flank with the bulk of his army. The right wing's attack was led by the veteran infantry divisions of Zayas (2,500) and Lardizabal (3,000). These were supported by 3,500 foot soldiers of the Valencian Reserve under General Velasco, 300 horsemen under General Loy, 800 Valencian cavalry under General Caro and three batteries of artillery. Blake left wing consisted of the Valencian infantry divisions of Generals Jos√© Miranda (4,000) and Pedro Villacampa (3,350) and Jos√© Obispo (3,400), and Mahy's Murcian infantry brigades led by Generals Juan Creagh and Conde de Montijo (4,600 total). General San Juan led one brigade of 900 Valencian and a second brigade of 800 Murcian cavalry. There were 18 field guns in three batteries. O'Donnell planned to attack with Villacampa and Miranda, while Obispo came in on the Imperial right rear. Mahy and San Juan would support O'Donnell's attack, while two Murcian battalions under Colonel O'Ronan served as a link between Obispo and O'Donnell. Altogether, Blake would throw 10,500 troops against Suchet's left flank and 17,000 against his right flank. Suchet maintained the siege of Sagunto Castle with the 117th Line Infantry Regiment from Habert's division and General of Brigade √âloi Charles Balathier's brigade from Palombini's division. Comp√®re's Neapolitans watched the road to Segorbe, which runs to the northwest. Approximately 4,000 troops stayed in the siege lines. To face Blake's army, Suchet deployed 12,000 infantry, 1,800 cavalry and six batteries of field artillery, for a total of about 14,000 men. Though outnumbered nearly two to one, the French marshal was aware that his army was qualitatively superior to his opponent's army. Suchet posted Habert's division (2,500) on the left flank and Harispe's division (3,600) in the center. The reserve consisted of the 2,000 foot soldiers of General of Brigade Vertigier Saint Paul's Italian brigade and 1,300 cavalry. Guarding the right flank was Robert's brigade (2,500), Colonel Schiazzetti's Italian Napoleone Dragoon Regiment (450) and one artillery battery. At the last minute, Suchet switched the 44th Line (1,800) under General of Brigade J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki to the right flank. Ch≈Çopicki was senior to Robert, so the Pole assumed command of the right flank. Whereas the Imperial left and center were arrayed in the plain, the right flank lined the crests of the Sancti Espiritus Hills. J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki At about 7:00 am, O'Ronan's two battalions bumped into Robert's brigade and were repulsed. Next, O'Donnell's two divisions descended the Germanel Heights and moved to attack Ch≈Çopicki's troops. As they marched up the slopes of the Sancti Espritus Hills, Villacampa's division on the left was somewhat ahead of Miranda's division on the right. In second line were San Juan's cavalry and well to the rear on the Germanel Heights were Mahy's Murcian infantry. When the Spanish formations started to press back the Imperial skirmish line, Ch≈Çopicki ordered an attack. Robert's brigade came into contact with Villacampa's startled men first and pushed them to the bottom of the hill without much resistance. Between Robert's five battalions and the two battalions of the 44th Line stood Schiazzetti's dragoons. These horsemen charged downhill into the gap between the two Valencian divisions and then swerved into the left flank of Miranda's soldiers. Seeing Villacampa's division give way and the Italian dragoons boring in on their flank, Miranda's men turned and fled back to the valley. O'Donnell ordered San Juan's cavalry forward to protect his infantry. Recognizing a crisis, Mahy advanced his troops toward the action. After his stunning success, Ch≈Çopicki halted his troops, waiting to see how matters were going on the Imperial center and left. By this time, O'Donnell's two divisions were seething masses at the bottom of the hill. Having reformed his dragoons, Schiazzetti launched them at San Juan's Valencian cavalry brigade. The hapless Spanish horsemen turned and galloped away, riding over the first two of Mahy's battalions as they appeared, causing them to run away also. At this, Ch≈Çopicki waved his seven battalions forward and O'Donnell's two divisions dissolved into complete rout. The Murcian cavalry brigade and two infantry brigades also collapsed. Mahy managed to form a rearguard from one battalion each of the Cuenca and Molina (Montijo's brigade and Villacampa's division, respectively) Infantry Regiments; the rest were scattering in panic-stricken flight. Spanish losses were only about 400 killed and wounded, but the Imperial troops rounded up about 2,000 prisoners and a few cannons. Obispo's division showed up too late; O'Ronan's battalions joined it and retreated to the north. Battle of Waterloo re-enactors are dressed as French artillerymen. While the fiasco on Blake's left was playing out, the Spanish right wing began its attack. Habert kept well away from the shoreline because there were several Spanish gunboats offshore, firing cannons. On the Spanish right flank, the division of Zayas advanced and got into a musketry duel with Habert's troops, with neither side gaining the advantage. In the center, both sides tried to occupy a knoll between the battle lines, but Ladizabal's leading brigade under General Prieto got there first. Prieto quickly deployed 1,500 soldiers and a battery of artillery to defend the knoll. Suchet organized an attack spearheaded by four battalions of the 7th Line Infantry. These were supported on each flank by the 116th Line and the Poles of the 3rd Legion of the Vistula, an example of the mixed order favored by Napoleon. Two squadrons of the 4th Hussars and one squadron of the 13th Cuirassiers covered Harispe's left flank. The Imperial attack forced Prieto's men to fall back from the knoll, but not before they inflicted heavy losses on their foes; General of Brigade Marie Auguste Paris was wounded and Harispe had his horse killed under him. Lardizabal got his second brigade and a second battery into action against Harispe's troops. Meanwhile, a French battery began blasting Lardizabal's right flank. Giuseppe Palombini in Austrian service Generals Loy and Caro brought 1,100 Spanish cavalry forward and charged. Partly masked by some trees, this unexpected attack fell on the three French squadrons on Harispe's left and routed them. Loy led his troopers to capture three cannons and nearly overran the 116th Line which barely had time to wheel back at an angle to protect the Imperial flank. Caro's horsemen galloped after the beaten French cavalry. In the crisis, Suchet ordered Palombini to send Saint Paul's brigade to plug the hole in the line. The French marshal then rode to the remaining two squadrons of the 13th Cuirassiers and ordered them to charge. The 350 cuirassiers crashed into the Spanish cavalry and scattered them. Both Loy and Caro bravely tried to rally their troopers; both were badly wounded and captured. The cuirassiers rode over a Spanish battery and were only stopped when they reached the Picador stream in the Spanish rear, where they were pounded by the guns attached to the Valencian Reserve. At this time, Lardizabal's division was still holding its own in a musketry fight with Harispe's soldiers. Following in the wake of the cuirassiers, Saint Paul's Italians drove off the last of the Spanish horse, then came in on Lardizabal's unprotected right flank. Lardizabal's soldiers had performed very well, but the division finally crumbled under the pressure from front and flank. Blake had set up his command post and reserves too far to the rear to influence the battle. As one of his staff observed, Blake gave the initial order to advance and then let events take their course. When Lardizabal's troops gave way, Blake finally overcame his inertia and gave orders for his right wing to quickly retreat out of danger and began to organize a general withdrawal. Zayas was able to fend off Habert and get most of his troops across the Picador stream. The Walloon Guard battalion from Zayas' division defended the village of Puzzol where they attracted the attention of Habert's division. After a stiff fight, 400 men of the battalion were captured, but this allowed the rest of Zayas' division to get away without further loss. Lardizabal's troops were not so lucky. After falling back, their general reformed the division alongside the Reserve. There was a lull in the battle during which Suchet reordered his regiments and ordered the rallied 4th Hussars to the right to help Ch≈Çopicki round up prisoners. Then Suchet unleashed his last regiment, the 24th Dragoons, directly down the main road. The dragoons rode into Lardizabal's survivors, broke up the last formed battalions and seized two cannons and four flags. The Imperial pursuit went on for . Result Blake's army lost about 1,000 killed and wounded, mostly in the veteran divisions of Zayas and Lardizabal. The French made 4,641 prisoners and captured 12 guns. The 2nd Regiment of Badajoz lost 17 officers and 521 men out of 800, mostly taken prisoner. Harispe and Habert lost 41 officer casualties while battling the two divisions of Spanish veterans; Ch≈Çopicki and Robert sustained only seven officer casualties. As usual, Suchet understated his losses at 130 killed and 590 wounded. Total Spanish casualties came to around 6,000. French losses were probably around 1,000 killed and wounded. The next day, Suchet sent an emissary to Andriani, asking for the garrison's surrender. Andriani soon gave in. After seeing the army of relief dispersed before their eyes, the troops of the garrison had no more stomach for a siege. By this time, the French siege trenches were very close to the Spanish defenses. The Dos Mayo redoubt was in ruins from the bombardment and would probably have fallen to the next assault. The 2,500 survivors became French prisoners, though 200 of them were too sick or injured to be moved from the hospital. Most of the 17 guns were knocked out and their ammunition was low, though there were enough musket cartridges to prolong the defense. Suchet might have advanced to Valencia and scattered the 22,000 survivors of Blake's demoralized army. Instead, the French marshal paused after his victory. After providing a garrison for Sagunto Castle and detaching a brigade to escort the Spanish prisoners to the rear, he had only 15,000 men available for field operations. Suchet declined to use Ficatier's brigade because it secured the roads over which his food and supplies reached him. He wanted the divisions of Severoli and Reille for the advance to Valencia. Severoli was under his orders, but that general's troops guarded Aragon. To procure Reille's help Suchet needed Napoleon's permission. That consent would arrive in December.

These works frequently addresses race relations in Australia, often from a personal point of view, with Australian Aboriginal people used as a theme or subject.Shoemaker, Alan, Black Words, White Page: Aboriginal Literature 1929‚Äì1988, University of Queensland Press, Queensland, 1992 In the first part of the 20th century, much of Australia was still being explored by white Australians and their encounters with Aborigines who had had little or no contact or knowledge of the settlers were still taking place well after World War II. First contact There has been some little attempt on the part of European writers to speak up on behalf of the Aborigines. One writer in particular, Western Australian Donald Stuart, has made the effort. Contact between Indigenous Australian and settlers and the early experience of native tribesmen and women with the new arrivals involved challenges. Another writer who looked at this period is Brian Penton, whose novel Landtakers recounts a disastrous meeting between Indigenous Australian tribespeople and European settlers. 1900‚Äì1930 The 20th century saw the opening up of northern and western Australia, as well as the far reaches of the established colonies of New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland, and in 1901, the Federation of Australia took place. Outback Australia was still very much accessible only by horse and camel, with the latter faring far better than the former. Yet cattle and sheep were being driven north (and back south to market) in ever increasing numbers, leading to the establishment of the legendary stations of the outback, some of them to be described as \\"bigger than Texas.\\" In this period, Aborigines came to work on cattle stations in greater and greater numbers. Indigenous Australians were good horsemen and they worked as house servants. Indeed, a recurring theme running through much outback literature of the period is that, \\"the land could never have been opened up by Europeans without the help of the Aborigines.\\"Jupp, James, The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, its People and their Origins, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1988, p. 142 Writers referring to this period are necessarily more numerous, and include Mary Durack, Charles Duguid, A. M. Duncan-Kemp, William Hatfield, Tom Cole, Margaret Ford, Michael Terry, Alfred Searcy, R. G. Kimber, Gordon Buchanan, K. Langford Smith, Louis Kaye and Ion Idriess.    1931‚Äì1945 In this period, motor transportation was slowly making an impact and the main thing holding it back by the end of the period was the lack of well-made roads. In a sense, these years marked the last real period of exploration by white Australians of areas where Indigenous Australians lived. Many an expedition into the dry lands of Central Australia in particular, was still carried out by camel. This is true of anthropologists like Charles P. Mountford, journalists like Ernestine Hill, patrol officers like Vic Hall, doctors like Clyde Fenton, scientists like Cecil Madigan, writers like Frank Clune and Xavier Herbert, missionaries like Wilbur S. Chaseling, and others like Arthur Groom and Carl Warburton.   1945‚Äì1960 The post-war period saw vastly increased development of white settlements throughout the outback. The war itself had created a need for an efficient north-south axis route for troop movements, and this led to a temporary increase in the number of people living in these remote areas. Writers of this period include W. E. Harney, Colin Simpson, Joe Walker, Syd Kyle-Little, Patsy Adam-Smith, Max Brown, Sidney Downer and George Farwell.   1961‚Äì2010s Even in the 1960s, there remained some Aboriginal tribespeople who had little or no contact with Europeans.Lee, Richard B. and Richard Heywood Daly, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.348 Writers include Hugh Atkinson, Keith Cole, Richard A. Gould, Xavier Herbert and Winifred Hilliard.

The ridge lines are the combination of points where marginal product (MPLK) of one of the factors is zero. The theory entails that there is a limit to how much one factor can be substituted for another. When production reaches a point where substitution between the factors becomes impossible (MPLK), the isoquant becomes positively sloping.

Early life and education Geoffrey Kaye was born Geoffrey Alfred Kornblum in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia in 1903, the son of Rosetta Levison and Alfred Kornblum. He was educated in England, and studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating MBBS in 1926. As Resident Medical Officer at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital in 1927, he was assigned to anaesthetics and quickly developed an affinity for the practice. He was appointed Honorary Anaesthetist to the Alfred Hospital in 1930. At this time, he was one of a small number of full- time anaesthetists in Australia.  Anaesthesia  After graduation, Kaye was in the fortunate position of being able to travel widely at a time when few could. During his travels he took the opportunity to meet with, and learn from, anaesthetists in the UK, US, Germany and Scandinavia. On return to Australia, he began experimenting with anaesthetic equipment, engineering equipment for personal use and, later, for the Australian Army. Additionally, Kaye worked with other anaesthesia staff from the Alfred Hospital to produce Australia's first textbook on anaesthesia. Practical Anaesthesia was published in 1932, and included a foreword by Francis McMechan, Secretary General, International Anesthesia Research Society. During his travels he had become aware of the collegiate nature of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and was determined to create something similar in Australia. In 1934 he successfully established the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, which launched at an anaesthetic congress in Hobart, Tasmania. At that time, its headquarters was at 49 Mathoura Road, Toorak.https://www.asa.org.au/ASA/About_Us/History_of_the_Society/ASA/About_us/History_of_the_Society/History_of_the_Society.aspx?hkey=4ff34748-8fc5-48fe-a47e-ef02d981f612 Before World War II he served as its first secretary.

His stage persona, William Batty currently serves as the ringmaster of the Wanderlust Circus, as well as the emcee of numerous vaudevillian and bohemian events in the area. Mickens has worked in a variety of performance media: scrap-metal percussion, singing, butoh, drama, circus arts, rock opera, and fashion modeling. Several of his collaborative projects have been combinations of two or more of the aforementioned art forms. Mickens has also performed as composer, director, and producer of numerous theatrical productions, as well as show promoter and publicist for various venues in the Portland area, including Someday Lounge, Dante's, The Jasmine Tree, and the Rotture-Branx venue complex. Early life Mickens has described growing up in Los Angeles with his mother and his brother, Sam Mickens (a vocalist, guitarist, and composer for such bands as The Dead Science, Xiu Xiu, and Parenthetical Girls). In an interview with Portland Monthly, he said he was taught to juggle at age 14 by a homeless man named Robert. \\"I began to meet other people who were into that sort of thing,\\" he recalls, \\"and I started to think of myself as a circus performer.\\" Mickens began singing in local punk and pop bands in Los Angeles, among them Poor Old Timer, which he described as \\"blues-inflected punk music\\". In 1996, Mickens moved to Portland, OR, and quickly became involved in a variety of theatrical and musical endeavors, including Nequaquam Vacuum (Latin for \\"the void does not exist\\"), an improvisational \\"post-asiatic chamber noise\\" ensemble, which he formed in 1999 with Tyler Armstrong and Travis McAlister. In 2004, Oregon Public Broadcasting filmed a short documentary on Mickens and Nequaquam Vacuum for the station's Oregon Art Beat program. The program showed Mickens, Armstrong and McAlister performing alongside butoh dancers from the PAN Butoh troupe. Mickens began organizing avant-garde performances through underground networks of artists. One such network was 36 Invisibles, which Mickens founded in 2000. Under the name 36 Invisibles, Mickens arranged and promoted performances by a variety of artists, usually at the Jasmine Tree, a small tiki bar near the Portland State University campus. He was also heavily involved with the Radon collective, another loose affiliation of avant-garde artists for which he was considered the \\"Portland Liaison \\". From roughly 2001 to the present day he has recorded and toured with Stooges saxophonist Steve Mackay and the Radon Ensemble, composed of Radon members from around the world. In 2001, he also began collaborating with 2 Gyrlz Performative Arts, a Portland-based performance group founded by Lisa Newman and Llewyn Maire, and served on its board of directors. 2Gyrlz produced an annual month-long event, the EnterActive Language Festival, a multifaceted performance art showcase. His band Nequaquam Vacuum is listed in the 2Gyrlz archives as an EnterActive participant as early as 2002, as well as 36 Invisibles, and the PAN Butoh troupe, with which he was also involved. Early circuses and booking: 2004‚Äì2007 In 2004 Mickens performed as ringmaster in Cicuri Curajul, his first foray into organizing a circus. Cicuri Curajul, a \\"fake Romanian circus\\", performed at the Crystal Ballroom April 25, 2004.http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/print_story.php?story_id=23955 In the same year he began organizing another project, a ritual performance troupe called \\"Societas Insomnia\\" (Latin for \\"Nightmare Company\\"). Societas Insomnia told, in several installments between 2004 and 2007, a story of otherworldly creatures within a living nightmare, combining \\"ritual performance\\" (including fire performance, hook suspension, and butoh) with circus arts and live music. This collaborative project also featured vocal performances by Portland-based tuvan throat singer Enrique Ugalde, with whom Mickens has frequently collaborated, providing musical backing for Ugalde's solo project Soriah. In Societas Insomnia, Ugalde played the role of The Sun. In 2005 Mickens toured with a newly formed underground freak show, then called the 999 Eyes ov Endless Dream Carnival and Sideshow of the Damned (now simply known as the 999 Eyes Freakshow), for which he performed as ringmaster and master of ceremonies. After traveling by bus with The 999 Eyes Freakshow on its first tour in 2005, Mickens moved to Seattle to further pursue his study of butoh. He played music, danced, and acted in a great number of shows during his relatively brief stay in Seattle: Die Wandlung with Implied Violence, The Greasy Demon Heat Cycle with The Villainaires Academy, and numerous butoh and musical collaborations with PAN, Death Posture, his brother Sam Mickens, and others. In April 2006 Mickens was hired by Someday Lounge, a performance-art oriented nightclub in downtown Portland started by Kris and Eric Robison, two brothers who owned the adjacent Backspace Cafe and were interested in hosting the EnterActive Language Festival and other \\"experimental, progressive performance art\\". He left Seattle and became creative director and booker at Someday, and frequently performed and acted as emcee for events there. In February 2007, the Portland Mercury reported that Mickens had been suddenly fired from Someday Lounge Mickens worked as an independent producer, director, and actor in numerous productions, including the opera Queen of Knives composed by Eric Stern, the dark fairytale operetta series Bogville co- directed with Tiare Tashnick (aka NagaSita), an outdoor butoh production of A Midsummer Night's Dream co-directed with Mizu Desierto; and his main project, Wanderlust Circus, co-directed and -produced with Nick \\"The Creature\\" Harbar. Wanderlust Circus: 2006‚Äìpresent In 2006, during his time at Someday Lounge, Mickens threw his efforts into performing with another vaudevillian project. Originally called Batty's Hippodrome, the show was a revue of circus arts, featuring a variety of performances, with Mickens playing a character named William Batty, loosely based on the Victorian England circus proprietor of the same name, who created Batty's Hippodrome in Kensington Gardens. Mickens performed as a slightly menacing Batty in bright suits and heavy stage makeup, leading press to make comparisons to The Joker. Early in the history of Batty's Hippodrome, Mickens began collaborating with Nick \\"The Creature\\" Harbar, who had recently wrapped production in San Francisco on a Romani dinner circus called Circo Romani. After his departure from Someday Lounge, the two consolidated their show under the name of Wanderlust Circus, with Mickens as the ringmaster. Mickens' circus began doing regular events at the Hippodrome Circus Arts Center, a rehearsal and performance space for circus arts in SE Portland; of which they were the co-directors. Batty's Hippodrome performed at the grand opening November 17, 2007. When the Hippodrome Circus Arts Center closed in 2008, Mickens and Creature moved Wanderlust Circus to the Bossanova Ballroom, where regular shows were hosted until 2010, when Wanderlust Circus moved its main stage to the Alberta Rose Theatre. In 2012, the Wanderlust Circus Orchestra released their debut EP, Joyous Panic, with Mickens appearing as vocalist.

These methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors are one of the first components in the sensory excitation and adaptation responses in bacteria, which act to alter swimming behaviour upon detection of specific chemicals. Use of the MCP allows bacteria to detect concentrations of molecules in the extracellular matrix so that the bacteria may smooth swim or tumble accordingly. If the bacterium detects rising levels of attractants (nutrients) or declining levels of repellents (toxins), the bacterium will continue swimming forward, or smooth swimming. If the bacterium detects declining levels of attractants or rising levels of repellents, the bacterium will tumble and re-orient itself in a new direction. In this manner, a bacterium may swim towards nutrients and away from toxins  Evolution  There are many different types of bacterial 60 kDa transmembrane receptors, which share similar topology and signalling mechanisms. They possess three domains: a periplasmic ligand-binding domain, two transmembrane segments, and a cytoplasmic domain. The structure of the ligand-binding domain comprises a closed or partly opened, four-helical bundle with a left-handed twist. The difference in the sequence of the ligand-binding domain between receptors reflects the different ligand specificities. Binding of the ligand causes a conformational change that is transmitted across the membrane to the cytoplasmic activation domain. Environmental diversity gives rise to diversity in bacterial signalling receptors, and consequently there are many genes encoding MCPs. For example, there are four well-characterised MCPs found in Escherichia coli: Tar (taxis towards aspartate and maltose, away from nickel and cobalt), Tsr (taxis towards serine, away from leucine, indole and weak acids), Trg (taxis towards galactose and ribose) and Tap (taxis towards dipeptides).  Structure  MCPs share similar structure and signalling mechanism. MCPs form dimers. Three dimers of MCP spontaneously form trimers. Trimers are complexed by CheA and CheW into hexagonal lattices. MCPs either bind ligands directly or interact with ligand-binding proteins, transducing the signal to downstream signalling proteins in the cytoplasm. Most MCPs contain: (a) an N-terminal signal peptide that is a transmembrane alpha-helix in the mature protein; (b) a poorly-conserved periplasmic receptor (ligand-binding) domain; (c) a transmembrane alpha-helix; (d) generally one or more HAMP domains and (e) a highly conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that interacts with downstream signalling components. The C-terminal domain contains the methylated glutamate residues. MCPs undergo two covalent modifications: deamidation and reversible methylation at a number of glutamate residues. Attractants increase the level of methylation, while repellents decrease it. The methyl groups are added by the methyl-transferase CheR and are removed by the methylesterase CheB.  Function  Binding a ligand causes a conformational change in the MCP receptor which translates down the hairpin structure and inhibits its sensor kinase. At the tip of the hairpin are two proteins that associate to the MCP: CheW and CheA. CheA acts as the sensor kinase. CheA has kinase activity and autophosphorylates itself on a histidyl residue when activated by the MCP. CheW is believed to be a transducer of the signal from the MCP to CheA. Activated CheA transfers its phosphoryl group to CheY, a response regulator. Phosphorylated CheY phosphorylates the basal body FliM which is connected to the flagellum. Phosphorylation of the basal body acts as a flagellar switch and changes the direction of rotation of the flagellum. This change in direction allows for alternation between smooth swimming and tumbling which biases the bacterial random walk towards attractant.

It can be interpreted as the space of projective measured foliations on the surface. The Thurston boundary of the Teichm√ºller space of a closed surface of genus g is homeomorphic to a sphere of dimension 6g-7. The action of the mapping class group on the Teichm√ºller space extends continuously over the union with the boundary.  Measured foliations on surfaces  Let S be a closed surface. A measured foliation (mathcal F, mu) on S is a foliation mathcal F on S which may admit isolated singularities, together with a transverse measure mu, i.e. a function which to each arc alpha transverse to the foliation mathcal F associates a positive real number mu(alpha). The foliation and the measure must be compatible in the sense that the measure is invariant if the arc is deformed with endpoints staying in the same leaf. Let mathcal S be the space of isotopy classes of closed simple curves on S. A measured foliation (mathcal F, mu) can be used to define a function i((mathcal F, mu), cdot) in mathbb R_+^{mathcal S} as follows: if gamma is any curve let : mu(gamma) = sup_{alpha_1, ldots, alpha_r} left(sum_{i=1}^r mu(alpha_i) right) where the supremum is taken over all collections of disjoint arcs alpha_1ldots, alpha_r subset gamma which are transverse to mathcal F (in particular mu(gamma) = 0 if gamma is a closed leaf of mathcal F). Then if sigma in mathcal S the intersection number is defined by: :i bigl((mathcal F, mu), sigma bigr) = inf_{gamma in sigma} mu(gamma). Two measured foliations are said to be equivalent if they define the same function on mathcal S (there is a topological criterion for this equivalence via Whitehead moves). The space mathcal{PMF} of projective measured laminations is the image of the set of measured laminations in the projective space mathbb P(mathbb R_+^{mathcal S}) via the embedding i. If the genus g of S is at least 2, the space mathcal{PMF} is homeomorphic to the 6g-7-dimensional sphere (in the case of the torus it is the 2-sphere; there are no measured foliations on the sphere).  Compactification of Teichm√ºller space  = Embedding in the space of functionals = Let S be a closed surface. Recall that a point in the Teichm√ºller space is a pair (X, f) where X is an hyperbolic surface (a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvatures all equal to -1) and f a homeomorphism, up to a natural equivalence relation. The Teichm√ºller space can be realised as a space of functionals on the set mathcal S of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on mathcal S as follows. If x = (X, f) in T(S) and sigma in mathcal S then ell(x, sigma) is defined to be the length of the unique closed geodesic on X in the isotopy class f_*sigma. The map x mapsto ell(x, cdot) is an embedding of T(S) into mathbb R_+^{mathcal S}, which can be used to give the Teichm√ºller space a topology (the right-hand side being given the product topology). In fact, the map to the projective space mathbb P(mathbb R_+^{mathcal S}) is still an embedding: let mathcal T denote the image of T(S) there. Since this space is compact, the closure overline mathcal T is compact: it is called the Thurston compactification of the Teichm√ºller space. = The Thurston boundary = The boundary overline mathcal T setminus mathcal T is equal to the subset mathcal{PMF} of mathbb P(mathbb R_+^{mathcal S}). The proof also implies that the Thurston compactfification is homeomorphic to the 6g - 6-dimensional closed ball.  Applications  = Pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms = A diffeomorphism S to S is called pseudo-Anosov if there exists two transverse measured foliations, such that under its action the underlying foliations are preserved, and the measures are multiplied by a factor lambda, lambda^{-1} respectively for some lambda > 1 (called the stretch factor). Using his compactification Thurston proved the following characterisation of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes (i.e. mapping classes which contain a pseudo-Anosov element), which was in essence known to Nielse and is usually called the Nielsen-Thurston classification. A mapping class phi is pseudo-Anosov if and only if: *it is not reducible (i.e. there is no k ge 1 and sigma in mathcal S such that (phi^k)_*sigma = sigma); *it is not of finite order (i.e. there is no k ge 1 such that phi^k is the isotopy class of the identity). The proof relies on the Brouwer fixed point theorem applied to the action of phi on the Thurston compactification overline mathcal T. If the fixed point is in the interior then the class is of finite order; if it is on the boundary and the underlying foliation has a closed leaf then it is reducible; in the remaining case it is possible to show that there is another fixed point corresponding to a transverse measured foliation, and to deduce the pseudo-Anosov property. = Applications to the mapping class group = The action of the mapping class group of the surface S on the Teichm√ºller space extends continuously to the Thurston compactification. This provides a powerful tool to study the structure of this group; for example it is used in the proof of the Tits alternative for the mapping class group. It can also be used to prove various results about the subgroup structure of the mapping class group. = Applications to 3-manifolds = The compactification of Teichm√ºller space by adding measured foliations is essential in the definition of the ending laminations of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  Actions on real trees  A point in Teichm√ºller space T(S) can alternatively be seen as a faithful representation of the fundamental group pi_1(S) into the isometry group mathrm{PSL}_2(mathbb R) of the hyperbolic plane mathbb H^2, up to conjugation. Such an isometric action gives rise (via the choice of a principal ultrafilter) to an action on the asymptotic cone of mathbb H^2, which is a real tree. Two such action are equivariantly isometric if and only if they come from the same point in Teichm√ºller space. The space of such actions (endowed with a natural topology) is compact, and hence we get another compactification of Teichm√ºller space. A theorem of R. Skora states that this compactification is equivariantly homeomorphic the Thurston compactification.

According to January 2011 measurements by the Maryland Big Tree Program, the Travilah Oak has a circumference of 18' 4\\", a height of 78', and a crown that stretches 108' in all directions.  History  A plaque stands underneath the Travilah Oak recognizing its historical significance The Travilah Oak, and the community it resides in, was named after the first post master of the area, Travilah Cleggett. The shopping center next to the oak was built in 1979. In 1989 the tree received local attention when it was in danger of being cut down because of development. In 1997, Friends of the Travilah Oak joined together with the goal of protecting the tree and preserving it for posterity. The group coordinated with Hopkins and Porter Construction, Inc. to build a fence, patio, and seating area around the large oak. Today the floodlights illuminate the oak at night and lightning rods protect it from thunderstorms. = Travilah Oak Celebration = The large oak has become the site and focus of the annual Travilah Oak Celebration.

All variations also include a Picatinny rail, tritium night sights, and a loaded chamber indicator on the right side. New models are sold in a plastic hard case with three magazines, and two interchangeable backstraps. As of 2012, new models include 4 interchangeable backstraps rather than two.

The backstraps are two different thicknesses and two different patterns (a cross-hatch pattern similar to the sides of the grip, and horizontal lines similar to the front of the grip). barrel; 2. slide; 3. recoil spring; 4. receiver. Field stripping is accomplished by locking the slide to the rear, rotating the takedown lever clockwise ninety degrees and releasing the slide stop while carefully allowing the slide to be pushed forward out of the frame. The barrel and recoil spring then separate from the slide to complete the disassembly procedure. Joint Combat Pistol Competition The FNP-45 Tactical was developed to be entered into the Joint Combat Pistol from late 2005 to early 2006 for a new military sidearm to replace the M9 Pistol. The program was started in 2005 and run by USSOCOM which was a merger of two earlier programs, the army's Future Handgun System (FHS) and the Special Operations Forces Combat Pistol. The requirements for the JCP included being chambered for caliber .45 ACP, having an integrated Picatinny rail, including day/night sights, and being capable of accepting a suppressor. The FNP‚Ñ¢-45 Tactical was offered with a 15-round magazine for the required .45 ACP caliber. Variants As of the beginning of October 2012, the only variants of the FNX 9 and FNX 40 pistol were purely cosmetic: both the FNX-9 and FNX-40 are available with the slide finished in matte black or stainless steel. The FNX 45 was released at the beginning of October 2012. It is currently available in Black, Stainless, and FDE (flat dark earth). The FNX 45 has magazines that come with 12 witness holes, numbering from 4 to 15, enabling the shooter to more accurately gauge the number of rounds left. This is in contrast to the original FNX having a hole marked 5, 10, and 14, for the FNX 40, or 5, 10, 15, 17 for the FNX 9. The FNX Tactical was released in .45 ACP shortly after the initial production runs of the FNX 45. It features a threaded barrel, Suppressor height tritium night sights \\"rear yellow front green\\" and a milled slide to install a micro red dot sight. Function The FNX is a short recoil operated pistol, much like many other centerfire pistols on the market. Its difference lies in the distance the barrel and the slide travel prior to the barrel dropping and unlocking. The FNX barrel and slide travel up to twice the distance of some other semiautomatic pistols before separating. This helps to reduce the felt recoil of the pistol by allowing the spring to absorb more momentum from both the barrel and the slide. The pistol is hammer fired, as opposed to striker fired; this allows the pistol to be fired in either Single Action or Double Action mode. Its safety mechanism is based on the safety found on a M1911. It is possible to cock the hammer to the rear and engage the safety simultaneously to carry the weapon \\"cocked and locked\\". The safety lever acts as a decocker when pushed downward.

An application, NiFTyTV, bypasses limitations inherent to online broadcasting by reducing bandwidth costs at the source. NiFTy is headquartered in Ruston, La., on the Louisiana Tech University campus. The company largely employs graduates and students of the university's computer science program.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com  Background  Founded in 2001, NiFTy was the first online broadcaster to incorporate the \\"Free For View\\" model for professional sports leagues, and provides online broadcasts for the Arena Football League and the Professional Bull Riders, as well as Grambling State University. The company receives ongoing support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as private funding, and has been awarded nine U.S. patents, with five pending. Patents #7,035,933, #7,512,676, #7,536,472, #7,543,074, #7,664,840, #7,818,407, #7,843,855, #7,895,324 and #7,925,726 were issued between 2006 and 2011. Technology NiFTy's technology centers on a balanced binary tree design, where a broadcast stream is fed directly to a small number of viewers, who propagate the signal to more viewers. The audience grows as the signal repeats to more end-users, but only a few nodes remain directly connected to the server. The collective capacity of the viewers' computers and Internet connections then power a significant part of the online broadcast in a polite and non-invasive manner. This technology overcomes the requirement that online broadcasters transmit a duplicate copy of each video stream to every viewer. Employing end-users' computers to help broadcast the content stream reduces the server footprint and lowers energy consumption.  Board of Advisors  NiFTy's Board of Advisors includes music executive Clarence Avant, former chairman of Motown Records and board member of PolyGram Records and William J.

It is expressed in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to humans. Function Molecular chaperones are a diverse family of proteins that function to protect proteins from irreversible aggregation during synthesis and in times of cellular stress. The bacterial molecular chaperone DnaK is an enzyme that couples cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release by an N-terminal ATP-hydrolyzing domain to cycles of sequestration and release of unfolded proteins by a C-terminal substrate binding domain. Dimeric GrpE is the co-chaperone for DnaK, and acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, stimulating the rate of ADP release 5000-fold. DnaK is itself a weak ATPase; ATP hydrolysis by DnaK is stimulated by its interaction with another co-chaperone, DnaJ. Thus the co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE are capable of tightly regulating the nucleotide-bound and substrate- bound state of DnaK in ways that are necessary for the normal housekeeping functions and stress-related functions of the DnaK molecular chaperone cycle. This family of proteins contain a 70 amino acid consensus sequence known as the J domain. The J domain of DnaJ interacts with Hsp70 heat shock proteins. DnaJ heat-shock proteins play a role in regulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 heat-shock proteins. Besides stimulating the ATPase activity of DnaK through its J-domain, DnaJ also associates with unfolded polypeptide chains and prevents their aggregation. Thus, DnaK and DnaJ may bind to one and the same polypeptide chain to form a ternary complex. The formation of a ternary complex may result in cis-interaction of the J-domain of DnaJ with the ATPase domain of DnaK. An unfolded polypeptide may enter the chaperone cycle by associating first either with ATP-liganded DnaK or with DnaJ. DnaK interacts with both the backbone and side chains of a peptide substrate; it thus shows binding polarity and admits only L-peptide segments. In contrast, DnaJ has been shown to bind both L- and D-peptides and is assumed to interact only with the side chains of the substrate. Domain architecture Proteins in this family consist of three domains. The N-terminal domain is the J domain (described above). The central domain is a cysteine-rich region, which contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG where X is any amino acid. The isolated cysteine rich domain folds in zinc dependent fashion. Each set of two repeats binds one unit of zinc. Although this domain has been implicated in substrate binding, no evidence of specific interaction between the isolated DNAJ cysteine rich domain and various hydrophobic peptides has been found. This domain has disulphide isomerase activity. The function of the C-terminal is chaperone and dimerization.

It arises in the beels west of Chatmohor in Pabna District. Another name Dangha. Early history The Chiknai receives an excess of flood water from the Padma during the rains and falls into the Baral near the village of Faridpur in Pabna district. It is navigable in the rainy season, and in the dry season it forms a good fishery, supplying Pabna and other places with fish. The Jamuna forms the eastern boundary of the district for a length of , separating Pabna from the districts of Mymensingh, Tangail and Dhaka. The present channel of the Jamuna is of comparatively recent origin and is due to the diversion of the Brahmaputra through the Jenai which was a small river, more or less, at the present position of the Jamuna. When Rennell compiled his map of Bengal towards the close of the 18th century, the main stream of the Brahmaputra bent sharply round the range of the Garo Hills and flowed in a south-easterly direction across the district of Mymensingh to join the Meghna just below Bhairab Bazar. About the beginning of the 19th century the Brahmaputra having raised its bed and lost its velocity was no longer able to hold its own course against the Meghna mentioned above. So it left its old channel and broke to the west, capturing the waters of the Teesta on the way and cut out a new channel for itself, which is practically its present channel. Even at the beginning of the 19th century, the original channel through the Mymensingh district had become of secondary importance, and at the present time, though it bears the name of Brahmaputra, it has dwindled into a mere watercourse navigable only during the rainy season.

He was the first person in regional theatre to be called a sound designer, and he developed the first effective automatic microphone mixer: the automixer. Dugan's sound design work was acknowledged in 2003 with a Distinguished Career Award by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology, and in 2020 with an Emmy Award for technology relevant to remote working. In his youth, Dugan was fascinated by the technical aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type. Dugan first recorded sounds in the late 1960s to augment his sound designs. He continued making recordings, concentrating on capturing the sounds of nature. Dugan records outdoors in a variety of locations including national parks and nature preserves. He has assisted in research related to the harmful effects of human-generated sound in nature. Dugan is a co-founder and current secretary of People for Legal and Nonsectarian Schools (PLANS), a California non-profit organization incorporated in 1997. Early career Daniel W. Dugan was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 20, 1943, after his father, U.S. Navy Commander P. F. Dugan, had been activated for service in the Pacific War. \\"Dan\\" Dugan was raised in San Diego where his parents took him to the Old Globe Theatre and summer musicals at the Ford Bowl‚Äîhe always wanted to go backstage to see the lighting control equipment. As a young man he sang bass in the church choir, in the San Diego Bach Chorus, in choral workshops under Roger Wagner at San Diego State University, and in madrigal groups for \\"Dancing on the Green\\", an Elizabethan-era folk dancing event held in front of the Old Globe. Dugan obtained a four-year scholarship to the University of San Francisco and majored in physics and math. He dropped out in 1963 to pursue stagecraft, specifically lighting design. His early lighting designs include ones for the San Diego National Shakespeare Festival at the Old Globe Theatre, the San Diego Opera, and the Actor's Workshop in San Francisco. Sound design 1978: Dugan prepares sound design materials in a dressing room at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego Dugan changed from lighting design to sound design in 1967. The state of sound design at the time was mostly occasional sound effects performed live or played back on record players or tape machines. Dugan's first efforts in sound involved designing sound solutions for the Shakespeare festival in San Diego and for the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco. Dugan's complex and atmospheric theatrical soundscapes led to a new title: during ACT's 1968‚Äì69 season, he was the first regional theatre person to be called a \\"sound designer\\".In 1959 in London, Dan Collison was first given \\"sound effects\\" billing near the level of lighting designer, and in 1961 Jack Mann was credited as the \\"sound designer\\" for a Broadway production. He presented a paper about his sound design to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) at their 37th convention, and his paper was published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society in December 1969. Dugan described a system in which the signals from three stereo tape players were routed to ten loudspeaker zones in the theater. Dugan designed sound for three regional productions of Hair, the musical: ones in Chicago, Las Vegas and Toronto. The Chicago production ran in 1969 and 1970 at the Blackstone Theatre, operated at that time by The Shubert Organization. Dugan was able to design sound but not allowed to operate the mixing console because he was not in the stagehands union: International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). When Margrit Mondavi founded the Mondavi Summer Music Festival in 1969 at the Robert Mondavi Winery, primarily featuring jazz artists, Dugan supplied sound services at the outdoor venue in Napa, California. He recorded independent record albums, including Kate Wolf's first two: Back Roads (1976) and Lines on the Paper (1977) and designed sound for the Sacramento Music Circus. Dugan occasionally delivered speeches at conferences of the United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT) in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003 the USITT honored Dugan with the Harold Burris-Meyer Distinguished Career in Sound Design Award, given for \\"a lifetime spent establishing the field of sound design for the performing arts, as both artist and innovator in audio engineering and technology.\\" Previous winners of the award were Abe Jacob, John Bracewell, Charlie Richmond and Tony Meola. Automixer While designing sound for the musical Hair, Dugan began to appreciate the human operator's inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person \\"working rotary knobs for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band\\". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, more than just the room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage- controlled amplifiers (VCAs), finally developing the \\"Dugan Music System\\", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were \\"continuously and automatically adjusted\\" by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a \\"Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems\\" was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems. Dugan tests nine Model A automixers, ca. 1980 Though the algorithm was good, the reference microphone was an unpredictable variable: it had practical placement problems. If it was near the audience, audience noise would skew the algorithm. If placed backstage, crew and equipment noises could be a factor. Thus, the Dugan Music System was not immediately developed into a product. Dugan studied the problem, researching alternative solutions. In 1975, Dugan filed a patent for the \\"Dugan Speech System\\", and in 1976 produced 60 copies of what he named the Dugan Model A. The automixer with serial number 1, a unit Dugan fabricated by hand, \\"was installed in the conference room of Bell Labs by Harvey Fletcher\\". Significantly, the external microphone reference of the Dugan Music System was replaced by a reference composed of the total signal received from all of the active microphones. Dugan described the process some three decades later: Yamaha Dugan-MY16 card (2011), and to his left are earlier automixer models Dugan licensed this more practical system to Altec who produced 4- and 8-channel automixers for commercial installations such as hotels, conference rooms, courtrooms and city council chambers. The Dugan Speech System was the first commercially successful automixing algorithm. Over the next 15 years, other manufacturers designed competing automixers, and the market segment was born. In the late 1980s, Dugan developed a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and presented to the 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously. Generations of Dugan's automixers Dugan's original 1974 patent expired in 1991, and the Dugan Speech System patent in 1993. Other manufacturers began to sell automixers incorporating the Dugan algorithm. In 1996, Dugan produced the Model D-1, an automixer for speech-only applications. The Model D-2 returned to having applicability for both speech and music, as did the Model D-3. In 1997, Dugan licensed his system to Protech Audio of Indian Lake, New York, yielding the Protech 2000 model series. In September 2006, Dugan produced the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller and less expensive than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable. In February 2011, Dugan demonstrated an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer such as the O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-series of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones. Nature sounds nature sounds recordists Dugan made his first sound effects recordings to augment his theatrical sound designs. As he grew more interested in field recording, he was attracted to the sounds found in pristine natural settings‚Äîenvironments without human noise. A board member and webmaster of Nature Sounds Society, Dugan has conducted equipment training sessions since 1994, and has given talks about his experiences in nature recording. He has traveled to New Zealand in pursuit of recordings, but mainly devotes himself to U.S. National Parks and Monuments such as Yosemite and Muir Woods. Other national parks and monuments at which he has recorded sound include Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Lassen Volcanic, Yellowstone, Haleakala, Olympic, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lava Beds. Recording in the field wearing a vest with attached microphones protected by furry windscreens Dugan and his wife Sharon Perry, the Nature Sounds Society chair, recorded the dawn chorus of Cathedral Grove in Muir Woods once each month for a year. He has partnered with the National Park Service and the California Library of Natural Sounds to document the various sounds heard in U.S. parks. Regarding his reasons for doing so, Dugan wrote in 2008: In 2006, Dugan assisted a group of researchers studying soundscapes and human use at Muir Woods. The researchers presented their findings at the Northeastern Recreation Research Symposium, produced by the United States Forest Service, a work titled, \\"From Landscapes to Soundscapes: Understanding and Managing Natural Quiet in the National Parks\\". They concluded that human- generated noise \\"is a potentially important indicator of quality\\" of soundscapes in parks. PLANS, Inc. In 1998 an organization he co-founded, People for Legal and Nonsectarian Schools (PLANS), filed a federal lawsuit against Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District in California arguing that their Waldorf-methods-inspired schools violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article IX of the California Constitution.\\"Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\\", PLANS, Inc v Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District, filed U.S. District Court Eastern District of California No. Civ. S 98-266, filed 2/11/98 Dugan participated in the court proceedings. After years of litigation, the 9th circuit court dismissed the case on its merits in 2012. As co-founder and Secretary of PLANS, Dugan has given media interviews and was quoted in the book The Flickering Mind: The False Promise of Technology in the Classroom and How Learning Can Be Saved. He said Waldorf schools are \\"faith-based\\" and draw from an educational theory that is \\"frozen\\" in 1925.

They are 2010s-design small- scale in-space satellite-refueling spacecraft first launched in 2019. The MEV spacecraft grew out of a concept proposed in 2011 by ViviSat, a 50/50 joint venture of aerospace firms US Space and Alliant Techsystems (ATK). The joint venture was created in 2010 for the purpose of designing, producing and operating the MEV program. Since the original conception of the MEV program by the ViviSat company, the Vivisat venture was shut down for a time, and the company was dissolved by Orbital ATK in April of 2016.https://spacenews.com/u-s-space-sues-orbital-atk-over-vivisat-venture/ The MEV program continued on as a solo-project of Orbital ATK, which was subsequently purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2018. The MEV program continued under Northrop Grummanhttps://spacenews.com/u-s-space-sues-orbital-atk-over- vivisat-venture/ and in 2019, launched MEV-1 to dock and reposition Intelsat 901, an objective reached in April 2020. Servicing an on-orbit satellite in this way was a space industry first for a telerobotically-operated spacecraft, as satellite servicing had previously been accomplished only with on-orbit human assistance in the several missions to service the Hubble Space Telescope.  History  ViviSat proposed the Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV) concept in 2011. At that time, the project was planned to be a 50/50 joint venture of aerospace firms US Space and Alliant Techsystems (ATK), to operate as a small-scale in-space satellite-refueling spacecraft. In the joint venture, ATK was to be responsible for the technical design, production and operation of the satellite, and US Space would be responsible for the financing and business-side of operations. By March 2012, ViviSat was finalizing its design and was \\"ready to build\\" the servicing spacecraft, but had announced no customers for the Mission Extension Vehicle services. In April 2014, ATK announced that it would merge its Aerospace and Defense Groups with Orbital Sciences Corporation. In the timeframe 2013-2016, the partners ATK and US Space fell out concerning the joint ViviSat-venture. The situation ended with ATK (which in the meantime in 2015 had merged with Orbital Sciences Corporation to become Orbital ATK) taking control and dissolving the ViviSat- company on 5 April 2016. The MEV program continued as Orbital-ATK only project.https://spacenews.com/u-s-space-sues-orbital-atk-over-vivisat-venture/ In December 2017, the US telecommunications regulator approved a plan submitted by Orbital ATK to use an MEV to service an Intelsat satellite, Intelsat 901, that was originally launched to geostationary orbit in June 2001 for a planned in-service life of 13 years. That satellite had already been replaced in orbit. The first MEV, MEV-1, was then planned to launch with Eutelsat's Eutelsat 5 West B commsat, no earlier than 2019. MEV-1 also needed a licence from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NOAA license is required because the MEV-1 has cameras for docking that could also image the Earth, thus necessitating a remote-sensing license. In 2018, the Orbital ATK was acquired by Northrop Grumman to become Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. The MEV program continues under this new company. MEV-1 was set to launch on a Russian Proton-M rocket along with Eutelsat 5 West B satellite on 30 September 2019, but the launch was postponed to 9 October 2019 due to issues with the integration of control systems of Briz-M orbit insertion stage and the satellites. MEV-1 was launched on 9 October 2019. MEV-1 rendezvoused with Intelsat 901 on 25 February 2020 at 07:15 UTC,https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/02/26/two-commercial-satellites-link-up- in-space-for-first-time/ and by April 2020 had repositioned the commsat so that it could come back on line in its designated geosynchronous spot, a space industry first for a telerobotic spacecraft, and something that had only previously been done on the Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions with direct human assistance.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/northrop-grumman- mev-1-spacecraft-services-intelsat-901-satellite.html The goal is to extend its operational life by five years via in-orbit stationkeeping.https://spacenews.com/why-intelsats-going-with-life-extension- over-refueling/ After the Intelsat 901 mission ends, MEV-1 is designed to be able to dock and undock additional times, potentially enabling it to service additional satellites.

Technical capabilities and competition  ViviSat saw competition for space servicing business with the 2011 announcement of the Space Infrastructure Servicing (SIS) vehicle from MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA). However, the two vehicles intended to operate with different technology approaches. Whilst the ViviSat design connects to the target satellite and uses \\"its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target\\"., SIS MDA would open the satellite's fuel lines, refuel it, then depart. In a June 2012 article in The Space Review, a number of approaches to satellite servicing were discussed. ViviSat's Mission Extension Vehicle was reported to operate at the \\"less complex\\" end of the technology spectrum, which could offer higher reliability and reduced risk to satellite owners. ViviSat believed their approach was simpler and could operate at lower cost than MDA, while having the technical ability to dock with \\"90% of the 450 or so geostationary satellites in orbit\\", whereas MDA SIS could open and refuel only 75%. \\"In addition to extending the life of an out-of-fuel satellite, the company could also rescue fueled spacecraft like AEHF-1 by docking with it in its low orbit, using its own motor and fuel to place it in the right orbit, and then moving to another target\\". , ViviSat planned to use the ATK A700 satellite bus.

The company's prodrug technology renders the drug inactive until it encounters the programmed target, thereby delivering the cytotoxin directly to the cancer or the vessels that support it, while potentially avoiding the side effects associated with current chemotherapies. A prodrug is an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form at a targeted site.http://www.genspera.com/pcrp.pdf CDMRP: Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program, September 2009. GenSpera's lead drug candidate, G-202, is currently in a Phase II clinical trial for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose disease has failed to improve on standard therapy for this indication. G-202 is also being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in glioblastoma patients with recurrent disease after surgery and/or radiation treatment of the primary tumor. G-202 targets the enzyme PSMA, found on the walls of blood vessels that feed most cancerous tumors, destroying the tumor blood supply. In contrast with anti-angiogenic agents, G-202 destroys existing as well as new cancer blood vessels. G-202 received Orphan Drug Designation from U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HCC, the most common form of primary liver cancer. The company also holds patents on prodrug candidates that target the prostate-specific enzymes Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Human Glandular Kallikrein (hK2). These candidates are expected to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer. The active ingredient in G-202 is a chemotherapeutic agent derived from thapsigargin, a plant-based cytotoxin that kills by disrupting the calcium balance in cancer cells. GenSpera's prodrug delivery system keeps the thapsigargin inactive in the body until it finds cells that it has been programmed to seek. Once those cells in the body are found, the prodrug releases its active ingredient and destroys all of the targeted cells. The National Cancer Institute had previously demonstrated that thaspigargin was ten-to-a-hundredfold more potent than traditional chemotherapeutic agents in killing all types of cells.http://www.genspera.com/pcrp.pdf Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program, September 2009. Thapsigargin kills cells irrespective of the rate of cell division, which may provide an effective approach to kill both fast- and slow-growing cancers as well as cancer stem cells.

Isaacs of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, was investigating ways to approach the treatment of slow-growing tumors and discovered they could be efficiently destroyed if intracellular calcium levels were raised significantly. He determined that the ideal agent for upsetting intracellular calcium levels was the novel chemical thapsigargin. He began collaborating with Dr. Soren Christensen, a natural products chemist, at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and the first scientist to isolate thapsigargin from the plant Thapsia garganica, a poisonous weed that grows wild in areas of the Mediterranean.http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/13/990.full Journal of the National Cancer Institute, July 2, 2003. The objective of the collaboration was to chemically alter thapsigargin to a derivative that could be linked to peptides, thus forming prodrugs to treat certain tumors. Drs. Isaacs and Christensen were joined in their research by Dr. Hans Lilja, now at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and Dr. Samuel Denmeade, of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Together the four co- inventors developed a technology platform in which the therapeutic component of all the compounds would remain the same, but the targeting peptide would change. Peptides would be selected that could only be \\"cut off\\" or cleaved by enzymes specific for certain tumors.

Her last appointment was at Macquarie University in Sydney, from which she retired as emeritus professor in 1994. Throughout her career she researched and published widely in the areas of verbal art, culture, context and text, text and texture, lexicogrammar and semantic variation. The latter involved the devising of extensive semantic system networks for the analysis of meaning in naturally occurring dialogues. Biography Born in 1931 in Pratapgarh, India, Hasan took her undergraduate degree at the University of Allahabad, in 1953, in English literature, education and history. Her elder brother Zawwar Hasan who was working as a journalist in Pakistan brought her and the rest of the family to Lahore in 1954. From 1954 to 1956, she was a lecturer at the Training College for Teachers of the Deaf, in Lahore, Pakistan. In 1958, she completed an MA in English literature at Government College Lahore, the University of the Punjab. From 1959 to 1960 she was a lecturer in English language and literature at Lahore's Queen Mary College. With a British Council scholarship, Hasan went to Edinburgh where she completed a postgraduate diploma at the University of Edinburgh in applied linguistics. In 1964 she completed her PhD in linguistics, also at the University of Edinburgh. The title of her thesis was 'A Linguistic Study of Contrasting Features in the Style of Two Contemporary English Prose Writers'. The writers were Angus Wilson and William Golding. She drew on Halliday's early work, in particular, his \\"Categories of the Theory of Grammar\\" paper, which had been published in 1961. Between 1964 and 1971 she held various research fellowships, first with the Nuffield Foreign Languages and Teaching Materials Project, at the University of Leeds, where she directed the Child Language Survey. Between 1965 and 1967 she was a research fellow with the Nuffield Programme in Linguistics and English Teaching, at University College London. From 1968 to 1971, she worked in the Sociological Research Unit, with Basil Bernstein, where she directed the Nuffield Research Project on Sociolinguistic Aspects of Children's Stories. Following this she went to the Department of Linguistics and Anthropology, at Northwestern University in Illinois, before returning to England and taking up a lectureship in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics at the University of Essex. She migrated to Australia in 1976, and was appointed senior lecturer in linguistics at Macquarie University. She retired from Macquarie in 1994 as emeritus professor. She has held numerous visiting appointments in the US, Kenya, Japan, Singapore, Denmark, and Hong Kong. Contributions to linguistics Hasan worked in her career of more than 50 years in linguistics around a number of central concerns, but all have set out from a basic conviction concerning the \\"continuity from the living of life right down to the morpheme\\".Hasan, R. 1996. Ways of Saying, Ways of Meaning. Selected Papers of Ruqaiya Hasan. Edited by Carmel Cloran, David Butt and Geoff Williams. Cassell. Her early PhD research began a long interest in language and verbal art. In the 1960s she worked at the Sociolinguistic Research Centre with Basil Bernstein, on issues concerning the relation of language and the distribution of forms of consciousness. This engagement spawned both her later work on semantic variation,Hasan, R. 2009. Semantic Variation: Meaning in Society and Sociolinguistics. Volume Two in the Collected Works of Ruqaiya Hasan. Edited by Jonathan Webster. Equinox. and provided the impetus and data for her early studies of what underpins text unity‚Äîin her terms, texture and text structure. in 1976, with MAK Halliday she published what remains the most comprehensive analysis of cohesion in English.Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1976. Cohesion in English. London: Longman. In their further co-authored book, Language Context and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective,Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1985/89. Language, context and text: Aspects of language in a social semiotic perspective. Deakin University Press/OUP: Geelong/Oxford. Hasan set out the interrelationships of texture and text structure (i.e. her notion of \\"generic structure potential\\", or \\"GSP\\"). In all of these endeavours, language as a social semiotic (following the account of language developed by MAK Halliday over many years) served as the point of departure. The specific type of connection she saw between language and social context has meant that her work has been concerned with many important problems in linguistics, such as the relations between language and culture, language and social class, language and learning (see Collected Works below). A distinguishing feature of her contributions is her work on many of these larger questions at the same time as attending to matters of detailed linguistic description. She divided linguistic theories into two categories: \\"externalist\\" and \\"internalist\\". She applied the term \\"externalist\\" to those theories where language is assigned a \\"subsidiary role\\" in the creation of meaning. In such theories, language plays no role in bringing about the existence of the thing to be understood or expressed. In the externalist approach, \\"language is reduced to a name device: it becomes a set of 'names' that label pre-existing things, properties, events, actions, and so on. It is a condition of naming that the phenomena should exist and be recognisable as having specific identities quite independent of the 'names' that the speakers of the language choose to give them.\\"Hasan, Ruqaiya. 1988.

School of English and Linguistics, Macquarie University. Reprinted in full in Semantic Variation: Meaning in Society and Sociolinguistics. Vol. 2, Hasan Collected Papers. Ed. Jonathan Webster. London: Equinox. p. 135 She urged linguists to abandon the externalist view, arguing instead for a linguistic model \\"that is capable of doing two seemingly disparate things at once: first, we need to show that meanings are the very artefact of language and so are internal to it; and secondly, that these linguistically created meanings nonetheless pertain to our experience of the world around us and inside us\\".Hasan, Ruqaiya. 1988.

Vol. 2, Hasan Collected Papers. Ed. Jonathan Webster. London: Equinox. p. 136 Studies in context Hasan followed but extended the model of linguistic context set out by Michael Halliday going back to the 1960s, in which he proposed that linguistic context must be seen as a \\"semiotic construct\\" with three essential parameters: field, tenor and mode.Halliday, M. A. K., McIntosh, A., & Stevens, P. (2007 [1964]) The users and uses of language. In Webster, JJ (ed.) Language and Society. Vol. 10, Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. pp. 5‚Äì37. Hasan argued that context is essential to resolving Saussure's dichotomy of 'langue' and 'parole'. Hasan made a theoretical distinction between \\"relevant context\\" [aspects of context encapsulated in the text], and what she called in 1973 the 'material situational setting'.Hasan, R. 1973. Code, register and social dialect. In Class, Codes and Control, vol II, ed. Basil Bernstein. Routledge and Kegan Paul. Reprinted in Full in Hasan, 2005. Language Society and Consciousness. Volume 1 in the Collected Works of Ruqaiya Hasan. Edited by JJ Webster. London: Equinox. 'Relevant context' she defines as \\"that frame of consistency which is illuminated by the language of text\\" and \\"a semiotic construct\\".Hasan, R. 2009. The Place of Context in a Systemic Functional Model. In M.A.K. Halliday and J.J. Webster, Continuum Companion to Systemic Functional Linguistics. London and New York: Continuum. p. 177. Since relevant context is a \\"semiotic construct\\", she argued that it should be \\"within the descriptive orbit of linguistics\\". Further, since systemic functional linguistics is a social semiotic theory of language, then it is incumbent on linguists in this tradition to \\"throw light on this construct\\".Hasan, R. 2009. The Place of Context in a Systemic Functional Model. In M.A.K. Halliday and J.J. Webster, Continuum Companion to Systemic Functional Linguistics. London and New York: Continuum. p. 177. Hasan critiqued the typical application of Halliday's terms \\"field\\", \\"tenor\\" and \\"mode\\" by systemic linguists, on the basis that the terms have been applied as if their meaning and place in the theory was self-evident.Hasan, R. 2009. The Place of Context in a Systemic Functional Model. In M.A.K. Halliday and J.J. Webster, Continuum Companion to Systemic Functional Linguistics. London and New York: Continuum. pp. 179‚Äì80. She argued for the application of the system network as a mechanism for the systematic description of the regularities across diverse social contexts.Hasan, R. 2004. Analysing Discursive Variation. In L. Young and C. Harrison (eds) Systemic Functional Linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis: Studies in Social Change. London and New York: Continuum. pp. 15‚Äì52. Studies in semantic variation Ruqaiya Hasan. 2009. Semantic Variation: Meaning in Society and Sociolinguistics. London: Equinox While working at Macquarie University in Sydney, Hasan undertook 10 years of research into the role of everyday language in the formation of children's orientation to social context. She adopted the term semantic variation to describe her findings from this research, a term first coined by Labov and Weiner.see Weiner, E.J. and Labov, W. 1983. Constraints on agent-less passive. Australian Journal of Linguistics 19(1): 29‚Äì58. Having proposed the concept, the authors explicitly rejected the possibility of semantic variation as a sociolinguistic concept, except as possibility a function of age.see Weiner, E.J. and Labov, W. 1983. Constraints on agent-less passive. Australian Journal of Linguistics 19(1): 29‚Äì58.Hasan, R. 2009. \\"On semantic variation\\". In Hasan, R. Semantic Variation: Meaning in Society and in Sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 41. Hasan's work was an empirical investigation of semantic variation. Her findings represent linguistic correlates of Basil Bernstein's conception of \\"coding orientation\\". Hasan collected some 100 hours of naturally occurring discourse in families across distinct social locations. She used the terms higher-autonomy professional and lower-autonomy professional to distinguish social locations, the latter describing professionals who have discretion over the way their working time is organized, as distinct from those whose time is at the discretion of others higher up in a workplace hierarchy. The findings are set out in Hasan 2009, the second volume of her collected papers.Lemke, J. 2011. \\"Review of Semantic Variation: Meaning in society and sociolinguistics\\". Linguistics and the Human Sciences. London: Equinox. pp. 1‚Äì7. Of this work on semantic variation, Jay Lemke, adjunct professor of communication at the University of California, writes: : :The results of this work were at least twofold. First, it established in great detail and with high statistical significance that across social class lines there were major differences in how mothers and young children from working class vs middle class families framed questions and answers, commands and requests, and grounds and reasons in casual conversation in normal settings. And second, it showed that the usual mode of teachers‚Äô talk with these children was if anything an exaggerated version of the typical middle-class ways of meaning. :The theoretical significance goes well beyond even these important results. Educationally, and in terms of social policy, it faces us with the truth of Basil Bernstein's hypothesis of many years ago that ways of meaning differ significantly across social class positions, and that home and school, functioning as critical settings for socialization, tend to inculcate these ways of meaning and then evaluate and classify them in ways that lead to or at least significantly support the realities of social class differentiation and hierarchization in modern societies (Bernstein, 1971). Linguistically and sociologically, Hasan argues from her data, variation in meaning making must be considered an integral if not the primary factor in our understanding of the role of language in the constitution of social structure.\\"Lemke, J. 2011. Review of Semantic Variation: Meaning in society and sociolinguistics. Linguistics and the Human Sciences. London: Equinox. pp1-2. Studies in verbal art Hasan's studies of verbal art are a linguistic extension of the Prague School, and in particular the work of Jan Muka≈ôovsk√Ω. According to Hasan, of the Prague School linguists Muka≈ôovsk√Ω has produced \\"the most coherent view of the nature of verbal art and its relation to language\\".(Hasan, R. 1985. Linguistics, language and verbal art. Geelong: Deakin University Press: 122) Muka≈ôovsk√Ω argued that poetic language cannot be characterised by reference to a single property of language. The aesthetic function is instead a mode of using the properties of language.Muka≈ôovsk√Ω J., 1977. The Word and Verbal Art. New Haven: Yale University Press. From Muka≈ôovsk√Ω, Hasan took the notion of foregrounding. The process of foregrounding, or making salient, depends on contrast: an aspect of the text's language, or a set of textual features, can only be foregrounded against a patterning which becomes the ‚Äòbackground‚Äô. This is the notion of a figure and ground relationship. Foregrounding, for Hasan, is contrast with respect to the norms of the text.Hasan, R. 1985. Linguistics, language and verbal art. Geelong: Deakin University Press: 94 However the idea of contrast is not self- evident. We need to be able to specify under what conditions a pattern in language is significant such that we consider it to be foregrounded, and, therefore, can attribute to it some of the responsibilities for conveying the text's deeper meanings. A pattern draws attention to itself, i.e. is foregrounded, when it displays consistency. There are two aspects to this consistency: consistency in terms of its \\"semantic drift\\" (Butt 1983) and consistency in terms of its textual location. Semantic drift refers to the manner in which an ensemble of features take the reader toward ‚Äúthe same general kind of meaning‚Äù (Hasan, 1985a: 95). Consistency of textual location refers not to any gross notion of location, such as every other paragraph or every five lines. Rather, consistency of textual location refers to ‚Äúsome significant point in the organisation of the text as a unity‚Äù (ibid: 96). The process of attending to the foregrounded patterns in the text is the means by which we proceed from simple statements about the language to an explication of the ‚Äòartness‚Äô of the text. Ultimately, Hasan describes the patterning of language patterns as 'symbolic articulation'.Hasan, R. 1985. Linguistics, language and verbal art. Geelong: Deakin University Press 'Symbolic articulation' is the means by which a process of \\"second-order semiosis\\" emerges, that is the process by which \\"one order of meaning acts as metaphor for a second order of meaning‚Äù.Hasan, R. 1985.

The single was a re-working of the song originally released on her 1989 album, The Sensual World. The song's lyrics describe an increasingly intense relationship between a lonely person and a computer. It is her first single release since 2005.  Background  Kate Bush explained that the song is about how people are replacing human relationships with technology: > \\"This is about people... well, about the modern situation, where more and > more people are having less contact with human beings. We spend all day with > machines; all night with machines. You know, all day, you're on the phone, > all night you're watching telly. Press a button, this happens. [...] And > this is the idea of someone who spends all their time with their computer > and, like a lot of people, they spend an obsessive amount of time with their > computer. People really build up heavy relationships with their computers!\\"  Song information  The Director's Cut version of the song is almost two minutes longer than the original recording on The Sensual World, and features re-recorded vocals and a harmonica solo at the end. The later version features the voice of her son, Albert, on the chorus, performing the role of the computer. For the original recording, the chorus vocals were distorted using a very basic vocoder, and needed backing vocals just to make the words audible. For the Director's Cut version, Bush was able to present it as a solitary computerized voice, as was her original intention. This is not the first time Bush worked with her son; he makes a brief spoken word appearance on her previous album Aerial on Disc 2, \\"A Sky of Honey\\".  Music video  A short film to accompany the track premiered on Kate Bush's official YouTube channel on Monday, 25 April 2011. It is directed by Bush herself and stars Robbie Coltrane, Frances Barber, Noel Fielding, and the voice of her son Albert, who plays the role of the computer program. Music website Consequence of Sound reviewed the video and briefly explained it: > The video adapts the song's core plot ‚Äì a person becoming addicted to a > program called Voice Console deeply, emotionally attaching themselves to it > to the point of separation with friends and family. Robbie Coltrane, best > known for his work in Harry Potter as Hagrid, plays the computer junkie who > leaves behind his wife and two sons to escape with the program. In the > video, Voice Console is a pair of feminine lips on a screen (Bush's son > Albert) with an eerie inhuman blackness behind them [...]. The program > spouts hallucinogenic wave forms that cast Coltrane into a state of > euphoria. When the family finally steps in to disable the sinister program, > Coltrane turns on them and in his withdrawal things get very dark and > strange.  Release  The song premiered on BBC Radio 2 on Monday 4 April 2011 on The Ken Bruce Show and was made available for streaming on Kate Bush's official YouTube channel after the radio premiere. \\"Deeper Understanding\\" was released as a digital download single on Tuesday 5 April.

The book is based on a series of four lectures endowed by Granada Television and delivered at Manchester, Keele, Hull, and Sheffield Universities in England. The first lecture, on The Deadly Theatre, was delivered on 1 February 1965 at Manchester University. The lecture series helped to fund his long- planned trip to Afghanistan. The work was considered controversial when first published in 1968 and received mixed reviews. However, it is now widely taught in higher education theatre studies courses. The Empty Space is defined by Brook as \\"[A]ny space in which theatre takes place.\\" \\"I can take any empty space and call it a bare stage.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=534728 on 2015-02-01 Other common names include white-striped octopus and night octopus, in reference to its nocturnal habits. It was previously known as Polypus ornatus. C. ornatus is edible and was recorded in a Hawaiian market in 1914 by S. S. Berry. Description The upper arms of Callistoctopus ornatus are much longer and thicker than the other arms. They are pink to red in colour with paired white spots down the arms and short longitudinal white stripes on their mantle. This species can weigh several kilograms, and can reach an armspan of up to 2m.http://australianmuseum.net.au/White-striped-Octopus-Octopus- ornatus#sthash.wU6d8z4h.dpuf Retrieved on 28 Jan 2015 The body is oval-shaped to elongate and the eyes are large. The arms are about six times the length of the body with the front pair being the longest. Each arm has two rows of suckers. The webs are shallow. The skin is fairly smooth with long flaps able to be raised in the white stripes on the sides of the body.http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank- treatment.pl?id=77081 Retrieved on 28 Jan 2015 Distribution This species has one of the widest distributions of all octopus, because of the planktonic life stage of the hatchlings. It is found throughout tropical waters in the Indo-Pacific, from Hawaii and Easter Island to South Africa. In Australian waters it is found from northern New South Wales around the northern coastline to Perth in Western Australia. The distribution of this octopus appears to be limited to tropical waters within the 20 ¬∞C isotherm. However specimens collected in the warm temperate waters of New South Wales are probably a result of the planktonic juveniles being carried south by the warm East Australian Current. Habitat Adults are usually found on coral reefs. Lairs found on the southern Great Barrier Reef consist of deep vertical holes excavated in coral rubble. The entrances are sealed during the day with rubble. Diet These octopus eat mainly fish and crustaceans. They hunt at night and can be observed foraging over reef flats or on sand and gravel substrate during nightly low tides. Hunting consists of probing long arms down holes or enveloping small coral heads within the webs and using the arm tips to flush prey into the waiting suckers. The stomach contents also regularly contain the beaks of other octopus species. Other night-active octopuses in the same habitat flee in an explosion of ink if a single arm of this octopus touches them. Reproduction Nothing is known of mating behaviour. Females lay up to 35,000 small eggs, each about 2mm long. The hatchlings swim up into the plankton and are carried away by surface currents. Eventually they settle in a new coral reef and develop into adults. Use by humans This octopus is harvested by subsistence hunters throughout its range. Historically it was collected by Polynesian Hawaiians using torches to find foraging animals at night. The animals were then killed with hand spears.

The trial became a cause c√©l√®bre scandalising British colonial society. William Somerset Maugham wrote a short story about the case which he subsequently turned into a successful 1927 play The Letter and which in turn received several film and TV adaptions, the most well known is William Wyler's movie The Letter. In addition, it was referenced in the 1977 film East of Elephant Rock by Don Boyd. It was the subject of a 2000 book by Eric Lawlor. History =Ethel Proudlock= Ethel Proudlock, n√©e Charter, was a Eurasian who married William Proudlock, acting headmaster of the prestigious Victoria Institution for boys in Kuala Lumpur, at the age of 19 in 1907. =Incident= On the evening of 23 April 1911, she was alone in the VI headmaster's bungalow (near the present-day Pasar Seni LRT/MRT station ) while her husband dined with a fellow teacher. In the course of that evening, she shot dead William Steward, a mine manager. Steward had visited her by rickshaw and had told the rickshaw boy to wait outside. Shortly afterwards, the boy heard two shots and saw Steward stumble out of the house across the veranda followed by Proudlock carrying a revolver; she then fired the remaining four bullets into him. Proudlock stood trial for murder in June 1911. There was no jury, and her case was heard by a judge and two assessors. The trial lasted 10 days and attracted intense local interest. Proudlock claimed that Steward had attempted to rape her and that she was acting in self-defence. However, the judge found her guilty of murder on the basis of inconsistencies in her testimony and other circumstantial evidence and sentenced her to death. The verdict caused a furor in the local community, prompting The Malay Mail to issue the following notice =Aftermath= Proudlock appealed the verdict and spent five months in Pudu jail awaiting her appeal. During the course of that time, a number of petitions were created for her, including one from her husband and the boys of the Victoria Institution, prompting the Sultan of Selangor to pardon her. Ethel Proudlock immediately left the colony with her three-year-old daughter for England and eventually America. William Proudlock left soon after for England. It's not known whether he ever rejoined Ethel, but he did keep in touch. By 1931, he had moved to South Africa and ultimately to Argentina to teach at St. George's College, Quilmes. He died in 1958.

The poem was published in his book The Opening of the Field. The speaker describes a meadow to which he is \\"often permitted to return.\\" This meadow seems to represent a place that is metaphysically, spiritually, and emotionally valuable for him. The notion of permission is ambiguous: it is not made clear who does the permitting or why permission is needed.  Themes  Duncan sets up dichotomies and hierarchies which he subsequently twists and folds. He suggests divisions between artificial and organic (made, not made); natural and cultural (meadow, hall); and freedom and ownership (not mine, mine). It also plays with the theme of place by positing the meadow as a real location that also represents a pinnacle of metaphysical abstraction. Other important dichotomies include youth/age, mental/physical, reality/dream, landscape/architecture, and light/shadow. = Nature and Culture = The poem spans nature and culture with a series of equivalences: meadow, pasture, field folded, words within words, hall, hill, etc. Another series of connections: light, shadow, forms, architecture, I, First Beloved; this leads into a series of female titles: First Beloved, Lady, and Queen Under The Hill. All of these series constitute journeys to and from the oft-permitted meadow. = Time = The sixth stanza describes the meadow in relation to the progress of the sun. The time of the dream is \\"an hour before the sun's going down\\"; at the same time, the grass of the meadow is \\"blowing / east against the source of the sun.\\" These images invoke circularity: the meadow encompasses a whole day, even when viewed from a single present. This perspective is reinforced by the final stanza, which describes the meadow as a \\"place of first permission, / everlasting omen of what is.\\" These lines convey the idea of a place that entangles past, present, and future in an orderly and perhaps transcendent fashion. = Boundaries = The \\"certain bounds\\" that \\"hold against chaos\\" enable the poem's narrator to return to this particular place. The meadow is eternal and originary, yet paradoxically requires these boundaries to retain its unique position. These boundaries apply not only to Duncan's idea, but also to the signifier \\"meadow,\\" which unsteadily holds this place \\"near to the heart.\\" External links * Full text hosted by the Poetry Foundation. * Several critics discuss the poem: On \\"Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow\\" * An essay by Lisa Jarnot 1960 poems American poems ","title":"Often I Am Permitted to Return to a Meadow"},{"id":"31257983","text":"Dhuandhar Waterfalls in Bhedaghat, India as viewed from east side.Jabalpur The Dhuandhar Falls (‡§ß‡•Å‡§Ü‡§Ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞) is a waterfall in Jabalpur district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

The horse stands on the snake. The group is accompanied by birds. Ahead of the horse is the sign of the sun. 10th century. Permian bronze casts ‚Äì Permic and Western Siberian animal style cult cast figurines ‚Äì were the predominant form of Finno-Ugrian toreutics of the 3rd‚Äì12th centuries CE. It was spread throughout a large area of forests of the north-eastern Urals and western Siberia from the basins of the Kama and Vyatka to the Ob. In the Middle Ages, these territories were inhabited mostly by the Ugrian tribes, ancestors of the present day Hungarians and Ob-Ugrians ‚Äì the Khanty and the Mansi people. Their style is referred to as the \\"Permian animal style\\". The first collections of these works of arts and their scholarly research date back to the end of the 19th century. Despite over a century of research into the field, Perm animal style still remains one of the most mysterious cultural phenomena of Eurasia. This can be explained by the absence of written tradition of its creators and lack of external historic evidence about the creators of the bronze images in the heyday of the animal style. The golden age of cult metallurgy began immediately after the period of the Great Migrations (4‚Äì5th centuries CE) and continued in the epoch of the medieval Urals and Siberia of 6‚Äì11th centuries CE. A large collection was amassed by the Stroganov family in Perm. Researchers point to the influence of Scytho- Sarmatian animal style on the development of cult toreutics of the forests of the north: famous animal battle scenes, vertical model of the Universe in the form of three worlds ‚Äì three levels of the plaques and the cult of the great mother-goddess are present in both styles. Perm animal style objects include metalwork of bronze with the usage of single- or double-sided forms for casting, bone and wooden carvings, engravings on metal and bone objects. Figures depicted on the images are elks, rain-deers, bears, fur-bearing and other types of animals, horses, different waterfowl and birds of prey, snakes, insects and a number of \\"complex creatures\\" of mixed nature (hybrids), mixed zoomorphic and anthropomorphic half-human creatures; there are also a number of images of horsemen. The stories, which the Perm animal style plaques tell, are numerous and diverse.The objects are found in the hoards, on the sites of the temples, among the skeletons, in burials, as part of sacrificial complexes or on the sites of metallurgical workshops. Most of the bronze artifacts were used as a cult figures for the sacred rites. The sculptural embodiment of a spirit or an ancestor is not the monument for him, neither it is the place where the spirit dwells, but the deity itself. Wooden or metal ingots and the spirits or souls cocooned inside them are inseparable unit, so that the figurine becomes a divine piece of wood or metal. Kustaa Fredrik Karjalainen uses the Khanty notion of \\"tonx\\" to describe the idea of one of human souls. The images were made for \\"tonx\\". \\"After a piece of wood has been given a shape of a human or after a tin cast, having a certain human form, has hardened, it is important to transfer or to indwell in it a \\"tonx\\" of the spirit which the figurine depicts, and only after that the image becomes a \\"tonx\\" to which necessary honours can be given\\". The specialists believe that for making figurines the real wooden models were used which were painted or rubbed with the sacrificial blood. Permian Animal style: Elk-headed man on the lizard. 8th century Raw material for copper casting were cupriferous sandstones of the Upper Kama. The alloys mostly consisted of copper (up to 86%), tin (10‚Äì17%), sometimes zinc (up to 7%) and arsenic. In the first millennium CE in the Upper Kama, as well in other regions of European North-East and Ob region, the coppers used were high in tin and zinc. The objects of the animal style are usually divided into two groups, according to their function and the sphere of usage. The first group is Perm-Pechora bronze open-work objects having worship purpose. Certain objects from this group have a complicated composition, a sophisticated story behind them and many-leveled structure. Most artistically expressive compositions are 3-leveled cosmological compositions with a goddess in the center. Upper level consists of the heads of elks, heavenly faces, and soul birds associated with the Higher World of heavenly creatures, middle level is an earthly world of people and animals. The ruler of the Middle world is a deity (mother goddess) depicted in the center, and an animal at her feet is as a rule hybrid animal consisting of parts of different terrestrial animals ‚Äì it marks the borders of Lower invisible world. The hallmark of the Perm animal style is the images of elk peoples, and to be more precise, the image of man-bird-elk, found nowhere else in the territory of Eurasia.The second group is the Transural, Western-Siberia animal style. There are a lot of applied and decorative artifacts ‚Äì decorations, including costume decorations ‚Äì belt plates, buckles, clasps, bracelets with zoomorphic images, pendants, beads, pommels, sheaths, needle cases, ear-picks, stills and combs. Mythological stories could be seen on the plaques, depicting \\"complex animals\\" ‚Äì mixed bears and fur-bearing animals, on figured pendants in the form of waterfowl, horses, in the images of birds of prey on the pommels. According to the sphere of usage, cult metalwork objects can be divided into groups: for instance, the ones protecting against diseases (they were as a norm kept at home), the others ‚Äì \\"spirits of the happiness\\" ‚Äì bringing luck as a response to the sacrifices (they were inside community temples).The diversity of cult artifacts and mythological stories on the plaques presuppose the existence of developed mythology of the creators of the animal style. Perm Animal Style appeared on the territory of Scytho-Sarmatian world at the beginning of the first millennium CE and disappeared at the beginning of the second millennium, on the eve of the Mongolian invasions. The last traces of this civilization can be observed in the traditional culture of the Ob-Ugrians ‚Äì the Khantys and the Mansis. Casting of objects for worship existed for over a thousand years and ensured the unity of the pagan world of the Urals and Western Siberia.

Langdon Parsons\\", was a Cornish Australian minister of the Baptist church, politician, and the 5th Government Resident of the Northern Territory, 1884‚Äì1890. Biography Parsons was born on 28 April 1837 at Botathan near Launceston, Cornwall, a son of Edward Parsons and his wife Jane, n√©e Langdon. He was educated at local schools and Bellevue Grammar School, Plymouth and was subsequently employed in a business house in London, but left to study for the Baptist ministry at Regent's Park College. He left for South Australia aboard Orient in company with merchant Charles H. Goode, arriving in July 1863, and preached his first sermon at George Stonehouse's Baptist church on LeFevre Terrace, North Adelaide on 19 July. He proceeded to Angaston, where he attracted large congregations, and married a granddaughter of George Fife Angas on 23 January 1866. He accepted an invitation to serve at the Baptist Church in Dunedin, New Zealand, but the climate affected his wife's health, and they returned to Angaston. In 1869 Rev. Stonehouse had been forced by a throat malady to retire from active ministry, and Parsons accepted the invitation to take over that pulpit. The congregation had outgrown their building and it was decided to build a new church on Tynte Street, North Adelaide, and meanwhile services were held in the Temperance Hall on the same street. In December 1869 the foundation stone was laid, and the first service was held in the new North Adelaide Baptist Church on 6 November 1870. He left the ministry on account of failing health, or loss of faith, and after a holiday in England and Norway, joined with J. Preston as merchants, then with Ebenezer Finlayson's brokerage and agency business. He then determined to enter politics. He was elected to the Assembly seat for Encounter Bay in 1878 as a colleague of (later Sir) James Boucaut until 1881, then won North Adelaide in 1881. For some years previously he had been a useful member of the Council of Education, and resigned prior to entering parliament, but the cause was dear to his heart, and he was appointed Minister of Education in 1881, serving until 1884, in which year he was granted the Queen's permission to bear for life the title of \\"honorable\\". > In debate he soon established a reputation as one of the most fluent and > persuasive speakers of the House. Lucid, exact, and eloquent, there was a > charm, and vitality about Mr. Parsons' speeches that won the sympathy and > admiration of legislators, as well as of outside audiences. Few publicists > in the history of the State cultivated the art of oratory with greater > success. ... As Minister of Education, he was one of the most enlightened , > and useful administrators who have occupied the office in South Australia; > and he earnestly applied himself to strengthening and consolidating the > educational system. In 1884 Parsons was appointed Government Resident for the Northern Territory, residing at Port Darwin. He served in this position for six years and the reports he wrote were widely read, not only for their insights but for their literary charm. He resigned his position ahead of the creation of a separate electoral district for the Northern Territory in 1890, and was elected, with Vaiben Louis Solomon as his colleague, and served as the first Minister for the Northern Territory, from 1890 to 1893. He was instrumental in the development of railways in the Territory, and he also recognised Aboriginal land rights. On the dissolution of Parliament in 1893 Mr. Parsons did not seek re-election. In 1895 he visited Japan as hon. commissioner for the Government of South Australia to enquire into the prospects of opening up trade relations with Japan, China, and the Philippine Islands. Parsons did much to extend trade with the Far East, and as recognition of his efforts the Emperor of Japan conferred upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. In 1896 he was appointed Consul for Japan, and in 1898 when he revisited that country he was granted an audience with the Emperor, who presented him with a pair of valuable cloisonn√© vases. In 1896 Parsons was unsuccessful in his bid for election as a delegate to the Federal Convention. He was elected to the Legislative Council for the Central district in February 1901 for the National Defence League and served to 1903.Elizabeth Kwan, 'Parsons, John Langdon (1837‚Äì1903)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/parsons-john- langdon-7966/text13871, published first in hardcopy 1988, accessed online 30 January 2017. > [Parsons] was one of the most scholarly men in South Australia.

His breathing became more difficult, as a consequence of a heart complaint brought on by rheumatic fever when a child. Nevertheless, he continued to sit in the Legislative Council until a week before his death. His mind remained clear and he suffered no pain throughout his illness.

Discovery Gaffkaemia was first discovered in 1947 in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) in a holding tank in Maine. It was originally described as \\"Gaffkya homari\\" by Hitcher and Snieszko, but the genus name Gaffkya was rejected in 1971, and the gaffkaemia bacterium was recognised as a subspecies or variety of Aerococcus viridans by Kelly and Evans in 1974. Effects The effects of gaffkaemia infection include lethargy (typically seen as a drooping tail), anorexia and a pink colour on the ventral side of the abdomen, which gives the disease its alternative common name of red tail disease. When lobsters are moribund, they may lie on their sides, and frequently lose appendages. The effects of gaffkaemia are slowed by low temperatures, such that death can occur within two days of infection at , but can take over 60 days at . As few as five bacteria can lead to clinical disease. When they enter the host, the bacteria colonise the heart and hepatopancreas. They may be engulfed by phagocytosis into the lobster's blood cells, but continue to survive within the blood cells, feeding on the cytoplasm. The lobster's blood cell count drops, and the infection develops into septicaemia. The stores of glycogen in the hepatopancreas become depleted, concentrations of glucose and lactic acid in the blood drop, and concentrations of adenosine triphosphate in muscles also fall. In a severe infection, the ability of the lobster's blood pigment haemocyanin to carry oxygen may be reduced by up to 50%. Diagnosis The classical method of diagnosis is to culture aliquots of haemolymph in phenylethyl alcohol broth. Cultures containing A. viridans var. homari change colour from purple to yellow, and form tetrads of cocci. To reduce the four-day waiting time needed for diagnosis, a method using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) was developed, and, more recently, PCR-based methods have been developed. Virulence Gaffkaemia is enzootic in North America, and causes little harm to wild populations of H. americanus. In the European or common lobster, Homarus gammarus, however, it is far more destructive. European lobsters held in the same tanks as American lobsters can be killed within days. A number of other crustacean species can be infected with A. v. var. homari, but do not develop severe disease. They include the shrimp Pandalus platyceros, and the crabs Cancer borealis, Cancer irroratus, Metacarcinus magister, Libinia emarginata, Chionoecetes opilio and Chaceon quinquedens. Spiny lobsters appear to be either immune or resistant to gaffkaemia. Control The primary method for controlling the incidence of gaffkaemia is improved hygiene. Other measures include limiting damage to the exoskeleton (preventing the bacterium's entry), reducing the water temperature, and reducing the stocking density. Antibiotics may be effective against the bacterium, but only tetracycline is currently approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration for use in American lobsters.

Long represented solely by the heavily-armored reptile Doswellia, the family's composition has expanded since 2011, although two supposed South American doswelliids (Archeopelta and Tarjadia) were later redescribed as erpetosuchids. Doswelliids were not true archosaurs, but they were close relatives and some studies have considered them among the most derived non- archosaurian archosauriforms. They may have also been related to the Proterochampsidae, a South American family of crocodile-like archosauriforms.  Description  Doswelliids are believed to be semiaquatic carnivores similar to crocodilians in appearance, as evidenced by their short legs and eyes and nostrils which are set high on the head, though the putative member Scleromochlus has been interpreted as a frog-like hopper by one study.Bennett, S.C. (2020). \\"Reassessment of the Triassic archosauriform Scleromochlus taylori: neither runner nor biped, but hopper\\". PeerJ. 8: e8418. doi:10.7717/peerj.8418. ISSN 2167-8359. They had long bodies and tails, and their front legs were shorter than their hind legs. Unlike in some other groups of archosauriforms, doswelliids retain teeth on the pterygoid, on the roof of the mouth. Although Vancleavea had a short and deep skull, most doswelliids had slender and elongated snouts, similar to other members of Proterochampsia. Advanced doswelliids possessed dorsal ribs which splay outwards (rather than downwards), making their bodies wide and low. Doswelliids were armored with multiple rows of bony scutes (osteoderms) on their backs. With the exception of Vancleavea, which had many different forms of smooth osteoderms, doswelliid osteoderms were characteristically covered by deep, circular pits. There is also a smooth area (an anterior articular lamina) on the front edge of each osteoderm where the preceding osteoderm overlaps. This combination of osteoderm features is also present in erpetosuchids and some aetosaurs, although the osteoderms of the latter group differ in the arrangement of the pits and the fact that the anterior articular lamina is formed by a raised bar. Doswellia had at least ten rows of osteoderms, creating a flattened carapace-like armor plate on its back. Jaxtasuchus had lighter armor, with only four rows.  Classification  The family was originally named by R. E. Weems in 1980 and was placed in its own suborder, Doswelliina. The Doswelliidae has long been considered a monospecific family of basal archosauriforms represented by Doswellia kaltenbachi from the Late Triassic of North America. However, a 2011 cladistic analysis by Desojo, Ezcurra, & Schultz recovered the newly named Brazilian genus Archeopelta as well as the enigmatic Argentinian archosauriform Tarjadia as close relatives of Doswellia, within a monophyletic Doswelliidae. These authors defined the family as the most inclusive clade containing all archosauromorphs more closely related to Doswellia kaltenbachi than to Proterochampsa barrionuevoi, Erythrosuchus africanus, Caiman latirostris, (the broad-snouted caiman) or Passer domesticus (the house sparrow). Within the next few years, several other genera of archosauriforms were classified as Dosweliids. A second New Mexican species of Doswellia was described in 2012; however, this species was subsequently transferred to the separate doswelliid genus Rugarhynchos. Two additional dosweliids were named in 2013: Jaxtasuchus salomoni based on several skeletons found in the Ladinian-age Lower Keuper of Germany, and Ankylosuchus chinlegroupensis based on fragments of four vertebrae, parts of the skull and of a limb bone from the early Carnian Colorado City Formation. Desojo, Ezcurra, & Schultz (2011)'s analysis placed Doswellidae as the closest large monophyletic clade to Archosauria, with only the Chinese archosauriform Yonghesuchus nested closer to archosaurs. However, a phylogenetic analysis by Ezcurra (2016) recovered Doswelliidae alongside the family Proterochampsidae within the clade Proterochampsia, which was found to be the sister taxon of Archosauria. The unusual aquatic archosauriform Vancleavea was also referred to Doswelliidae in this analysis. Subsequently, Ezcurra et al. (2017) excluded Archeopelta and Tarjadia from Doswelliidae, considering them to be archosaurs of the family Erpetosuchidae instead. Litorosuchus, an aquatic archosauriform which is considered a close relative of Vancleavea, may also be a doswelliid if Vancleavea is a member of the family.

The area, which is part of the city green belt, contains lakes, meadows and oak groves. It was drained in the 19th century to transform the area into farmland. Restoration work started in 1994 and has reversed this situation and now Salburua is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The Salburua marshes are considered to be \\"the Basque country's most valuable area of wetland\\", according to a Fedenatur report for the European Commission in 2004. History Before 1857, the Salburua wetlands had at least three lakes: Beto√±o, Larregana, and Arcaute. The grazing, hunting and fishing were well known throughout Basque Country. Around Arcaute lake was an oak forest landscape characteristic of the Plains of Alava. In 1857, a process of draining the lakes and forest clearance was initiated with the aim of producing valuable agricultural land. This process continued into the 20th century when the last lake, Beto√±o, was drained. The wetlands nowadays Work began in 1994 on the recovery of the ancient landscape. At that time there was only a remnant of forest, north of Elorriaga, and a small wet patch near Beto√±o, in which the last animals and plants characteristic of these environments barely survived. Negative impacts on the area were included poaching, slums, and waste disposal. Ecological restoration work began with the reversal of the drainage of Lake Beto√±o. In 1998 a dam was built in the Canal de la Balsa to help this process. Through these activities it has been possible to recover an area of more than , of which, at times of maximum flooding, are covered by water. The restoration of Salburua serves as protection against flooding in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which uses the lagoons and ponds. Since 1994 restoration work and landscaping in the vicinity of the lakes, and along water courses, have helped to recover some of the original wealth of Salburua. In addition to the ecological recovery, walkways, paths and bird hides have been provided. Ataria wetlands interpretation centre An interpretation and information centre, Ataria, was opened in 2009. The facilities include an exhibition area, a caf√©, auditorium and a cantilevered observation deck, which extends over a lagoon. Biodiversity The flora includes a mass of well-preserved Carex riparia and other aquatic flora. Invertebrates include carabid beetles in different species with at least two endemic types. Small mammals include the European mink which is an endangered species. There is also a wide variety of amphibians. At present the greatest threat to these species is the arrival of invasive species. Large numbers of birds use the wetlands for breeding or wintering. The INBIOS Project aims to improve populations of threatened species: bats, sand martins, waders, herons and otters; improve the conservation status of habitats, especially aquatic vegetation and the edges of ponds; combating invasive alien species of fauna, fish and American freshwater crayfish. Another objective is to conduct the first pilot project of reintroduction of European mink in the river ecosystems of northern Spain. =Flora= Although the most spectacular sight are the animals, Salburua also hosts a variety of vegetation, especially wetland species. Many of these species have managed to revive after the revitalization of wetlands. There are up to about thirty-five different species, including marshmallow, aconite, sedges and orchids. =Fauna= Apart from a herd of deer, introduced artificially to the marsh for vegetation control, all the wildlife that lives in the wetland is of wild origin. One of the most important carabid beetle communities of the Iberian Peninsula is present as well as one of the most comprehensive communities of amphibians and reptiles of the Basque Country. The strategic location on migration paths enables thousands of birds to visit by Salburua. Some of them are in the area through the winter and even choose these ponds for breeding. one of the world's most endangered carnivores, the European mink has been re-introduced. Urbanization Urbanization in Salburua The wetlands are bordered by a large residential district of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which is still under development as of 2012. The northern part includes high bioclimatic towers and apartment blocks of 4-6 stories high. The runway of the former city airport, located right in the middle of the development, has become an avenue. It is a low density place and has approximately 7,000 residents. The Santo Tomas district is still under construction and will eventually have half of the population of the district, with about 16,000 inhabitants. The \\"Gateway of Arkay\\" will join the municipal boundaries and include the towns of Elorriaga and Arkay. Its development began in mid-2010.

(1480 ‚Äì before 10 March 1524), was an Italian artist and pupil of Leonardo da Vinci from 1490 to 1518. Sala√¨ entered Leonardo's household at the age of ten. He created paintings under the name of Andrea Sala√¨. He was described as one of Leonardo's students and lifelong servant and is thought by some to be the model for Leonardo's St. John the Baptist and Bacchus. Early life Monna Vanna ‚Äì a nude version of the Mona Lisa Sala√¨ was born in 1480 as son of Pietro di Giovanni, a tenant of Leonardo's vineyard near the Porta Vercellina, Milan. He joined Leonardo's household at the age of ten as an assistant. Vasari describes Sala√¨ as \\"a graceful and beautiful youth with curly hair, in which Leonardo greatly delighted\\". Although Leonardo described him as \\"a liar, a thief, stubborn and a glutton\\" and he stole from Leonardo on at least five occasions, he kept him in his household for more than 25 years, in which he trained as an artist. Sala√¨ became a capable, although not very impressive, painter, who created several works, including the Monna Vanna, a nude version of the Mona Lisa which may be based on a charcoal sketch by Leonardo. He is also considered one potential creator of the Prado's copy of the Mona Lisa. Leonardo is thought to have used Sala√¨ as the model for several of his works, specifically St. John the Baptist and Bacchus. Some researchers also believe that Sala√¨ and not Lisa del Giocondo was the real model for the Mona Lisa but this claim is disputed by the Louvre. Cristo giovanetto come Salvator Mundi, Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci During Leonardo's second stay in Milan, he took another young pupil, Francesco Melzi. Unlike Sala√¨, Francesco was a son of a nobleman. When Leonardo traveled to Rome in 1513 and to France in 1516, Sala√¨ and Melzi both accompanied him. As an adult, Melzi became secretary and main assistant of Leonardo, and undertook to prepare Leonardo's writings for publication. Vasari says that Melzi \\"at the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful and very much loved young man\\". In France, Francesco Melzi was greeted as \\"Italian gentleman living with master Leonardo\\" and granted donation of 400 ecus, while Sala√¨, 36 years old, was described as \\"servant\\" and granted a one time donation of 100 ecus. Sala√¨ left Leonardo and France in 1518. He later returned to Milan to work on Leonardo's vineyard, previously worked by Sala√¨'s father, half of which was granted to him by Leonardo's will. It is commonly believed that upon Leonardo's death in 1519, Sala√¨ inherited several paintings including the Mona Lisa. Through his estate, many of those works, notably the Mona Lisa, passed into the possession of Francis I of France. While Leonardo left all personal belongings, paintings, drawings and notes to Francesco Melzi in his will, it is unclear whether this included the Mona Lisa. Sala√¨ married Bianca Coldirodi d'Annono on June 14, 1523, at the age of 43.Claire J. Farago, Taylor and Francis Inc, Leonardo's Art ‚Äì Twentieth-Century Connoisseurship and Iconographic Studies, Leonardo's Projects from 1500‚Äì1519, Vol 3 (1999) p 397 Sala√¨ died in 1524 as a result of a wound received from a crossbow in a duel and was buried in Milan on 10 March 1524. Sala√¨'s sexuality Angelo Incarnato, drawing by Leonardo, . A number of drawings among the works of Leonardo and his pupils make reference to Sala√¨'s sexuality. There is a drawing modelled on Leonardo's painting John the Baptist and called The Angel Incarnate, of a young man nude with an erect phallus, and appearing to represent Sala√¨. The face of the figure is closer to Sala√¨'s copy of Leonardo's painting, than to the original John the Baptist in the Louvre. It may have been drawn by Sala√¨ himself. A folio by Leonardo includes a page of drawings by a hand other than Leonardo's, one of which is a crudely drawn sketch depicting an anus, identified as \\"Sala√¨'s bum\\", pursued by penises on legs.The page on which this sketch appears is the same page that contains the depiction of a bicycle. Neither drawing is by Leonardo, and the page was not seen until a restoration of the volume in the 1960s, in the process of which, several pages went missing and were later returned. It has been suggested that the drawings are by a pupil of Leonardo's but this is debated. Relationship to the Mona Lisa A group of Italian researchers has claimed that Sala√¨ was the model for the Mona Lisa, noting the similarity in some of the facial features, particularly the nose and mouth, to those in which Sala√¨ is thought to have been the model. These claims have been disputed by the Louvre. The letters which form \\"Mona Lisa\\" can be rearranged to form \\"Mon Sala√¨\\". In popular fiction * Sala√¨ is a principal character in the novel Cenacolo by Joseph Orbi. * In Paul McAuley's novel Pasquale's Angel set in an alternate Italian Renaissance, Sala√¨ is the main antagonist. * DC Comics' 1995 Vertigo series Chiaroscuro: The Private Lives of Leonardo da Vinci (later published as a graphic novel) tells a speculative story of a love affair between Leonardo and Sala√¨. * In a DLC of the video game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, Ezio (protagonist) interacts with Sala√¨ when searching for Leonardo da Vinci.

For Thai people, money was considered as the symbol of civilization. Currency itself reflected faith in religion, culture, the customs and traditions of each era and also serve as a record of the development of Thailand. History The land which is now Thailand was once inhabited by various pre-historic communities. These groups of people left a heritage of social culture and ceremonies. In the ancient days of Thai society, before money was created to serve as a medium of exchange, humans traded goods by bartering for products of similar value. However, many products differed in quality, and buyers and sellers differed in their assessments of value and in their requirements. To facilitate product sales, several mutually-agreed commodities came into use as mediums for exchange. The Indo-China Peninsula or \\"Suvarnabhumi\\" which means 'golden peninsula', was the geographical area on which Thailand is presently situated. These ancient kingdoms were a prosperous homeland for a variety of diverse races and tribes. They were the regions that were later on known as the Funan Kingdom, Dvaravati Kingdom, Srivijaya Kingdom, and Sukhothai Kingdom. They used money as a medium of exchange which evolved into different forms of money. Thai money has the unique characteristics of the Thai nation with the Sukhothai Kingdom, using round shaped money made from silver which was known as \\"pod duang\\", and has been continued from that time down to the Ayudhya, Thonburi and the early Rattanakosin periods. Funan Kingdom (1st‚Äì6th centuries AD) Funan was the most important region of Indo‚ÄìChina and became highly successful in trade during the 1st through 6th centuries. The Funan Kingdom was influenced by India, through trading and religion. The coinage used during that period bears marks symbolizing the monarchy and the religion, these were mostly flat and round coins made from silver. These coins display, on one side, a half sun spreading rays between two rows of fish eggs. The opposite side carries, in a central position, the Sriwatsa design that represents Narayana in accordance with the Brahmin religion, with bandoh, a small Brahmin ceremonial drum, in one corner; and the swastika, a symbol that represents good luck, in the other. At the top of each coin the sign of the sun and the moon appear. Dvaravati Kingdom (6th‚Äì11th centuries) With the decline of the Funan Kingdom, several kingdoms declared their freedom and independence. They alternated as dominant powers in the area. They included the regions around the central Chao Phraya River basin such as Nakhon Pathom, Rajburi, Supanburi. They had become the important cities and formed themselves into the consolidated kingdom known as the Kingdom of Dvaravati in the 6th century AD. They also alternated at being the dominant power in the area and continued to follow the religious beliefs and administrative systems that had been adopted from India. They were also influenced by Khmer culture and beliefs. The Dvaravati Kingdom produced many types of coins as mediums of trade. They revealed, through the designs on the coins, symbols of monarchy and the power of the state, the beliefs of Buddhism, and the Bhramin religion. Samples are coins inscribed with the large conch, the small conch, the rabbit on a lily leaf, and the goat, with a row of fish eggs decorating the outer edge. On the reverse side is the Sriwatsa symbol flanked by ankusha, with the sun and moon on the top and fish at the bottom. In addition, there are flat coins on one side. On some of these coins appeared the features of Buranaklod (water jar), the Dhama wheel and a cow. On the reverse side of the coins is ancient Sanskrit script. Srivijaya Kingdom (8th‚Äì13th centuries) Around the 8th century, the Srivijaya Kingdom was \\"the land of sea-faring traders\\". Therefore, the Malay Peninsula, especially the area of Chaiya and Nakhon Sri Thammaraj province prospered because they were vital ports on the trade route and also the central market of goods from Europe, the Middle East, India, and Cochin China (Vietnam). Merchant ships stopped to seek shelter from the southern monsoons of the Malaysian Peninsula. Eventually, these lands in the southern part down to Sumatra Island rose to power and banded together to form Srivijaya Kingdom. The people were Buddhists of the Mahayana sect, ruled by a king. The two main types of money found originating from Srivijaya Kingdom were Dok Chan money and Namo money. Silver and gold Dok Chan money is flat, round, and imprinted with a four-petal blossom on one side, with the other side imprinted with the ancient Sanskrit word wara. Silver mixed with antimony Namo money is flat, round and small with one side bearing the ancient Sanskit letter similar to Thai alphabet \\"‡∏ô\\". On the other side, there are fold and gully marks. Sukhothai Kingdom (13th‚Äì15th centuries) The Sukhothai Kingdom was founded after the joint efforts and armies of Poh Khun (King) Pah Muang and Poh Khun (King) Bang Klang Hao successfully dislodged the Khmer from holding on the administrative powers over the territories of Suvarnaphumi. Poh Khun Bang Klang Hao ascended the throne of the Sukhothai Kingdom under a new title and name: King Sri Intharathit. The pinnacle of political and administrative power, and the development of the Sukhothai Kingdom, was reached during the reign of King Ramkhamhaeng. This kingdom's territory was extended to cover the entire length of the Malaysian Peninsula. The initiation of the Thai alphabet and its inscription into stone. Besides, the people of Sukhothai made ceramics which were considered to be of high quality and known as sangkalok. Sangkalok was an important component of exports. The medium of exchange used in this kingdom varied, but the type of money originated in Sukhothai was \\"pod duang\\" or \\"bullet money\\". It was in circulation for 600 years. It was round-shaped, with long, sharp and pointed tips of legs, and a large hole between the legs. It had marks to show the origin, as few as one and as many as seven marks have been found stamped into Sukhothai pod duang. The marks most often found are lion, elephant, conch, Dharma Wheel, lotus, rabbit and ratchawat (a pyramid of dots). Additionally, it was found that Sukhothai used a hard mixture of many low value metals, such as tin, lead and zinc, to produce a shape resembling pod duang, but of larger size, they were called different names, such as \\"pod duang chin\\", ngern kub, ngern khub, or ngern kook. Cowrie shells or bia were also used as small change in the Sukhothai Kingdom. Ayudhya Kingdom (1350‚Äì1767) The establishment of the Kingdom of Ayudhya was in 1350 A.D. Due to the geographical location with the junction of four main rivers, namely, Chao Phraya, Noi, Lop Buri, and Pa Sak, Ayudhaya had become then the centre of commerce, communication, economics and administration. The main Ayudhya money remained pod duang as in the Sukhothai period, but with some modifications. The coins later became more compact, with shorter and wider apart legs, and with smaller and less deep notch marks. They also made the rice grains pattern instead. Pod Duang of the period bore only two marks. On the top was the chakra, which was the kingdom mark, and in the front was the reign marks, which varied in design, such as the Pum Khao Bin, Ratchawat, Elephant and Conch Shell marks. Thonburi Kingdom (1767‚Äì1782) After the fall of Ayudhya to the Burmese in 1767, King Taksin led the Thai army to push out and vanquish the Burmese. After liberation, King Taksin tried to put the country back in order, as Ayudhya had been sacked and burnt by the Burmese and was difficult to renovate in a short time. Therefore, King Taksin chose to establish his capital in Thonburi. Thonburi was close to the sea and suitable as a seaport for trading with foreign countries. It was a small city that was easy to take care of and defend. Later, he was enthroned as the king and the people passed a resolution to honor him as ‚ÄúKing Taksin the Great‚Äù The money that was used early in this reign was pod duang of Ayudhya and later King Taksin had pod duang produced for use in the economic system with similar characteristics as that of the later Ayudhya period but was stamped with the Chakra as the Kingdom mark. Regarding the Reign mark, it still remained controversial as to what symbol was used: \\"Trisula\\" or \\"Thavivudh\\". Rattanakosin Kingdom Following the Thonburi Kingdom, Rattanakosin was established as the new capital. The monetary system at the beginning of Rattanakosin Era was similar to Ayudhya monetary system consisting of pod duang but it was modified in order to exhibit the development of unique traits attributed to Thai people living in this era. Commemorating pod duang also came into being, which showed there was a shared interest in the importance of the events occurring in their time. Then, King Rama IV who had the royal intention to produce \\"flat coinage\\" for use. For the first time this became a period in which Thai money entered the international system. Reign of King Rama I to King Rama III In the Reign of King Rama I until King Rama III, pod duang was continued in use but with the reign mark changed. King Phra Buddha Yodfa Chulalok the Great (King Rama I) created pod duang with the Chakra representing the kingdom mark and the Bua Unalom and the royal emblem of King Rama I. The pod duang also had values: tumlung, baht, half baht, salung, fuang. The money used in the reign of King Rama II continued to be pod duang which was similar to that of King Rama I's, but with the reign mark changed to the Garuda to represent the reign of King Rama II. It is assumed to have come from his former name \\"Chim Plee\\", the paradise home of Lord Garuda. The money produced in the reign of King Rama III remained the pod duang carrying the Chakra-Prasat mark. The Prasat mark represents King Rama III's former name: \\"Tab\\" (Tee pratab), which was Phra Maha Prasat (royal palace). Additionally, it was found that pod duang was produced to commemorate some important occasions such as pod duang krut sio, pod duang chaleo, pod duang dok mai, and pod duang bai matum. Reign of King Rama IV The Thai monetary system changed significantly during the reign of King Rama IV. This period saw increasing trade between Thai and foreigners. During the early period of the reign, pod duang was still the main money, bearing the chakra as the kingdom mark and the Mongkut as the reign mark. The use of the Mongkut mark (crown) was the pre-ascension of his title and name \\"Crown Prince Mongkut\\". Meantime, Thailand had a problem due to the inability of being able to produce sufficient pod duang and to meet demand as well as prevent widespread counterfeiting, King Rama IV had the paper money issued for use along with pod duang, being called \\"mai\\". Mai was produced from paper with simple printing and used together with pod duang, but this series of paper money was not popular with citizens. In 1857, Queen Victoria sent a small manually-powered coin production machine as a royal gift. King Rama IV had the first coin production machine. This coin was called \\"Rien Bannakarn\\" (royal gift coins). But, finally, the cessation of use of this machine was ordered because only a small number of coins could be produced per day. They had a new steam-powered machine for the production of flat coinage. Later, King Rama IV ordered the construction of the Sitthikarn Mint in front of the Royal Treasury in the Grand Palace. The first series of coins produced by this machine was similar to the royal gift coins. They could be used alongside pod duang, as the production of pod duang had been discontinued. In this same year King Rama IV ordered the production of gold and silver coins of four baht value bearing the Monkut-Krung Siam mark as mementos of his 60th birthday. Reign of King Rama V The reign of King Rama V saw a significant development of the nation in almost every aspect including in monetary and financial system. In 1875, the king ordered a new mint built, including installation of a new machine with greater production capacity and efficiency. The new mint began producing silver coins with the royal portrait and the coat-of-arms design, the first time that the front side carried the profile of the ruling monarch. It became the operating format for later reigns. The king ordered the issuance of new tin Solos coins bearing on the obverse the Phra Kiew (the coronet), and in the reverse, the Elephant inside Chakra design. The Phra Kiew is also called \\"Chula Mongkut\\" as the royal emblem of King Rama V. During his reign, his younger brother Prince Jayanta Mongkol was tasked with restructuring of the monetary system to realign Siam's monetary units along international lines, from the former 13 units, -- Tos, Pit, Pad Duang, Chang, Tumlung, Baht, Salung, Fuang, Pai, Sik, Sio, Att and Solos. These had been based upon weight and made keeping accounts internationally difficult. Pod Duang production had ceased in the reign of King Rama IV. King Rama V ordered the production of pod duang with the Chakra Phra Kiew mark as a memento in commemoration of the royal cremation of his youngest daughter, Princess Charoen Kamol Suksawat, and as a memento of the royal merit making ceremony dedicated to Somdej Phra Thep Sirin Tara Mataya, the princess mother. Rama V later ordered coins from the Paris Mint production facility, coins bearing the royal portrait engraved by Henri-Auguste Patey, and Airapo, the three-headed white elephant. Rama V however died before an announcement for use could be made, so Rama VI ordered distribution of the coins during the cremation of his father. These coins are generally called Rien Nuad' or \\"moustache coins\\". Reigns of King Rama VI to VIII During the reigns of King Rama VI to VIII, Siam faced economic crises due to the worldwide economic downturn caused by world wars and depressions. During the early reign of King Rama VI, coins that had been produced during the reign of King Rama V continued to circulate. Rama VI ordered for the first time the production of baht coins with the portrait of the king on the obverse, with these first coins having on the reverse Airavata, the three- headed white elephant. Rama VI inaugurated the Thai Banknotes Department under the Ministry of Finance with the Siamese Currency Notes Act, R.E. 121, promulgated on 24 June 1902. Banknote Series 1 were printed by Thomas De La Rue & Company Limited, England, with the company name centered on the bottom margin. The notes were printed on one side only and in many types of seven denominations of 1 baht, 5 baht, 10 baht, 20 baht, 50 baht (Overprinted on 1 baht Banknotes Series 50Z-59Z), 100 baht and 1000 ticals[sic] with both Arabic and Thai numerals. (Dual numeration continues, but tical was dropped from Series 2 on.) Series 2 banknotes were first issued in 1925 during the reign of Rama VI and continuing into the reign of Rama VII dropped translation of baht and first added the legend, > Promise to pay (silver to) bearer on demand in (silver) currency of Siam; later changed in 1928 to be in line with The Currency Act, B.E. 2471 to > This note is legal tender (lit. silver in payment of debt) according to law. The front has a guilloche design with twelve rays, and the back, depictions of the Royal Ploughing Ceremony, printed in six denominations: 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 baht in two types printed by De La Rue. Series 3 banknotes, first issued in 1934, were the first having a portrait of the king, appearing on the front with scenic designs as minor elements. The reverse depicts Phra Samut Chedi Temple with a statement of the penalty for counterfeit, also used for the first time. Series 3 continued until the reign of Rama VIII, printed by De La Rue in four denominations including 1, 5, 10 and 20 baht with the change of the royal portrait from King Rama VII to King Rama VIII in 1936. Series 4 banknotes were first issued in 1938 by De La Rue with five denominations including 1‚Äì5‚Äì10‚Äì20 and 1,000 baht. The second type has been issued in 1940 with the change from (Government of Siam) to (Government of Thailand) due to the change of country name on 10 December 1939 which applied to four denominations including 1‚Äì5‚Äì10 and 1,000 baht. To alleviate a scarcity of banknotes in the country during the Greater East Asia War, the Royal Thai Survey Department printed a special series of banknotes in four denominations, 1‚Äì10‚Äì20 and 100, like those of the 4th series. The phrase \\"the Royal Thai Survey\\" at the lower center of the front and back replaced that of Thomas De La Rue & Co., London. Series 5 were printed by the Note Printing Works of Japan in seven denominations including 50 satang, 1 baht, 5 baht, 10 baht, 20 baht, 100 baht and 1000 baht starting in 1942. Series 6 were by the Royal Thai Survey Department and the Naval Hydrographic Department in two denominations including 20 and 100 baht, each with two types. A special war-time issue was printed in England, Indonesia, and by the Royal Thai Survey Department in four denominations including 50 satang (over-stamped on 10 baht banknotes printed from Java), 1 baht (both from Royal Thai Survey Department and invasion notes issued in England), 50 baht (overprinted on the 1 Strait dollar notes issued for four Malayu States by Royal Thai Survey Department) and 1000 baht issued by Royal Thai Survey Department. Series 7 was printed in haste by private printing companies under supervision from Bank of Thailand of barely satisfactory quality in four denominations including 1 baht, 5 baht, 10 baht and 50 baht Reign of King Rama IX In 1945, the government sought to renew its contract with Thomas De La Rue & Company Limited, England, but the company had been damaged during the war and was unable to accept orders. The US government was asked for assistance. The US assigned its Bureau of Engraving and Printing to prepare the printing plates and the Tudor Press Company to do the printing of the 8th series. The front portrayed King Rama VIII at a young age as main element, and the Phra Pathom Chedi as a minor element on every denomination. On the back of all five denominations was the constitution placed on a pedestal tray. The dimensions of low and middle denominations including 1 baht, 5 baht, and 10 baht were the same as the low denominations of MPCs while the dimensions of high denominations including 20 baht and 100 baht were the same dimensions as a US dollar (high denomination of MPC). These were issued in 1946 during the reign of King Rama IX. They had been ordered in the period of the King Rama VIII but had been shifted as Rama IX had already ascended the throne. Series 9 printed by De La Rue in six denominations returned to the familiar colors of each type and denomination model from Series 4 of De La Rue and Series 4 of Royal Thai Survey with the exception of 100 baht which used red instead of the azure color from Series 4 of Royal Thai Survey, and it can be assumed that the colors of the 9th Series are the standard for current Thai banknotes. The 100 baht banknotes of Series 9 were heavily counterfeited, so the multi-colored banknotes with the base color of red were needed. Series 10 consisted of only the 100 baht denomination printed by De La Rue, first issued in 1968. Series 11 began with 5 and 10 baht notes issued in 1969, 20 baht notes in 1971, and 100 baht notes in 1972. Five hundred baht banknotes were printed for the first time in 1975 when the production process, designing, engraving, and issuance of notes, shifted to Thailand's own note printing works. King Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended the throne on 9 June 1946. He ruled until his death on 13 October 2016, the longest reign of any Thai monarch. His era was one when society and the economy rapidly changed, accompanied by evolution of knowledge and technology in all areas, including that of coins, which have continuously been developed and modified in design and metal content in order to comply with the rapidly expanding economy, and to meet international standards. In 1950, the first series of circulation coins was minted in aluminum bronze and copper in four denominations; 5, 10, 25 and 50 satang coins with the obverse design being King Bhumibol's portrait and the reverse design being the coat of arms that had been used during the reign of King Rama V. In 1986, the changes had been generally partial and made on certain values of coins only, following a comprehensive major revision of coin production in denomination, composition, size, and pattern, they included and addition of 1 satang and 10 baht coins. The government then produced a series of eight coins: 10 baht, 5 baht, 1 baht, 50 satang, 25 satang, 10 satang, 5 satang, and 1 satang. In 2005, 2 baht coins were minted and made raised the number of circulation coin to 9 denominations. Only 25 satang up to 10 baht are used in circulation while the 1, 5 and 10 batang are minted to serve the accounting system. During this reign, a large number of coins were issued. The first commemorative coin was minted in 1961 with the nickel 1 baht coin to mark the return of the king and queen from state visits abroad. It is the first coin featuring the portrait of a female royal family member. Banknote Series 12 was The Great Series in denominations of 10 baht notes in 1980 until the termination of 10 baht banknote issuing after 1995 to be replaced by 10 baht coins which has been issued since 1988, 20 baht notes in 1981 and 100 baht notes in 1978 with engravings of monuments for those monarchs entitled \\"The Great\\".\\" In 1982, the first proof coin was minted to commemorate the bicentenary of Bangkok. The coins were presented to the king and royal family without being issued to the general public. It was not until Queen Sirikit's 50th anniversary on the 12 August 1982 that proof coins were released to the public. Banknote Series 13 was to supposed issued to commemorate the Bicentennial Celebration of Bangkok in 1982, but a delay in the delivery of new printing machines along with heavy workload of the bank delayed the issuance of 50 baht notes until 1985, 500 baht notes in 1987 with engravings of monuments for the monarchs relating to Rattanakosin Celebration including King Prajadhipok and King Rama I.\\" The growing economy of Thailand caused demand for higher denominations. This caused the revival of 1000 baht notes in 1992 as a part of Series 14 banknotes along with the new notes in 100 baht denomination issued in 1994 and the new notes in 500 baht denomination issued in 1996.\\" 21st century Demands for anti-counterfeiting technology, along with the aim of the Thai government to draw public attention to the deeds of the monarchs of the Chakri Dynasty compelled the Bank of Thailand to issue the Series 15 Banknotes in five denominations: 20 baht in 2003, 50 baht in polymer sheets in 1997 before being replaced by the familiar paper notes (type 2) in 2004 due to the unpopularity of polymer notes, 100 baht in 2004 until the replacement with type 2 in 2005, 500 baht in 2001, and 1000 baht in 1999 until the replacement with type 2 in 2005.\\" *2006: To celebrate the 60th year of the king's accession to the throne, the Treasury Department issued colored coins for the first time to mark \\"The First UNDP Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award\\" presented to the king by the United Nations. Apart from commemorative coins minted to mark special events and occasions, the Treasury Department also produces commemorative coins in cooperation with international organizations. *2012: Series 16 banknotes issued to glorify Thai kings of different periods from past to present *50 baht issued to commemorate the declaration of independence of King Naresuan. *2013: 20 baht Series 16 issued to commemorate King Ramkhamhaeng. * 500 baht Series 16 issued to commemorate King Rama I. * 100 baht Series 16 issued to commemorate King Taksin. * 1000 baht Series 16 issued to commemorate King Chulalongkorn. * 20, 50, 100 baht Series 17 to honour King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun Thai money and coins are regarded as national treasures as they reflect not only Thai history, but also the Thai culture and economy of each period.

All four occupants of the aircraft and 19 people on the ground were killed. Fourteen more people on the ground were injured. Accident The Antonov An-12 was on a domestic cargo flight from Brazzaville to Pointe Noire Airport in the Republic of the Congo. At around 15:30 local time on 21 March (14:30 UTC), while on final approach to the airport's runway 17, the aircraft rolled inverted and crashed to the ground in the Mvoumvou district of Pointe Noire. Weather conditions at the time were reported as good. According to the Russian Embassy, the flight had attempted an emergency ditching in the sea, but was unable to do so. Four crew members were on board. It was initially reported that five 'illegal' passengers were also on board, but this was later stated not to be the case. The use of the Antonov An-12 for carrying passengers is prohibited in the Republic of the Congo. There were conflicting reports about the number of dead and injured, with figures of 16, 17, and 19 reported. On 23 March, the Pointe- Noire mayor Roland Bouiti-Viaudo stated that 23 bodies had been recovered to date. The number of injured was 14. On 23 March, Congo's Agence Nationale de l'Aviation Civile du Congo issued an update stating only four crew were on the aircraft. They were killed, as were 19 on the ground. A video of the accident shows the Antonov rolling to starboard and nosediving to the ground inverted. In the video, the aircraft appears to be correctly configured for landing, with landing gear and flaps extended, but only engines No. 1 and 2 appear to be operating, trailing the characteristic smoke. A failure of both engines on the same wing for the aircraft type involved could reportedly lead to loss of control, due to the rudder not having sufficient authority to counter the asymmetric thrust. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Soviet-built Antonov An-12 with Congolese registration TN-AGK. It was fitted with four turboprop engines Ivchenko AI-20. Built in 1963, the aircraft was no longer airworthy, according to a list published in 2006 by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Investigation A joint committee was set up by the Congolese Government to investigate the accident. Committee members include members of the Government, the police and representatives from the aviation industry in the Republic of the Congo.

A monotypic genus, it contains the single species Mycetophagites atrebora. The genus is solely known from the Lower Cretaceous, Upper Albian stage (about 100 Ma), Burmese amber deposits in Myanmar. Mycetophagites is one of only two known instances of hyperfungal species known in the fossil record, and is the oldest to be described. History and classification The genus is known only from the single holotype, number \\"AB-368\\", hyphae parasitizing a single partial fruiting body specimen. When described the mushroom is part of in the private collection of Ron Buckley of Florence, Kentucky, USA. The collection has been sold and is now owned by Deniz Erin of Istanbul, Turkey.Fossil page of Ron Buckley accessed on 7 December 2010 AB-368 was collected from one of the amber mines in the Hukawng Valley area southwest of Maingkhwan, Kachin Region, Northern Myanmar. It was first studied by a pair of researchers led by Dr George Poinar from Oregon State University who worked with Ron Buckley. Poinar and Buckley published their 2007 type description in Mycological Research, journal of The British Mycological Society. The genus has been assigned the MycoBank number MB510323, with the species being assigned number MB510324. The generic epithet Mycetophagites is Greek in derivation and is a combination of the words ' meaning \\"fungus\\" and ' which means \\"to eat\\" referencing the mycoparasitic nature of the species. When published, Mycetophagites atrebora was the first known instance of hyperparasitism on mycoparasitism to be described in the fossil record, and the oldest. The fossil shows that this type of fungal parasitic relationship had been established by the Albian, 100 million years ago. An earlier instance of mycoparasitism is known from the extinct species Palaeoserenomyces allenbyensis and Cryptodidymosphaerites princetonensis described in 1998 from cherts found in British Columbia, Canada. Description The holotype of Mycetophagites consists of mycelium in a lone, partly decomposed fruiting body without any associated structures. The fungi are preserved in a rectangular piece of yellow amber approximately by by . The pileus is in diameter and possess a convex shape with the flesh a bluish gray color and hairy. The mycelium is composed of thick, septate, hyphae 4‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter. The hyphae sport septate dark conidiophores that are simple or sparsely branched. Each of the conidiophores are born singly or as sparse clusters and are upright or almost upright. The 8‚Äì10 Œºm long conidia on the conidiophores are oriented in short chains or singally on the ends of conidiophores. The condia are generally simple and ovoid. Mycetophagites presents the oldest evidence of fungal parasitism by other fungi in the fossil record. The fossil displays a complex interrelationship between three different fungal genera. The preserved Palaeoagaracites antiquus cap is host to both the mycoparasitic fungus and a hypermycoparasitic fungus. The surface of the gilled fungus Palaeoagaracites specimen hosts the Mycetophagites atrebora mycelia. The mycelia of Mycetophagites are found across the surface of the P. antiquus pileus, and the hyphae penetrate into the P. antiquus tissues themselves forming necrotic areas. Mycetophagites is in turn host to a hypermycoparasitic necrotrophic fungus species Entropezites patricii. Hyphae of Entropezites are preserved penetrating the Mycetophagites hyphae forming areas of decomposing tissues. Entropezites also displays a range of growth stages for probable zygospores. The combined distinguishable characters of Mycetophagites were not enough for Poinar and Buckley to place the genus further than Hypocreales incertae sedis. Where the hyphae of Mycetophagites penetrate into the Palaeoagaracites cap, distinct areas of cell lysis appear to be present. The necrotrophic nature of the interaction is similar to the modern genus Sepedonium. However the details of the condia and mycelium are distinct from those found in Sepedonium.

The other group, headed by IWW Secretary Treasurer William Trautmann, Vincent St. John, and Daniel DeLeon, head of the Socialist Labor Party, published through a different IWW publication called the Industrial Union Bulletin. A.S. Edwards was elected editor of the Bulletin in 1906., p. 176 The Trautmann-St. John-DeLeon faction eventually prevailed in a lawsuit over the Sherman faction. During the economic panic of 1907, the Industrial Union Bulletin went from a weekly publication to every two weeks, and for a time publication was suspended. The last issue of the Industrial Union Bulletin was published March 6, 1909.Brissenden, p. 229 A few days later, on March 18, the Industrial Worker, version II, No. 1, Vol. 1 was published in Spokane, Washington.

At present it contains the single species Entropezites patricii. The genus is solely known from the Lower Cretaceous, Upper Albian stage (about 100 Ma), Burmese amber deposits in Myanmar. Mycetophagites is one of only two known instances of hyperfungal species known in the fossil record, and is the oldest to be described. History and classification The genus is known only from the single holotype, number \\"AB-368\\", hyphae parasitizing a single partial fruiting body specimen. When described the mushroom is part of in the private collection of Ron Buckley of Florence, Kentucky, USA. The collection has been sold and is now owned by Deniz Erin of Istanbul, Turkey.Fossil page of Ron Buckley accessed on 7 December 2010 AB-368 was collected from one of the amber mines in the Hukawng Valley area southwest of Maingkhwan, Kachin Region, Northern Myanmar. It was first studied by a pair of researchers led by Dr George Poinar from Oregon State University who worked with Ron Buckley. Poinar and Buckley published their 2007 type description in Mycological Research, journal of The British Mycological Society. The genus has been assigned the MycoBank number MB501250, with the species being assigned number MB501251. The generic epithet Entropezites is Greek in derivation and is a combination of the words entrope meaning \\"to turn inward\\" and ites which means \\"pertaining to\\" referencing the hypermycoparasitic nature of the species. When published, Entropezites patricii, its host Mycetophagites atrebora and M. atrebora's host Palaeoagaracites antiquus were the first known instance of hyperparasitism on mycoparasitism to be described in the fossil record, and the oldest. The fossil shows that this type of fungal parasitic relationship had been established by the Albian, 100 million years ago. An earlier instance of mycoparasitism is known from the extinct species Palaeoserenomyces allenbyensis and Cryptodidymosphaerites princetonensis described in 1998 from cherts found in British Columbia, Canada. Description The holotype of Entropezites consists of hyphae which form a complex and extensive intergrowth with the Mycetophagites atrebora host hyphae. The fungi are preserved in a rectangular piece of yellow amber approximately by by . The pileus is in diameter and possesses a convex shape with the flesh a bluish gray color and hairy. The hyphae are very small, ranging from 1 to 2.5 Œºm in diameter and hyaline. The nonseptate hyphae are branched, intergrown with and penetrating the host hyphae. Entropezites hyphae penetrate host areas of necrotic tissue. The specimen sports a number of simple, hyaline conidiophores 7‚Äì10 Œºm in length which are borne upright from the hyphae. Each of the conidiophores is borne singly or as sparse clusters and are upright or almost upright. The single-celled condia are borne in chains on the conidiophore tips. As with the other organs of Entropezites, the spherical to cylindrical condia are hyaline in coloration. Also present are possible zygospores ranging from 15 to 30 Œºm in diameter. Entropezites presents the oldest evidence of fungal hyperparasitism by other fungi in the fossil record. The fossil displays a complex interrelationship between three different fungal genera. The preserved Palaeoagaracites antiquus cap is host to both a Mycoparasitism}mycoparasitic fungus and a hypermycoparasitic fungus. The surface of the gilled fungus Palaeoagaracites specimen hosts the Mycetophagites atrebora mycelia. The mycelia of Mycetophagites are found across the surface of the P. antiquus pileus, and the hyphae penetrate into the P. antiquus tissues themselves, forming necrotic areas. Mycetophagites is in turn host to a hypermycoparasitic necrotrophic fungus species Entropezites patricii. Hyphae of Entropezites are preserved, penetrating the Mycetophagites hyphae forming areas of decomposing tissues. Entropezites also displays a range of growth stages for probable zygospores. The combined distinguishable characters of Entropezites were not enough for Poinar and Buckley to place the genus further than Hypocreales incertae sedis. Where the hyphae of Entropezites penetrate into the Mycetophagites hyphae, distinct areas of necrotic tissue appear to be present. The necrotrophic nature of the interaction is similar to the modern genera Penicillium, Schizophyllum and Trichoderma. However the extensive intergrowth of the host and parasite hyphae is distinct from those found in the modern genera.

The company includes forestry operations, manufacturing and sales of TMP wood pulp and lumber products, employing approximately 360 staff. Company Pan Pac was established by Carter Consolidated Ltd, a family business which was founded in 1896, a predecessor to Carter Holt Harvey. By 1967, the Auckland-based timber company was researching ways to utilise timber waste from its forestry and sawmill operations. They learnt of a strong demand in Japan for mechanical pulp and began to investigate production of mechanical pulp for export to Japan. It became clear that an economic pulp mill would require more wood than the company could provide from waste. This meant that cutting rights to a forest were needed, and a sawmill would be required to process the millable timber. When 320 million cubic feet of timber from the government owned Kaingaroa Forest was offered for sale in 1969, Carter Consolidated bid for the lot. They won cutting rights to 220 million, the remaining 100 million going to Tasman Pulp and Paper. A joint venture agreement was signed between Carter Consolidated Ltd, Oji Paper Company and Kokusaku Pulp on 3 May 1971, forming Carter Oji Kokusaku Pan Pacific Ltd. =Ownership= Pan Pac was established as an international joint venture between Carter Consolidated (holding 60%) and two Japanese partners (holding 40%). In 1991 Carter Holt Harvey sold their share in Panpac down to 10% to raise capital for cutting rights to Hawke's Bay forests. In March 1993, Carter Holt Harvey sold the last of their investment and Pan Pac became wholly Japanese owned, with 87% held by Oji Paper Company and 13% by Nippon Paper Industries Company Ltd. In 2007, Pan Pac became 100% Oji owned.Company Profile Accessed 2010-2-23 Mill The mill was located in Hawke's Bay because Napier was the closest port to the Kaingaroa Forest, and more specifically Whirinaki was selected as it had a major water supply, the Esk River, and it was conveniently located for both raw materials and product. The mill was built in 18 months for a cost of $12 million and was completed in March 1973. It was officially opened by Prime Minister Norman Kirk in June that year. The pulp mill had a capacity of 400 air dried tonnes (ADT) per day. Stage 2 development was undertaken 1974-1976 at a further cost of $12 million. It included a chip screening system, a new chipper and conveying, four refiners, dewatering machines, another flash drier and slab press, two bale presses and a wrapping system. This lifted production to 600-700 ADT per day. In the early 1980s, market forces necessitated a change in product, and between 1981-1982 the mill was converted from mechanical pulp to thermo mechanical pulp for a budget of $30 million. Five refiners were added, three chip pre-heaters and two chip washes. The initial refiners were converted to 'secondaries'. A 36MWth Boiler was installed in 2002Bioenergy reference project 5 EECA and a new chipmill was built in 2009. Today the pulpmill and sawmill are supported on-site by a chipmill, two boilers and a cogeneration plant. Production Pan Pac produces 220 000 tonnes of pulp annually which is exported to Japan.

The underlying ideas John Blair put forward a description of the early Anglo-Saxon Christian church in England in a number of publications. He believed that the organisation of the early church was based around minsters staffed by a community of clerics and providing spiritual services within a defined area (known as a parochia). Minsters were established close to royal vills, as part of the process by which pagan communities were converted to Christianity. During 10th and 11th centuries, parochial duties were increasingly taken over by estate churches which were the property of local land owners. The diminishing role for minsters and the emergence of estate churches accompanied the fragmentation of the Anglo-Saxon multiple estates that had been common in the earlier landscape. The new estate churches were frequently dependent to some extent on the original minster church within whose boundary they were located. Sonning (Berkshire) is an example of an original minster which by the 12th century had eight dependent churches, four of which had become independent parishes by the 15th century. Although minsters were in decline by 1086, it is still possible to identify them in Domesday wherever the description goes beyond the purely formulaic. Clues to identification of minsters include references to groups of priests; a church endowment exceeding one hide; tenure by a royal or named clerk; a separate valuation or survey or some additional sign of status. Origin of the term Blair did not himself coin the phrase \\"minster hypothesis\\", instead using (but not coining) the phrase \\"minster model\\". The term \\"minster hypothesis\\" was first used in a critical review by Cambridge and Rollason The term has subsequently been widely adopted by both proponents and opponents of the underlying ideas. The term \\"minster system\\" has sometimes been used as an alternative. Areas of dispute Disputed points include *the extent to which there was a deliberate and planned programme of establishing minsters to provide parochial services *the extent to which private churches were numerous in the early Christian period *whether or not all minsters had parochial duties *the applicability of evidence from a later date to infer an earlier practice.

It runs as a package under R. Cross platform, it runs under Linux, Mac OS and Windows.S. Boker, M. Neale, H. Maes, M. Wilde, M. Spiegel, T. Brick, J. Spies, R. Estabrook, S. Kenny, T. Bates, P. Mehta and J. Fox. (2011). OpenMx: An Open Source Extended Structural Equation Modeling Framework. Psychometrika, 76,  Overview  OpenMx consists of an R library of functions and optimizers supporting the rapid and flexible implementation and estimation of SEM models. Models can be estimated based on either raw data (with FIML modelling) or on correlation or covariance matrices. Models can handle mixtures of continuous and ordinal data. The current version is OpenMx 2, and is available on CRAN. Path analysis, Confirmatory factor analysis, Latent growth modeling, Mediation analysis are all implemented. Multiple group models are implemented readily. When a model is run, it returns a model, and models can be updated (adding and removing paths, adding constraints and equalities; giving parameters the same label equates them). An innovation is that labels can consist of address of other parameters, allowing easy implementation of constraints on parameters by address. RAM models return standardized and raw estimates, as well as a range of fit indices (AIC, RMSEA, TLI, CFI etc.). Confidence intervals are estimated robustly. The program has parallel processing built-in via links to parallel environments in R, and in general takes advantage of the R programming environment. Users can expand the package with functions. These have been used, for instance, to implement Modification indices. Models can be written in either a \\"pathic\\" or \\"matrix\\" form. For those who think in terms of path models, paths are specified using mxPath() to describe paths. For models that are better suited to description in terms of matrix algebra, this is done using similar functional extensions in the R environment, for instance mxMatrix and mxAlgebra. The code below shows how to implement a simple Confirmatory factor analysis in OpenMx, using either path or matrix formats. The model is diagrammed here: 529x529px  Example path model specification  Below is the code to implement, run, and print a summary for estimating a one- factor path model with five indicators. require(OpenMx) data(demoOneFactor) manifests < names(demoOneFactor) latents < c(\\"G\\") m1 < mxModel(\\"One Factor\\", type=\\"RAM\\", manifestVars = manifests, latentVars = latents, mxPath(from=latents, to=manifests), mxPath(from=manifests, arrows=2), mxPath(from=latents, arrows=2, free=FALSE, values=1.0), mxData(cov(demoOneFactor), type=\\"cov\\", numObs=500) ) summary(mxRun(m1))  Example matrix specification  Below is the code to implement, run, and print a summary for estimating a one-factor path model with five indicators. library(OpenMx) data(demoOneFactor) df = cov(demoOneFactor) m1 < mxModel(\\"One Factor\\", mxMatrix(\\"Full\\", nrow = 5, ncol = 1, values = 0.2, free = TRUE, name = \\"A\\"), mxMatrix(\\"Symm\\", nrow = 1, ncol = 1, values = 1.0, free = FALSE, name = \\"L\\"), mxMatrix(\\"Diag\\", nrow = 5, ncol = 5, values = 1.0, free = TRUE, name = \\"U\\"), mxAlgebra(A %*% L %*% t(A) + U, name=\\"R\\"), mxExpectationNormal(covariance= \\"R\\", dimnames = names(demoOneFactor)), mxFitFunctionML(), mxData(df, type = \\"cov\\", numObs=500) ) summary(mxRun(m1))  References   External links  * Home Page Free statistical software Structural equation models ","title":"OpenMx"},{"id":"31259057","text":"Mark Lorenzen (born 1966) is a video game designer and former entrepreneur.

The D√∂kk√°lfar and the Lj√≥s√°lfar are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the late Old Norse poem Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins. Scholars have produced theories about the origin and implications of the dualistic concept. Attestations =Prose Edda= In the Prose Edda, the D√∂kk√°lfar and the Lj√≥s√°lfar are attested in chapter 17 of the book Gylfaginning. In the chapter, Gangleri (the king Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High what other \\"chief centres\\" there are in the heavens outside of the spring Ur√∞arbrunnr. Gangleri responds that there are many fine places in heaven, including a place called √Ålfheimr (Old Norse 'Elf Home' or 'Elf World'). High says that the Lj√≥s√°lfar live in √Ålfheimr, while the D√∂kk√°lfar dwell underground and look‚Äîand particularly behave‚Äîquite unlike the Lj√≥s√°lfar. High describes the Lj√≥s√°lfar as \\"fairer than the sun to look at\\", while the D√∂kk√°lfar are \\"blacker than pitch\\". As chapter 17 continues, Gangleri asks what will protect the beautiful hall of Giml√©, previously described as \\"the southernmost end of heaven\\", when the fires of Surtr \\"burn heaven and earth\\" (Ragnar√∂k). High responds that there are in fact other heavens. The first called Andl√†ngr, he says, is \\"south of and above this heaven of ours\\" and \\"we believe\\" Giml√© is located in the third heaven \\"still further above that one\\", V√≠√∞bl√°inn. High adds that \\"we believe it is only light-elves who inhabit these places for the time being\\". =Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins= There occurs an additional mention of the d√∂kk√°lfar in the late Old Norse poem Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins (\\"Odin's Raven-galdr\\"), stanza 25. Theories and interpretations As the concept is only recorded in Gylfaginning and the late poem Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins, it is unclear whether the distinction between the two types of elves originated with Snorri, or if he was merely recounting a concept already developed. =Question of Christian influence= The sub- classification perhaps resulted from Christian influence, by way of importation of the concept of good and evil and angels of light and darkness. Anne Holtsmark aired this view, though with some reservation, since \\"good vs. evil\\" dualism is not confined to Christian thinking. Aside from some additional observations to encourage the hypothesis, Holtsmark has been credited with demonstrating that Snorri borrowed from Christian writings, specifically that \\"Snorri‚Äôs description of V√≠√∞bl√°inn [the third heaven populated by light-elves] was almost certainly influenced by (and possibly based on) the account of the angels in the Elucidarius.\\" Dissenters of the view that elves were a later invention, such as Rudolf Simek and Gabriel Turville-Petre, feel rather that \\"dark\\" and \\"light\\" aspects of the same beings not inherently unlikely, death and fertility cults often being closely related.Turville-Peter, Gabriel, Myth and Religion of the North (1964), p.231, cited in =Dwarves= Since the Prose Edda describes the d√∂kk√°lfar as being dwellers, they may be dwarves under another name, in the opinion of a number of scholars such as John Lindow. The Prose Edda also uniquely mentions the svart√°lfar ('black elves'), but there are reasons to believe these also refer to merely dwarves. Consequently, Lindow and other commentators have remarked that there may not have been any distinction intended between dark-elves and black-elves by those who coined and used those terms. Lotte Motz's paper on elves commingles, and hence equates \\"dark-elves\\" and \\"black-elves\\" from the outset. =Grimm's trinity= Jacob Grimm presents an extract of Grimm's view on the classes of elves, with German text and Stallybrass's translation in parallel surmised that the proto-elf (') was probably a \\"light-colored, white, good spirit\\" while the dwarves may have been conceived as \\"black spirits\\" by relative comparison. But the \\"two classes of creatures were getting confounded\\", and there arose a need to coin the term \\"light-elf\\" (lj√≥s√°lfar, or hv√≠t√°lfar‚Äî\\"white elves\\")Grimm (1883), Vol. 2, p. 445, \\"Thorlac. spec. 7, p. 160, gives the liosalfar another name hv√≠t√°lfar (white elves) ; I have not found the word in the old writings.\\" to refer to the \\"elves proper\\". This was counterpart to the \\"dark-elf\\" (d√∂kk√°lfar, or svart√°lfar‚Äî\\"black elves\\").(Stallybrass tr.) Stallybrass's actual phrasing in his translation was \\"recourse was had to composition, and the elves proper were named lios√¢lfar\\" (Vol. 2, p.444) for Grimm's \\"half man durch zusammen-setzung und nannte die eigentlichen √¢lfar lios√¢lfar.\\" Preferring it over duality, Grimm postulated three kinds of elves (lj√≥s√°lfar, d√∂kk√°lfar, svart√°lfar) present in Norse mythology.(Stallybrass tr.) , \\"Some have seen, in this antithesis of light and black elves, the same Dualism that other mythologies have set up between spirits good and bad, friendly and hostile, heavenly and hellish, between angels of light and of darkness. But ought we not rather to assume three kinds of Norse genii, lios√¢lfar, dock√¢lfar, svart√¢lfar?\\" But Grimm's \\"tripartite division\\" (as Shippey calls it) faced \\"trouble\\" in Snorri's statement that dark-elves were pitch-black, as this would lead to the \\"first reduction\\" that \\"dark-elves = black-elves\\". As a solution, Grimm \\"pronounce[es] Snorri's statement fallacious\\", and hypothesizes that \\"dark elves\\" were not really 'dark' but rather 'dingy' or 'pale'.(Stallybrass tr.) And while conceding that \\"such a Trilogy still [lacks] decisive proof,\\"(Stallybrass tr.) draws parallels from the white, brown and black subterranean in Pomeranian legend, and the white, pale, and black troops of spirits come to claim souls in the tale of Solomon and Marcolf.

It was found in the Middle Triassic Lagerstatte of the Guanling Formation. It was first named by Jun Liu, Olivier Rieppel, Da-Yong Jiang, Jonathan C. Aitchison, Ryosuke Motani, Qi-Yue Zhang, Chang-Yong Zhou and Yuan-Yuan Sun in 2011 and the type species is Dianopachysaurus dingi, thanking a Professor Ding for his help. Dianopachysaurus is most closely related to Keichousaurus, another Chinese pachypleurosaur. Both belong to the family Keichousauridae. Pachypleurosaurs are hypothesized to have originated in the eastern Tethys Ocean (South China) before spreading and diversifying in the western Tethys in what is now Europe. A large ghost lineage of eastern pachypleurosaurs has long been inferred based on the phylogeny of the group. Dianopachysaurus represents an early stage in the radiation of pachypleurosaurs and its early age fills in much of the gap.  Features  The holotype, and only fossil so far, is an almost complete articulated skeleton. It is from nose tip to the last caudal vertebra known, although the end of the tail is missing after the 17th caudal vertebra. = Skull = The skull is broad and flat, with the eyes quite far forward and the snout shorter than the postorbital region. Much of the occipital region has been covered by the displaced cervical vertebrae, so it is not visible and cannot be studied easily, but there appears to be no occipital crest. The premaxillae are quite broad, and form the anterior margin of the naris. They show some weak signs of snout constriction, being slightly narrower than the rest of the skull, but it is not very pronounced. At the very anterior end of the rostrum they are fused. The maxillae are partially covered, and only a few maxillary teeth are at all visible, all smaller than the premaxillary teeth. They extend back, forming the posterolateral border of the naris and the lateral border of the orbit to just beyond the midpoint. A few striations are visible on the maxillae. The nares are small, only long, and almost square or trapezoid. The nasal bones are elongated and thin, but still shorter than the frontals. They are separated anteriorly by the posterior process of the premaxillae, but meet in a suture posteriorly. There are many small pits present on their surfaces. The orbit is large, at in diameter, but has no scleral ossicles present. The prefrontals form the anterior border of the orbit, and are raised in a large ridge just in front of it. The frontals are fully fused into one large bone, and this forms the small ridge between the orbits, which were on the top of the head. Its most noticeable feature is the two processes extending backwards into the parietal almost up to the pineal foramen. The postfrontals are triradiate and come between the orbits and the upper temporal fenestrae, but their anterior processes are mostly covered by the postorbitals. The jugals are very reduced, only thin slivers of bone bounding the orbits and just touching the upper temporal fenestrae. They form no part of the upper temporal arch. The upper temporal fenestrae are only 4.5 mm long, and much thinner, making them relatively small. There is only one parietal, as it is completely fused, and this bounds much of both upper temporal fenestrae and forms most of the upper temporal arch. It is quite broad and flat, but uniquely to this species there is a weak constriction where it meets the squamosals. The pineal foramen is close to the centre of the parietal, but slightly anteriorly displaced. Very small pits are present on the surface of the parietal bone. The postorbitals are quite small, and there is weak sculpturing on the posterior processes. The squamosals, which form the posterior margins of the upper temporal fenestrae, are large and triradiate, with forked anterior processes. Their lateral processes just descend to meet the lower jaw. The quadratojugal is barely exposed at all, but the quadrate is just noticeable near the location of the occipital condyle. Only part of the supraoccipital is exposed, but it has a deeply concave posterior margin. The surangular, which is only exposed in the postorbital region, has no lateral ridge, and the angular is very small. A small fragment of splenial is exposed, but the dentary is barely visible and no teeth can be seen. = Vertebrae = 20 cervical vertebrae, 19 dorsal vertebrae, 3 sacral vertebrae and at least 17 caudal vertebrae are present. The atlas, axis and eighth-tenth cervical vertebrae are disarticulated, as is the posterior-most region of the tail (in fact missing). The dorsal vertebrae have no elongated transverse processes, but the zygapophyses are very pachyostotic. = Ribs = The cervical ribs are double-headed and start from the third cervical vertebra. The dorsal ribs are single-headed, significantly more elongate, and highly pachyostotic. The last dorsal rib is noticeably shorter than the preceding one, but still much longer than the following sacral ribs. It points laterally instead of trending towards the ilium. The sacral ribs are all articulated with the ilium but do not fuse to their vertebrae. The first caudal rib is far away from the ilium, but trends towards it. = Pectoral girdle and forelimbs = The clavicles are attached to the medial edge of the scapulae. The scapulae have highly developed dorsal wings, which are posteriorly directed and taper to blunt points. The proximal ends of the humeri are mostly covered by the scapulae, and the deltapectoral flanges are not highly developed. The humeri are 10 mm long, and have unequal attachments for the ulnae and radii. The ulnae is no wider than the radii are, and they are both 5 mm long. An unknown carpal bone, probably an intermedium as it is quite elongate, is preserved between the ulna and radius of the right forelimb and there are three rounded carpal elements preserved in the left forelimb, one of which is the ulnare. The phalangeal formula is not known due to incomplete preservation. = Pelvic girdle and hindlimbs = The ilia have a triangular acetabulum, and a reduced but still quite robust dorsal process. The pubis is round, and has an open obdurator foramen, but the ischium is almost entirely hidden. The femurs are slender and slightly sigmoid, with distinct striations on both ends. They are 14 mm long. The fibulae are slightly longer than the tibiae, at 6.5 rather than 6 mm long. The astragali are larger than the calcanea, but both have flat proximal margins. The first metatarsals are distinctly shorter than the others, and many metatarsals are covered by phalanges and so not fully visible. Enough phalanges are preserved in their original positions, however, to let us see that all the most distal phalanges have pointed tips, which may originally have been claws, and to give a probable phalangeal formula for the foot of 2,3,4,5,4.

It was located south-southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. History Ohlson Mountain AFS was a continental defense radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. Plans were made for a permanent radar site beginning in late 1956. A site was located approximately 8 miles northeast of Homer, Alaska. The port facilities at Homer and the existing airport there were used to bring in construction supplies and equipment by Naval LST and towed barges. A gravel road was constructed through the wilderness to the new station which supplied access to the 1,600' hilltop site. Ohlson mountain is a very prominent hill, but technically not a mountain. The buildings were, except for the civil engineering building, connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 937th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, activated in February 1957 operated AN/FPS-3A, and AN/FPS-6 radars. As a surveillance station, its mission was to monitor the airspace for aircraft activity and provide information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Fire Island AFS near Anchorage, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Ohlson Mountain is not a proper mountain but rather a very prominent hill with a wide view of the lower Cook Inlet region The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, constructed a White Alice Communications System communications site at the station, operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Bethel site was activated in 1958. Ohlson Mountain Air Force Station was very expensive to maintain, and was inactivated due to budget reductions on 15 May 1963, its mission being taken over by other AAC surveillance radar sites with upgraded and more capable equipment. After the station's closure, the buildings, radars and communications antennas sat derelict and abandoned for decades. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Today the road to the summit is closed except for gravel pit operations After the site was removed, the hilltop became a gravel pit and informal shooting range. Shooting and other destructive activities eventually caused nearby residents to petition for closure of the area to the public.Armstrong, Michael, Unofficial Ohlson Mountain Shooting Range stirs up neighbors Homer News 7/20/2011 Air Force units and assignments  Emblem of the 937th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron =Units= * Established as the 937th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron : Activated on 8 February 1957 : Discontinued and inactivated on 1 October 1963 =Assignments= * 5039th Air Base Wing, 8 February 1957 * 5039th Aircraft Control and Warning Group (later 5040th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, 1 June 1957 * 10th Air Division, 1 June 1959 * 5070th Air Defense Wing, 1 August 1960 * Alaskan Air Command, 1 October 1961 - 1 October 1963 See also * Alaskan Air Command References External links * Alaskan Air Defenses * Ohlson Mountain, AK Installations of the United States Air Force in Alaska Radar stations of the United States Air Force 1958 establishments in Alaska Military installations established in 1958 1963 disestablishments in Alaska Military installations closed in 1963 ","title":"Ohlson Mountain Air Force Station"},{"id":"31259101","text":"Broken Frontier is a web-magazine which publishes news, interviews, and essays about the comic book industry, with a focus on the British small press scene.

It was introduced in the 1960 film High Time, sung by Bing Crosby with Henry Mancini conducting his orchestra, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It lost out to \\"Never on Sunday\\". Its theme is captured by its first two lines: : Love is lovelier the second time around, : Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground. Although Crosby recorded it on August 25, 1960, for MGM Records, it is especially associated with Frank Sinatra, who recorded it for Reprise Records on December 21, 1960. This achieved some chart success reaching the #50 position in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Sinatra also recorded it again for Reprise on November 5, 1961, and April 29, 1963.

Photo: Tony Rebelo. In plants, a gland is defined functionally as a plant structure which secretes one or more products. This may be located on or near the plant surface and secrete externally, or be internal to the plant and secrete into a canal or reservoir. Examples include glandular hairs, nectaries, hydathodes, and the resin canals in Pinus.  Notable examples = Salt glands of the mangrove = The salt glands of mangroves such as Acanthus, Aegiceras, Aegialitis and Avicennia are a distinctive multicellular trichome, a glandular hair found on the upper leaf surface and much more densely in the abaxial indumentum. On the upper leaf surface they are sunken in shallow pits, and on the lower surface they occur scattered among long nonglandular hairs composed of three or four cells. Development of the glands resembles that of the nonglandular hairs until the three-celled stage, when the short middle stalk cell appears. The salt gland continues to develop to produce two to four vacuolated cells at the level of the epidermis, the stalk cell with an almost completely cutinized wall, and at least eight terminal cells. The terminal cells have a thin, perforated cuticle which separates from the cell walls apically, leaving an enclosed cavity between them. The secreted salt evaporates and forms visible crystals. = Cannabinoid-secreting glands of hemp = Cannabis plants are broadly covered with sessile glands, and other hairs throughout above-ground portions of the plant. There is a particularly high concentration of glands on the bracts of the female plant. After flower formation begins, some of the glands, especially on bracts near the flowers, develop stalks projecting them outward from the plant surface. The glands consist of a layer of disk cells, whose outer surface splits to create a large secretory cavity lined by cell wall and cuticle components. Together the disk cells and secretory cavity form a round head atop the narrow stalk. These cavities come to contain large amounts of cannabidiol in hemp-producing strains, or tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in marijuana-producing strains. These compounds appear to be produced beginning in specialized plastids called lipoplasts. These produce spheres of oily secretions, including terpenes, which pass through the cell membrane and wall to accumulate as vesicles in the secretory cavity. Final reaction to cannabinoids appears to occur outside the disk cell cyctoplasm. The glands gradually darken as they mature, with loss of cannabinoids over time (perhaps to evaporation) and eventually undergo abscission from the plant.

Heinemann considered Klafki to be thinking in purely ideal terms with his humanistic approach, and instead created a practical model for making education decisions. Heimann‚Äôs model is intended to enable teachers to analyze their lessons on a purely empirical and objective basis to make more transparent decisions. It was also intended to assist teachers to consider as many factors as possible in planning their lessons. This would permit specific and scheduled learning.  The Model  Berliner Modell The goal of the ‚ÄúBerlin Model‚Äù is to support the process of making useful decisions with regard to the questions ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, ‚Äúwhereto‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù within a group, considering all the different conditions and situations. It offers support for analysis and planning of single steps and for subsequent reflection and evaluation of work units or group works. By systematic evaluation of teaching on an empirical basis, Heimann established ‚Äúformal constants‚Äù (also known as categories) of lessons, occurring time-independent in teaching. These identified categories (teaching factors) can serve as a guideline to lesson planning. Heimann identifies six of these constants within two fields: * Two conditional factors (field of conditions) anthropological-psychological conditions of each attendant personal socio-cultural conditions of all involved *Four decisional factors (field of decisions) Intentions/objectives Content/items Methods/techniques Resources/media = Conditional Factors = *The anthropological-psychological or anthropogenic conditions of each attendant: Which learning background does the particular pupil have? Which stage of development do the individuals have? Which attitude/motivation, receptivity? Where do they live and what follows from that? (attitudes, skills, learning styles) Existing knowledge and experience of all involved? How is the group composed? Who leads and has influence? Positive or negative group climate? What about the behavior and relationship of the attendants and teachers? Which interest do they probably have? *The socio-cultural conditions of all involved: Where does the meeting take place? Which spatial conditions do exist? How much time is at hand? What else is unaltered given? Which external persons have influence or control rights? (e.g. janitor switches off the current) How old are the involved persons or which state of development do they have? Male or female? What expectations do the parents, the society or the institution/school have? What is the concept the institution/school is based on? =Decisional Factors= *The contents/items dealt with: Which contents should be dealt with? Do the contents fit the aims and vice versa? How exactly do the contents have to be filled (limited/enlarged) so that they do not pass the requirements of those involved? Are there any contradictions with regard to the general conditions? *The methods and the way the contents are treated and aims could be reached: If I bring to mind all requirements of those involved, the general conditions and the intended objectives and contents, which ideas to achieve them come into my mind? Which steps do I find? What am I supposed to do, say or offer? How to arrange, structure or present the content? Do I eventually have to modify my intentions/objectives because I do not find a way to achieve them? Or do I have to reflect on my decision regarding the content, the general conditions or my personal requirements? (e.g. by acquiring more information) *The resources/media needed to go this way: Do I have all required resources/media? Or do I have to change the way/method because they are not available? Do the media fulfill the requirements of those involved, the objectives, the contents etc.? = Main Statements = The main statements of this model are: *All six factors are correlated, and among these strict interdependence rules. Each factor has to be treated with regard to the others. *The model deals with planning (of a meeting or a group lesson) as a system of correlated decisions: Each element refers to each other and so decisions in one field have consequences in all other fields. If I made my decision in one field, I have to reflect all other decisions and check whether they fit overall interaction. *The general conditions have to be taken into consideration also, respectively, according to my objective, I have to try to change the general conditions. *The conditional and decisional factors are mentioned in a specific order. One does not necessarily have to follow that order during planning because all factors are interactive. In principle, one can start in each field and refer decisions in other fields to this. *After a planned meeting has been held consequences and results occur for all persons involved: aims have been reached or have not been reached, changes have taken place or have not taken place. All results have to be taken into consideration and influence the planning of the following meetings accordingly. =Development= The model was advanced to the ‚ÄúHamburger Modell‚Äù in the 1980s by Wolfgang Schulz, a former associate of Heimann. The planning model of Heimann becomes an action model for ‚Äúemancipatory appreciable and professional pedagogic teaching‚Äù. Schulz avoids the strict phenomenological descriptively analysis of teaching and develops a normative model of sceptical teaching which allows pupils to get rid of unnecessary control and act in maximum self- control. =Literature= *Paul Heimann, Gunter Otto, Wolfgang Schulz: ‚ÄúUnterricht: Analyse und Planung‚Äù (Hrsg.: Blumenthal, Alfred; Osterman, Wilhelm), Hannover, Schroedel Schulbuchverlag. 10. unver√§nderte Auflage, 1979 =Related Links= * ACM ITiCSE 2011 - June 27-29, 2011, Darmstadt, Germany * German version of this article * Hamburger Modell { cellspacing=\\"10\\" width=\\"70%\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFACD\\" style=\\"background-color:#FFFDDD;border- style:dashed;border-width:2px;border-color:blue\\" Please note: This article is based on a GFDL-licensed text, taken from PflegeWiki.

Four of them earned him nominations for Best Novel of the Year Award (the Kresnik Award). A wide variety of readers is drawn to his novels because of their broad and rich historical background, intertwined with legends as well as present-day reality and humorous motifs that manage to combine the magical with the spiritual and the mystical. The end result is oftentimes an intense thriller which merges with a gentle and profound love story. Sebastijan Pregelj has been featured in several anthologies in the Slovene, Slovak, German, Polish and English language. He is a member of the Slovenian Writers‚Äô Association. He lives and works in Ljubljana. Bibliography Novels * V Elvisovi sobi (2019) Dear Ali. Dear Elvis. * Vdih. Izdih. (2017) Breathe In.

The initiative won a Healthcare Innovation Award in 2013. Its stated aims are to introduce flexibility, sustainability and modern career pathways for the healthcare science workforce to meet future needs of the NHS. Background and history Modernising Scientific Careers is a joint initiative of the four health departments of the UK led by the Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health, Professor Sue Hill OBE. It is analogous to the Modernising Medical Careers scheme for doctor training. The genesis of MSC came from a series of stakeholder consultation events in early 2008 and the June 2008 report 'A High Quality Workforce', part of the Darzi Review of the NHS. This led to the publication of a policy consultation document at the end of 2008, which outlined a revised training structure for the 50,000 plus healthcare scientists in the NHS, providing a single coherent framework for all the healthcare science disciplines. The final policy proposals were published in February 2010 in the document 'Modernising Scientific Careers: The UK Way Forward' Key elements There are four main elements to Modernising Scientific careers: * introduction of a new simplified healthcare science career pathway at all stages of the career framework * new training and education programmes, incorporating both academic and workplace-based training. This includes qualifications and awards and arrangements for assessment of previous 'equivalent' education and skills. * identification of regulatory implications for changing education and training * supporting delivery of the changes. This includes improving communication strategies, workforce planning, and education commissioning together with ensuring sustainable funding arrangements Career stages The new MSC career pathway has four stages: * Assistants and Associates * Practitioner Training Programme (PTP) - Bachelor-level education * Scientist Training Programme (STP) - Masters-level education * Higher Specialist Scientific Training (HSST) - Doctoral level Implementation in devolved administrations Scotland The Health Directorate of the Scottish Government has agreed to participate in the UK-wide framework for healthcare science education and training, while retaining the best of current Scottish practice. NHS Education for Scotland is leading on the work for Scotland and is participating on the UK-wide Healthcare Science Education and Training Board arrangements.

At the previous election, Chiam had been the only opposition MP to win a seat, so the results were seen as a significant success for the opposition. In 1994, Chiam resigned as the SDP's leader after a dispute with the rest of the party's Central Executive Committee (which included Cheo). After he publicly criticised them, the Central Executive Committee attempted to expel Chiam from the party (which would have forced him to vacate his parliamentary seat), but he won a court case to prevent them from doing so on procedural grounds. The negative publicity surrounding the dispute with Chaim hurt the SDP's prospects at the next general election in 1997.

It was the first parliamentary election contested by the Independent Labour Party.June Purvis, Emmeline Pankhurst: a Biography, p.41 Background The election was caused by the succession of Bernard Coleridge to the peerage. He had been the Liberal Party Member of Parliament for the seat since its creation for the 1885 general election. He had been re-elected at the 1886 and 1892 general elections, but the Conservative Party had taken more than 40% of the vote on each occasion. G. Hill Smith stood for the Conservatives in 1892, receiving 43.1% of the vote, and reducing Coleridge to his smallest majority to date. The seat of Attercliffe had a large working class population, many working in trades which were well unionised: ironworking, toolmaking and coal mining. Local labour movement leaders believed that the new representative for the seat should be a worker.Joyce Brown, \\"Attercliffe, 1894: How One Local Liberal Party Failed to Meet the Challenge of Labour\\", The Journal of British Studies, Vol.14, No.2, pp.48-77 Candidates The Conservative Party re-selected their candidate from 1892, G. Hill Smith. J. Batty Langley Several possible Liberal candidates were discussed, including Robert Hadfield, Joshua Rowntree and C. P. Scott, but two names came to the fore: J. Batty Langley and Charles Hobson. Hobson, the leader of the Sheffield Federated Trades Council, was a President of the Labour Electoral Association and would have stood as a Liberal-Labour candidate. Local Liberal leaders hoped that, if he were selected, it would discourage more radical labour movement activists from standing their own candidate. Langley ran a large saw mill in the city, and was an alderman on Sheffield Town Council. He had served as Mayor of Sheffield in 1892-93, when he took the initiative in resolving a major coal strike. On 18 June, the trades council unanimously endorsed Hobson as a candidate. Several leading trade unionist wrote in support of this decision, including William Bailey of the Nottinghamshire Miners Association, William Edwin Harvey of the Derbyshire Miners Association and Havelock Wilson of the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union. The Independent Labour Party (ILP), although only recently established, was strong in Sheffield, with four main branches and around 400 members, many formerly of the Social Democratic Federation. As its central purpose was to campaign for independent labour representation, it strongly opposed Langley, but its representatives on the trade council decided to endorse Hobson. Frederick Mappin, Liberal MP for nearby Hallamshire spoke strongly against any working class candidate, holding that they would lose the seat. William Clegg, leader of the Liberal group on the council, argued against selecting Hobson, because he believe that he would prove unable to raise the necessary money to stand. Henry Wilson, MP for Holmfirth, Secretary of the Sheffield Liberal Association, and John Wycliffe Wilson both favoured Hobson but, following Mappin and Clegg's comments, agreed to support Langley. On 22 June, an open meeting of the Liberal Council chose Langley by 160 votes to 2 for Hobson, and 2 for Robert Cameron, who had stood for the party in 1892 in Sheffield Central. The selection did not entirely settle the issue. At a meeting of the trades council on 23 June, Hobson announced that he would not oppose Langley, but the Daily Chronicle still wrote of him as the \\"ideal candidate\\". The ILP responded by proposing one of their own members, Frank Smith. He was narrowly endorsed by the trades council, although some liberal delegates refused to support the decision. Campaign Keir Hardie, Tom Mann, Emmeline Pankhurst and Ben Tillett all campaigned for the ILP. Hobson spoke alongside Hardie at a meeting on 1 July, although he stated that he had some differences with the party and considered himself independent. Langley was only given weak support by the National Liberal Federation, who did not send any speakers. Ben Pickard, General Secretary of the Yorkshire Miners' Association, sent a telegram supporting Langley.David Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, p.19 Philip Stanhope arranged a meeting between Frank Smith, Hardie and local Liberals, in the hope of persuading the ILP to withdraw, but Smith and Hardie complained that they had been tricked into attending, and left. Result Langley held the seat for the Liberals, with their majority only slightly reduced. Both the Liberal and Conservative votes fell, but the ILP only took 13.5% of the votes cast. The Daily News claimed that this was the Liberal's greatest victory since the 1892 general election, while Hardie claimed that the result would harden divisions between the Liberals and the labour movement. The Westminster Gazette held that Langley had only won because he was able to take some votes from the Conservatives. Immediately after the election, Ramsay MacDonald wrote to Hardie, requesting membership of the ILP. In his letter, he noted that \\"...Attercliffe came as a rude awakening, and I felt during the contest that it was quite impossible for me to maintain my position as a Liberal any longer...\\" The Liberal Party were soon reconciled with the majority of the trades council, and the first independent labour MP for Sheffield was not elected until the 1907 Sheffield Brightside by-election. Langley held Sheffield Attercliffe until the 1909 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election. Frank Smith eventually became Labour Party MP for Nuneaton, but Hobson never stood for Parliament.

He was appointed history painter to Queen Adelaide, Queen Consort of William IV, and painted Queen Victoria's coronation in 1838 and the Duke of Wellington's funeral in 1852. He supervised the painting of the huge panorama in the London Colosseum in Regent's Park, London, and was the inventor of \\"Parris's medium\\". Life and work J W Archer) The Sultan's Daughter (engraving by H. Cook after Parris) Parris, was born in the parish of St. Marylebone, London on 3 June 1793, the son of Edward and Grace Parris. He showed an early talent for art and was placed with Jewellers \\"Ray and Montague\\" (John Ray and James Montague), to learn enamel-painting and metal-chasing. During his apprenticeship, his leisure time was given to the study of mechanics, which subsequently proved to be of great use to him. In 1816 he entered the schools of the Royal Academy, and commenced the study of anatomy under Dr. Carpue. His first important picture, \\"Christ blessing little Children\\", was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1824. In that year, when the proposal was first made to undertake the restoration of James Thornhill's paintings in the cupola of St. Paul's Cathedral, Parris devised an ingenious apparatus for gaining access to them which attracted much attention, and led to his engagement by Thomas Hornor to assist him in the production of his panorama of London at the Colosseum, for which he had been making sketches since 1820. Upon this immense work, which covered nearly an acre of canvas and presented formidable artistic and mechanical challenges, Parris laboured incessantly for four years, completing it in November 1829. Soon after he painted, in conjunction with William Daniell, R.A., a panorama of Madras, for which he also constructed a building. A wholly different class of art, in which Parris gained a great temporary reputation, was the portrayal of female beauty, and he was for some years a fashionable portrait painter. His picture \\"The Bridesmaid\\", which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1830, and purchased by Sir Robert Peel, became very popular through the engraving by James Bromley (engraver); and many of his single figures and groups, composed in the same weak, sentimental style, were engraved in the \\"Keepsake\\" and similar publications. In 1836 and 1838 three sets of plates from his drawings were published, entitled respectively, \\"Flowers of loveliness\\", \\"Gems of Beauty\\", and \\"The Passions\\", with illustrative verses by Lady Blessington;E. T. Parris and Marguerite Gardiner. Flowers of Loveliness (1836) he also provided illustrations for her \\"Confessions of an Elderly Gentleman\\" (1836), and \\"Confessions of an Elderly Lady\\" (1838), to much popular approval. His illustrations were also used in several other books.Anon. The blue silk work- bag and its contents (G. Walker, 1817). On Queen Victoria's first state visit to Drury Lane Theatre in November 1837, Parris, from a seat in the orchestra, made a sketch of her as she stood in her box, and from this painted a portrait, of which an engraving, by Charles Edward Wagstaff, was published by Hodgson & Graves in the following April. In 1838 he was commissioned by the same firm to paint a picture of the Queen's coronation, and he received sittings for this purpose from the Queen and all the chief personages who were present; a print of this, also executed by Wagstaff, appeared in 1842. At the cartoon competition in Westminster Hall in 1843, Parris gained a prize of ¬£100. for his \\"Joseph of Arimathsea converting the Britons\\". In 1852, he painted the Duke of Wellington's funeral. Also in that year, the proposal to restore Thornhill's paintings in St. Paul's was revived and the commission given to Parris, who, bringing into use the scaffold he had designed for the purpose nearly thirty years before, commenced the task in 1853, and completed it in July 1856. Opinions about the appropriateness of Parris's restoration were divided, with one critic W. A. J. Archbold commenting that \\"the state of decay into which Thornhill's work had fallen rendered some kind of reparation necessary, but the complete repainting carried out by Parris almost wholly deprived it of such interest as it ever possessed\\". Parris was a frequent exhibitor of historical and fancy subjects at the Royal Academy and British Institution from 1816 to the end of his life, and in 1832 received the appointment of historical painter to Queen Adelaide. Throughout his career his untiring industry and great facility of invention led him to engage in almost every description of artistic work, and he made innumerable designs for stained-glass windows, carpets, screens, etc. He assisted Robert Smirke in preparing Westminster Abbey for the coronation of William IV, and was much employed in decorating the mansions of the nobility. One of his last important undertakings was the preparation of a model for a piece of tapestry, forty feet long, for the Paris exhibition of 1867. At one time Parris carried on a life-drawing school at his house in Grafton Street, Bond Street. He invented a medium which, when mixed with oil, produced a dull fresco-like surface; this was widely known as \\"Parris's Medium.\\" Edmund Thomas Parris died at 27 Francis Street, Bedford Square, London, on 27 November 1873. John Haslem (1808-1884), a porcelain and enamel painter, was a pupil of Parris's.

The round watchtower or Lochturm opposite the keep was also built in the 15th century as were the entrance gate and the castle stables. The castle started to deteriorate in the middle of the 16th century and was dismantled in 1685 by the troops of Louis XIV. The outer wall was however left intact as many of the houses used of it for their back walls. The castle fell into the hands of commoners. When Victor Hugo visited the village in 1871, several families were still living there. In 1902, the Egyptian Martin Riano d‚ÄôHutzt bought the ruins from the State for 1,000 francs.

Life Crane was born at Chester in 1808 to Thomas Crane, a bookseller. The young Thomas was in a family of six sisters and three sons. In 1824, having shown early a taste for art, he went to London, and joined the Royal Academy schools. There he remained for two years, receiving, in 1825, a medal for drawings from the antique. Returning to Chester, he commenced his profession as a miniature painter, and not very long after, he published, in conjunction with a brother, some sketches of celebrated characters in North Wales, including Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby, the eccentric \\"Ladies of Llangollen\\". In 1832 he exhibited at the Liverpool Academy for the first time, and continued to show there for many years. In 1835 he was elected an associate of the academy, and in 1838 a full member. In the following year he married, and moved back to London, where he lived for some time, but found the capital unsuitable, due to his predisposition to pulmonary disease. After trying Leamington and other places, he moved to Liverpool, and in 1841 was elected treasurer of the academy there. The delicate state of his health led him to move again, to Torquay, where he lived for twelve years, occasionally returning to north-west England, in order to procure more lucrative commissions. His health having apparently improved, he moved to Bayswater in London in 1857. However his illness reasserted itself, and he died in July 1859, leaving a widow and four children. His obituary in the Art Journal described him as \\"a portrait-painter of considerable provincial celebrity, and not altogether unknown and unappreciated in London.\\" Crane's daughter Lucy was a writer and art critic, while his eldest son, also named Thomas, was an illustrator and art director at Marcus Ward & Co. Crane's second son, Walter Crane, was one of the most prolific and influential illustrators of his time. Works Crane was, according to his obituary, \\"most successful in portraits of females and children, both in oil and water-colours; his treatment of such subjects being so elegant and so full of fancy as almost to make them ideal works, yet without compromising their likeness.\\" As well as working as a portraitist, he also painted figure subjects, including The First Whisper of Love,The Deserted Village,The Cobbler, The Old Romance, The Bay Window, and Masquerading, most of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy. He illustrated several books, including a nursery rhyme called The History of Mr Pig and Miss Crane, published in 1836.

Each house has one Faculty Master and one House Dean, with at least two College House Fellows (members of the faculty and senior administration) in residence. Each house hosts a wide range of jobs for students, including Residential Advisors, Graduate Associates, House Councils, Managers and Information Technology Advisors. The houses also encourage communities through the wide range of Residential Programs within the system. The University recently announced plans for New College House West, which will open in Fall 2021 at 40th and Walnut Streets. After this college house opens, sophomores will also be required to live on campus housing. Penn will require students to live on campus through sophomore year starting 2021. The Quadrangle The Quadrangle, located at 3700 Spruce Street, is divided into three College Houses: Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware, and Riepe. The houses are named for James and Gail Riepe, John H. Ware III, Anne and Jerome Fisher, and Alan G. Hassenfeld. Though the entire Quadrangle building is interconnected, much of the programming is housed within individual college houses. All three houses are for freshmen only. Lounges, libraries, and laundry rooms are located throughout the building and are shared by all residents of the Quad. The section of the building that now comprises much of Fisher Hassenfeld was the first dormitory built on Penn's campus. The University recently announced it is searching for an architect to start renovations at the Quad after the completion of New College House West. Hill College House Hill College House Hill College House, located at 3333 Walnut Street, is one of the largest college houses at the University of Pennsylvania. Hill was designed in 1958 by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, who also designed the St. Louis Arch, the former TWA Flight Center at New York City's Kennedy Airport, and Dulles Airport. The building was unusual for its time, incorporating an interior atrium. Originally the women's dormitory, Hill is now co-ed and houses only freshmen. There is a dining hall in the lower level of the building. In common with other buildings constructed at the height of the Cold War, the basement of Hill contains a fallout shelter, which links to the University's utility tunnels. The building was closed for renovation for the entire 2016-2017 school year. Kings Court English College House King's Court English College House, located at 3465 Sansom Street, was the first college house to host a residential program. Like Hill, it is a freshmen-only house and has a dining hall on the ground floor. King's Court was originally a luxury apartment building, and was restricted to nursing students only from World War II until 1975. English House, funded in 1960 by alum Thomas English, was officially incorporated into the college house in 1978. Lauder College House Lauder College House, is the newest building in the College House system and the first to be designed specifically for the College House system. It first opened to students for the 2016-17 school year and was designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, who also specialize in the Apple Store design. Formerly known as New College House, it was renamed Lauder College House in 2019 after the Lauder Family of Estee Lauder, a family with multiple generations of Penn alumni who have donated extensively to the university. New College House West New College House West will as of 2021 replace Lauder College House as the newest building in the College House system. Situated next to the three high rises and two low rises in High Rise Field, it will open to students in the Fall of the 2021-2022 academic year. High Rises Harnwell College House, Harrison College House, and Rodin College House collectively make up the three High Rise dormitories. Along with the two Low Rise dorms, they are located off of Locust Walk between 38th and 40th streets in what is referred to as High Rise Field. Each high rise building contains 24 floors of residential housing, as well as rooftop and lobby study lounges. All three houses are open to any and all upperclassmen students. The three high rises were designed identically by G. Holmes Perkins, a former Dean of the Design School, and constructed in 1971-72. They opened as High Rise East, High Rise South, and High Rise North respectively, but have since been renamed for W. Welsh Harrison, Gaylord Harnwell, and Judith Rodin, the latter two of which were presidents of the university. Stouffer College House Stouffer College House contains both Stouffer Hall and Mayer Hall. Stouffer Hall, located at 3702 Spruce Street, opened in 1972 and was one of the first College Houses. Mayer Hall, located diagonally across the street at 3817 Spruce Street, opened a few years earlier in 1964. However, Mayer was not officially incorporated into Stouffer College House until 2001. Mayer is named for Harold C. Mayer, a former University trustee. Stouffer Hall formerly had a dining hall, which was closed in 2001. Low Rises W. E. B. Du Bois and Gregory College Houses are two low-rise counterparts to the high rises on the west side of campus. Du Bois is located to the north of the high rises on Walnut Street and Gregory is to the south on Spruce Street. The buildings, however, can only be accessed via pedestrian pathways on opposite side of the streets. Both buildings are four-year communities, open to any students. Du Bois, originally Low Rise North, is named for W. E. B. Du Bois, who spent time conducting research at Penn for his 1899 publication The Philadelphia Negro. Du Bois focuses on supporting the pursuit of African American culture. Many of its activities are co-sponsored by various campus organizations including the Black student League, Muslim Students Association, and the LGBT Center. Gregory, originally Low Rise South, is named for Emily Lovira Gregory, a botanist who was the first female faculty member at Penn. Gregory focuses on events geared towards film studies and foreign language programs.

Life He was the son of Sir William Douglas, 6th of Drumlanrig (b. bef. 1484, k. 9 Sep 1513, Battle of Flodden) and Elizabeth Gordon of Lochinvar. As the descendant of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas (b.1323 d.1384) and his first wife Margaret of Mar, he was a ‚ÄòBlack Douglas‚Äô. Other descendants of the Earl from his mistress, Margaret Stewart, were known as ‚ÄòRed Douglas‚Äô. These two branches of the family were sometimes opposed, and this rivalry was revived in the time of the 7th Lord Drumlanrig. Complicating matters was the fact that Drumlanrig's wife, Margaret, was the sister of the powerful ‚ÄòRed‚Äô Earl of Angus, Archibald Douglas (b.1489 d.1557) = Guardianship of James V = One point of contention between Drumlanrig and Angus was over the guardianship of the infant King James V, whose father James IV had been killed at Flodden in 1513. His widow, Margaret Tudor, had quickly married the pro-English 6th Earl of Angus. By doing so, she invalidated her position as tutrix (guardian) to her son, and this led to a tussle between her and the governor of the king's council, the pro-French John Stewart, Duke of Albany, over guardianship of the child. Eventually her hasty marriage to the Earl of Angus was to devolve into a ‚Äòlong, acrimonious and very public separation‚Äô, ending in divorce. She was therefore opposed to the guardianship by Angus over her son, after Albany's regency lapsed in 1524. At this point, Scotland had become ‚Äòa Douglas kingdom in all but name', with Angus ‚Äòfilling virtually all posts of authority with his relatives‚Äô. James V was held as a virtual prisoner by Angus, leading to several failed attempts to free him. Drumlanrig was involved in one such attempt in July 1526, known as the Battle of Melrose. Only in 1528 did James, aged 16, free himself and assume authority over the kingdom. Despite his efforts two years previously to rescue him, Drumlanrig was considered by the new king ‚Äòas one of a dangerous family‚Äô and he was warded in Edinburgh Castle. = Return to favour = ‚ÄòThereafter little is heard of him till about the year 1550‚Äô, although it is apparent he was working to significantly expand his sizeable family (see below). His return to favour after this year is apparent in the number of concessions granted to him by the government, acting in the name of Mary, Queen of Scots, who had left for France in 1548. * In 1551 he was given a pardon for his part in the events of 1526. * In 1552 he was appointed a commissioner to meet commissioners from England to discuss the border between the two countries. * In 1553 he was made Warden of the West Marches, with full powers of justiciary, an office he occupied for many years until retiring at an old age. = Guardianship of Janet and Marion Carruthers = In 1548, after the death of Sir Simon Carruthers of Mouswald, he was made guardian of his two young daughters, Marion and Janet. He had responsibility for ensuring their upbringing and marriage. It is likely that he eyed their family property with a covetous eye, since he persuaded Janet, on marrying, to surrender part of her estate to him in exchange for money. Marion rejected both his choice of husband and his offer to buy her half of the estate, leading to an appeal by him to the Privy Council. In 1564 she was found dead in an apparent suicide at the base of the battlements of Comlongon Castle, where she had gone to take refuge. The court eventually awarded her half of the estate to Drumlanrig's heir, William. = The return of the Queen = In 1561, Mary Queen of Scots returned to Scotland. Drumlanrig was probably not a natural adherent of the Queen, being a Protestant whilst Mary was a Catholic. Along with John Knox, Drumlanrig had signed the First Book of Discipline in Edinburgh this same year, described by a later historian as ‚Äòan owner‚Äôs manual for the new religion‚Äô. (Drumlanrig was also one of those who visited John Knox on his deathbed in 1572) Concerned that her marriage to the Catholic Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley heralded a return to the Catholic religion, he joined other Protestant lords in a faint-hearted rebellion in 1565, later called the ‚ÄòChaseabout Raid‚Äô. > When the King and Queen advanced in force upon Dumfries, most of the > Protestant lords went off to Carlisle, but Maxwell, Drumlanrig and Gordon of > Lochinvar remained to meet their sovereign, and Mary won them over to her > side. Two years later, after the death of Mary Queen of Scot's husband Lord Darnley (a relation of Drumlanrig's wife Margaret), and Mary's quick remarriage to the Earl of Bothwell, Drumlanrig again joined the Protestant ‚ÄòConfederate Lords‚Äô in revolt.This saw her (much smaller) army capitulate without a fight at Carberry Hill in June 1567. The Queen later spoke bitterly about both Drumlanrig and his son William, describing them as ‚Äòhell houndis, bludy tyrantis without saullis or feir of God‚Äô. An aftershock of his opposition to Mary arose in 1571, when following a dispute with the Laird of Wormiston (a supporter of Queen Mary), he was ambushed and taken prisoner. Whilst in prison, he wrote a touching letter to his son, whose fate he was unsure of. > Willie, Thou sall wit that I am haill and feare. Send me word thairfoir how > thow art, whether deid or livand? Gif thow be deid, I doubt not but freindis > will let me know the treuth; and gif thow be weill, I desire na muir,‚Äù = Marriage and issue = On his death in 1578, it is said that he had ‚Äòraised his family to a very high degree of influence in the south-west of Scotland‚Äô. He had 18 children by 2 wives and mistresses. His first wife was Margaret Douglas, sister to the Earl of Angus, with whom he had 10 children. Divorced c. 1539, he married Christian Montgomery, who became mother to another 6 of his children, including his heir, William Douglas of Hawick. Because William predeceased his father, the title and estate was inherited by Drumlanrig's grandson, James Douglas. Robert Douglas, Provost of Lincluden was his son by one of his mistresses.David Laing, Works of John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 386 fn.

In 1991, Seet was appointed the Acting Minister for Community Development. It was widely predicted that she would become the first woman to become a full member of the Cabinet in Singapore after the general election. However, in the general election held later that year, Seet faced a challenge from Ling again and was defeated. Ling won 12,037 votes (51.4%) to 11,383 Seet's (48.6%). Seet became the first cabinet member to lose a parliamentary seat. One factor which is thought to have contributed to Seet's defeat was an incident in which she washed her hands after shaking hands with a fishmonger while campaigning in a market, which drew negative publicity. The incident occurred during the 1988 general election campaign, and was brought up again by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at an election rally in 1991 when, in an attempt to defend Seet, he said that she had a habit of washing her hands regularly and had not done so out of disrespect. His comments were reported in the media and reignited the incident. In an interview with The Straits Times in 2011, Seet said that she had in fact washed her hands because she had also shaken hands with pork sellers and wanted to clean her hands before meeting Muslim residents. She added that she wished Goh Chok Tong had clarified this with her before making his comments at the election rally.Dr Seet Ai Mee: Why I lost in Bukit Gombak, The Straits Times, 19 March 2011 After her election defeat, Seet became a Senior Visiting Fellow in the National University of Singapore Institute of South-East Asian Studies.

Red. The group is best known for working for Chikara, but has also worked for promotions such as Dragon Gate USA, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and various other independent promotions. Originally forming on the independent circuit in the Illinois‚Äìarea, the group has worked majority of its existence as babyface and has had its members hold numerous titles in promotions such as Stars & Stripes Wrestling, Vanguard Wrestling All‚ÄìStar Alliance and Windy City Pro Wrestling. A major part of the group's gimmick involves its entrance, during which its members are known for doing the \\"Soulja Boy dance\\" from \\"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\\", which was also their entrance theme. History =Chikara (2008‚Äìpresent)= Da Soul Touchaz before a match in March 2008 After their formation on the Illinois‚Äìindependent circuit, Da Soul Touchaz, being represented by Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett, Willie Richardson and their manager C. Red, made their debut for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania‚Äìbased Chikara on March 1, 2008, entering the 2008 King of Trios tournament. After defeating Team BSE (Kobra Kai, La Sombra Canadiense and Super Xtremo) in the first round, they were eliminated from the tournament later that same day by F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Gran Akuma and Icarus). The group returned to Chikara in June 2008, with Marshe Rockett entering the sixth Young Lions Cup tournament, while Acid Jaz and Willie Richardson wrestled tag team matches. On July 14 Rockett defeated Johnny Gargano in his first round match, thus advancing to the six‚Äìway elimination semifinal match later that same day, from which he was eliminated by Lince Dorado. Trauma made his Chikara debut on September 20, 2008, in an eight-man tag team match, where he, Jaz, Richardson and Rockett defeated UltraMantis Black, Crossbones, Sami Callihan and Trik Davis. Da Soul Touchaz returned to Chikara on March 27, 2009, with Marshe Rockett, Willie Richardson and Trauma, who replaced an injured Acid Jaz, entering the 2009 King of Trios tournament. This appearance also marked the Chikara debut of their valet Dymond. In their first round match Richardson, Rockett and Trauma defeated Team CZW (Beef Wellington, Greg Excellent and Pinkie Sanchez). The following day they were eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals by The UnStable (Colin Delaney, STIGMA and Vin Gerard). On the third day of the tournament Richardson and Rockett entered a twelve tag team gauntlet match and eliminated Mitch Ryder and Pinkie Sanchez, before being eliminated themselves by The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson). After not appearing for Chikara for the rest of the year, Da Soul Touchaz attempted to win a spot in the 2010 King of Trios tournament by entering Cleveland, Ohio‚Äìbased Absolute Intense Wrestling's (AIW) sixteen team Jack of All Trios tournament in April 2010, the winner of which would earn themselves a spot in King of Trios. Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson made it all the way to the semifinals of the tournament, before suffering an upset loss against the trio of Johnny Gargano, Flip Kendrick and Louis Lyndon, who went on to win the entire tournament. After missing the 2010 King of Trios, Jaz, Richardson and Rockett, managed by C. Red and Dymond, returned to Chikara on June 26, 2010, defeating the reigning King of Trios, the up to that point undefeated Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK) (Ares, Claudio Castagnoli and Tursas), in a six-man tag team match. They followed that up by defeating the 2010 King of Trios runners up, The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant), in another six man tag team match the following day. Da Soul Touchaz's win streak came to an end on September 18, when they were defeated by the newly reformed F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano). During the rest of the year, Jaz, Richardson and Rockett scored two more victories over BDK, first in a six-man tag team match against Lince Dorado, Tim Donst and Tursas on September 19 and then in an eight-man tag team match, where they teamed with Sugar Dunkerton against Ares, Daizee Haze, Pinkie Sanchez and Tursas on November 20. The following day Da Soul Touchaz, who boasted over their victories over BDK and claimed to have their number, were ambushed and beat down by its members. The attack was used to explain the retirements of both C. Red and Dymond, with Jaz, Richardson and Rockett promising to exact revenge on BDK, becoming a more serious trio. At the season ten premiere on January 23, 2011, BDK members Lince Dorado, Sara Del Rey and Tursas defeated Jaz, Richardson and Rockett via disqualification. On February 3, Da Soul Touchaz became the fourth team entered into the 2011 King of Trios. On April 15, Da Soul Touchaz were eliminated from the King of Trios by BDK representatives Tim Donst, Delirious and Jakob Hammermeier, following interference from Tursas. The following day, Marshe Rockett was eliminated from the Rey de Voladores tournament by BDK member Pinkie Sanchez with help from the group's own referee, Derek Sabato. In their next appearance on June 25, Da Soul Touchaz defeated Jakob Hammermeier, Tim Donst and Tursas in the main event of the show held in their hometown of Chicago, following interference from the returning C. Red. Marshe Rockett returned to Chikara in September, losing to Johnny Gargano and Ares in singles matches on the 18 and 19, respectively. Rockett, Acid Jaz and Willie Richardson returned to Chikara on November 10, 2012, in Chicago, when the three were defeated in a six-man tag team match by The Batiri (Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon). On May 18, 2013, Jaz and Rockett represented Da Soul Touchaz in the 2013 Tag World Grand Prix, but were eliminated in their first round match by Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and The Shard). =Independent Wrestling Association Mid‚ÄìSouth (2008‚Äì2010)= \\"The Urban American Dream\\" Willie \\"Da Bomb\\" Richardson On August 17, 2008, Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson made their debuts for Indiana‚Äìbased Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA‚ÄìMS), losing to Brian Skyline, Christian Able and Jeff Brooks in a six-man tag team match. The team picked up their first victory in the promotion on October 4, when Jaz and Rockett defeated Jason Hades and Troy Walters. At the following event on October 11, Jaz was granted a shot at Hades' IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to defeat him for the title. On December 6, 2008, Da Soul Touchaz, represented by Acid Jaz and Marshe Rockett, entered the second annual Candido Cup. In the first round of the tournament, Jaz and Rockett faced the Nintendogs (The Game Boy and Yellow Dog) and Team WLW (Darin Waid and Steve Anthony) in a three‚Äìway tag team match. The match ended with Team WLW being eliminated and Da Soul Touchaz and the Nintendogs advancing to the second round. Later that same day Da Soul Touchaz defeated the Strong Rednecks (Roderick Strong and Trevor Murdock) to advance to the semifinals, where they defeated Prince Mustafa Ali and Trik Davis to advance to the finals of the tournament, held that same day. In the finals of the tournament Jaz and Rockett defeated Michael Elgin and Sami Callihan to win the 2008 Candido Cup. However, during the final match Jaz broke his leg and would spend the next eleven months sidelined from in‚Äìring action, while Trauma was given the spot as Rockett's regular tag team partner. On June 7, 2009, IWA‚ÄìMS held a benefit show to help pay for Jaz's medical bills. Jaz finally made his return on November 20, 2009, when he teamed with Rockett and Trauma in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated the Hooligans (Devin Cutter, Mason Cutter and Neil Diamond Cutter). Recently, IWA‚ÄìMS had run into severe monetary issues and had cancelled many of its shows, before announcing that it would go forward with a much smaller budget. On May 16, 2010, Acid Jaz and Marshe Rockett made their to‚Äìdate final appearance for IWA‚ÄìMS, defeating Egotistico Fantastico and Sal Thomaselli in a tag team match. =Dragon Gate USA (2010)= On September 25, 2010, Da Soul Touchaz, being represented by Acid Jaz, Marshe Rockett and Willie Richardson, made their debut for Dragon Gate USA, defeating Billy Rayz, Danny Duggan and Gringo Loco in a dark match prior to the Untouchable 2010 pay-per-view. Later, in the pay-per-view section of the event, the three of them were defeated in a three‚Äìon‚Äìone handicap match by Brodie Lee.

The focus of the interpretive centre is the story of Beringia, the 3200 km landmass stretching from the Kolyma River in Siberia to the MacKenzie River in Canada, which remained non-glaciated during the Pleistocene due to light snowfall from an arid climate. Beringia is of special interest to archeologists and paleontologists as it played a crucial role in the migrations of many animals and humans between Asia and the Americas. The term Beringia was first coined by the Swedish botanist Eric Hult√©n in 1937. During Beringia's long history some animals migrated Easterly (mastodons, gomphotheres, mammoths, various members of the deer family, bison, sheep and muskoxen) others Westerly (equines, camels), and yet others reveal many episodes of dispersal (such as lemmings and voles). Research Recent research includes the paleobotany around the Bluefish Caves, habitat of ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and their middens, Klondike gold fields, and the Old Crow region which revealed many fossils belonging to mammals that are much rarer in Pleistocene fossil assemblages, including giant beaver (Castor ohioensis), broad-fronted moose (Cervalces latifrons), western camel (Camelops hesternus), American mastodon (Mammut americanum), scimitar cat (Homotherium serum), and short-faced bear (Arctodus simus).

New powder is continuously added to the bed from a powder reservoir c) by means of a leveling mechanism b) Binder jet 3D printing, known variously as \\"Powder bed and inkjet\\" and \\"drop-on-powder\\" printing, is a rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing technology for making objects described by digital data such as a CAD file. Binder jetting is one of the seven categories of additive manufacturing processes according to ASTM and ISO. History This technology was first developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and patented in 1993. In 1996, the ExOne Company was granted an exclusive field-of-use patent for the technology, while Z Corporation, which was later acquired by 3D Systems, obtained a non- exclusive patent for use of the technology for metal casting purposes. The term \\"Three-Dimensional Printing\\" was trademarked by the research group at MIT, along with the abbreviation 3DP. As a result, the term \\"3D printing\\" originally referred uniquely to the binder jet printing process prior to gaining wider acceptance as a term referring to all additive manufacturing processes. Description As in many other additive manufacturing processes the part to be printed is built up from many thin cross sections of the 3D model. An inkjet print head moves across a bed of powder, selectively depositing a liquid binding material. A thin layer of powder is spread across the completed section and the process is repeated with each layer adhering to the last. When the model is complete, unbound powder is automatically and/or manually removed in a process called \\"de-powdering\\" and may be reused to some extent. The de-powdered part could optionally be subjected to various infiltrants or other treatments to produce properties desired in the final part. Materials A 3D selfie in 1:20 scale printed by Shapeways using gypsum-based printing, created by Madurodam miniature park from 2D pictures taken at its Fantasitron photo booth. In the original implementations, starch and gypsum plaster fill the powder bed, the liquid \\"binder\\" being mostly water to activate the plaster. The binder also includes dyes (for color printing), and additives to adjust viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point to match print head specifications. The resulting plaster parts typically lack \\"green strength\\" and require infiltration by melted wax, cyanoacrylate glue, epoxy, etc. before regular handling. While not necessarily employing conventional inkjet technology, various other powder-binder combinations may be deployed to form objects by chemical or mechanical means. The resulting parts may then be subjected to different post-processing regimes, such as infiltration or bakeout. This may be done, for example, to eliminate the mechanical binder (e.g., by burning) and consolidate the core material (e.g., by melting), or to form a composite material blending the properties of powder and binder. Depending on the material, full color printing may or may not be an option. As of 2014, inventors and manufacturers have developed systems for forming objects from sand and calcium carbonate (forming a synthetic marble), acrylic powder and cyanoacrylate, ceramic powder and a liquid binder, sugar and water (for making candies), etc. One of the first commercially available products that incorporated the use of Graphene, was a powdered composite used in powder bed inkjet head 3D printing. 3D printing technology has a limited potential to vary material properties in a single build, but is generally limited by the use of a common core material. In the original Z Corporation systems, cross- sections are typically printed with solid outlines (forming a solid shell) and a lower-density interior pattern to speed printing and ensure dimensional stability as the part cures. Characteristics In addition to volumetric color by use of multiple print heads and colored binder, the 3D printing process is generally faster than other additive manufacturing technologies such as fused deposition modeling material jetting which require 100% of build and support material to be deposited at the desired resolution. In 3D printing, the bulk of each printed layer, regardless of complexity, is deposited by the same, rapid spreading process. As with other powder-bed technologies, support structures are generally not required because loose powder supports overhanging features and stacked or suspended objects. The elimination of printed support structures can reduce build time and material use and simplify both equipment and post-processing. However, de-powdering itself can be a delicate, messy, and time-consuming task. Some machines therefore automate de-powdering and powder recycling to what extent feasible. Since the entire build volume is filled with powder, as with stereolithography, means to evacuate a hollow part must be accommodated in the design. Like other powder-bed processes, surface finish and accuracy, object density, and‚Äîdepending on the material and process‚Äîpart strength may be inferior to technologies such as stereolithography (SLA) or selective laser sintering (SLS). Although \\"stair-stepping\\" and asymmetrical dimensional properties are features of 3D printing as most other layered manufacturing processes, 3D printing materials are generally consolidated in such a way that minimizes the difference between vertical and in-plane resolution. The process also lends itself to rasterization of layers at target resolutions, a fast process that can accommodate intersecting solids and other data artifacts. Powder bed and inkjet 3D printers typically range in price from $50,000 to $2,000,000 however there is a hobbyist DIY kit selling from $800 to convert a consumer FDM printer to powder/inkjet printer. Limitations Parts printed using the binder jetting process are inherently porous and have an unfinished surface, as unlike powder bed fusion the powders are not physically melted and are joined by a binding agent. While the usage of a binding agent allows for high melting temperature (e.g. ceramic) and heat-sensitive (e.g. polymer) materials to be powdered and used for additive manufacturing, binder jetting parts require additional post-processing that can require more time than it takes to print the part, such as curing, sintering, and additional finishing . X-ray image of normal metal and agglomerate particles produced during the binder jetting process. The utilized powder was 9um Stainless Steel 316. Note the large, circular agglomerate particles- these lead to powder bed depletion. Binder jetting is particularly prone to the phenomena of powder bed depletion, which occurs when the binder is dropped onto the surface of the powder bed. This issue is particularly prevalent in binder jetting, as unlike traditional additive manufacturing processes (which utilize high heat to melt and fuse powders together), the \\"jet\\" of binder that is dropped onto the bed can cause large agglomerates of semi-bonded powder to be ejected from the surface, leaving behind subsurface depletion zones (for 30 Œºm SS316 powder, a depletion zone depth of 56¬±12Œºm was observed). The growth of depletion zones as subsequent layers of powder are deposited printed can have major ramifications on the quality of parts printed with binder jetting. Ejected agglomerates land on other regions of the bed, causing the surface of the bed to become less even, the dimensions of the final part to be warped and inaccurate, and large subsurface pores to form. Residual defects and stress may also be present throughout, which reduce the strength of the already weaker part (due to the inherent porosity of the binder jetted part) . These factors limit the usage of binder jetting for high-performance applications, such as for aerospace, as binder jetted parts are generally weaker than those printed with powder bed fusion processes. However, binder jetting is perfect for rapid prototyping and production of low-cost metal parts .

States shown include Alaouite Morocco, Ottoman Algeria, Tunis, Tripolitania and Egypt, Abyssinia, and in the south Cape Colony, Orange Free State and Transvaal. Detail shown in the interior of the continent is based on then-recent expeditions, such as the exploration of Lake Victoria by Henry Morton Stanley in 1871. The earliest cartographic depictions of Africa are found in early world maps. In classical antiquity, Africa (also Libya) was assumed to cover the quarter of the globe south of the Mediterranean, an arrangement that was adhered to in medieval T and O maps. The only part of Africa well known in antiquity was the coast of North Africa, described in Greek periplus from the 6th century BC. Hellenistic era geographers defined Egypt as part of Asia, taking the boundary of Asia and Egypt to lie at the Catabathmus Magnus (the escarpment of Akabah el-Kebir in western Egypt). Ptolemy's world map (2nd century) shows a reasonable awareness of the general topography of North Africa, but is unaware of anything south of the equator. The limit of Ptolemy's knowledge in the west is Cape Spartel (35¬∞ 48‚Ä≤ N); while he does assume that the coast eventually retreats in a \\"Great Gulf of the Western Ocean\\", this is not likely based on any knowledge of the Gulf of Guinea.Eric Anderson Walker, The Cambridge history of the British Empire, Volume 7, Part 1, 1963, p. 66 In the east, Ptolemy is aware of the Red Sea (Sinus Arabicus) and the protrusion of the Horn of Africa, describing the gulf south of the Horn of Africa as Sinus Barbaricus. With the European exploration of Africa from the 15th century, maps of Africa became more precise. The Fra Mauro map of 1459 shows a more detailed picture of Africa as a continent, including the Cape of Diab at its southernmost point, reflecting an expedition of 1420. Sebastian M√ºnster's Cosmographia (1545) labels the Cape of Good Hope, reached by Bartolomeu Dias in 1488, as caput bonae spei. The interior of Africa was not mapped in any detail before the second half of the 19th century. Indigenous maps Whereas most known early maps of Africa were prepared in the framework of the colonial enterprise, some indigenous maps have been recently uncovered, particularly in West Africa and Ethiopia.Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

The road deck, stiffened by a steel Warren truss, is above the high water line of the reservoir. The bridge was designed by Harold H. Gilbert of the Washington State Highway Department, and was constructed by the Gilpin Construction Company of Portland, Oregon. The only short-span steel suspension bridge in Washington, the bridge incorporates unique features. Only the central span is slung from the cables, with separate unloaded cables acting as backstays running from the tall towers to concrete anchorages in the canyon's rocky sides. The approach spans were originally supported from below by a timber structure. The cables are discontinuous at the towers, unlike most suspension bridges in which the cables run over a saddle on the towers. With less wear, the cables could be smaller. The bridge deck is made of timbers with an asphalt overlay. The counties transferred the bridge to the Washington State Department of Highways in the late 1930s and it was refitted in 1957-58 with steel approach spans.

The Court invalidated part of a federal law that prohibited \\"dial-a-porn\\" telephone messaging services by making it a crime to transmit commercial telephone messages that were either \\"obscene\\" or \\"indecent\\".\\"Sable Communications of California v. FCC\\". oyez.org. Retrieved 2011-03-14.\\"Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n.\\". Quimbee.com. Retrieved 2011-04-30. Obscenity versus indecency The often tough question of what it is that makes material indecent or obscene was an important aspect of this case. The murky line between these two categories has been difficult to determine. In Butler v. Michigan (1957), when dealing with the sale of books containing adult material, the Court \\"reversed a conviction under a statute which made it an offense to make available to the general public materials found to have a potentially harmful influence on minors\\".. This case, however, did not deal with definitions. A case that did, which is one of the most crucial cases to this debate, was Miller v. California (1973), which involved the mailing of sexually explicit advertising brochures. From this case, the Miller test was established as a way to determine whether a work can be considered obscene. The test has three major criteria: *Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would deem the work as appealing to the prurient interest, *Whether the work depicted sexual conduct, as defined by state law, in a patently offensive way, *Whether the work as a whole lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. All three parts must be fulfilled for the material to be considered obscenity. History of Dial-a-Porn The first attempt to deal with dial-a-porn services occurred with subsection 223(b) in the 1934 Communications Act. With 223(b), it became illegal to make obscene or indecent phone calls to anyone who was either under 18 years old, or had not given consent. To regulate this, the FCC required dial-a-porn services to operate only between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., and receive payment with a credit card. In 1984, the case of Carlin Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 749 F.2d 113 (2nd Cir. 1984) (Carlin I) deemed the time channeling to not be effective because it did not allow adults access to dial-a-porn services between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., but still could allow access to minors who could not be stopped from calling between the current legal hours. After getting rid of these time restrictions in 1985, the FCC began to use a system of user identification access codes, in addition to credit cards, to regulate these dial-a-porn services. They later added message scrambling, which made use of a descrambling device that was only available to adults to actually listen to dial-a-porn phone calls. The combination of these three regulatory practices were finally supported as being effective enough to protect minors after Carlin Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 837 F.2d 546 (2nd Cir.) (Carlin III). Case In 1988, Congress amended subsection 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 to ban indecent and obscene interstate commercial phone messages, regardless of age. This made the business of Sable Communications, who had been in the dial-a-porn industry since 1983, illegal. The federal parties had argued that the only way to prevent children's access to dial-a-porn messages was through the complete ban of their telephone services. Sable Communications argued that the \\"legislation creates an impermissible national standard of obscenity, and that it places message senders in a 'double bind' by compelling them to tailor all their messages to the least tolerant community\\".\\"Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n.\\". lawschool.courtroomview.com. Retrieved 2011-03-14. The Court said that if the government wants to protect children in this regard, it must do so by technological means, rather than by a total ban on the transmission of these messages.. Although some children might be able to defeat these devices, a banning these services would have the impermissible effect of \\"limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that which is suitable for children to hear\\". Ruling A judge of the United States District Court for the Central District of California upheld the ban on obscene messages, but ordered the Act's enforcement against indecent ones. The Court upheld the district court ruling. Since the First Amendment does not protect obscene speech, as the Court found in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton (1973), the ban on obscene speech was legitimate. However, sexual expression that is simply indecent is protected.\\"Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton\\", Oyez.org. Retrieved 2011-04-30. Therefore, banning adult access to indecent messages \\"far exceeds that which is necessary\\" to shield minors from dial-a- porn services. ;Words from the Court :Sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment...The Government may, however, regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. We have recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors. This interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards.\\"Action for Children's Television v. Federal Communications Commission, 58 F. 3d 654 (1995) (Edited Version)\\". cba.uni.edu. Retrieved 2011-03-31. :The Government may serve this legitimate interest, but to withstand constitutional scrutiny it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms...It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends. Significance The court drew a sharp distinction between speech that meets the legal definition of \\"obscene\\" and speech that is \\"indecent\\" (sexually charged but not rising to the level of \\"obscene\\"). The court held that obscene speech could be restricted, but that merely indecent speech was protected by the First Amendment. The court also recognized a real need for governmental interest in shielding children from speech that could be obscene to minors, but not for adults. However, the court stressed that these limitations must be limited so they can distinguish what is and what is not restricted, carefully protecting the rights of adults to receive protected speech, even if that protected speech is indecent.

The band consist of Amory Neish-Melling (vocals), Jake Ward (guitar), Joshua Harper (guitar), Jacob Walker (bass) and Sam Dabrowski (drums). A recent article printed in the Manchester Evening News said of the band: \\"Armed with a clutch of full-blooded romantic pop anthems... substance, along with intoxicating doses of idealism and romance, is something The Cold One Hundred clearly aren't lacking in. Combining Suede pomp, Clash punky freneticism and large splashes of Morrissey poetic swoon, The Cold One Hundred are classic Britpop elegance compacted into the neatest seven inch pop parcel...

Within a month they were described as \\"A band with all the potential to break the mould of mundane Indie music\\". The band's first demos, recorded at Sandhills Studios in Liverpool, received local acclaim as the band were hotly tipped as 'ones to watch' by Manchester- based High Voltage and Ark Magazines. The band has played live sessions for both BBC Radio Lancashire and BBC Radio Manchester, and were featured as The Guardian's New Band of The Day in March 2012. The Cold One Hundred have played numerous gigs across the UK, including supports with The Vaccines, The Heartbreaks and Spector.

After it is displaced from its initial lattice site, the PKA can induce the subsequent lattice site displacements of other atoms if it possesses sufficient energy, or come to rest in the lattice at an interstitial site if it does not. Most of the displaced atoms resulting from electron irradiation and some other types of irradiation are PKAs, since these are usually below the threshold displacement energy and do not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. In other cases like fast neutron irradiation, most of the displacements result from higher energy PKAs colliding with other atoms as they slow down to rest.  Collision Models  Atoms can only be displaced if, upon bombardment, the energy they receive exceeds a threshold energy Ed. Likewise, when a moving atom collides with a stationary atom, both atoms will have energy greater than Ed after the collision only if the original moving atom had an energy exceeding 2Ed. Thus, only PKAs with an energy greater than 2Ed can continue to displace more atoms and increase the total number of displaced atoms. In cases where the PKA does have sufficient energy to displace further atoms, the same truth holds for any subsequently displaced atom. In any scenario, the majority of displaced atoms leave their lattice sites with energies no more than two or three times Ed. Such an atom will collide with another atom approximately every mean interatomic distance traveled, losing half of its energy during the average collision. Assuming that an atom that has slowed down to a kinetic energy of 1 eV becomes trapped in an interstitial site, displaced atoms will typically be trapped no more than a few interatomic distances away from the vacancies they leave behind. There are several possible scenarios for the energy of PKAs, and these lead to different forms of damage. In the case of electron or gamma ray bombardment, the PKA usually does not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. The resulting damage consists of a random distribution of Frenkel defects, usually with a distance no more than four or five interatomic distances between the interstitial and vacancy. When PKAs receive energy greater than Ed from bombarding electrons, they are able to displace more atoms, and some of the Frenkel defects become groups of interstitial atoms with corresponding vacancies, within a few interatomic distances of each other. In the case of bombardment by fast-moving atoms or ions, groups of vacancies and interstitial atoms widely separated along the track of the atom or ion are produced. As the atom slows down, the cross section for producing PKAs increases, resulting in groups of vacancies and interstitials concentrated at the end of the track.  Damage Models  A thermal spike is a region in which a moving particle heats up the material surrounding its track through the solid for times of the order of 10‚àí12 s. In its path, a PKA can produce effects similar to those of heating and rapidly quenching a metal, resulting in Frenkel defects. A thermal spike does not last long enough to permit annealing of the Frenkel defects. A different model called the displacement spike was proposed for fast neutron bombardment of heavy elements. With high energy PKAs, the region affected is heated to temperatures above the material‚Äôs melting point, and instead of considering individual collisions, the entire volume affected could be considered to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù for a short period of time. The words ‚Äúmelt‚Äù and ‚Äúliquid‚Äù are used loosely here because it is not clear whether the material at such high temperatures and pressures would be a liquid or a dense gas. Upon melting, former interstitials and vacancies become ‚Äúdensity fluctuations,‚Äù since the surrounding lattice points no longer exist in liquid. In the case of a thermal spike, the temperature is not high enough to maintain the liquid state long enough for density fluctuations to relax and interatomic exchange to occur. A rapid ‚Äúquenching‚Äù effect results in vacancy-interstitial pairs that persist throughout melting and resolidification. Towards the end of the path of a PKA, the rate of energy loss becomes high enough to heat up the material well above its melting point. While the material is melted, atomic interchange occurs as a result of random motion of the atoms initiated by the relaxation of local strains from the density fluctuations. This releases stored energy from these strains that raises the temperature even higher, maintaining the liquid state briefly after most of the density fluctuations disappear. During this time, the turbulent motions continue so that upon resolidification, most of the atoms will occupy new lattice sites. Such regions are called displacement spikes, which, unlike thermal spikes, do not retain Frenkel defects. Based on these theories, there should be two different regions, each retaining a different form of damage, along the path of a PKA. A thermal spike should occur in the earlier part of the path, and this high-energy region retains vacancy-interstitial pairs. There should be a displacement spike towards the end of the path, a low-energy region where atoms have been moved to new lattice sites but no vacancy-interstitial pairs are retained.  Cascade Damage  The structure of cascade damage is strongly dependent on PKA energy, so the PKA energy spectrum should be used as the basis of evaluating microstructural changes under cascade damage. In thin gold foil, at lower bombardment doses, the interactions of cascades are insignificant, and both visible vacancy clusters and invisible vacancy-rich regions are formed by cascade collision sequences. The interaction of cascades at higher doses was found to produce new clusters near existing groups of vacancy clusters, apparently converting invisible vacancy-rich regions to visible vacancy clusters. These processes are dependent on PKA energy, and from three PKA spectra obtained from fission neutrons, 21 MeV self-ions, and fusion neutrons, the minimum PKA energy required to produce new visible clusters by interaction was estimated to be 165 keV.

Family Courts in Israel do not conduct trials on visitation rights, they delegate the powers to determine them to Social Workers who are appointed as aides of Court. Its report was delivered in 2008. The Minister of Justice, Moshe Kahlon decided to take no action. Main findings of the Slonim Nevo Commission in Israel The commission has found that social workers appointed as aides of Court to determine rights of visitations are understaffed, lack appropriate guidance, lack of transparency and reliability, and cause increased levels of deprivation and frustration among the fathers. * The policies and guidelines are not up to date. * Social workers act as both investigators and therapists; however, they use information extracted during therapy to hurt fathers in the investigatory Visitations Rights Report. * Duties of confidentiality owed to fathers who are forced to go through psychotherapy, as condition to seeing their children, are constantly breached. * The Commission further found that the social workers should not write a Social Welfare report to the Family Court about a family previously treated by it as a welfare agent or social worker. * Occasionally welfare officers must conduct a Report on families, who were treated by them previously, as social workers. In most cases, the social worker's acquaintance of the family caregiver is with the woman, thus earning the Social worker's sympathy in advance. The prior acquaintance creates bias against the man. * The Commission recommended that Welfare officers must provide an objective opinion, and therefore they should not have a previous acquaintance with the family. * Social workers do not provide copies of the reports to the adversaries in Court, thus denying the parents procedural rights to know the contents of the reports. * The commission also recommended appointing an independent ombudsman officer to review all complaints regarding the welfare officers. * The Commission also found that Visitation Reports do not adhere to professional principles. Training in preparing Visitations Reports are lacking. * The duration of the services is too long, and appointment for more than one year is not necessary. * Because of personnel shortage, the waiting list for Visitations Reports is too long, and during the waiting period, fathers are disconnected from children. Other observations of the Slonim-Nevo Commission The Commission further criticized the privatization of state responsibility to provide a forum, to litigate custody and visitations. The delegation of powers to social workers raises questions and concerns regarding the definition of welfare officer role and work. Social Workers or Welfare officer's role is to perform an investigation, draw a factual picture of the family, followed by recommendations about custody arrangements. The welfare officers tend to mix therapeutic components with investigatory ones. While Courts expect them to provide diagnostic reports, the social workers instead resort to forced therapy treatments. The social workers then use the information stated by the patient, and submits it to court. The Commission found that Social Workers should limit themselves to the obvious welfare job, which is to focus on gathering information, assessment and formulating recommendations about the parents as caregivers, without therapy or over-involvement in the parents‚Äô intimate lives.

A railway between Donnybrook and Boyup Brook was opened in 1908 with Wilga originating as a railway siding. Built to serve the Adelaide Timber company the forested area around the town was felled and sent to nearby mills. Land was set aside for a town in 1912 and later surveyed. The town was gazetted in 1915. The name of the town is thought to have come from the nearby Wilgee Springs which first appeared on maps of the area in 1894. The name Wilgee is Aboriginal in origin and means ochre or pigment that is worn in ceremonies. The nearest saw mill was established in 1925 about 10 km from town and was named Woop Woop. The Wilga Mill and its surrounds was considered to contain relics of the mill, locomotives and logging were scattered around it.

Its first project was the Metropolitan Buildings in Old Pancras Road, Kings Cross, which consisted of 21 two-room and 90 three-room flats in five-storey blocks. It was demonstrated as an archetype of model dwellings and was visited by the Prince Consort in 1848, as well as William Gladstone, Charles Kingsley, Lord Shaftesbury, Charles Dickens and the Duke of Wellington. The principal architect on many of these dwellings was Henry Roberts who pioneered many types of model dwelling, working also with the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. By 1900, the MAIDIC was one of the largest model dwellings companies operating in London, housing over 6,000 individuals.Wohl, A.S.

London: Edward Arnold, p.146 Its activities declined as other model dwellings companies and the Greater London Council grew, which offered lower rents to a wider range of candidates.
