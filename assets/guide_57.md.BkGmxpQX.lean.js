The National Hockey League (NHL) has endured a tumultuous period of history in recent years. It has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today (32 in 2021) as the league expanded across the United States. Repeated labour conflicts interrupted play in 1992, 1994‚Äì95, 2004‚Äì05 and 2012‚Äì13; the second lockout caused the entire 2004‚Äì05 NHL season to be canceled, the first time in North American history that a sports league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Nine franchises were added between 1991 and 2000, comprising the San Jose Sharks, Ottawa Senators, Tampa Bay Lightning, Florida Panthers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Nashville Predators, Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild. The Vegas Golden Knights were added in 2017, and the Seattle Kraken are expected to begin play in 2021. In additions to expansion teams, five franchises have relocated during this time: the Minnesota North Stars became the Dallas Stars (1993), the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche (1995), the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes (1996), the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes (1997), and the Atlanta Thrashers became the second franchise known as the Winnipeg Jets (2011). In 1993, the Montreal Canadiens celebrated the Stanley Cup's 100th anniversary with their 24th championship. They remain the last Canadian team to capture the trophy. The 1994 New York Rangers broke the Curse of 1940, winning their first title in 54 years. The renaissance of the Original Six would continue as the Detroit Red Wings (Stanley Cup winners in , , and ), Chicago Blackhawks (winners in , and ) and Boston Bruins (winners in ) broke lengthy Cup droughts of 42, 47 and 39 seasons, respectively. Meanwhile, the NHL's southern expansion, often maligned by Canadians and fans in the Northeastern United States, has led to championships by the Dallas Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Carolina Hurricanes and Anaheim Ducks in the last decade, with the Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and St. Louis Blues following suit. Manon Rheaume became the first female player in the NHL when she suited up for the Lightning in a 1992 pre-season game. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame Hodgkin's lymphoma to finish his NHL career with more than 1,700 points and two championships, and now owns the Pittsburgh Penguins. Today's NHL is led by arguably its three biggest young stars: Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals, and Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers. The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in 1996, while NHL players first competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics. To promote itself worldwide, the NHL played regular season games in Japan in 1996, and throughout Europe since 2007. The league played its first outdoor regular season game between the Canadiens and the host Edmonton Oilers in 2003 and which led to the creation of three series of outdoor games: the Heritage Classic, Winter Classic and Stadium Series. Increased use of defence-focused systems contributed to decreased scoring in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by the 1990 expansion plan. The league has attempted several times to alter its rules to increase scoring. It began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime in 1999, hoping to reduce the number of tie games. In 2005, ties were eliminated altogether as the penalty shootout was introduced to ensure that all games have a winner. Background Gary Bettman, pictured in 2008, joined the NHL as its first commissioner in 1993. As the 1990s began, players were uneasy with the closeness between National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) executive director Alan Eagleson and the teams' owners. As a result, Eagleson stepped down in December 1991, and was replaced by Bob Goodenow. Four years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicted Eagleson on charges of racketeering, fraud, embezzlement, kickbacks and obstruction of justice over allegations that he stole millions of dollars from the NHLPA. Eagleson pleaded guilty in 1998 in a plea bargain and was fined US$1 million and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He subsequently resigned from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Four months after replacing Eagleson, Goodenow and the NHLPA launched the first NHL strike on April 1, 1992. It lasted ten days and resulted in the players receiving larger playoff bonuses, increased control over the licensing of their likenesses and improved rights to free agency; all canceled games were also rescheduled. It also led the owners to dismiss league president John Ziegler and replace him on an interim basis with Gil Stein. Goodenow called the strike a major moment, stating \\"I don't think the owners took the players seriously and it wasn't until the strike that they understood the players were serious.\\" As part of the deal, the league also agreed to have each team play two games per season for the following two years in neutral site locations, partially to help gauge markets for potential expansion. Desiring a fresh start, the owners replaced Stein with Gary Bettman in February 1993. Formerly a senior vice president of the National Basketball Association, Bettman replaced the position of president with that of commissioner. He was given the task of selling the game to the American market, ending labor unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing the league. Expansion The acquisition of Patrick Roy helped lead the Colorado Avalanche to a Stanley Cup championship in 1996. The Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators joined the league in as part of the owners' 1990 plan to expand the NHL to 28 teams within a decade. The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rheaume played a period of an exhibition game for them on September 23, 1992. Rheaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game. She also became the first woman to sign a professional hockey contract, doing so with the Lightning's farm team, the Atlanta Knights. One year later, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL's 25th and 26th franchises. They were established as part of the NHL's attempt to regain a U.S. network television presence by expanding into southern North America. The league expected that bringing in Blockbuster Video's Wayne Huizenga to own the Panthers, and The Walt Disney Company to own the Mighty Ducks would raise its profile. The NHL's southward push continued in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas to become the Dallas Stars. The NHL celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup in 1993. That year's finals featured Patrick Roy and the Montreal Canadiens against Wayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings. After losing the first game, the Canadiens rallied from a late deficit to win game two in overtime after the Kings' Marty McSorley was penalized for using an illegal stick. Montreal scored on the power play, sending the game into overtime. Montreal won games three and four in overtime en route to winning the series in five games. The Canadiens won an NHL-record ten consecutive overtime games in the 1993 playoffs. The New York Rangers ended their \\"Curse of 1940\\" after 54 years by winning the 1994 Stanley Cup in seven games over the Vancouver Canucks. The Rangers' championship was the last hurrah for the great Edmonton Oilers dynasty of the 1980s, as there were seven ex-Oilers on the team, including Mark Messier, who became the first (and to this date, the only) player to win Stanley Cups as the captain for two franchises, having captained the Oilers to the last of their five Stanley Cups in . The Rangers' victory also resulted in the first Russian names to be engraved on the Stanley Cup: Alexei Kovalev, Alexander Karpovtsev, Sergei Nemchinov, and Sergei Zubov. The global audience of 285 million in 120 countries that watched the Rangers' victory included a huge European audience, including those watching across the former Soviet Union. This Stanley Cup win was the highest-rated single CBC Sports program in history to that point. 1994‚Äì95 lockout Four months later, the players were locked out by the owners due to the lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout lasted 104 days and resulted in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners wanted to control salary growth and insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and salary arbitration. The union instead proposed a luxury tax system that would penalize teams that spent above a set figure on player salaries. The negotiations were at times bitter, as defenceman Chris Chelios famously issued a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that he should be \\"worried about [his] family and [his] well-being\\", because \\"some crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way.\\" The lockout entered its fourth month in January 1995 and approached a deadline that would have canceled the season when the two sides agreed to an 11th-hour deal. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap, but the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts, changes to the arbitration system and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant a player the unrestricted right to choose where he played until age 31. The deal was initially seen as a victory for the owners. The agreement was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian dollar, led the Winnipeg Jets to relocate to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996, becoming the Coyotes one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver, Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche. Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada, and citing the cost of doing business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars, the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in 1996. The Hartford Whalers became the third former World Hockey Association team to relocate in 1997, moving to Raleigh, North Carolina, to become the Carolina Hurricanes. Dead puck era Following the 1994‚Äì95 lockout, the NHL entered a prolonged period of offensive decline. Throughout the 1980s, 7.6 goals were scored per game on average. That figure had dropped below six goals per game by the 1994‚Äì95 season, and to 5.19 by 1998‚Äì99. There have been many arguments put forth as to what caused this decline. A common claim is that the drop in offence was due to dilution of talent caused by 1990s expansion, a position former player Brett Hull endorsed. Increased use of the neutral zone trap and similar defensive systems were also blamed. The New Jersey Devils have often been criticized for popularizing the trap, using it to win the Stanley Cup in 1995. This period has been called the dead puck era. The Devils, along with the Detroit Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche, largely dominated the dead puck era, winning a combined eight championships in nine years while also sweeping their series opponents in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. The Canada Cup gave way to the World Cup of Hockey in 1996, an NHL-sanctioned eight team international tournament featuring the top professionals in the world. The inaugural tournament saw the United States upset the favored Canadians in a three-game final. That same year, the Avalanche won their first Stanley Cup in their first season in Denver, sweeping the Florida Panthers. One year later, the Detroit Red Wings ended a 42-year drought, capturing their first Stanley Cup since 1955. The team's celebration was cut short, as defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov were seriously injured when their limousine crashed six days following the victory. The Red Wings dedicated the 1997‚Äì98 season to the two. Upon repeating as champions in 1998, they brought Konstantinov, who had suffered severe brain damage in the crash, out in a wheelchair to celebrate with the team on the ice. Jarome Iginla and Vincent Lecavalier face off. The two forwards battle each other for the 2004 Stanley Cup. The NHL added four expansion teams to increase the total number of clubs to 30. Continuing its expansion into the southern United States, the Nashville Predators joined the league in 1998, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers in 1999. The Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets then began play in 2000. On April 16, 1999, Wayne Gretzky played his final NHL game, retiring as the league's all-time scoring leader and holding 61 NHL records. His number, 99, was retired league-wide the following season. The usual three- year waiting period between a player's retirement and his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame was waived, and he was inducted in 1999. For marketing reasons, the NHL agreed to participate in the Winter Olympics starting in 1998. NHL players first competed at the Nagano Games. Led by goaltender Dominik Ha≈°ek, the tournament was won by the Czech Republic. Hasek, who finished the tournament with a 0.97 goals against average (GAA) and a .961 save percentage over six games, was the leading goaltender of the 1990s. His run of consecutive Vezina Trophies from 1994 to 1999 was interrupted only once, in 1996 by Jim Carey of the Washington Capitals. Hasek won another Vezina Trophy in 2001, and two consecutive Lester B. Pearson and Hart Trophies in 1997 and 1998. The Panthers' trip to the Stanley Cup final in 1996 began a trend in which southern-based teams frequently appeared in the championship round. The Dallas Stars won the 1999 Stanley Cup over the Buffalo Sabres in controversial fashion: Brett Hull scored the Cup-winning goal in overtime of game six despite arguments that his foot was in the goal crease, which under the rules at the time would have disallowed the goal. The Stars returned to the finals in 2000, falling to the New Jersey Devils. The Hurricanes first played in the finals in 2002, losing to the Red Wings, while the Mighty Ducks reached the final in 2003, falling to the Devils. In 2004, the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames to win the Cup. The Lightning win in 2004 was seen as the end to the Devils/Avalanche/Red Wings Stanley Cup era, as all three teams won a combined 8 Stanley Cups between 1995 and 2003. The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL's first regular season outdoor hockey game, the Heritage Classic, on November 22, 2003. The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then-record crowd of 57,167 fans who endured temperatures as low as . Mario Lemieux Lemieux in 2001 When they selected him as the first overall draft pick in 1984, the Pittsburgh Penguins hoped that Mario Lemieux would improve the team's fortunes on the ice, and increase interest in the team in the Pittsburgh market. Lemieux, who had scored 133 goals in his final season of junior hockey, recorded his first NHL goal in his first game on his first career shot against the Boston Bruins. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux scored five goals, one in each of the five different ways possible: even strength, on the power play, short handed, on a penalty shot and into an empty net, a feat no player in league history has duplicated. Injuries and illness plagued Lemieux throughout his career. He played only 26 regular-season games in 1990‚Äì91 after surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back, but returned in time to score 44 points in the playoffs in leading the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup. Lemieux continued to struggle with back trouble the next season, though he still won the scoring title, and his second consecutive playoff MVP award in leading the Penguins to their second championship in 1992. In 1993, he was diagnosed with cancer. Lemieux endured 22 radiation treatments in 30 days to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only 12 hours after his final treatment, Lemieux returned to the Penguins, scoring a goal in his first game back. A second surgery on his back cost Lemieux most of the 1993‚Äì94 season, and the entire 1994‚Äì95 campaign. As a result of his injuries, Lemieux retired in 1997. He was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame; the three-year waiting period was waived by the Hall. Inspired by his son Austin's desire to see him play, Lemieux returned to the NHL in 2000‚Äì01, earning an assist on a Jaromir Jagr goal 33-seconds into his return, and scoring one himself in the 2nd period. He also became the first player-owner in NHL history; he had bought the Penguins in the summer of 1999 to save them from bankruptcy. Lemieux finished the season with 35 goals and 76 points in 43 games. Lemieux continued to battle injuries, missing the majority of the first half of the 2001‚Äì02 season, however he returned to action in time to captain Team Canada to its first gold medal in 50-years at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Injuries again forced his retirement, as Lemieux finally ended his career on January 24, 2006, with 690 goals and 1,723 points in 915 games. Despite his injuries, Lemieux is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NHL history. Hall of Famer Bobby Orr said that Lemieux was the most skilled player he had ever seen, while Mike Gartner said that if he had remained healthy, Lemieux would have scored 1,000 goals. 2004‚Äì05 lockout By 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown much faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002‚Äì03. Upon the expiry of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), Gary Bettman announced that the players were again locked out to start the 2004‚Äì05 season. As with the 1994‚Äì95 lockout, the owners were demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The players, for their part, offered a 24% salary rollback to keep the free-market system that was already in place. On February 16, 2005, after a series of last minute offers failed, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season, making the NHL the first major North American league to cancel an entire season because of a labor stoppage. The season's cancellation led union president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin to take charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new CBA. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues, a 24% rollback on salaries, and unrestricted free agency beginning after seven years of service. The loss of the 2004‚Äì05 season led the NHL to institute a special lottery to determine the order of the 2005 draft, as there were no standings to base a drafting order from. The Pittsburgh Penguins won the lottery, and selected Sidney Crosby, a highly prized prospect whose arrival to the NHL had been greatly anticipated. Crosby and the Washington Capitals' Alex Ovechkin, the 2004 first overall pick, were expected to become the faces of the NHL as the league entered a new era. Ovechkin was named the Calder Memorial Trophy winner as rookie of the year in 2005‚Äì06, while Crosby's presence helped Pittsburgh's attendance increase by 33%, over 4,000 fans per game. Recent years Debut of Crosby and Ovechkin Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo for the 2008 Winter Classic In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Ovechkin and Crosby began their careers. In their first three seasons, they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies; Crosby captured both in 2007 and Ovechkin in 2008. The 2006 Stanley Cup Finals was the first time that franchises that originally played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) met in the Stanley Cup Final, as the Oilers lost a seven-game series to the Hurricanes. The following season, the Senators lost the finals in five games to the Ducks. The three- year streak of Canadian teams in the finals was halted in the 2007‚Äì08 season, when the Red Wings defeated the Penguins for their fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. Penguins, Blackhawks and Kings dominate The introduction of the salary cap in 2005 encouraged parity in the NHL, making it harder for teams to compete for the Stanley Cup every year. Nevertheless, three franchises emerged to win Stanley Cups each during this period. During the decade from 2008 to 2017, the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins combined for eight Stanley Cup wins. At least one of the three teams or the Boston Bruins appeared in every Stanley Cup Final in that time frame, but only faced one another once in 2013 when the Blackhawks defeated the Bruins in six games. The Pittsburgh Penguins lost to the Red Wings for the 2008 Stanley Cup, but returned in for a rematch with the defending champions. The Penguins would return the favor, capturing their third Stanley Cup championship in Game 7. Seven years later, in , the Penguins won their fourth Cup at the expense of the Sharks, then repeated the feat in against the Predators, becoming the first back-to-back champion since the 1998 Red Wings. Led by homegrown players Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, the Penguins emerged from the brink of bankruptcy to become an NHL powerhouse, reaching the playoffs every year since . The Chicago Blackhawks also had its share of struggles to begin the 2000s, but the team's fortunes soon changed after drafting Jonathan Toews third overall in 2006 and Patrick Kane first overall in 2007. The duo of Toews and Kane helped the Blackhawks end a 49-year Cup drought in by defeating the Flyers in six games. It was then followed by two more Stanley Cup victories; first in against the Bruins, and then in against the Lightning. The Los Angeles Kings had struggles to begin with, until they hired Daryl Sutter in the middle of the 2011‚Äì12 season. Afterward, the Kings made the Cup final in , and won the Stanley Cup against the Devils, which was the first championship as a franchise. It was then followed by another Stanley Cup victory in against the Rangers. The only other team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals more than once between 2009 and 2017 was the Boston Bruins. The Bruins reached the Cup Finals twice, winning in and losing in 2013. The Bruins' 2011 triumph was its first since . Two first-time champions The six‚Äìyear streak of a Penguins, Blackhawks, or Kings Cup win came to an end in . The Washington Capitals, not seen in the Stanley Cup Finals since their loss to the Red Wings in 1998, won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The Washington Capitals won in five games over the Vegas Golden Knights, who made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. In , the St. Louis Blues won their first Stanley Cup championship over the Boston Bruins in seven games. Going Outdoors The success of the Heritage Classic led the NHL to schedule more outdoor games. The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings. On January 1, 2010 at Fenway Park in Boston the third Winter Classic was held with the Bruins defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 2‚Äì1 in overtime. The following year the Winter Classic was held in Pittsburgh's Heinz Field, with the Washington Capitals beating the Penguins 3‚Äì1, and on January 2, 2012 (January 1 of that year was a Sunday), the New York Rangers defeated the Flyers 3‚Äì2 at Philadelphia's Citizens Bank Park. The pinnacle of the Winter Classic's popularity took place on January 1, 2014, when the Maple Leafs defeated the Red Wings 3‚Äì2 in a shootout behind a record crowd of 105,491 spectators at Michigan Stadium. Since its debut, the Winter Classic became an annual New Year's Day tradition for the NHL, regularly playing in front of sellout crowds and record viewers on television. Its Canadian counterpart, the Heritage Classic, continues to take place, albeit infrequently. After the Oilers' successful staging of the event in 2003, the Heritage Classic was held in three Western Canadian cities. The 2011 game took place in Calgary's McMahon Stadium and it involved the Canadiens and Flames. Three years later, the Heritage Classic was held at Vancouver's BC Place and it featured the Senators and Canucks. The 2016 Heritage Classic was played in Winnipeg's Investors Group Field with the Oilers and Jets taking part. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, the NHL introduced the Stadium Series which promoted outdoor hockey to warm-weather and non-traditional markets. Two of the first five Stadium Series games were held in Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium and Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, both of which involved the Kings against their in-city rival Ducks and their in-state rival Sharks. On March 3, 2018, the Capitals hosted the Maple Leafs at the Navy‚ÄìMarine Corps Memorial Stadium, starting off a unique partnership between the NHL and the United States Armed Forces. During the NHL's 100th anniversary celebrations in 2017, two one-off outdoor games were held in Eastern Canada. The NHL Centennial Classic took place at Toronto's BMO Field on January 1, 2017 and it featured a rematch of the 2014 Winter Classic between the Red Wings and Maple Leafs. Then on December 16, 2017, the NHL 100 Classic between the Canadiens and Senators was played at TD Place Stadium in Ottawa. Overall, 25 NHL outdoor games have taken place since 2008. NHL Premiere Challenge and Olympic Participation Intending to promote the game worldwide, the league sent the San Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames to begin the 1998‚Äì99 season with two games in Tokyo, Japan. Since 2007, the NHL has been sending teams to Europe to start each season. The Los Angeles Kings met the Ducks at the O2 Arena in London, England to start the 2007‚Äì08 season. A year later, four teams were sent to Prague, Czech Republic and Stockholm, Sweden. One of those teams, the Rangers, also participated in the inaugural Victoria Cup, defeating the Kontinental Hockey League's Metallurg Magnitogorsk 4‚Äì3 in a single game. Another four teams opened the 2009‚Äì10 season in Stockholm and Helsinki, Finland. In 2010, Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics, the first time an NHL city has hosted the event since the league began participating. The NHL's participation in future games remains in doubt, as it had expressed a desire not to participate in the 2014 games in Sochi, Russia. However, the NHL players did ultimately participate in those games. The players strongly favour continued participation in the Olympics. Due to the 2010 Olympics, the Canucks underwent the longest road trip in NHL history, with 14 games over 6 weeks, from January 27 to March 13, 2010, to allow General Motors Place to be used for ice hockey during the Winter Games. It marked the first time that an NHL-sized rink was used during the Winter Olympics. GM Place was \\"Canada Hockey Place\\" during the games, as the IOC prohibits advertising, including corporate sponsorship, within Olympic venues. In 2018, the NHL elected not to send its players to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Prior to that, the NHL revived the World Cup of Hockey tournament in 2016, twelve years after its most recent tournament. Coyotes bankruptcy, Thrashers relocation, Vegas and Seattle additions Despite these successes after the lockout, a couple of teams still had financial difficulties. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 after incurring several hundred million dollars of losses. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market. Meanwhile, the City of Glendale, Arizona, home of the team's Jobing.com Arena, financially kept the team afloat, paying $25 million to the NHL to cover the club's losses for the 2010‚Äì11 season, and another $25 million for the 2011‚Äì12 season. The league eventually sold the team in 2013 to Renaissance Sports & Entertainment (RS&E;), a group of Canadian investors . After also suffering financial losses and ownership struggles, the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts to expand into the southern United States. Initially replacing the Thrashers in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division, as part of a realignment to four divisions, the Jets were moved to the Western Conference's Central Division before the 2013‚Äì14 season. The Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were then assigned to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions, respectively. In 2017, the Vegas Golden Knights joined the NHL, increasing league membership to 31 teams. In its first season as a franchise, the Golden Knights became an immediate success, reaching the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals and capturing the Pacific Division title, a feat never seen before in North American professional sports. However they lost the series 4‚Äì1 to the Washington Capitals, losing the last game 4‚Äì3. On December 4, 2018, it was announced that a team in Seattle, later named the Seattle Kraken, would be the 32nd team in the league. 2012‚Äì13 lockout The NHL again entered lockout in 2012, cancelling the first 526 games, about 43% of the season, until at least December 30, 2012. Just after 5 am on January 6, 2013, after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating, the NHL and the player's union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. The first games of the season were held on January 19. Suspension of the 2019‚Äì20 season due to COVID-19 The NHL halted play in the 2019‚Äì20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, indefinitely postponing the remainder of the regular season and playoffs. In early March 2020, the NHL suspended media access to the locker rooms, saying that only official personnel would be allowed in after the games to limit person-to-person contact. But after the National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended all games when two players tested positive for the disease, the NHL scheduled a meeting to discuss pausing the season. On March 12, the morning practice sessions and media access were cancelled for all teams. Shortly after, they announced the 2019‚Äì20 season was paused indefinitely. It was the biggest interruption to an NHL season since the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout. On March 17, it was announced that a player from the Ottawa Senators tested positive for COVID-19. On March 21, it was announced that a second Senators player tested positive for COVID-19. Two Colorado Avalanche players have also tested positive for the virus. On April 4, the originally intended date for the final games of the regular season, Commissioner Gary Bettman participated in a call with President Donald Trump and other sport commissioners on the state of the sport world. On May 22, the league and the NHLPA agreed on a basic framework to stage a 24-team playoff tournament behind closed doors. The seeds would be based on each club's points percentage when the season paused on March 12 (effectively scrapping the remainder of the regular season). The top four seeds in each conference would get a bye, while the next eight seeds in each conference would play in a best-of-five series. Many of the logistics still have to be negotiated, including COVID-19 testing protocols, visas, and whether these games will be held in one or more \\"hub\\" cities as the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border remains closed to non-essential travel until June 21. That same day, the U.S. government announced that foreign athletes would be exempted from pandemic-related travel bans still in effect. On May 25, the NHL announced \\"phase 2\\" of its \\"Return to Play Plan\\", which is to begin at some point in June. Players would be allowed to resume use of team practice facilities in small groups (no more than six), with only players allowed on- ice and no other agents or press admitted. Players must self-isolate for 14 days if they use public transport, and will be regularly monitored and tested for COVID-19. If a player tests positive, they may not attend training until cleared, with teams suggested to use guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Training camps (phase 3) are planned to reopen after July 1. On May 26, Bettman formally discussed aspects of the \\"Return to Play Plan\\", including the proposed 24-team playoff format (with the top four teams in each conference playing a round robin tournament under regular season overtime rules to determine their seeds), and modifications to the procedures for the Draft Lottery. Whether the first and second round proper will use a best-of-five format as opposed to seven is to be determined, the conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals will each remain a best-of-seven series. Bettman stated that at least two hub cities would be used for the playoffs, shortlisting hosts such as Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Toronto (the latter two of which would be chosen by the league on July 1). Health, testing, and security protocols would be in place at these sites. As Canadian law requires all travellers entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly stated that this may impact the ability to use Canadian host cities unless these issues can be addressed. On June 4, it was announced that the NHL and NHLPA had approved aspects of the format that had not yet been finalized during the May 26 briefing, with the first and second rounds proper using a best-of-seven format as usual, and all teams being reseeded after each round (to account for the lack of home advantage due to all games being played at a neutral site). It was reported that the NHL planned to have one American host and one Canadian host. As Canada's Quarantine Act currently requires all travellers entering the country to self- isolate for 14 days on arrival, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly stated that this may impact the ability to use Canadian host cities unless these issues can be addressed. On June 10, British Columbia Premier John Horgan stated that the province's medical officer Bonnie Henry had endorsed proposed protocols developed by the Vancouver Canucks in collaboration with local officials, and that they were being sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for federal approval. These include allowing the NHL to \\"cohort\\" players and restrict their access to the general public. Phase 2 of the \\"Return to Play Plan\\" began on June 8. Players are allowed to resume use of team practice facilities in small groups (no more than six), with only players allowed on-ice and no other agents or press admitted. Players must self-isolate for 14 days if they use public transport, and will be regularly monitored and tested for COVID-19. If a player tests positive, they may not attend training until they have been cleared, with teams suggested to use guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Training camps (phase 3) were planned to reopen on July 10. Amidst an intense growth of new cases in Florida, the Tampa Bay Lightning temporarily closed their training facility on June 19 after several staff members and three players tested positive for COVID-19. On June 24, Sportsnet reported that Vancouver's bid had been complicated by disagreements over protocols for positive cases. The next day, Global BC's Richard Zussman reported that the NHL had \\"moved on [for now]\\" from Vancouver, and was increasing its focus on Edmonton and Toronto as potential sites. While Las Vegas was initially considered a front-runner, a spike of cases in Nevada and other U.S. states led to reports on July 1 that the NHL had decided on Edmonton and Toronto as the sites. On July 10, the NHL confirmed that it had ratified agreements with the NHLPA to begin the playoffs on August 1 (concluding no later than early October), with games being hosted by Edmonton (Western Conference early rounds, conference finals, and Stanley Cup finals) and Toronto (Eastern Conference early rounds). The league also renewed its CBA for four additional seasons, which includes an increase to minimum player salaries and a 10% deference of player salaries for the 2020‚Äì21 season (to be paid out over three seasons beginning 2022‚Äì23). The Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup over the Dallas Stars on September 28. Rules and innovations The addition of the trapezoid behind the nets is one of many changes made by the NHL since the lockout. Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season, the NHL decided that beginning in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, in any game tied after regulation time, both teams would be guaranteed one point, while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point. The theory was that rather than playing conservatively to earn a point for a tie, teams would press for the extra point for the overtime win. In the 2005‚Äì06 season the NHL eliminated tie games altogether, as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five-minute overtime period. The shootout has proven controversial; critics have called it a gimmick, and expressed fierce opposition to any suggestion of using it to decide playoff games, though the league has not pushed for this to happen. It has also been argued that teams are playing it safe, taking no chances in regulation in order to bring the game to overtime, where they are each guaranteed a point. The shootout also has many supporters, among them Phoenix head coach Dave Tippett, who stated that many fans enjoy it. The shootout was one of several rule changes made in 2005 as the league attempted to increase offence following the lockout. The two-line pass rule was eliminated, allowing teams to pass from their defensive zone to anywhere in the neutral zone. Previously, such passes could only be made to their own half of the neutral zone. The rule was intended to encourage long breakout passes and create more breakaways. Teams that commit an icing infraction are no longer allowed to make a line change before a faceoff, and goaltenders are now prohibited from playing the puck in the end-zone corners behind the goal line. They are allowed to play the puck directly behind the net, within the trapezoid marked by diagonal lines from the goal line to the end boards. One of the most controversial changes was the league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction penalties. The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on \\"clutching and grabbing\\". The tighter regulations have met with complaints about the legitimacy of some calls, that players are diving to draw penalties, and that officials are not calling enough penalties. The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring. Teams combined to score 6.1 goals per game in 2005‚Äì06, more than a goal per game higher than in the 2003‚Äì04 season. This represented the highest single-season increase in offence since 1929‚Äì30. However, scoring has rapidly declined since, approaching pre- lockout totals in 2007‚Äì08. Other rule changes that were implemented include the hybrid icing rule,Hybrid icing tops list of rule changes for 2013-14.

It was chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 43rd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The film was also entered into the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. However, the competition was cancelled and no prizes were awarded, over controversy surrounding the film. Plot A four-man US fireteam on patrol seizes a passing young Vietnamese girl and continue to torture and kill her. Only one soldier refuses to take part in it and reports this incident to his superior, who dismisses it as simple wartime incident. As a consequence for his report, the soldier has to fear for his life. Later, the perpetrators are convicted, although subsequent appeals reduce their sentences significantly. The plot takes place in a Bavarian forest and reenacts the 1966 Incident on Hill 192 during the Vietnam War. The soldiers wear US uniforms, have authentic names but speak with a pronounced Bavarian accent‚Äîa conscious directing decision known as Brechtian distancing effect.

This accusation was based on the fact that the film depicted four American soldiers kidnapping, raping, stabbing and shooting a Vietnamese woman named Mao until she finally dies. A fifth soldier on the patrol refuses to take part in the attack on the woman and his report to his commander is buried in the files. Stevens, who had served during the Second World War, claimed that the film was anti-American. One jury member, Du≈°an Makavejev, protested against this measure, stood up for the film and supported director Michael Verhoeven and producer Rob Houwer. Verhoeven defended his film by stating in these terms: \\"I have not made an anti-American film. If I were an American, I would even say my film is pro‚ÄêAmerican. The biggest part of the American people today is against the war in Vietnam\\". Other directors that were taking part in the festival withdrew their films in protest. The jury was accused of censorship and eventually disbanded, therefore no prizes were awarded and the competition was suspended. This scandal had such a big impact that it was unclear if the festival would continue to take place the next year.

These include Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain and Lithos Confederation of Lodges. History Freemasonry began in Belgium whilst the region was ruled by Austria, and later came under influence from Freemasonry in France (following the area's annexation) and the Netherlands (in the period between 1815 and 1830). When the state of Belgium was formed in 1830, Freemasonry there expanded greatly, but faced dramatic changes and challenges over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today Grand Orient of Belgium The Grand Orient of Belgium (French: Grand Orient de Belgique, Dutch: Grootoosten van Belgi√´ G.O.B.) is for men only and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. It was founded in 1833, three years after the independence of Belgium, and joined the Grand Orient of France and other Continental jurisdictions in not requiring initiates to believe in a Supreme Being. In 1989 the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium and the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain signed an agreement of mutual recognition. Grand Lodge of Belgium The Grand Lodge of Belgium (French: Grande Loge de Belgique, Dutch: Grootloge van Belgi√´, G.L.B.) is for men only, and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. It was founded in 1959 by 5 lodges of the Grand Orient of Belgium in order to regain recognition by the United Grand Lodge of England. When in 1979 this recognition was lost again, 9 lodges founded the Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium. In 1989, the Grand Orient of Belgium, the Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium and the Belgian Federation of Le Droit Humain signed an agreement of mutual recognition. Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium The Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium (French: La Grande Loge R√©guli√®re de Belgique, Dutch: Reguliere Grootloge van Belgi√´, R.G.L.B.) is for men only and works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. It was founded on 15 June 1979 by 9 lodges after the Grand Lodge of Belgium lost its recognition from the United Grand Lodge of England. Today it has nearly 57 lodges throughout Belgium. Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium The Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium (French: Grande Loge F√©minine de Belgique, Dutch: Vrouwengrootloge van Belgi√´) is a Masonic obedience for women only which works in the first three degrees of Freemasonry. The Grande Loge F√©minine de France founded its first lodge in Brussels on 20 April 1974, followed by three more in Li√®ge, Brussels and Charleroi. The Women's Grand Lodge Of Belgium was founded on 17 October 1981. Other Masonic rites Various iterations of the Scottish Rite exist in Belgium. The oldest is the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite under the leadership of the \\"Supreme Council of Belgium\\". Another is the Souverain Coll√®ge du Rite √©cossais pour la Belgique, founded in 1962.

Introduced by Optimas in 2001, the JTI was developed over a 10-year period in Norway by psychologists Thor √òdeg√•rd and Hallvard E: Ringstad. The JTI was designed to help capture individuals' preferred usage of the psychological functions identified by Carl Jung in his book Psychological Types, such as thinking vs feeling and sensing vs intuition. The JTI's questions and methodology for identifying the preferred functions differs from the MBTI. For example it eliminates word pairs, which can be troublesome to translate from English into other languages. In many languages, the sentence context frames the meaning of a word, while in English the words themselves may denote more meaning. Overview Similar to the MBTI, the JTI identifies four categories from which the 16 types are formed: Extraversion/Introversion, Intuiting/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, Perceiving/Judging. A personality type is reached through an examination or introspection about these categories. For example, an Intuiting, Thinking, Judging Extravert would be classified as an ENTJ. However, further complexity lies below this surface-level classification. Each personality type has its associated Jungian cognitive functions, which aim to further explain the ways in which people with each type perceive and interact with reality. Each type has all four of the cognitive functions (Thinking, Feeling, Intuiting, and Sensing) arranged in a different order and with different levels of introversion/extraversion. Of the two middle letters of any type, one will be the primary function with which they interact with the world, and one will be the auxiliary. For example, an ENTJ's primary function is (extraverted) Thinking, and their secondary function is (introverted) Intuiting. Commercialization Though it is relatively unknown in the United States, it has some market share in Scandinavia although the original MBTI tool is still the most commonly used. In Norway and Sweden,JTI Agency for Sweden the JTI is also gaining users in conjunction with other tools that complement the JTI for career development and coaching. It also has distributors in the Netherlands, China, and Germany.JTI - Jungian Type Index Debate about type dynamics Some MBTI practitioners argue that the application of type dynamics (e.g. with inferred types like \\"Extraverted Sensing\\") to MBTI is a logical category error that has little empirical evidence backing it. Instead, they argue the best evidence for Myers Briggs types comes when the types are viewed as separate categories that function independent from one another as dichotomous types.https://www.capt.org/research/article/JPT_Vol69_0109.pdf See also * Analytical psychology * Keirsey Temperament Sorter * Socionics * Jungian cognitive functions *Personality testing *Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory References External links * Optimas website (in English) Personality tests Jungian tradition ","title":"Jungian Type Index"},{"id":"19094465","text":"Sompote Suwannarangsri (born June 1, 1985 in Lopburi) is a retired sprint athlete who competed internationally for Thailand.

They were built by Hartmann between 1910 and 1927 in Chemnitz. The design of this passenger train locomotive was carried out in parallel with that of the express train classes, the Saxon X H1 and Saxon XII H. A total of 159 examples of this powerful locomotive were built by 1922. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 124 of these engines as the DRG Class 38.2-3 (the others had been lost during the First World War or had to be given away as reparations) and gave them operating numbers 38 201 to 38 324. In 1927, ten more were built. These were given operating numbers 38 325 to 38 334. During the Second World War 15 of the Class XII H2s that had been given to France returned to Germany and were stationed again in the Reichsbahn division of Dresden. From 1938, however, the majority of these locomotives were working out of locomotive depots (Bahnbetriebswerken or Bw) in the Sudetenland. As a result, after the war only about a half the original fleet of these engines was left in Germany. Five of the locomotives returned from France went into the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn where they were allocated operating numbers 38 204 and 38 351 to 38 354. The last ones had been withdrawn by 1971. Even the surviving museum locomotive, number 38 205 is currently not working. This engine is owned by the DB Museum at Nuremberg and has been loaned to the Saxon Railway Museum in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf.

This is followed by globose purple-black berries (not edible). Uses The leaves are a commercial source of pharmaceutically useful alkaloids. The same alkaloids render all plant parts poisonous. The leaves contain a number of alkaloids, including hyoscine (scopolamine), used for treating motion sickness, stomach disorders, and the side effects of cancer therapy. A bush medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia from the soft corkwood tree, or Duboisia myoporoides, was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel on their way to liberate France and defeat Hitler during the Invasion of Normandy. Later, it was found that the same substance could be used in the production of scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used in eye surgery, and a multi-million dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance.

Its Gnome Monosoupape 9N 160 CV rotary engine was mounted in a circular open-front cowling. The strut braced parasol wing was swept back. The spars and ribs of the circular section fuselage were wood, wire-braced and covered in fabric, and faired out with wood stringers. The production aircraft were given service designations based on whether they had 1 gun (designated MoS 27) or 2 guns (designated MoS 29).Donald 1997, p. 659.

Numerous world and American records have been set over the years at the facility by Pablo Morales, Janet Evans, Matt Biondi, Tom Jager, Dara Torres and others.Swimming World Magazine History of the YMCA Aquatic Center Formerly known as the Justus Aquatic Center it opened January 1985 as a business venture combining a hotel with a sporting venue. It was the first aquatic, fitness and hotel complex, of its kind. Financial problems plagued the center from the beginning. In 1988, there was a brief closure of the facility as it was taken in receivership by the Great Western Bank. The facility was renamed the Orlando International Aquatic and Fitness Center. Citing an operating loss of $600,000 a year and the impossibility of running an aquatics facility of that size in the black, the bank closed the center in January 1992.Orlando Sentinel Jan 1992 The center was to be destroyed in order to make a larger parking lot. A local hotelier, Harris Rosen, fought the closure, by forming an organization called Friends of the Aquatic Center with several aquatics activists such as Dr. Lucky Meisenheimer, Scott Henderson, Julie Sundstrom and others. A six-month community battle ensued in the attempt to reopen the center. Rallies and protest marches were held and congressional representatives Jim Bacchus and Bill McCollum became involved.Williamsburg News June 1992 Ultimately a deal between the county commission and the bank was arranged, in exchange for zoning changes that increased hotel room density at the site, the bank separated the Aquatic Center from the hotel and donated the facility to the county. Not wanting to manage the facility, the county offered the center to the Central Florida YMCA. Jerry Haralson the CEO of the Central Florida YMCAs agreed to add the Aquatic Center to the Central Florida YMCA community. \\"A Brief History of the YMCA Aquatic Center\\". YMCA Aquatic Center. In June 1992, the facility reopened as the YMCA Aquatic Center.Orlando Sentinel June 1992 Charlie Stuart became the first chairman of the YMCA Aquatic Center‚Äôs Board of Directors and Richard Robinson was named the first executive Director. In 1994 Jim Ferber the CEO of the Central Florida YMCA arranged a partnership with Florida Hospital Orlando that resulted in the addition of a physical therapy and rehabilitation center to the YMCA Aquatic Center. The remodeling project was completed under the guidance of Jim Purdy the then executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center. In the mid 1990s, John Vasbinder took over as the executive director of the YMCA Aquatic Center and for the first time the center began to run in the black. A $250,000 grant from Orange County resulted in further improvements to the center. In 2006, the YMCA announced the promotion of Vasbinder to a regional position, and began the search for a suitable replacement for him. Steve Corrie was named as his successor in 2006. Corrie was Executive Director from 2006-2013. By the mid 2000s, the facility was seriously outdated and rundown. In 2007 Corrie's first major move was to fund raise and add a new $150,000 video scoreboard. This created a real buzz in the aquatics community. Building on this positive atmosphere, in 2009 Corrie led a successful multi-million dollar capital campaign that provided a comprehensive face-lift for the facility. These upgrades allowed the Aquatic Center to move back into the national swim meet scene. During his tenure, Corrie re-branded the facility in the swimming world as 'The Big House'. The name has stuck since then. This return to the national stage culminated in the Aquatic Center hosting the 2013 USA Swimming Grand Prix event. The YMCA Aquatic Center currently houses a number of competitive athletic teams in swimming, water polo, and diving. One of those programs is YCF Diving who, in 2012, had 2 Olympic Trials qualifiers (Justin Dumais & Wallace Layland) and 1 Olympian (Brittany Viola).Orlando Sentinel August 2012. The YCF Water Polo program was named the 2012 Southeast Club of the year. Special Olympic/Dr P Phillips High School Coach and YMCA volunteer, Apryle Nickson was named the 2012 North America Special Olympic Coach of the Year. In June 2020, severely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, the YMCA of Central Florida announced that it is no longer offering competitive aquatics, and the YMCA is giving up the Aquatic Center. Local volunteers are once again in discussion with both the county and the YMCA to keep the fastest pool in the south alive. For now, the Big House sits dark, waiting for its next chapter to unfold.

Tourism is a major industry in the area; a small year-round population is supplemented by an influx seasonal residents each Summer. It is the location of the SUNY-ESF Ranger School. History The town was founded in 1902 by cousins Herbert and Horace Rich, founders of the Rich Brothers Lumber Company. Rich Lumber purchased on the southwestern shore of Cranberry Lake, and constructed several mills to work the lumber. Housing for the millworkers was built in part from lumber salvaged from the company's abandoned Pennsylvania lumber operation with many of these homes still in existence. At the height of lumbering & milling activities in Wanakena (1902-1912) there were up to 1500 workers at the Rich Brothers mill and associated industries. Prior to leaving the deforested area, Rich Lumber Company donated land to Syracuse University to start the first school in the nation to educate forest rangers and to encourage sustainable forestry practices with the first school built in 1912. The Environmental School of Forestry is now part of SUNY and is the oldest Ranger School / School of Forestry in the country. A logging railroad was constructed connecting Wanakena to the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad at Benson Mines, starting operation in 1905. After the lumber industry left the area, the rails were dismantled because of a significant decrease in people traveling to and from Wanakena. A suspension footbridge built over the Oswegatchie River before 1903 connected the hamlet and the mills for company workers and was one of the longest suspension foot bridges in the United State. The footbridge had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places prior to being destroyed by an ice jam on January 14, 2014. Community efforts began immediately to rebuild the bridge with over $130,000 raised as of May 2016. Several grants and donations by local Foundations were used with the donated money for a matching grant from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Places. Reconstruction of the bridge was completed in November 2016. The Wanakena Presbyterian Church is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wanakena Historical Association developed a historical walking tour (2002) that includes two kiosks and six picture stations that display historical pictures and narratives on the history of the hamlet, logging, milling, railroad, and tourism. The walking tour is visited annually by schools, bus tours and tourists. The walking tour is free and open to the public from May 30 to at least Labor Day. Today there still is a vibrant community in this little pioneer village on the Oswegatchie River. In addition to the SUNY ESF school, The church has weekly services during the summer (9:15am), post-office, a store and art gallery called Otto's Abode, the Otto J Hamele Historic Walking Tour, gazebo where weekly summer concerts are held, and Black Waters Cafe and Trading Post.

Early life Chapel was born in Lyon, the son of Ma√Ætre d' Charles and his wife Eva. At the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to the village of Mionnay 12 miles outside the city, where his father opened a bistro called La Mere Charles in an old coaching inn surrounded by lush gardens. There Alain Chapel received his first training. Career Former restaurant of Alain Chapel in Mionnay Alain Chapel eventually returned to the family bistro which was then upgraded to a restaurant. In 1967 it was awarded its first Michelin star. After taking over the restaurant in 1970 on the death of his father, he converted the inn to a hotel and renamed it in his own name. In 1973, Chapel gained his third Michelin star, then one of only 19 restaurants all in France which had ever then gained the honour. Chapel's signature dishes included stuffed calves' ears with fried parsley, truffle-stuffed chicken tightly enveloped in a pork bladder and cooked in a rich chicken broth. Food critic Craig Claiborne writing for The New York Times in 1977 described Chapel's gateau de foies blonds as \\"his ultimate triumph\\" and \\"one of the absolute cooking glories of this generation\\". According to the Gault Millau Guide to France: \\"A meal at Chapel's restaurant was like a symphony.\\" Throughout the rest of his life, the establishment retained all three of its Michelin stars. The speed of transformation and the elaborate cuisine turned the village of Mionnay into a culinary landmark on any serious gastronomic tour of France. The attraction was also as great for young chefs, who sought the opportunity to work with Chapel ‚Äì these included Michel Roux Jr. Death and succession Grave of Alain Chapel Chapel died of a stroke in 1990, leaving his wife Suzanne, and two sons, David and Romain. Under chef Philippe Jousse, and then Chapel's son Romain, the restaurant maintained two Michelin stars until closing in 2012. He is buried in Croix-Rousse cemetery in Lyon.

AFN is governed by a 37-member board, which is elected by its membership at the annual convention held each October. The mission of AFN is to enhance and promote the cultural, economic and political voice of the entire Alaska native community.\\"About AFN\\". Alaska Federation of Natives. Accessed on May 7, 2016. History The Alaska Federation of Natives was formed in October 1966, when Emil Notti called the gathering of 400 Alaska Natives representing 17 Native organizations gathered for a three-day conference to address Alaska Native aboriginal land rights. The 1968 discovery of oil prompted Native leaders to push for a land claims settlement with unprecedented urgency. It was officially incorporated on January 8, 1970.\\"Alaska Federation of Natives, Inc.\\" Corporations, Business & Professional Licensing Division. Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. Accessed on May 7, 2016. From 1966 to 1971, AFN worked primarily to achieve passage of a just and fair land settlement. On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law. In the early- and mid-1970s, AFN provided technical assistance to help Alaska Natives implement ANCSA and set up the corporations mandated by the Act. Since then, AFN has evolved to meet the changing needs of Alaska Natives and respond to new challenges as they emerge, working to address and protect Native interests at the state and federal levels. AFN was instrumental in the development and passage of federal laws including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, and the 1987 Amendments to ANCSA (the \\"1991 legislation\\"). At the state level, AFN plays an active role in the legislative process, promoting laws, policies and programs in areas such as health, education, resource development, labor and government. In the late 1980s, AFN turned its attention to social, tribal and economic issues.Arnold, Robert. Alaska Native Land Claims. Anchorage: The Alaska Native Foundation, 1976. Mission Alaska Native people began as members of full sovereign nations and continue to enjoy a unique political relationship with the federal government. We will survive and prosper as distinct ethnic and cultural groups and will participate fully as members of the overall society. The mission of AFN is to enhance and promote the cultural, economic and political voice of the entire Alaska Native community. AFN‚Äôs major goals are to: * Advocate for Alaska Native people, their governments and organizations, with respect to federal, state and local laws; * Foster and encourage preservation of Alaska Native cultures; * Promote understanding of the economic needs of Alaska Natives and encourage development consistent with those needs; * Protect, retain and enhance all lands owned by Alaska Natives and their organizations; and * Promote and advocate for programs and systems which instill pride and confidence in individual Alaska Natives. Annual convention AFN's convention is the largest representative annual gathering in the United States of any Native peoples. Delegates are elected on a population formula of one representative per twenty-five Native residents in the area and delegate participation rates at the annual convention typically exceed 95%. 3,000 to 4,000 people attend each year, including 1,000 voting delegates from across the state \\"Options to follow Alaska Federation of Natives convention \\".

For over 20 years, Alaska Natives have come together in dance to celebrate Quyana Alaska during AFN‚Äôs Annual Convention. First introduced at the 1982 Convention, Quyana Alaska was designed to restore the traditional dances and ensure that they were passed on to the future generations. To date, over 200 different dance groups have performed at Native gatherings across the state.

It is native to the southeastern United States and as far north as the Great Lakes. It is known as an introduced species in California and Hawaii, where it is weedy.  Invasive species  Andropogon virginicus has also been introduced to Japan and Australia. It competes with other species by allelopathy, releasing persistent herbicidal chemicals from its dying tissues, such as decaying leaves. A. virginicus colonizes disturbed areas such as abandoned mining sites. It is a weed of pastures and grazing ranges, where it proves less palatable and nutritious to cattle than other grasses. This species is tolerant of fire and grows back quickly and more abundantly after a burn. It is perhaps most problematic in Hawaii, where its natural growth patterns are out of synch with the local climate. It is dormant during the Hawaiian rainy season, dying back and leaving the slopes it has colonized exposed and vulnerable to significant erosion. Despite its weediness, the grass is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant. Typical appearance of broomsedge in winter (Stone County, Mississippi, 2010)  Life history  Andropogon virginicus is a perennial grass forming narrow clumps of stems up to just over a meter in maximum height [approx. 3 feet 3 inches]. Its stems and leaves are green when new, turning purplish to orange and then straw-colored with age. It produces large amounts of seeds small enough to disperse on the wind.

He was New York State Engineer and Surveyor from 1884 to 1887. He is credited with constructing the first cantilever arch bridge. Biography He was born on November 20, 1837 in Cheshire, Massachusetts. His family moved to Stephentown, New York in 1842. He graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Union College in 1859, and began work as Deputy Surveyor under Ward B. Burnet, Surveyor General of the Kansas and Nebraska Territories. He soon returned to New York and was employed as Assistant Engineer in various railway companies. From 1864 to 1868, he was at Franklin, Pennsylvania engaged in the engineering development of oil wells and coal mines. In 1869, he removed to Chicago, and became Chief Engineer of the Rock Island and Quincy Railroad, later a part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1871, he became also Consulting Engineer for the Rockford Central Railroad and the Cairo and St. Louis Railroad, and engaged in railway construction with his partner James R. Young. In 1875, he was a member of the Tilden Commission which investigated alleged canal frauds. He was appointed Division Engineer of the Eastern Division of the New York State Canals in 1876. He resigned in 1880, and resumed his railway construction business with his former partner, James R. Young. He was New York State Engineer and Surveyor from 1884 to 1887, elected on the Democratic ticket in 1883 and 1885. Upon retiring from public office, he returned to private practice where, as president of the Hilton Bridge Construction Company, his company landed a State contract to design and construct what would become the Hawk Street Viaduct in Albany. He was also, for a time, president of the Canton Bridge Company. In 1897 he was appointed as receiver for the Lebanon Springs Railroad following the death of William V. V. Reynolds. In 1900, he was President of the Advisory Commission of Engineers, appointed by State Engineer Edward A. Bond to advise in the conduct of surveys for a thousand-ton barge canal. Later he was a member of the New York Water Storage Commission. He died from heart disease at the Fort Orange Club in Albany, New York on January 26, 1903 at age 65. Legacy Of those engineering projects with which Sweet was directly involved, the Hawk Street Viaduct may have had the most lasting and widespread impact. Sweet's novel design, likely the first cantilever arch bridge, was replicated across America and Europe. In the years following its completion, major cantilever arch bridges were erected over the Seine and Viaur in France, the Elbe‚ÄìL√ºbeck Canal at M√∂lln in Germany, and on railways in Alaska and Costa Rica. His principal contribution to engineering science was the determination of the laws that govern the propulsion of vessels in narrow channels, an account of which he published in 1880 in the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers of which organization he was elected a member in 1878.

He is best known for his recordings of \\"I Never See Maggie Alone\\" and \\"Choc'late Ice Cream Cone\\", and was a member of The Down Homers with Bill Haley. Life and career He started in music at the age of 11, when he organized a band consisting entirely of young harmonica players. Later, he learned to play guitar and then bass fiddle and violin. He was inspired by Yodeling Slim Clark (with whom he performed along with the Red River Rangers from Athol, Massachusetts), as well as by Jimmie Rodgers and other singing cowboys and was known as a blue yodeler. Roberts at age 17 won a New Hampshire radio contest to be chosen as \\"Eastern States Yodeling Champion\\" in 1944. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in early 1945, then moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, after World War II ended. He performed on several shows on radio station KMOX in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as the CBS Saturday morning show \\"Barnyard Frolics.\\" then organized and led a Pennsylvania-based western swing band called the Down Homers, recording for Vogue Records. Rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley joined the band in 1946 as a guitarist and yodeler replacing Roberts who had joined the Navy. Before departing, Roberts taught Haley some of his yodels. When Roberts returned from service, he resumed his spot with the Down Homers relieving Haley. In the early 2000s, a set of 1946 radio recordings by the Down Homers were discovered and Haley is named and performs the solo number \\"She Taught Me to Yodel.\\" Roberts signed a recording contract with Coral Records in 1949, a division of Decca. His first release \\"I Never See Maggie Alone\\" was an immediate hit. It sold a million copies. He followed with other hits including \\"River of Tears,\\" \\"I've Got the Blues,\\" \\"Yodel Polka,\\" \\"She Taught Me to Yodel,\\" and \\"Hillbilly Style.\\" He soon began to jump while yodeling and became popular with youngsters thanks to the jumping, yodeling and his cowboy tunes. He starred in a children's TV show in 1953, performing in Cincinnati on WLW-TV. He performed on Arthur Godfrey's CBS network talent program. Roberts played at the Hoosier Hop in Fort Wayne, as well as the WCOP Hayloft Jamboree. He later performed on the Midwestern Hayride during the 1950s from Cincinnati. He became a regional star through television shows in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana. He began a daily cartoon show on WNEM TV-5 in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1961, as \\"The Kenny Roberts Show\\" where he was known as \\"The Yodeling Cowboy\\", or (according to at least one former child guest) \\"The Jumping Cowboy\\". The popular black- and-white show featured Roberts singing and playing guitar as he hosted children in the studio, and presented cartoons. His best known locally performed songs were \\"Cheer Up, (Things Could Be Worse)\\" and the poignant Hank Williams tribute song \\"Sing Me A Hurtin' Song\\" (A/B of a 45 record on Bethlehem Records). The program stayed on the air for about five years. Roberts moved back to Dayton in the early 1970s, and later, moved back to Massachusetts. He played concerts in the region, and released on album for Palomino around 1980, followed by Longhorn's \\"Then and Now,\\" which combined historical cuts with new recordings. Though essentially retired, he continued to give concerts around the Northeast throughout the decade. Roberts died in April 2012 in Athol, Massachusetts, aged 85.

It was built by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) to improve communications between the capital Constantinople and the eastern provinces of his empire. With a remarkable length of 430 m, the bridge was mentioned by several contemporary writers, and has been associated with a supposed project, first proposed by Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan,Pliny 10.41-42, 61-62 to construct a navigable canal that would bypass the Bosporus.  Location and history  The Sangarius Bridge is located in northwestern Anatolia, in the ancient region of Bithynia, ca. 5 km southwest of the town of Adapazarƒ±. Today, the bridge spans the small √áark Deresi stream (called Melas in Antiquity), which flows from the nearby Sapanca Lake; the modern course of the far wider Sakarya lies 3 km to the East. In Antiquity and all the way up to the Middle Ages, the bridge served an important purpose: it was the crossing-point of the strategically important military road from the Bosporus to the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, which were threatened by the Sassanid Empire. Before the stone bridge was constructed, a wooden pontoon bridge existed, which, according to Procopius, was frequently washed away when the river flooded, costing many men their lives.Procopius, De Aedificiis, 5.3.8-11 The date of construction for the stone bridge can be accurately determined from contemporary sources: two laudatory poems of Paul the Silentiary and Agathias, dating to the year 562, celebrate its completion, and the chronicler Theophanes records that the work began in Anno Mundi 6052, which corresponds to 559‚Äì560. Conversely, since Procopius states that the bridge was still under construction when he wrote his work on Justinian's building projects (De Aedificiis), this would mean that it was written in the years 560‚Äì561 and celebrated in 562, five to six years later than earlier presumed. However, given that Theophanes' dating is somewhat inaccurate, it may well be that the bridge's construction had originally started in ca. 554.PLRE, Vol. III, pp. 1064-1065  Construction  The bridge is built of blocks of limestone, and, including the abutments at each end, totals 429 m in length, with a width of 9.85 m and a height of up to 10 m. The bridge rests on seven main arches. The central five arches span ranges from 23 to 24.5 m, with the piers between them ca. 6 m thick. They are complemented on either side by a smaller arch with a span of ca. 20 m. The √áark Deresi stream flows through one of the western arches today. In addition, there are further five arches (two in the western and three in the eastern ends) of between 3 and 9 m on the banks of the river bed, which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. The eastern part of the bridge has been partially destroyed by the construction of a railway line along the river's course. The seven main piers were apparently decorated with small Christian crosses, which, with the exception of two, seem to have been destroyed. In detail, the width of the main architectural elements (spans in bold, piers in parentheses) are, in meters: :3 (N.A.) 7 (9.5) 19.5 (6) 23 (6) 24.5 (6) 24.5 (6) 24 (6) 24.5 (6) 20 (9.5) 9 (N.A.) 6 (N.A.) 3 Sketch of the surviving sections of the bridge, including the now vanished triumphal arch in the western end, and the apse in the eastern end (1838) The piers are shaped so as to act as cutwaters, rounded on the upstream and pointed on the downstream side. The only exception is the broadest pier on the western shore, which is wedge-shaped on both sides. This feature of the Sangarius bridge sets it apart from most known Roman bridges, which usually feature pointed cut- waters upstream, and ‚Äì if existing ‚Äì also downstream. On the western entrance a triumphal arch stood, while on the eastern side there are the remains of an apse, whose function is unclear, but possibly served as a religious shrine.

It is awarded by the Canadian monarch, usually by the Governor General of Canada, to members of the Canadian Forces or allied forces wounded or killed in action, and to members whose death under honourable circumstances is a result of injury or disease related directly to military service. Design The Sacrifice Medal is in the form of a diameter silver disc topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing the Canadian monarch's role as the fount of honour. On the obverse is an effigy of the reigning sovereign and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces wearing a diadem of maple leaves and snowflakes, surrounded by the inscription ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA CANADA (Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada). On the reverse is the word SACRIFICE alongside a depiction of the statue Mother Canada, one of Walter Seymour Allward's allegorical figures adorning the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. The recipient's name, along with his or her rank and service number for those in the military, is inscribed around the medal's edge. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in purposefully sombre red (recalling spilled blood), black (symbolizing grief and loss), and white (representative of both hope and peace). Should an individual already possessing a Sacrifice Medal be awarded the medal again for subsequent injuries, he or she is granted a medal bar‚Äîin silver with raised edges and bearing a maple leaf‚Äîfor wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended. Eligibility On 29 August 2008, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, created the Sacrifice Medal to recognize any member of the Canadian Forces, soldier of an allied force, or a civilian working for the Canadian Forces, who after 7 October 2001 was killed or wounded under honourable circumstances and as a result of hostile action or perceived hostile action. If not fatal, the wound received must be serious enough to require attention from a medic, and the treatment must have been recorded in the individual's medical file. These tenets were later augmented when, on 19 October 2009, the Department of National Defence announced that all service related deaths would qualify for the Sacrifice Medal, whether as a result of direct hostile action or not.

In February 2018, it was announced that Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip Technology was acquiring the company for over US$10 billion, pending regulatory approval. In May 2018, it was announced that Microchip had completed its acquisition of Microsemi. In August 2018, Microchip discovered that Microsemi shipped large orders to distributors on discount before the closing of the acquisition and had a culture of excessive extravagance, casting some doubt on the future prospect of the acquisition.  History   1959 to 1970: Early years  Microsemi was founded in February 1959 in Culver City, California as MicroSemiconductor. It incorporated in Delaware on September 27, 1960. A trade catalog and price lists from this early period can be found at the Smithsonian Institution. In March 1963, A. Feldon represented Microsemiconductor Corp in the Advisory Panel of Suppliers at the IEEE session on \\"Components for Miniaturized Electronic Assemblies\\". According to the Missiles and Rockets magazine, in 1964 \\"Molecular packaging of integrated circuits has been suggested by Microsemiconductor Corp. This would involve the same process the company uses for diodes it supplies to the Improved Minuteman program.\\" Microsemiconductor is cited in 1965 as supplier of miniature silicon diodes that are \\"ideal to use as beam profile detectors or to measure depth-dose distribution of small collimated beams.\\" by University of California's Ernest O. Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. In 1966, two of the company's engineers, E.S. Resnond and M.W. Stillwell, published a Production Engineering Measures Study, on High Voltage Oscillators. As of 1969, Microsemiconductor's address was still 11250 Plaza Court, Culver City, CA 90230. On August 13, 1969, Standard Resources Corporation, from Copiague, New York, a close-end management investment company, filed at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a request to merge with Microsemiconductor. This request disclosed that the major shareholders of Microsemiconductor as of May 31, 1969 were Arthur Feldon (31%), Steve Manning (31%) and Thomas C. Hall (10%). At the end of the proposed merger the company would retain the name Microsemiconductor. At the time, J.M. Kaplan's JemKap Inc owned 37.7% of the outstanding common shares of Standard, which would make him the owner of 18.9% of the surviving company. Standard Resources and Microsemiconductor merged in November 1969.  1971 to 2000: The Philip Frey Jr years  According to the Orange County Business Journal, \\"In 1971, the New York operation was spun off and Philip Frey Jr. was brought on from Teledyne Inc.'s semiconductor division in Hawthorne to head Microsemiconductor. At the time, the company had annual sales of about $500,000, almost entirely to defense industry customers. In 1972, the company moved from Culver City to Santa Ana, California. Microsemi still was almost exclusively a defense business in 1987, but by then sales were close to $50 million. That same year, the company did a $35 million convertible bond offering, the proceeds of which were used to acquire about a dozen companies, most of them struggling \\"bargain\\" buys. When the acquisitions began straining profitability, Frey didn't waste a lot of time admitting his mistake. In 1989, Microsemi began selling them off. Sales, which hit a then- high of $104 million in 1989, fell to $83 million by 1991. But they've grown almost every year since and are expected by analysts to exceed $150 million for the fiscal year just ended. (1996)\\" On July 1, 1982, Jemkap Inc acquired 48.6% of Microsemiconductor Class A Stock., and Microsemisemiconductor acquired the Siemens Components Group in Scottsdale, Arizona. Microsemiconductor renamed itself to Microsemi, in February 1983. On March 9, 1986, Microsemi, at the time a supplier of \\"high-performance semiconductor diodes in a variety of military, industrial and commercial products\\", issued 2.5 million shares of common stock. Up until this time, Jacob M Kaplan of New York owned or controlled 38.4% of the company shares, and was 94 years-old. Microsemi raised $26 million in the stock sale. Jacob Merril Kaplan, who was a philanthropist, died in Manhattan, NY on July 20, 1987. Microsemi was originally traded Over the Counter, commonly traded as MicrSm. On March 1, 1990 Microsemi joined the NASDAQ exchange. On March 1, 1987 Microsemi sold $35M in convertible debentures. Between 1986 and 1990 Microsemi acquired over 60% of the shares of 11 companies. In June 1991 Microsemi created two join- ventures in Taiwan for packaging in Taiwan its component dies made in Santa Ana, California. Microsemi established its presence in Ireland in 1992 through the acquisition of a facility in Ennis Co. Clare. The Ennis facility's key competencies are the development, manufacturing and high reliability testing of semiconductors to meet stringent aerospace, satellite, medical and security standards. In July 1992 Microsemi acquired Unitrode's semiconductor products division. In February 1993 Microsemi's stock crashed 54%, because of a cash crunch. \\"Microsemi has been restructuring for several years as defense budget cuts have slowed its sales. In 1989, the company said it planned to sell or close 10 subsidiaries not related to its core business of manufacturing computer chips for use in electronics equipment ranging from military weapons to heart pacemakers. The company sold four subsidiaries, shut down one, combined two and retained three. The company took $20.5 million in write-offs during the past three years in connection with the restructuring.\\" In April 1994 Microsemi formed a joint venture in China with Shanghai Electrical Apparatus, with 60% of the joint-venture belonging to Microsemi. Linfinity, whose CEO was Jim Peterson, was the first Integrated Circuit company acquired by Microsemi, in 1999.  2000 to 2018: The James J. Peterson years  On November 30, 2000 Microsemi promoted Jim Peterson to president and CEO. Jim Peterson was previously the president of Linfinity. In 2001 Microsemi relocated its headquarters from Santa Ana, California to Irvine, California. Between 2006 and 2011 Microsemi acquired a mix of space/hi-reliability focused companies (MDT, TSI, Babcock, Spectrum Microwave), defense/security focused companies (Endwave, White Electronics, Arxan, Brijot, AML), and also companies focused in discrete and IC power products for commercial applications (Advanced Power Technology, PowerDsine, Nexsem), as well as communications focused companies (PowerDsine, VT Silicon, Zarlink) a programmable logic company (Actel) and an ASIC design house focused on analog mixed-signal (ASIC Advantage). In 2011 Microsemi relocated its headquarters from Irvine, California to Aliso Viejo, California. In August 2012, Microsemi marked its 20 years of operations in Ireland by naming Ennis its European headquarters. It also announced the inaugural Microsemi Scholarship in Engineering at the University of Limerick. In addition, the company funded a high-profile science and aerospace engineering programme in St. Flannan's school in Ennis. Microsemi works closely with the Industrial Development Authority (IDA Ireland), which is responsible for attracting and developing overseas investment in Ireland. Support from IDA Ireland was a key factor in the company's decision to invest in the region. Between 2012 and 2013 Microsemi acquired Timing companies (the timing business of Maxim Integrated Products, Symmetricom) in addition to Zarlink. In November 2013, Jim Peterson promoted Paul Pickle to COO and president, retaining the CEO position, and accumulating the position of Chairman of the Board. In 2014 Microsemi established a design group in Cork, Ireland, through the acquisition of Mingoa, which is focused on advanced system-on-chip (SoC) software and solutions with an emphasis on ARM processor-centric designs. Between 2014 and 2015 Microsemi acquired communications and data-center focused companies (Mingoa, Centellax, Vitesse, PMC-Sierra). In March 2016 Microsemi announced the divestiture of the defense- focused business units acquired between 2009 and 2011. In April 2016 Microsemi announced the divestiture of its Broadband Wireless Division, which was previously part of PMC-Sierra for $21 million. In October 2017 Microsemi announced the acquisition of the timing business of Vectron International from Knowles for $130 million. In March 2018, Microsemi's PolarFire FPGA was named \\"2017 Product of the Year\\" by Electronic Products China and 21ic.com. In March 2018 Microchip Technology announced it would acquire Microsemi for approximately $10 billion.  Products  Microsemi has been producing various electronic products, including high-performance and radiation-hardened analog mixed-signal integrated circuits, FPGAs, SoCs and ASICs; power management products; timing and synchronization devices and precise time solutions, voice processing devices; RF solutions; discrete components; enterprise storage and communication solutions, security technologies and scalable anti-tamper products; Ethernet solutions; Power-over-Ethernet ICs. Microsemi has provided semiconductor solutions for numerous U.S. space programs dating back to the launch of the first Atlas rocket. Several of Microsemi's space products were used in the historic landing of the Mars Curiosity Rover in 2012.http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Microsemi_Space_Solutions_On_Board_Historic_Mars_Rover_Mission_999.html Microsemi products were also used for mission critical applications such as launch systems, avionics, telemetry, navigation, drive control, mission computers, cameras and other instruments. ;FPGAs and SoCs * Flash-based FPGAs and SoCs from 5K to 150KLUTs * Space-grade FPGAs * Space-grade Analog Front end for FPGAs ;Storage *RAID Controllers and Adaptec SAS/SATA host adaptors *HBA Controllers and Adaptec SAS/SATA host adaptors *SAS/SATA Switches and Adaptec Expanders *Flashtec NVMe Controllers *Flashtec NVMRAM Drives *Switchtec PCIe switches ;Ethernet and Network processors *Ethernet Switches *Ethernet PHYs *Ethernet Software *Winpath Network Processors ;Optical Products *Optical Transport Network (OTN) products *Optical Line Drivers ;Power over Ethernet *PoE Injectors *PoE Switches *PoE PSE ICs *PoE PD ICs ;Audio and Voice *Timberwolf Audio processors *SLIC ;Timing & Synchronization *Time servers *Atomic clocks *Rugged Oscillators *PLL *Frequency synthesizers *Precision Time Protocol Grand Masters and Software ;Power Management *Switching and Linear Voltage regulator *Electronic Fuses *Ideal Solar Bypass Devices *Space-grade Power supply ;Power Discretes and Modules *SiC Diodes, MOSFETs and power modules *IGBTs *BJTs, Diodes and JFETs ;RF Transceivers *Ultra Low Power Wearable Radio *Implantable Radio ;WLAN RF Front End *Power Amplifiers *LNAs *FEMs ;RF/Microwave Discretes *MMICs *PIN diodes *Varactors *Gunn diodes * Gallium nitride transistors ;Circuit Protection * Transient- voltage-suppression diodes * Medical Surge Protection  Acquisitions   1980s acquisitions  *2H 1982: Siemens Components Group (Scottsdale, Arizona) *July 1986: Bikor, divested in July 1993 *July 1986: RPM Enterprises *June 1987: Solitron's Rectifier Assembly Unit *July 1987: Hybrid Components Inc *August 1987: Diodes Incorporated (20%), divested in January 1990 *September 1987: Vitarel (60%) *August 1987: Omni Technology, divested in December 1993 to Technology Marketing *September 1987: Salem Scientific (a.k.a.

An independent inquiry was made on behalf of the board by the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, which confirmed that in fact Peterson had not earned either degree. As a penalty for misrepresenting his academic credentials, Peterson paid Microsemi a fine and forwent his 2008 bonus.

The underside of the wings is mostly yellow with a black eyespot on the forewing and two white spots on the hindwing. Ecology This butterfly can be found in short- grass prairie hills, open woodlands, and near road edges. Both male and female southern dogfaces may be seen feeding at flowers such as alfalfa, Coreopsis species, Houstonia species, and Verbena species. Males are also fond of puddling. Its host plants include the leadplant Amorpha canescens, false indigo Amorpha fruticosa, soybean Glycine max, alfalfa Medicago sativa, black dalea Dalea frutescens, purple prairie clover Dalea purpurea, and clover Trifolium species. Males patrol areas for females. The male is the active flight partner. The green-white eggs are laid on the underside of the host plant leaves. The larva is green with a white stripe running down each side of its body. The green chrysalis hangs upright with a silken girdle around itself.

It operates eleven stores in Italy, including two flagship stores in Rome and one in Milan.  Origin  In 1865, brothers Luigi and Ferdinando Bocconi opened in Via Santa Radegonda, Milan the first shop in Italy that sold ready-to-wear clothing and by the following year they employed over a hundred workers to manufacture ready-to-wear suits for men. Between 1872 and 1876, they set up branches in Via del Corso in Rome as well as in Genoa, Trieste, Palermo and Turin. In 1877 they opened the department store Aux Villes d'Italie (\\"To the Cities of Italy\\") at the Hotel Comfortable. This was the first of its kind in Italy and conceived following the model of Aristide Boucicaut's store Le Bon March√© in Paris that √âmile Zola made famous in his 1883-novel Au Bonheur des Dames. In 1880, the store took the Italianized name Alle citt√† d'Italia and in 1887 a new store designed by Giulio De Angelis opened in Rome in Piazza Colonna while in 1889 the new building of Piazza Duomo in Milan designed by Giovanni Giachi opened its doors.  The company owned by Senator Borletti and the upturn of the 1920s  In 1917, Senator Borletti purchased the company from the Bocconi Brothers and commissioned poet Gabriele D'Annunzio to find a new name. His suggestion was Rinascente, a name to convey the idea of 'rebirth' of the store. which was officially registered on 27 September 1917. Borletti's objective was to turn elegance into the distinctive character of the department store by immediately committing himself to increasing the quality of the merchandise yet without excessively raising prices. The official goal was a \\"democratic\\" approach to luxury that would attract customers of both the high and middle-low income classes. Just a few days before the grand opening, on Christmas night of 1918 fire destroyed the store in Milan in Piazza Duomo. Between 1919 and 1920 the stores in Turin, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples and Palermo were revamped. Over the years, other stores opened: Padua (1923), Catania (1923), Messina (1924), Bari (1925), Piazza Loreto in Milan, Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome, Taranto, Syracuse and Trapani (all between 1927 and 1928). The store in Piazza Duomo reopened on 23 March 1921 after it had been completely rebuilt, enlarged, transformed and expanded to include a variety of additional services such as a bank, a hair salon for women and men, a tearoom with an orchestra and a post office. The well-known poster created by Aldo Mazza for the reopening of the store, depicted a burnt trunk of an olive tree from with new green sprouting branches was a symbolic reference to the concept of rising from the ashes. Majority stakeholder Senator Borletti entrusted daily operation of the company to the hands of Umberto Brustio, his son-in-law. During these years Rinascente established and strengthened its business relationship with Marcello Dudovich. The Trieste-born artist would go on to create advertising posters for the company until 1956.  The 1930s  In 1928, after collaborating with the German-based company Leonhard Tietz to introduce a store with fixed pricing in Italy, la Rinascente merged with UPIM to create a new company. This new enterprise had a new partner, namely the department store Jelmoli in Zurich, and consisted of 5 Rinascente and 25 UPIM stores around Italy. In 1937, the Piazza Colonna store in Rome installed the first escalator in a retail outlet in Italy. These were the years in which many Made in Italy products were launched and soon became popular all around. Prominence was given to synthetic fabrics such as rayon, cafioc (artificial hemp) and artificial wool, which all took centre stage. At this time Rinascente launched campaigns to promote products manufactured by Italian companies and created strong ties through its distribution network with consumers thus catering for the needs of the general public. After Senator Borletti's death of in 1939, Umberto Brustio was appointed president of the company. In 1941, the National Clothing Association declared la Rinascente as leader in the retail market since its sales area in square metres was double that of Standa and Coin put together. The following year the company celebrated its 25th anniversary and counted 5 Rinascente and 52 UPIM stores.  The World War II years  The company suffered great losses during World War II. The stores in Genoa and Cagliari were completely destroyed. On 16 August, the store in Piazza Duomo was practically razed to the ground; only one Rinascente store in Rome and 37 UPIM stores around Italy were still partially operational. The City Council of Milan allowed la Rinascente to rent three large rooms in the Palazzo della Ragione in Via Mercanti so that it could keep supplying the general public with goods.  The post war recovery and the splendour of the 1950s  After the war there was a rapid and vigorous recovery. Between 1945 and 1946 a rebuilding project included 19 UPIM stores, la Rinascente in Cagliari, the Head Office in Via Carducci, Milan as well as the warehousing facilities. On 4 December 1950, the Rinascente store in Piazza Duomo opened its doors once again in great style. The fa√ßade of the building had been designed by Ferdinando Reggiori. Carlo Pagani was responsible for designing the store windows, entrances as well as the interior design and furnishings. Modern escalators connected the different floors of the building. Max Huber created the new logo while Albe Steiner was in charge of external and internal promotional fixtures and graphics until 1955. These were years of great turmoil and during this time Rinascente sold a great many innovative products imported mainly from the US and promoted a series of cultural events, which gave the public a glimpse of what was happening around the world. Countries featuring in these dedicated events included Spain (1955), Japan (1956), Great Britain (1957), the USA (1958) India and Thailand (1959), Mexico (1960) and a special event to promote the culture of the Indios in 1964. 1955 saw the inauguration of the new 'Circolo della Rinascente' located in Via Durini, Milan and the setting up of a PR office; while an office for market research was created in 1957. Lora Lamm was in charge of advertising graphics while Amneris Latis was the Art Director of the advertising department. In 1957, after 40 years, Umberto Brustio left his top management position and was nominated Honorary President. Aldo Borletti, Senator Borletti's son, was elected President and together with Cesare and Giorgio Bustio he also acted as Managing Director. One of the leading figures within top management was Cesare Bustio, Managing Director and Vice President. The 'Compasso d‚ÄôOro' award In 1954, Rinascente established the 'Compasso d‚ÄôOro' award, the brainchild of Gio Ponti and Alberto Rosselli. This prize was awarded for the best industrial production and for those designers that in creating everyday objects knew how to combine aesthetics with functionality. Albe Steiner, who got the idea from one of his own work instruments, created the logo of the award while it was left to Alberto Rosselli and Marco Zanuso to design the actual compass given as prize. In 1959, Rinascente gave control of the award to the Association for Industrial Design (ADI) that had been founded in 1956.  1960s Growth  In 1960, in addition to Rinascente-UPIM stores, the company expanded its operations by creating the Sma supermarkets chain. These stores followed the model of the first Italian supermarket, which opened in Milan in Viale Regina Giovanna on 27 November 1957. This was an example of more modern and advanced distribution and retailing of foodstuffs and groceries. It was the year of the economic boom and during the Christmas period there was such a great influx of customers that the Rinascente store in Milan was at times forced to block the entrances owing to overcrowding. Also in that year, Rinascente opened a new store designed by Franco Albini and Franca Helgin in Piazza Fiume, Rome. It extended over 7 floors linked by lifts, escalators and the famous spiral staircase designed by Albini. It held 50 sales departments displaying all the themes and ranges that so characterised the Milan branch. In this way, Rinascente became the most complete shopping destination in Rome. In 1963, noted French fashion designer Pierre Cardin signed a contract with la Rinascente to create a line of moderately priced garments, declaring that the latest fashion pieces should be accessible to all, democratic and in step with the times. Adriana Botti Monti became the Art Director of the Advertising department. Numerous prizes and professional awards marked her career.  1969: acquisition by FIAT Group  In 1967, after Aldo Borletti's death, the newly appointed president of the group was Senator Borletti (the son of one of the founder's brothers) and Cesare Brustio was the CEO. In 1969, the Borletti family sold its shareholdings to IFI and Mediobanca which held shares since 1965 when Jelmoli left the company. In 1970, the Ambassador Guido Colonna di Paliano was appointed president of the company. The group now owned 5 Rinascente stores, 150 UPIM stores and 54 Sma supermarkets. In 1972 Rinascente ‚Äì Citt√† Mercato opened in Brescia as the first hypermarket selling at bargain prices. The aim of the new company's management was to overcome the contrast between the large retail sector and traditional retail. The retail outlet in Piazza Duomo was refurbished and the new organisation of Rinascente became more rational and in line with the times. In 1973, the company opened a new store in Turin. Umberto Brustio died on 25 April 1972 and Senator Borletti became Vice President on 23 March 1973. In 1977, the group acquired one of the largest American retailers: JC Penney with 4 stores in the Lombardy. Rinascente pushed for a bigger market share, sustained by all the experience in its retail network as well as a modern and successful business organisation. The result was a 20.7% increase in sales in the first semester. In 1983 the group opened the first Italian Bricocenter, a DIY store, in Turin. Two years later the negotiations were successfully concluded for the purchase of Croff Nuova SpA, a company specialising in the distribution of homeware. In 1997 Fiat Estates stipulated a financial and technical agreement with Auchan, resulting in the gradual conversion of the 23 'Citt√† Mercato' and the 2 'Joyland' to the Auchan brand. The group closed with an increase in turnover and developed new strategies to reach the objective of strengthening the food sector by opening 40 hypermarkets by 2002.  Sale to Associated Investors Group  Following the split of the Group in 2005, the department stores of Rinascente were taken over by a group of investors (20% Pirelli Real Estate, 46% Associated Investors, 30% Deutsche Bank Real Estate, 4% Borletti family) and La Rinascente S.p.A. was set up. Vittorio Radice was at the helm of the management team. This signaled the beginning of an important period of change: the aim being to reposition the brand upmarket thus increasing its value. This was achieved by means of restructuring and updating all stores and upgrading the type of products available The complete renovation of the store in Piazza Duomo included the addition of an extremely cosmopolitan Food Hall in 2007 and in 2009 the Design Supermarket taking up a whole floor with over 200 brands on display. Acquisition by Central Retail Group In May 2011 the Thailand- based Central Retail Corporation, purchased Rinascente for ‚Ç¨290 million. Sudhitham Chirathivat became president with Tos Chirathivat as director of Rinascente. During a press conference Tos Chirathivat announced that he wanted to make the brand Rinascente famous at a global level and well‚Äìknown all over Asia. The following year Alberto Baldan, General Manager since 2007, was appointed CEO. Vittorio Radice took on the role of Vice President charged with the international development of the luxury stores within the group. In 2013, Central Group purchased department store ILLUM in Copenhagen and in 2015 it reached an agreement with Sigma for the acquisition of the majority shareholding of the KaDeWe Group thus acquiring the KaDeWe store in Berlin, Oberpollinger in Munich and Alsterhaus in Hamburg. On 26 May 2016 Rinascente Milan received the award as best department store in the world during the ceremony in Zurich of the Global Department Store Summit 2016.  In 2017 Pierluigi Cocchini, Sales Director since 2008, appointed CEO.  LR100 stories of Innovation ‚Äì an exhibition that celebrated 100 years of the brand Rinascente In 2017 la Rinascente set up an exhibition at Plazzo Reale in Milan to mark 100 years of the name invented by Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio. Design, fashion, art and communication played the star roles in an itinerary that showed how Rinascente created ever-new archetypes of tastes and trends and encouraged the introduction of new production methods for both the fashion and design industries.  New Logo  In September 2017 Rinascente revealed its new logo, all in upper case and without the definite article 'la'. Graphics are by North Design, the British studio specialized in visual identity and the image is fresh and contemporary as befits the Rinascente Collection of stores.  A second flagship store in Rome  In October 2017, Rinascente opened a second Rome flagship store to its base. This new store occupies a refurbished 8-storey building in Via del Tritone, Rome. The most extraordinary feature is the archaeological site that can be visited on floor ‚àí1. The site brings to light the remains of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct dating back to 19 BC. The store also incorporates a small building dating back to the 1900s called the 'Palazzetto'. The Food Hall, found on the top floor, gives visitors the chance to admire fantastic 360-degree views over the rooftops of the capital. Originally scheduled to open in 2012, but was delayed several times. The store was in development and construction for 11 years and cost a total of ‚Ç¨200 million.

Their aim was to push the vote on a cap- and-trade proposal that would dramatically lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to combat climate change to voters instead of being instituted by lawmakers. The Senate holds 30 seats, but 1 is vacant due to a death. Without the Republican senators, the remaining 18 Democratic state senators could not reach a quorum of 20 to hold a vote. Although several Republican state senators returned to the Senate chamber on June 29, 2019, leading to the cap- and-trade bill being sent back to committee, while other bills were passed, Girod was missing, and it was stated that he would not return for the month's legislative session.

Description Length up to 12.5 cm, dark gray to black, but centers of scales on body are whitish. Habitat Associated with coral reefs, most usually in shallow, protected waters. swim in shallow water surface to 20 feet below in small openings. Distribution The species is found around the Hawaiian Islands and Johnston Island. 300px Behavior Dascyllus albisella are a relatively passive species. Normally, males are the more aggressive of the two genders as they are the ones that usually exhibit parental care. While male aggressiveness is expected, males exhibit sole care of the offspring unlike most animals. This is due to the uniparental nature of Dascyllus albisella. This does not indicate that the females are not present whatsoever. Nor does this show that the females only have a duty to lay the eggs. In cases where the male is not present, females may develop more aggressiveness depending on the situation. As we can see, females do not desert the nest after mating. Females that are larger are more likely to defend the nest in the absence of the male than smaller females. That being said, the nest is defended most frequently by females that were born at that nest. This does not apply to all the females. Some females, even when raised at the nest will not defend the nest regardless. This increased aggressiveness is more favored towards the larger females, however the correlation isn't terribly strong between size and nest defense. There is only a tendency for larger fish to defend. In another case when both parents are present, the female will display increased aggressiveness when predation levels increase. Females have a tendency to only display aggressiveness when said female's eggs are in danger. Dascyllus albisella displays aggression by making chirping sounds. There is a difference in the chirping that Dascyllus albisella utilizes towards their own versus other organisms. Females tend to produce aggressive sounds when a male is chased by other female fish. Towards their own species, they make a popping sound that is composed of multiple pulses. In addition, they make these aggressive sounds when chasing juveniles. Towards other species, Dascyllus albisella will make a one and two pulse. The fact that they make different aggressive sounds towards other species shows that they are capable of distinguishing themselves from one another Dascyllus albisella are also known to hold territories. A territory holder will interact aggressively only when other fish attempt to enter its domain. A territory holder will tolerate most of the fish entering its territory. However, a few fish will be chased away immediately. This behavior is possibly due to those chased away were of similar size to the territory holder and threatened its control on its own territory Dascyllus albisella interact with each other at an early age as well. The younger fish are referred to as juveniles. In these juvenile interactions we see that Dascyllus albisella form a size based linear dominance. As one can expect, the aggressive scuffles are between larger fish and smaller fish. This behavior most likely establishes the hierarchy early on. This is further reinforced by the observation that growth is less in lower status fish or in larger groups. For larger groups this is most likely that the fish in the group are keeping each other smaller due to the hierarchy, as a result, they retard their growth. We see that these fish will settle in a group during settling season and said fish will stay in their group even if they chance upon a better group, which shows that Dascyllus albisella aren't that aggressive in their choice of group.

Wellington The Linked Ring (also known as \\"The Brotherhood of the Linked Ring\\") was a British photographic society created to propose and defend that photography was just as much an art as it was a science, motivated to propelling photography further into the fine art world. Members dedicated to the craft looked for new techniques that would cause the less knowledgeable to steer away, persuading photographers and enthusiasts to experiment with chemical processes, printing techniques and new styles. Motivation to create the Linked Ring Photography was interpreted in two ways: art photography and science photography.Storck, Jeane. \\"Band of Outsiders, Williamsburg Renegade Artists\\". Billburg. Web The science of photography requires practice that determines the outcome of the image, whereas the art aspect of photography concerns itself with the aesthetic experience and success of the photograph to the viewer.Lind, John A. Science of Photography. 1998. Web These differences created a tension in the craft that the Linked Ring sought to change. The group was founded in May 1892 by Henry Peach Robinson, former Photographic Society member George Davison, and Henry Van der Weyde. The Brotherhood was \\"a means of bringing together those who are interested in the development of the highest form of Art of which Photography is capable.\\"Robert Leggat: The Linked Ring Membership of the group was by invitation only; other members included James Craig Annan, Walter Benington, Arthur Burchett, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick H. Evans, Alfred Horsley Hinton, Frederick Hollyer, Richard Keene, Paul Martin, Alfred Maskell, Lydell Sawyer (aka Lyd Sawyer), William Smedley- Aston, Frank Sutcliffe, J. B. B.

The Linked Ring. William Heinemann Ltd. London 1979. In 1896 they began publishing The Linked Ring Papers, which were circulated annually to members until 1909 to promote and discuss the aesthetics and practice of pictorialism.  Photo-Secessionthe American counterpart of the Linked Ring  The Photo-Secession was founded by photographer Alfred Stieglitz in 1902. Stieglitz wanted to show that photography had artistic expression similar to that of painting and sculpture, emphasizing further the craftsmanship abilities of photographers. Photo- Secession members were also called American Links, and displayed works in the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at Fifth Avenue, New York City. Members include Mary Devens, Frank Eugene, Gertrude K√§sebier, William B. Dyer, Eva Watson-Sch√ºtze, Edward Steichen, Edmund Stirling, and Clarence H. White. Prominent members and contributions Pictorialist James Craig Annan was born into a household at the forefront of photography technology. In 1866 his father created a four-foot print of an eleven-foot painting with the new process of carbon printing. This became Annan‚Äôs primary influence to become a skilled photographer himself. At a young age, he learned the process of photogravure in Vienna on a trip with his father. This process allowed Annan to work like an etchersharpening, shading, or blurring areas of the picture, describing this process as \\"a long drawn out pleasure\\".Buchanan, William. J.

Its oldest parts having been built in 1775‚Äì1776, it is significant as the oldest surviving meeting house in Philadelphia. Located at the corner of Unity and Waln Streets, it is now used also as a community center.Article from Workshop of the World, by Barbara M. Auwarter and Joyce Halley, (Oliver Evans Press, 1990) The Friends meeting The Quaker meeting here was known from its establishment by the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting in 1683 as \\"Tacony\\" (after a nearby creek), then as \\"Oxford\\" (after the township in which it lay), then as \\"Frankford\\", then as \\"Unity\\" (to distinguish it from another Frankford meeting nearby on Orthodox Street). It is affiliated with the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. The historic building The original portion of the Frankford Preparative Friends Meeting House was built in 1775‚Äì76, making it the oldest Friends meeting house in Philadelphia. Although meeting houses were constructed in the region as early as the city's founding in the 1680s, most were replaced by the nineteenth century. Frankford Meeting House was originally erected as a single-cell, three-by-two-bay structure. In 1811‚Äì12, a smaller two-bay-wide section was added to accommodate the growing meeting. The addition also adapted the structure to a programmatic change that occurred among the Quakers during the late eighteenth century. Evidence indicates that a partition located to the east of the central doorway once divided the original single cell into two apartments. The smaller size of the eastern women's apartment reflected the English program whereby Friends met in a single room for worship, and then in separate apartments for gender-specific business meetings. By the late eighteenth century, American Friends began meeting on separate sides of a partition for worship and business, with the partition lowered for the latter. The new arrangement required two same-sized apartments and led to the development of the two-cell structure that became a standard for Friends meeting house design for nearly a century. Frankford's 1811‚Äì12 addition made the meeting house conform to the newer program by creating same-sized rooms, reflecting a critical point in the evolution of meeting house design. It is one of the few surviving examples of a single-cell form altered to accommodate separate space for women's meetings. Frankford Meeting House is also of interest for its unusual mix of building materials. A refined treatment of Flemish-bond brick with glazed headers was used in constructing the facades facing the street. The use of locally quarried rubble stone gives a more vernacular appearance to the two remaining facades, including the south front. The utilization of both brick and stone was probably a function of economy. Materials from the previous meeting house were reused, minimizing the need for additional (more costly) brick, a practice indicative of Quaker thrift.

A complaint alleged that Palin dismissed Wonegan because he did not fire Alaskan State Trooper Mike Wooten, who was in a bitter divorce with Palin's sister, Molly McCann. On October 10, 2008, the twelve- member bipartisan Alaska Legislative Council hired investigator Stephen Branchflower to investigate whether Palin had dismissed Monegan for not firing Wooten.

No action was ever taken. Origin of the conflict Walt Monegan, 2007 Sarah Palin, who in late August became the Republican vice presidential nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election, said that she reassigned commissioner Walt Monegan because of performance-related issues. Monegan said that his forced resignation may have been tied to his reluctance to fire Mike Wooten, an Alaska State Trooper who is also Palin's ex-brother-in-law. Monegan said that the Governor herself, her husband, and members of her staff as well as the state's Attorney General, had contacted him numerous times regarding Wooten. At the time Palin dismissed Monegan, Wooten was involved in a custody battle with his former wife, Molly McCann, Palin's sister. Palin denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. In mid- August, Palin acknowledged that \\"pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it.\\" She also apologized to Alaskans for what she called \\"this distraction.\\"\\"Raw feed: Palin (Updated)\\" , Anchorage Daily News (2008-08-13). Before Palin became governor, she and other members of her family had made various allegations of misconduct against Wooten. An internal investigation upheld some charges and rejected others. On March 1, 2006 the chief of the Alaska state police issued a letter of reprimand to Wooten, and he served a five-day suspension as penalty. After Palin became governor in December 2006, she, her husband Todd Palin, and various aides had further contacts with Monegan about Wooten. Monegan told both Sarah Palin and Todd Palin that the disciplinary proceeding against Wooten was concluded and could not be reopened. Palin was investigated by an independent investigator, hired by a unanimous vote of a bipartisan committee of the Alaska Legislature, \\"to investigate the circumstances ... surrounding [Monegan's termination], and potential abuses of power and/or improper actions by members of the executive branch.\\" Palin denied any wrongdoing. Democratic state Senator Hollis French, who is overseeing the investigation, stated the report will \\"likely be damaging\\" to the Palin administration, and may be an October surprise.Isikoff, Michael and Hosenball, Mark. \\"Team McCain and the Trooper\\", Newsweek (2008-09-05). Also see Ross, Brian and Tepper, Len. \\"'October Surprise' Over Palin Investigation?\\" ABC News (2008-09-02): \\"'It's likely to be damaging to the Governor's administration,' said Senator Hollis French, a Democrat ... 'She has a credibility problem,' he said ... 'Now they may have to deal with an October surprise,' he said...\\" In response to those remarks by French, Republican state Senator John Coghill pushed an unsuccessful effort to have French removed from managing the investigation. Todd Palin did not honor a September 2008 subpoena to appear in court to testify about his role in Troopergate. Two other key witnesses also failed to appear, and all three were originally referred to the full Alaska Senate for contempt. These contempt charges were not addressed until the state legislature met in January 2009, when the legislature had several options including physically bringing the witnesses in, imposing jail time, and levying fines. With the refusals to testify, Senator Hollis French, the Democrat chosen to oversee the charges, moved forward with the investigation. Palin's attorney general announced on October 5, 2008, that seven state employees would honor subpoenas to testify in the legislative investigation of the Troopergate affair. On October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without endorsing, the Branchflower investigative report which found that Sarah Palin \\"abused her power as governor [in] attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired.\\"Branchflower Report, page 65-67 State Trooper Mike Wooten Background In 1999, Sarah Palin's sister Molly McCann and Mike Wooten began dating. In 2000, Palin wrote a character reference for Wooten. In 2001, Wooten became an Alaska State Trooper. Also in 2001, McCann and Wooten got married. In January 2005, they were separated. Divorce filing and police complaint On April 11, 2005, McCann filed for divorce from Wooten. That day a judge granted a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) against Wooten. The same day, McCann's father Chuck Heath phoned police to inform them about the DVPO. Also that day, police spoke with McCann. She said Wooten had threatened to shoot her father if he hired an attorney to help in her divorce. McCann said that although Wooten \\"has never physically abused her,\\" he \\"acts very intimidating.\\" She also accused him of using illegal testosterone supplements, drunk driving, and threatening to \\"take down\\" Palin if she got involved. McCann said she was \\"scared\\" of what Wooten \\"would do when he finds out she has hired an attorney.\\" Police investigation into allegations Based on McCann's complaint, the Alaska State Troopers began an investigation into the claims made, interviewing more than fifteen witnesses. In May 2005, Sarah Palin told police that she and her son Track overheard a death threat against her father (Heath), in February 2005, when McCann allowed her to listen in on an argument through a phone line (speakerphone). Palin said she had not called police at that time because she did not want to put Wooten's career in jeopardy, and the situation had not progressed to physical violence. On August 10, 2005, Palin sent an email to Col. Julia Grimes, head of the Alaska State Troopers, urging that Wooten be dismissed and giving more details about the alleged death threat. The email from Palin to Grimes said that the February 2005 threat by Wooten to shoot Heath came after McCann had accused Wooten of attending an event with another woman. In the email, Palin described Wooten as \\"a loose cannon\\" and \\"a ticking timebomb,\\" and said that failing to fire Wooten \\"would lead a rational person to believe there is a problem inside the organization.\\" As a result of the email, Palin was interviewed again by state troopers on August 18, 2005. During this interview, she stated that she did not warn her father of the death threat until two weeks after it was made; she explained the delay by saying that Wooten had no reason to shoot Heath. According to Heath himself, the delay was a month: \\"Heath stated that his daughters didn't report the incident to him until a month later.\\" Divorce proceedings On May 9, a court hearing was held regarding the DVPO. At this hearing the DVPO was quashed because McCann's counsel was unable to produce evidence of any acts of physical or implied violence. In October 2005, the divorce went to trial. During the trial, Judge John Suddock expressed puzzlement at the efforts of McCann's family to get Wooten fired, since it would harm his earning capacity and damage his ability to pay child support. Judge Suddock said \\"it appears for the world that Ms. McCann and her family have decided to take off for the guy's livelihood -- that the bitterness of whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment.\\" A representative for the Alaska State Trooper's union testified that the union viewed the dozen complaints filed by McCann and her family against Wooten as \\"not job-related\\" and \\"harassment.\\" Judge Suddock repeatedly warned McCann and her family to stop \\"disparaging\\" Wooten's reputation or risk the judge granting Wooten custody of the children. At a court hearing in October 2005, Judge Suddock said \\"disparaging will not be tolerated‚Äîit is a form of child abuse ... relatives cannot disparage either. If occurs the parent needs to set boundaries for their relatives.\\" In the divorce decree that was granted on January 31, 2006, Judge Suddock expressed concern about continued criticism by McCann's family towards Wooten and noted that he would pay particular attention to problems raised by a custody investigator. Legal disputes between Wooten and McCann over custody, child support and visitation rights continued through 2007 and 2008. Results of internal police investigation On October 29, 2005, Sgt. Wall issued a Memorandum of Findings describing the results of his investigation. =Death threat= Wall's investigation report dated October 29, 2005 found that Wooten violated internal policy, but not the law, in making a death threat against Molly McCann's father Heath on February 17, 2005. Molly McCann, Sarah Palin and Track Palin said that he made the threat. Wooten said that he didn't make the threat. Wall decided that he had in fact done so. Wall concluded that the death threat was not a crime because Wooten did not threaten the father directly; therefore, Wall deemed the threat to be a violation of trooper policy rather than a violation of criminal law. Although the death threat was listed as a violation of trooper policy OPM 101.070(A) Unbecoming Conduct and OPM 101.070(B) Personal Conduct in the Memorandum of Findings, it was not mentioned at all in the suspension letter sent to Wooten by Col. Grimes on March 1, 2006. =Moose hunt= The investigation found that Wooten had committed a hunting violation in shooting a moose without a permit: he had been out hunting with McCann in September 2003 and had shot the animal himself even though their permit was in McCann's name only. According to subsequent news reports, McCann had obtained the permit but balked at killing the moose herself, so she handed the gun to her then-husband, who shot the animal. =Taser incident= Wooten was also found to have violated department policy in using a Taser on his then 11-year- old stepson in 2003. He told investigators that he did so \\"in a training capacity\\" after the child had asked to be tased. In a September 2008 newspaper interview, Wooten said that he set the Taser to \\"test\\" mode, meaning that it was on low power.Wooten added that he attached clips to the child's shirt rather than firing darts from a gun, that he turned on the power for less than one second, and that afterward his stepson \\"thought it was great and wanted to do it all over again.\\" He stated that \\"everyone laughed about\\" the incident at the time. According to a spokesman for Taser International, \\"if the Taser is fired for just a second, it would feel like your funny bone was hit.\\" In a statement to police, the boy said \\"he wanted to be tased to show that he's not a mommy's boy in front of Bristol [his cousin, Palin's daughter]. Following being tased he went upstairs to tell his mother that he was fine.\\" In a statement to police, Molly McCann said \\"she was up stairs giving a bath to the kids ... Mike was going to show Payton what it feels like and she told Mike that he better not.\\" According to Molly's account, she remained upstairs during the incident. Although the Taser incident happened in 2003, it was not reported to police until on or after April 11, 2005, the day McCann filed for divorce. On June 6, 2005, a police investigator asked Bristol why they \\"waited so long and brought the incident up after two years.\\" Bristol said \\"because of the divorce and stuff\\". =Alcohol-related allegations= The investigation initially cleared Wooten on all the alcohol-related charges, but Grimes overturned that result and found that Wooten did, \\"Take [an] open beer with him when he drove away in his trooper vehicle,\\" on one occasion in the summer of 2004, violating both the law and internal trooper policy. Wooten was not on duty; he was wearing \\"civilian attire.\\" And he \\"drove approximately one mile to his residence.\\" Because Wooten \\"was a member of the SERT [SWAT] team ... he [was allowed to] use his State vehicle for personal use.\\" The only witnesses to this event were close friends of Sarah Palin's father: \\"Adrian Lane was a student of Chuck Heath's in Idaho when he was a child and they have been close friends ever since.\\" This is apparently why the original Memorandum of Findings treated this allegation as \\"Not Sustained.\\" Wooten denied this allegation. =Other charges= Wooten was cleared of numerous other allegations made by McCann and her family, including that he had taken illegal steroid and testosterone supplements, that he had physically assaulted McCann, and that he had illegally shot a wolf from a helicopter. Aside from the alleged death threat against Heath, Sarah and Molly had also accused Wooten of making threats that he would \\"bring down\\" Sarah and her family. Sarah Palin had no first-hand knowledge of these threats; she heard about them via Molly. Molly told police she understood Wooten to mean that he could use his position as a trooper to make life difficult for Sarah. Wooten denied making this threat. The police investigation treated this allegation as \\"Not Sustained.\\" Suspension of Wooten Based on the internal investigation findings, Grimes announced on March 1, 2006 that she would suspend Wooten for ten days. In announcing the suspension, Grimes referred to the Taser, moose and beer incidents, and also to seven other negative actions in Wooten's personnel file, such as failing to use turn signals. She did not mention the alleged death threat or any other allegations regarding threats. She concluded that \\"[t]he record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times, illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period, which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession\\". After a union protest, the suspension was reduced to five days, and Grimes warned Wooten he would be fired if he committed any further misconduct. Contacts between Governor's office and Wooten's supervisors Palin with Monegan and troopers in 2007 In early December 2006, Palin took office as Governor of Alaska and appointed Walter C. Monegan III to be Public Safety Commissioner, a cabinet position. Monegan is a former police chief of Anchorage and son of Walter C. Monegan, Jr.\\"APD Chiefs of Police\\". According to the investigator hired by the state legislature, \\"Right about that time, a little after the swearing in,\\" someone from Palin's office called Monegan's office to schedule a meeting between Monegan and Todd Palin, the governor's husband. According to Monegan, the meeting took place in the Governor's office on January 4, 2007, with only Monegan and Todd Palin present. Palin asked Monegan to look into the Wooten affair. He gave Monegan various records, including material from a private investigator hired by the Palin family. Palin said that he disagreed with the five-day suspension, as inadequate and insufficient, and accused Wooten of a variety of transgressions, including drunken driving and child abuse. He asked Monegan to revisit the matter in light of some additional evidence he was providing. Monegan agreed to do that. He detailed some staff for the review, who made a page-by-page comparison with the investigation that had been done earlier, and told Monegan that there was nothing new. Monegan then told Todd Palin that there was nothing he could do as the case was closed. The troopers operate under a union contract that restricts the circumstances under which a trooper can be fired. According to Monegan, Governor Palin raised the matter with him personally twice, in January and February,Excerpt from Washington Post: The governor raised the issue again in February 2007 during the legislative session in Juneau. \\"As we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building,\\" Monegan said, \\"she wanted to talk to me about her former brother-in-law. I said, 'Ma'am, I need to keep you at arm's length with this. I can't deal about him with you. If need be, I can talk to Todd.\\" and then kept raising the matter indirectly through e-mails, though she did not again bring it up directly. In an email sent to Monegan on February 7, 2007 about a proposed bill to require 99-year sentences for police officers found guilty of murder, Palin mentioned Wooten as an example of an officer who violated the public trust. The email listed several examples of Wooten's alleged misbehavior. Another Palin email, dated July 17, 2007, concerned a proposed bill to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. Palin wrote to Monegan that her first thoughts \\"went to my ex- brother-in-law, the trooper, who threatened to kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this day carries a gun, of course.\\" A spokesperson for the McCain-Palin campaign says that Palin's contacts with Monegan were only to alert him to potential threats to her family. Monegan also has said he got telephone calls from three Palin appointees: her then- chief of staff, Mike Tibbles; Commissioner Annette Kreitzer of the Department of Administration; and Attorney General Talis Colberg. Colberg said he called after Todd Palin asked him about \\"the process\\" for handling death threats made by state troopers against the first family. Monegan told Colberg the matter had been handled, and Colberg reported back to Todd Palin that nothing more could be done. In mid-August 2008, the Alaska Attorney General's inquiry reported that Palin's staff had made about two dozen contacts with public safety officials about Wooten, in 2007 and 2008, with more than half initiated by Tibbles. In April 2007, Todd Palin told the Anchorage Daily News he had met once with Wooten's supervisor, Colonel Audie Holloway, to give her pictures of Wooten driving a snowmobile when he was out on a worker's compensation claim. Diane Kiesel, Alaska state personnel director, also called Holloway about the snowmobile incident.Alaska Deputy Attorney General Michael Barnhill said on August 30, 2008, that Kiesel called because she believed the troopers should know there might be a violation of law. \\"People in the administration made contact with the Department of Public Safety to deal with the worker's compensation file,\\" Barnhill said. He also said that the attorney general's office did not think the governor's staff should be banned from making calls about Wooten to his superiors. () On November 19, 2007, a meeting was called by Mike Tibbles, at the time Palin's chief of staff, to discuss the process of how Wooten had returned to work after a worker's compensation injury. Present were Kevin Brooks, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Administration, Nicki Neal, director of the Personnel Division, and Diane Kiesel, former director of Personnel and Labor Relations. Ivy Frye, special assistant to Palin, subpoenaed in Troopergate.Matt Volz and Gene Johnson, \\"Stalled Troopergate probe leaves many questions\\", Associated Press, September 20, 2008 On February 29, 2008, Frank Bailey, the governor's director of boards and commissions, made a phone call to trooper Lt. Rodney Dial, the state troopers' liaison to the legislature. The Public Safety Department recorded the call, as it does routinely, and the Palin administration released an audiotape of it on August 13.\\"Governor to Turn Over Findings\\" , Department of Law press release with link to audio of Bailey call, August 13, 2008 In it, Bailey made several accusations against Wooten, including that he lied on his application to become a trooper. He was recorded saying \\"Todd and Sarah are scratching their heads, 'why on earth hasn't, why is this guy still representing the department?' \\" and \\"I'm telling you honestly, you know, she really likes Walt [Monegan] a lot, but on this issue, she feels like it's, she doesn't know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue. It's very, very troubling to her and the family. I could definitely relay that.\\" Bailey said in an interview on August 13 that no one had asked him to make the call and he didn't know why he indicated in the call that he was speaking on behalf of the Palins. A transcript of the call is available. Cell records show that Todd Palin spoke to Palin aide Ivy Frye three times on the afternoon of February 28, the day before Bailey's conversation with Dial. About three hours after the last call, the first of ten emails began to circulate between Ivy Frye, Sarah Palin, her husband Todd, Bailey, Administration Commissioner Annette Kreitzer, Deputy Chief of Staff Randy Ruaro and Palin aide Kris Perry. The exchanges continued overnight and into the morning of Bailey's phone call.Only these seven contributors, and the subject lines of the emails were released under a public records request. The emails have the subject line \\"PSEA,\\" referring to the troopers' union: the Public Safety Employees Association, which was in the midst of contract negotiations with the state. Palin will not release the contents of those emails, despite her claim that Alaska's government is open and transparent. They ‚Äî along with more than one thousand other messages ‚Äî are included in an exemption in the state's open records law. (Matt Volz and Gene Johnson, \\"Stalled Troopergate probe leaves many questions\\", Associated Press, September 20, 2008) Shortly before the annual celebration of Police Memorial Day on May 15, 2008, Commissioner Monegan dropped off a color photograph at Governor Palin's Anchorage office with a request that she sign and present it at the ceremony. The photograph was of an Alaska State Trooper, dressed in a formal uniform, saluting. He was standing in front of the police memorial located in front of the crime lab at AST headquarters in Anchorage, partially obscured by a flagpole. The picture to be signed by the Governor was to be used as a poster to be displayed in various Trooper Detachments around the state. Shortly after he returned to his office from dropping off the photograph, he received a call from Kris Perry, Governor Palin's Director of her Anchorage office, who asked (according to Walt Monegan's testimony), \\"Why did you send a poster over here that has a picture of Mike Wooten on it?\\" Until that moment, Commissioner Monegan apparently never realized it was indeed a photograph of Trooper Wooten. Governor Palin canceled her appearance and sent Lieutenant Governor Parnell in her place.Branchflower report, page 38‚Äì39. At least three dozen people contacted Monegan's office over a 19-month period. Kim Peterson, Mr. Monegan's special assistant and a 31-year human resources employee of the State of Alaska, said she fielded about a dozen calls. \\"It was very clear that someone from the governor's office wanted him watched,\\" she told The New York Times. Mr. Palin had called Ms. Peterson to claim that he had seen Wooten riding a snowmobile while on disability for a back injury and asked her to investigate. When Mr. Palin called back two weeks later asking for a response, Peterson told him that she could not discuss it because it was a confidential personnel matter. Dianne Kiesel, a deputy director at the Department of Administration, called Ms. Peterson to suggest that Wooten could be reassigned to the cold- case unit or perform background checks. Ms. Peterson responded that those options would violate the union contract. Annette Kreitzer, Commissioner of the Alaskan Department of Administration, also called Monegan and Peterson about Wooten. Dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan On July 11, 2008, Palin's acting chief of staff Mike Nizich dismissed Monegan, offering him a position as executive director of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which he turned down. In a letter to DPS employees announcing his termination, Monegan wrote that he was an at-will employee and knew his dismissal was, \\"A possibility ever present\\", and that he had been advised that the governor wanted to take DPS in a \\"different direction\\". In an interview the next day Monegan said that the dismissal had come \\"out of the blue\\" and that \\"[i]f the governor was upset with me for one thing or another, it had never been communicated to me.\\" Response to the dismissal of Monegan The accusation that Governor Palin may have abused her power when her attempt to reassign Commissioner Walt Monegan resulted in his termination of employment appeared in the blog of Andrew Halcro on Thursday, July 17, 2008. Halcro claimed that Monegan was \\"fired\\" because of his budget battles with the governor and because he refused to fire Trooper Wooten. Halcro's blog reported that Monegan thought he was going into the meeting to smooth over the ruffled feathers caused from when his deputy, Holloway, denied the governor's chief of security, Cocerall, an extra trooper for security at the governor's picnic. Instead he was fired. The legislators agreed to hire a special investigator to look into the issue to clear the air. > That's the only thing I can think of, if you want to get to the truth and be > unbiased,\\" said Senate President Lyda Green, a Wasilla Republican. > \\"Otherwise, speculation just continues.\\" Ten days later, on July 28, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council met and voted 12‚Äì0 to delegate their authority to the Council Chairman, Senator Elton, to hire legal services to investigate the termination of Commissioner Monegan. They named Senator Hollis French as Project Director for the contract. The report was intended that the \\"investigation be professional, unbiased, independent, objective, and conducted at arm's length from the political process\\". The investigators report was to be submitted to the Legislative Council. Senator French hired Stephen Branchflower to conduct the investigation. The contract was signed on July 31, 2008, and Branchflower began his investigation on August 11, 2008. Other responses to the dismissal of Monegan On July 17, Palin said publicly that \\"We have [to] start recruiting. We have to start doing more than just talking about it. And taking action also.\\" Monegan responded on July 18 that the two most recent trooper graduating classes had the most recruits in years. On July 18, Monegan suggested that his dismissal might have been related to his reluctance to fire Wooten. He said phone calls and questions from the Palin administration and the governor's husband, Todd Palin, about Wooten started shortly after Monegan was hired and continued until May or June 2008.: \\"Monegan said he still isn't sure why he was fired but thought that Wooten could be part of it.\\" Monegan said that Palin's acting chief of staff, Mike Nizich, told him on July 11 that he was being removed from his position because Palin wanted to take the Department of Public Safety in a different direction. On July 18, in response to Monegan's comments, Palin released a statement: The statement also denied that the governor had improperly accessed Wooten's employment records, saying that \\"[t]o allege that I, or any member of my family, requested, received or released confidential personnel information on an Alaska State Trooper, or directed disciplinary action be taken against any employee of the Department of Public Safety, is, quite simply, outrageous. Any information regarding personnel records came from the trooper himself.\\" Palin said \\"absolutely no pressure [was] ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time ... no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody.\\" She also praised Monegan's replacement, saying \\"Commissioner Kopp shares my vision for filling vacant positions and reducing crime across the state.\\" In late July, former U.S. Attorney Wevley Shea, who had acted previously as an informal adviser to Palin, wrote her an unsolicited letter in which he urged her to apologize for \\"overreaching or perceived overreaching\\" to get Wooten fired, and warned that the matter could snowball into a bigger scandal. The letter said that she should fire any aides who had raised concerns with Monegan.\\"Palin adviser warned that firing raised 'grave' concern\\", CNN (2008-09-11):\\"A former ethics adviser to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned in July that firing her public safety commissioner would become a \\"grave concern\\" for her administration....Shea had acted as an informal ethics adviser to Palin, but he told CNN that his advice on the Monegan firing was unsolicited.\\" On August 13, Palin said specifically that her action was unrelated to Wooten. She said that Monegan was dismissed for not adequately filling state trooper vacancies and fighting alcohol abuse problems, and because he \\"did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues.\\" Palin acknowledged that \\"pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it.\\" She suspended Frank Bailey, and apologized to Alaskans: On August 28, in an interview with Anchorage Daily News, Monegan said, \\"For the record, no one ever said fire Wooten. Not the governor. Not Todd. Not any of the other staff. What they said directly was more along the lines of 'This isn't a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers.' \\". He later added that he had resisted pressure from the governor and her husband to re-open the case against Wooten. In an August interview with The New Yorker, Palin blamed Monegan for failing to address alcohol abuse in rural Alaska. According to the New Yorker article, Palin stated that she didn't fire Monegan, but rather \\"asked him to drop everything else and single-mindedly take on the state's drinking problem, as the director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.\\" Palin characterized the job offered to Monegan as \\"commensurate in salary pretty much‚Äîten thousand dollars less\\", but said that Monegan didn't want it, so he quit. In September, in a televised interview with Charles Gibson of ABC News, Palin reiterated her position that she had dismissed Monegan because of his job performance and that neither she nor her husband pressured him to fire Wooten. Palin said \\"I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody ... I know that Todd, too, never pressured ... Monegan.\\" In response, Monegan said: \\"She's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten. And she's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me.\\" Monegan has made a number of other statements alleging that he had been pressured to fire Wooten. \\"There was pressure for that, yes.\\" \\"There were numerous contacts by the governor, her husband, by her staff that basically said that Trooper Wooten was not an acceptable example of an Alaska state trooper.\\" \\"The fact that they tried for better than a year while I was there is kind of indicative that somebody was trying to pressure something.\\" On September 2, 2008, \\"a senior strategist in the McCain campaign\\" said \\"the man who was fired has said on the record that he was never pressured by the governor or the governor's husband on the issue of firing Trooper Wooten.\\" On September 15, 2008, McCain/Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton held a news conference at which she accused Monegan of \\"egregious insubordination\\", \\"obstructionist conduct\\" and a \\"brazen refusal\\" to follow proper channels for requesting money. Asked why someone with a history of insubordination would be offered the leadership of the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, Stapleton said that without having to deal with a budget, Monegan would be able to focus on alcohol abuse issues. She added that Palin \\"respects the fact that he [Monegan] was respected in the community.\\" Monegan's successor, Charles Kopp, testified that during the July 9, 2008, phone call seeing if he was still interested the commissioner's job, he asked why Monegan was leaving, and Frank Bailey told him that Governor Palin was upset by the episode where she was asked to autograph Wooten's photograph. Investigations and reviews The Alaska Legislative Council is a bipartisan body of state House and Senate members who can convene to make decisions when the full legislature is not in session. As of July 2008 it was made up of four Democrats and eight Republicans. On July 28, 2008, the Legislative Council voted 12‚Äì0 to hire an independent investigator to investigate Palin and her staff for possible abuse of power or improper actions surrounding Monegan's dismissal. A retired state prosecutor, Stephen Branchflower, was named as the investigator. Branchflower was awarded a three-month contract, which began on August 1. In the same unanimous vote, the Council also appointed Sen. French (D), a former state prosecutor, to manage Branchflower. French is Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Alaska Attorney General (internal investigation) As a result of the announcement of a legislative investigation, Talis Colberg, the Alaskan Attorney General, and his Department of Law, began conducting an inquiry in late July at the request of the Governor. Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized the Colberg probe. \\"I think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration, harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved ... it's just the worst possible thing to be doing.\\" Ramras said Colberg \\"needs to be very careful to avoid his review having any appearance of tampering with witnesses.\\" The findings of the review were made public on August 13. The inquiry identified two dozen contacts by members of Palin's staff with public safety officials, concerning Wooten. Of these, only one was determined to be improper by the Attorney General's office. Palin said that she had only known about some of the two dozen contacts, and that she never asked anyone on her staff to get in touch with such officials about Wooten. Additionally, the Governor said that, \\"Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate. However, the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure, presumably at my direction.\\" In July, Palin had denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. Based on the Attorney General's inquiry, she said on August 13 that \\"I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although I have only now become aware of it.\\" Palin said the \\"most disturbing\\" contact found in the inquiry by the Attorney General and his office was the February 2008 phone call by Bailey to Dial. In a newspaper interview the day after the tape was released, Palin said she never asked Bailey to make the call, which she called \\"just wrong.\\" She also denied that the tape showed the administration applying pressure to fire Wooten, saying \\"[i]f that's pressure, then (after) years in law enforcement, how do they do their job if that's perceived as pressure?\\" A day or two earlier, Palin had said that Bailey's call appeared as a form of pressure: \\"It appears that he, though, tried to apply some pressure on my behalf.\\"\\"Namely, specifically, most disturbing, is a telephone recording apparently made and preserved by the troopers...\\", Anchorage Daily News (2008-08-13). On August 19, the Governor's office announced that Bailey had been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of the legislative investigation. Sharon Leighow, a spokesperson for the governor, said that Bailey was kept on the state payroll so Palin \\"can direct him to assist Mr. Branchflower, thereby fulfilling her pledge to Alaskans to cooperate fully with the investigation.\\"Jerry Seper, \\"Palin aides welcome Alaska probe: Say governor had no connection to case of sister's ex-husband\\", The Washington Times, August 30, 2008 State Legislature investigation On August 16, Hollis French said that the Palin administration has been cooperating and that subpoenas would not be necessary. In late August, French said that Palin was likely to be deposed soon in the case. In mid-August, Palin hired a private practice lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, to defend her and her staff in the investigation; he began working on August 21. Van Flein was being paid by the State of Alaska; Attorney General Colberg was unable to represent Palin because of his involvement in the case. On August 29, Van Flein asked for all witness statements, documents and other materials collected in the course of the legislative investigation. French said, in response, that he had instructed Branchflower not to provide the letters or witness statements. On September 17, Van Flein said that he had, as of September 12, terminated his contract with the state, and was representing Todd and Sarah Palin personally. Van Flein said that the state would not be billed for any of his services since he was hired in August. Van Flein said that, after listening to Colberg's interview with Branchflower, he believes that Colberg is not a \\"material witness.\\" =Scheduled completion date= Branchflower's 3-month contract that started on August 1 was originally scheduled to end on October 31, and therefore the investigation was expected to end on that date. On September 2, French said the report would \\"likely to be damaging to the (Palin) administration,\\" and could be an October surprise. In response to French's statements, Republican state Senator John Coghill launched an unsuccessful attempt to have French removed from overseeing the investigation, and suggested the entire investigation ought to be canceled, saying \\"if this has been botched up the way it has, there's a question as to whether it should continue.\\" French apologized: \\"I made some remarks I should not have made. The point to remember is I'm not doing the investigation, Steven Branchflower is. He is independently gathering the facts and he will issue the report, which he will have to defend.\\" On September 5 French said that rather than ending on October 31, the Friday before the election, the report would be complete by October 10. House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R) said the reason for the earlier completion date for the report is to avoid the appearance of a last- minute \\"October surprise.\\" Other Republican lawmakers also expressed support for the earlier date. French's \\"October surprise\\" remarks were used, in part, as the basis for a lawsuit that was brought by five Republican lawmakers, in an attempt to stop the Branchflower investigation. On October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected this lawsuit, and defended French's right to make those remarks: \\"It is expected that legislators will belong to some party and will support the positions of their party, often publicly. The legislature is, by its nature, a political branch. It would be assumed that, e.g., review of Wall Street's financiers might be founded on a strongly held and expressed belief that somebody did something wrong.\\" =Initial dispute over witnesses' testimony= On September 1, French said the legislature would pay to fly Branchflower to wherever Sarah Palin was on the campaign trail if needed, and that Branchflower had not yet been able to set up an interview with Palin. In a letter on September 1, Van Flein indicated that Palin probably would not agree to an interview unless the legislature turned the matter over to the Personnel Board. If witnesses were not available, French said, he would ask the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, to issue subpoenas. He said that Palin needed to be interviewed sometime in September. On September 2, the lawyer for Frank Bailey, the aide Palin suspended after a recording of his call to a trooper official came to light, canceled a deposition scheduled for September 3. The lawyer said that Van Flein, who represents Palin, informed him that there was a jurisdictional dispute that was unsettled. Bailey's lawyer also said that Bailey was ready to be deposed, and that Bailey would say that he wasn't asked by the Governor to make any calls regarding Monegan, but that the jurisdictional matter should be settled first. In response to this, Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said \\"Alaskans should be offended, that Frank Bailey is on paid leave and will not do an interview that he already committed to with Mr. Branchflower.\\" On September 9, Senior Assistant Attorney General Mike Barnhill wrote to Legislative Council chair Sen. Kim Elton threatening to go to court to confirm that it was legal for the Governor to assign her staff to review personnel files. He said that, if the lawmakers agreed that this interpretation of the law was correct, the Attorney General's office \\"will drop its objections [to state employees testifying] and the depositions may proceed without subpoenas.\\" On September 12, Sen. Elton agreed with Barnhill's proposal, writing that \\"I stipulate in my role as a chair of the Legislative Council and on behalf of the council that your interpretation of the law is correct.\\" =Issue of subpoenas and response= On September 12, the Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to thirteen potential witnesses: Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Randy Ruaro, Frank Bailey, John Bitney, Annette Kreitzer, Dianne Kiesel, Nicki Neal, Brad Thompson, Michael Nizich, Kris Perry, Janice Mason, and Murlene Wilkes. The Committee also authorized a subpoena for Bailey's cell-phone records. According to Branchflower, Wilkes may have lied to him during an earlier interview, and may have had a financial incentive to cover up being pressured by the Palins to deny Wooten's worker's compensation claim. Branchflower said an employee at Wilkes' company had called a tip line and said \\"the governor's office wanted this claim denied.\\" According to KTUU, \\"knowingly denying a worker's comp claim for false reasons is a criminal offense.\\" Sarah Palin herself was not subpoenaed: Ramras said that it \\"would be disrespectful\\" for the committee to subpoena the governor while she was running for Vice President. The Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted to issue the subpoenas, is composed of three Republicans and two Democrats. The vote was 3-2. The subpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The House Judiciary Committee also voted, in an advisory capacity, in favor of authorizing the subpoenas. This vote was 5-0. Those five include three Republicans and two Democrats. Two Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee were not present. On September 16, saying that the investigation was \\"tainted\\" by manipulations from Barack Obama's supporters, a McCain-Palin spokesperson said that Palin would not cooperate with the investigator hired by the legislature. The Obama campaign said that the claim of manipulation was \\"complete paranoia.\\" On September 16, State Attorney General Talis Colberg, a Palin appointee, notified the Legislature that state employees would disobey the subpoenas issued in the course of the investigation, unless either the full Senate or the legislature as a whole voted to compel their testimony. He stated that the officials were \\"loyal employees subject to the supervision of the Governor\\" and cited Governor Palin's decision not to co-operate with the inquiry, her statement that the subpoenas were \\"of questionable validity,\\" and the pending lawsuits challenging the investigation. He added that the employees were in \\"an untenable situation.\\" The full Alaska legislature is not scheduled to convene until January 2009: it could not meet earlier unless a Special Session is called by Governor Palin. In response to Attorney General Colberg's letter, Sen. Elton accused the administration of breaking an earlier agreement to allow the employees to testify. He cited several public statements by Palin or her staff pledging her cooperation, in addition to what he called the \\"explicit\\" offer in the earlier letter of September 9 to allow the testimony, provided that the administration's interpretation of the State Personnel Act was agreed upon. Also on September 16, five GOP lawmakers from the Alaskan State Legislature filed a lawsuit in Anchorage Superior Court to end the investigation, claiming it was \\"unlawful, biased, partial and partisan.\\" On September 18, the McCain/Palin campaign announced that Todd Palin would refuse to testify because he does not believe the investigation is legitimate. State senator Bill Wielechowski said that the witnesses could not be punished for disobeying the subpoenas until the full legislature comes into session, which was scheduled to be in January 2009. =Allegation that the witness list was manipulated= As evidence of her claim that the Branchflower investigation was \\"tainted,\\" McCain spokesperson Stapleton cited the removal of former Palin Chief of Staff Tibbles from the subpoena list compiled by Branchflower. Branchflower had requested a subpoena for Tibbles because Tibbles was refusing to cooperate voluntarily. Stapleton said \\"French's further political involvement was accidentally revealed when the investigator testified that he had deferred to French on the proper witnesses to subpoena.\\" On October 1, the McCain campaign said \\"Branchflower and French were recently exposed for colluding on the issuing of subpoenas.\\" The McCain campaign also said \\"in a hearing, Branchflower admits conspiring with French regarding the recipients of subpoenas.\\" According to House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R), it was his idea to remove Tibbles from the list: \\"we did not want to put that onus -- at least this was the point of view I put forward -- I did not want to put that onus on somebody who is now excluded from state service and would not enjoy the same legal protection that has been afforded to those members of the administration.\\" In response to charges that the Branchflower investigation is partisan, Ramras stated that the Chairmen and Vice Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees comprise three Republicans and one Democrat. All those four voted in favor of authorizing Branchflower's subpoenas. Ramras also mentioned \\"I have had a McCain sign in my front yard since August 21st, as soon as they hit town in Fairbanks.\\" Responding to further claims of partisanship, Ramras said \\"the hyperbole from the truth squad [McCain campaign] is a little farfetched ... to those of us who have monitored this thing from the front-row seats, it's a misnomer.\\" =Branchflower's interim status report as of September 12= Subpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on September 12. Branchflower was present, and reported on the interim progress of his month-long investigation. As of September 12, Branchflower had identified 33 potential witnesses, and had taken statements from 16 witnesses. He was also working with a large amount of material that had been produced by the Colberg investigation, and turned over to him. Branchflower said there was enough evidence in the public record to support the claim that Todd Palin was the principal critic of Trooper Wooten. Todd Palin had many contacts with DPS personnel over the last several years and made many comments about how it appeared that DPS was not doing its job because of Wooten; he wanted Wooten fired. Branchflower described Monegan's account of his meeting with Todd Palin in January 2007. Palin said Wooten's suspension was inadequate. In a legal filing in September 2008, Sarah Palin said her family didn't learn until July 2008 that Wooten had been disciplined with a suspension in 2006. =Status of Branchflower's subpoenas as of September 19= On September 19, French issued a letter detailing the status of the thirteen witness subpoenas authorized by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 12. As of the 19th, six of the subpoenas had been served, to Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Ruaro, Bailey, Bitney and Wilkes. The former three failed to appear on September 19, as ordered. The latter three complied with the subpoena by providing statements to Branchflower. The cell-phone company also was served and complied by providing Bailey's records. On September 19, French announced that Branchflower would serve subpoenas on the seven remaining witnesses (Kiesel, Kreitzer, Neal, Thompson, Nizich, Perry, and Mason), with a return date of September 26. French's letter noted that Attorney General Colberg's office had confirmed twice, in writing, that witnesses would cooperate. Colberg cancelled that cooperation agreement on September 16. French said that various subpoenas would have been served earlier, but Branchflower had been relying on assurances that had been given by the Governor and others that witnesses would be instructed to cooperate. =Court upholds validity of subpoenas, witnesses state willingness to appear= On October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected the contentions of the five Republican state legislators who had sued to block the investigation, and he also rejected Colberg's challenge to the subpoenas. In response, Colberg declined to discuss whether he would advise the subpoenaed state officials to comply with the subpoenas; he stated instead that he would need to consult with them about a possible appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court before commenting publicly. On October 5, seven of the witnesses agreed that they would testify, leaving only the Palins' own appearance in doubt. =Branchflower Report and response= The Alaska Legislative Council investigation concluded on October 10, 2008. After a full day of deliberation, the twelve members of the legislative commission voted unanimously to release, without endorsing, the 263-page Branchflower Report. The report included four main findings: #Governor Sarah Palin abused her power as Governor in that her conduct violated AS 39.52.110(a) of the Ethics Act, which provides \\"The legislature reaffirms that each public officer holds office as a public trust, and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust.\\" #Although Walt Monegan's refusal to fire Trooper Michael Wooten was not the sole reason he was fired by Governor Sarah Palin, it was likely a contributing factor to his termination as Commissioner of Public Safety. In spite of that, Governor Palin's firing of Commissioner Monegan was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority to hire and fire executive branch department heads. #Harbor Adjustment Service of Anchorage, and its owner Ms. Murleen Wilkes, handled Trooper Michael Wooten's workers' compensation claim properly and in the normal course of business like any other claim processed by Harbor Adjustment Service and Ms. Wilkes. Further, that he received all the workers' compensation benefits to which he was entitled. #The Attorney General's office failed to substantially comply with (the investigation's) August 6, 2008 written request to Governor Sarah Palin for information about the case in the form of emails. The report concludes that Palin wrongfully allowed her husband, Todd Palin, to use state resources to pursue having Trooper Wooten fired, stating that \\"Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda...\\" The report also recommended some clarifications of ethics statutes for the future. The third finding relates to evidence that Alaskan officials had informed the owner of the firm handling Wooten's worker's compensation claim that the governor wanted Wooten's claim denied. However, the report finds that the claim was handled without regard to any attempt at political pressure. The report did not recommend any sanctions or legal penalties. Palin's attorney issued a five-page statement condemning the Branchflower report as misleading and wrong on the law.The Governor's Attorney Condemns the Branchflower Report as Misleading and Wrong on the Law scribd.com, statement from Clapp, Peterson, Van Flein, Tiemessen, Thorsness LLC, October 11, 2008. Retrieved 2010-11-24. Palin responded to the report by saying, \\"About the Tasergate issue... I'm very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing, any hint of any kind of unethical activity there.\\" This statement was criticized as inconsistent with the contents of the report by the media and by Democratic state senator Kim Elton. State Personnel Board investigation =Initiation= On September 1, Palin essentially filed an ethics complaint against herself, asking the state Personnel Board to review the case. Her lawyer asked the state legislature to drop its investigation, saying that by state law, the board had jurisdiction over ethics issues. Palin also asked that the board review the matter as an ethics complaint. The Personnel Board is a three- member panel appointed by the governor, and confirmed by the legislature.Alaska Department of Administration; Personnel and Labor Relations . Members serve six-year terms, and not more than two members may be of same political party. The three people on the current board were first appointed by Frank Murkowski (R), Palin's gubernatorial predecessor; Palin reappointed one member in 2008. Another member donated $400 to Palin's 2006 campaign for governor. As governor, Palin has the authority to remove members of the board, for cause. The Personnel Board hired Anchorage trial lawyer Timothy J. Petumenos, a registered Democrat who contributed to Palin's opponent for governor in 2006, as its investigator. In 2002, his firm handled the $15 million bond issue for Wasilla's hockey complex, a pet project of then-mayor Palin. In response to the request from Palin's attorney, French responded that \\"We're going to proceed. If they want to proceed, that's perfectly within their right but it doesn't diminish our right to do so.\\" On September 3, Nicki Neal, director of the state Division of Personnel and Labor Relations, said that the board would meet soon in executive session--closed to the public--to begin its work. Palin had asked for the ethics case to be open. Neal said she would check into how that relates to the board meetings. Neal is one of the persons listed as a potential witness in the Branchflower investigation. =Proceedings= On September 15, 2008, Palin's attorney Van Flein filed arguments with the Personnel Board arguing that there was \\"no probable cause\\" to pursue the complaint that Palin earlier filed against herself. The filing accused Monegan of \\"an escalating pattern of insubordination on budget and other key policy issues\\", including a press conference appearance with Senator French, who is leading the legislature's investigation. Van Flein also argued that, even if Palin had ordered Monegan to fire Wooten, that would not violate Alaska's Ethics Act \\"because the public generally shares a common interest in public order and safety.\\" The September 15 filing said that a key matter was a planned trip to Washington, D.C. by Monegan to seek funding for an initiative against sexual assault. The filing said that \\"the proposed Washington trip proved to be the last straw\\", and that she had not authorized the trip. Note: According to the FBI, \\"Alaska is the first in the nation, per capita, for rapes, and second for murder of women by men. On April 28, 2008, at a conference on domestic violence, Palin publicly applauded Monegan for his work in this area. She said \\"I want to publicly thank Walt for having his heart in the right place and his efforts too.\\" On April 28, 2008, Palin had praised Monegan for his work in this area (sexual assault and domestic violence). On September 19, ABC News reported that the governor's staff had authorized Monegan's trip, scheduled for July 22, 2008. ABC posted a travel authorization, signed by Nizich, Palin's Chief of Staff, on June 19, 2008, for the trip. In response to inquiries about the travel authorization, the McCain- Palin campaign provided a statement on September 19 from Ruaro, the governor's deputy chief of staff as of September 1, 2008. Ruaro wrote that Monegan asked for‚Äîand received‚Äîapproval for the travel without telling Palin's staff his reason for going. '\\"As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich ... weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,'\\" Ruaro wrote. On September 20, the McCain campaign said \\"Gov. Palin's chief of staff authorized Monegan to travel to Washington ... weeks before Monegan revealed the true purpose of his trip.\\" However, the September 15 legal filing contained a related e-mail: on June 26, 2008, Randy Ruaro, at that time a special assistant to the governor, emailed Karen Rehfeld, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to Nizich. The email began \\"Walt and DPS want to make a trip back to DC in the end of July ... to get funding ... for work on sexual assault cases.\\"Motion for Determination of No Cause (pdf) , filed September 15, 2008, Exhibit K, p. 2 of 2 (p. 42 in the pdf document) On October 13, 2008, Monegan asked the State Personnel Board for a hearing at which he could defend himself against Palin's accusations. Monegan's \\"Request for Due Process Hearing To Address Reputational Harm\\" set forth Palin's explanations for having dismissed him. It also stated: > Like all cabinet officers, Mr. Monegan served at the pleasure of the > Governor and she could terminate him for any just reason or for no reason at > all. But the Governor is not entitled to make untrue and defamatory > statements about her reasons for discharging a cabinet officer. Governor > Palin's public statements accusing Mr. Monegan of serious misconduct were > untrue and they have stigmatized his good name, severely damaged ‚Äì and > continue to damage ‚Äì his reputation, and impaired his ability to pursue > future professional employment in law enforcement and related fields. The Palins' attorney, Thomas Van Flein, stated that Palin and her husband would both give depositions on October 24 afternoon outside the state. As part of the Alaska Personnel Board investigation, with hired independent counsel Timothy Petumenos, each interview was expected to take up to 3 hours. Police union ethics complaint On September 3, the police union filed an ethics complaint with the Alaska Attorney General's office. The complaint alleged that Palin and her officials had illegally accessed and disclosed information from Wooten's confidential personnel records. It said that the call by Frank Bailey, particularly the allegation that Wooten had lied on his job application, demonstrated knowledge that could only have come from Wooten's private file. During the February 29, 2008, call, which was recorded, Lt. Dial asked Bailey how he had come across this \\"extremely confidential\\" information, and Bailey replied \\"I'm a little bit reluctant to say. Over in admin is where, you know, we hold workers' comp right in there.\\" The McCain- Palin campaign responded to the September 3 ethics complaint by saying that the privacy had been waived as part of the Wooten divorce proceedings, putting the information in the public domain, and that Bailey had received the information from Todd Palin, not from Wooten's personnel records, following Wooten's release on February 7, 2008 of his entire personnel file (\\"including all disciplinary action(s)\\") to his ex-wife's attorneys. Final report of Alaska Personnel Board On November 3, 2008, the Alaska Personnel Board concluded its probe and determined that Palin had not violated ethics laws, contradicting the earlier investigations. Tim Petumenos, the lawyer hired by the board to conduct the probe, was quoted as stating in his final report, \\"There is no probable cause to believe that the governor, or any other state official, violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in connection with these matters.\\" The Personnel Board report also dismissed Monegan's request for a hearing and recommended that the police union's (PSEA) amended complaint be dismissed. The summary and recommendations of the Petumenos report are as follows: SUMMARY OF PUBLIC FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act by making the decision to dismiss Department of Public Safety Commissioner Monegan and offering him instead the position of Director of the Alcohol Beverage Control Board. 2. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in any other respect in connection with the employment of Alaska State Trooper Michael Wooten. 3. There is no basis upon which to refer the conduct of Governor Palin to any law enforcement agency in connection with this matter because Governor Palin did not commit the offenses of Interference with Official Proceedings or Official Misconduct. 4. There is no probable cause to believe that any other official of state government violated any substantive provision of the Ethics Act. 5. There is no legal basis or jurisdiction for conducting a \\"Due Process Hearing to Address Reputational Harm\\" as requested by former Commissioner Walter Monegan. 6. The Amended Complaint by the PSEA should be dismissed. 7. Independent Counsel recommends that the appropriate agency of State government address the issue of the private use of e-mails for government work and revisit the record retention policies of the Governor's Office. These findings differ from those of the Branchflower Report because Independent Counsel has concluded the wrong statute was used as a basis for the conclusions contained in the Branchflower Report. The Branchflower Report misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence that is required to properly reach findings in this matter. In early December, Palin's deputy press secretary said that the board's report had been released because Palin had waived her confidentiality to release it, but that Palin would not release a transcript of her testimony on October 24. The governor's office also refused to release a transcript of Todd Palin's deposition and other key documents that were part of the Personnel Board investigation but not included as attachments to the official report. Palin's views regarding the proper venue for the investigation Palin has made a number of statements expressing her views on the proper venue for the investigation. =Intent to cooperate= * On July 18, 2008, Palin said \\"we would never prohibit, or be less than enthusiastic about any kind of investigation.\\" * On July 21, Palin said that said she welcomed an investigation. \\"I've said all along, hold me accountable,\\" Palin told reporters. * On July 24, Palin said \\"I have absolutely nothing to hide ... I'm happy to answer any questions between now and when they [the legislature] do conduct an investigation also. ... I'm happy to comply, to cooperate. ... No problem with an independent investigation.\\" * On July 29, Palin's spokesperson said \\"the governor has said all along that she will fully cooperate with an investigation and her staff will cooperate as well.\\" *On August 13, an official press release stated \\"Governor Palin has directed all of her staff to cooperate fully with Branchflower.\\" * On August 29, Palin's attorney wrote to Branchflower: \\"Please know that we intend to cooperate with this investigation ... I would like to review our calendars to schedule depositions of witnesses.\\" * On August 30, the McCain campaign said \\"Governor Palin is an open book on this -- she did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide. ... she has been happy to cooperate fully in the inquiry of this matter. ... The legislature and Attorney General are both currently reviewing the circumstances of Walt Monegan's departure ... and the Governor is fully cooperating with those inquiries.\\" *On August 30, The Washington Times reported that Palin knew Branchflower by reputation, and welcomed the investigation: \\"I know he's a prosecutor, probably a heavy duty prosecutor, and so that kind of puzzles us why we are going down that road when we are very, very open to answering any questions anybody has of me or administrators ... But I think this process will bode well for the state of Alaska and our administration, having a review committee of those experts in public safety, in the trooper organization.\\" * On September 4, the Anchorage Daily News noted that Palin had made repeated public statements that she would cooperate, and reported that Palin's attorney had said that hadn't changed. =Intent not to cooperate= * On September 1, Palin requested that the Personnel Board review the matter. That same date, her lawyer, hired in late August, asked the legislature to drop its investigation, saying that by state law, the Personnel Board had jurisdiction over ethics issues. * On September 2, Palin's attorney wrote to Branchflower: \\"It appears that the [Personnel] Board has jurisdiction over this matter ... [therefore you should] suspend your investigation pending the outcome of the Personnel Board investigation.\\" * On September 5, French and Ramras made this joint statement: \\"This week, seven key witnesses informed Mr. Branchflower through their attorneys that they would not provide depositions. Their depositions, which had been agreed to and scheduled earlier with Mr. Branchflower, were cancelled within the last 72 hours.\\" *On September 13, Palin said \\"we've said all along that ... the personnel board is the appropriate agency or board to inquire.\\" * On September 16, a McCain spokesperson said \\"the governor is not going to cooperate with that [Branchflower] investigation.\\" Successors to Monegan Palin replaced Monegan with Chuck Kopp, who had been the police chief and, for a time, the acting city manager, of Kenai. She had previously nominated Kopp in March 2007 to the Alaska Judicial Council, to which he was later confirmed. (He resigned on July 13, 2008.)http://www.legis.state.ak.us/pdf/25/M/SJUD2007-04-271339.PDF The Alaska Judicial Council recommends judges for selection in the state. According to the Anchorage Daily News, Kopp \\"was a rising star in Alaska's Christian conservative movement.\\" In Kenai, Kopp had been previously suspended and investigated for sexual harassment of an employee. Palin said she believed, when she named him on July 11, that the investigation had cleared him, and that she learned that Kopp had received a letter of reprimand only when Kopp held a press conference on July 22 to discuss that letter. Kopp resigned on July 25. He received a $10,000 severance payment. Monegan had received no severance payment. Although certain reports indicate that Kopp was appointed on July 11, the actual announcement from Palin's office is dated July 14. The person who was sexually harassed by Kopp sent an email to Palin on July 14, 2008, very early in the morning before Palin made her announcement. The victim said \\"my sexual harassment complaint against Chief Kopp was acknowledged [and] validated ... by the City of Kenai.\\" In a letter to the victim on October 10, 2005, the City of Kenai had said this: \\"As a result of our investigation, Chuck Kopp was removed immediately from his supervisory role relating to your position. ... The City of Kenai will not tolerate harassment of its employees from anyone, regardless of his or her position.\\" Palin later stated that when she appointed Kopp, she was unaware that he had been reprimanded. On September 12, 2008 Palin appointed Joseph Masters as the third Public Safety Commissioner in a two-month period. Masters, a former deputy director of the Alaska State Troopers, had been security director for petrochemical operations for a private company. He replaced John Glass, who had served as acting commissioner. The Anchorage Daily News reported: \\"Asked if the governor discussed her vision of the department with him, [Masters] said, 'Gov. Palin didn't give me any guidance or direction or mandates for the department.'\\" As of mid-September 2008, the post of director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (the alternative job which Palin had offered to Monegan) was unfilled. Areas of possible factual inconsistency In a number of instances, certain facts appear to be described in an inconsistent manner, when comparing multiple sources: Allegations that Wooten is violent and abusive According to the memorandum of findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever committed any act of violence against any person, other than the Taser incident. According to a police statement, McCann told police that Wooten never abused her. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved because there was no evidence of violence. According to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten is violent and abusive. Various statements reference the DVPO as proof that Wooten is violent. In a sworn statement, Todd Palin accused Wooten of \\"violent behavior\\" directed at four family members. On September 2, 2008 Palin said that Wooten was guilty of \\"violent behavior ... directed against ... my sister.\\" On September 17 McCain-Palin spokesperson Meg Stapleton said Wooten \\"abused her [Palin's] sister.\\" On October 9 Stapleton said \\"there are numerous instances of abuse.\\" On October 10 the McCain campaign accused Wooten of \\"violent behavior\\" directed at four family members in 2005 and early 2006. Threats against other family members According to the Memorandum of Findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever made any threat of violence against any person, other than Heath. The alleged threat against Heath was witnessed by no one outside the family. The suspension letter did not mention that threat. Another alleged threat, to \\"bring down\\" Sarah and her family, was witnessed only by McCann, and she stated that she understood it was not a threat of violence, but rather a threat \\"to make life difficult\\" for them. According to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten has made violent threats against various other members of her family, aside from Heath. For example, on September 15, 2008, Palin said Wooten had made \\"threats of violence\\" against McCann and Palin's nephew. Threats subsequent to April 2005 In September 2008, Palin described Wooten as \\"a trooper who is making threats against the First Family.\\" On September 18 she again mentioned \\"his threats against the First Family.\\" This seems to indicate that Wooten has made threats subsequent to the time that Palin became governor. However, Palin's September 2008 legal filings do not detail any threats that took place after Palin became governor, or at any time since April 11, 2005, when the divorce was filed. Palin's filing on September 1, 2008 said \\"no one in the Palin family ever filed a formal complaint,\\" subsequent to the complaints the family made in 2005. Branchflower said \\"Palin has stated publicly that she and her family feared Trooper Wooten. Yet the evidence presented has been inconsistent with such claims of fear ... she ordered a substantial reduction in manpower in her personal protection detail ..., an act that is inconsistent with a desire to avoid harm from Trooper Wooten ... [Palin's] claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins' real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons.\\"Branchflower Report, page 67 Branchflower wrote that in their first meeting with their security detail, the Palins were specifically asked if they knew of any threats against them. \\"They basically said no.\\"Branchflower Report, page 44 Duration and nature of the restraining order According to the DVPO document itself, the DVPO was temporary, with a nominal 20-day duration. It was issued presumptively on April 11, 2005, based on allegations made by McCann that day, in her written application. The DVPO document indicates that a hearing would be held to determine whether or not the temporary order should be extended into a long- term protective order. That hearing was originally scheduled for April 27 but actually took place on May 9. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved at the May 9 hearing because McCann could not present evidence of violence. On September 2, 2008, Palin said \\"the Anchorage Superior Court [had found] that [Wooten] had engaged in serious, violent misconduct.\\" According to a sworn statement by Todd Palin, the DVPO extended into 2006. On September 16, 2008, the McCain campaign said \\"he [Wooten] is the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order\\", suggesting that the DVPO was still in effect. On October 10, 2008, the McCain campaign said Wooten was the subject of a DVPO \\"in 2005 and early 2006\\". Awareness that Wooten had already been disciplined According to Palin, she and her family were unaware, prior to July 2008, that Wooten had been disciplined in 2006. For example, on September 1, 2008 Palin said that \\"Monegan never told Governor Palin or Todd about the discipline that Wooten received ... the parties involved had no idea how the matter was resolved ... As far as the Palin family knew [as of July 2008], Wooten ... had escaped discipline.\\" In a sworn statement on October 8, 2008, Todd Palin said \\"the DPS never informed me or my wife that Wooten had been disciplined.\\" According to the Branchflower Report, Sarah Palin was aware that Wooten had been disciplined. Branchflower said Palin was \\"apparently intent upon getting Trooper Wooten fired in spite of the fact she knew he had been disciplined following the Administrative Investigation.\\"Branchflower Report, page 66. In a sworn deposition, Monegan said that he did \\"mention [to Sarah Palin] that the discipline had already been imposed on Mr. Wooten during the previous administration following an administrative investigation and that the matter was closed.\\"Branchflower Report, page 25. Branchflower reports that Monegan \\"told Mr. Palin that the matter had been investigated, that discipline had been imposed.\\"Branchflower Report, page 111 The Branchflower Report includes testimony by John Glass, Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, who testified that he told Todd Palin \\"that Wooten had already been penalized for his actions that he had taken.\\"Branchflower Report, page 38 Glass testified that he gave the same information to Frank Bailey, Palin's director of boards and commissions. Glass told Bailey that \\"he should just leave the matter alone since Wooten disciplinary proceeding had already taken and that discipline had already been imposed and the matter was closed.\\"Branchflower Report, page 138 Allegations of misconduct against parties other than Wooten According to a statement by police, the DVPO was dissolved because McCann showed no evidence that Wooten was violent. According to Palin, the DVPO was dissolved because Wooten's superiors intervened. According to Palin, the police investigation was \\"negligently or deliberately slipshod ... investigators seemed more concerned about exonerating Wooten than protecting public safety or the Palin family.\\" Confidential status of Wooten's personnel file According to the police union ethics complaint, Bailey had improper access to confidential information from Wooten's personnel file. Palin responded by stating that Todd Palin had this information because Wooten had signed a release placing his entire personnel file in the public domain. However, Palin has also claimed that her family was not aware of Wooten's suspension until July 2008. Also, Wooten's release of February 7, 2008, did not place his file in the public domain, it only released his file to McCann's attorneys in connection with the divorce proceedings. Claims about prior discipline According to the suspension letter issued by Col. Grimes, there had been three disciplinary actions against Wooten: a warning, a reprimand, and an Instruction, for such things as \\"not using turn signals\\", in the period prior to April 11, 2005, the date when the divorce was filed and a Domestic Violence Protective Order was issued. According to Palin, \\"Wooten had been disciplined a dozen times before he was the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order from Molly McCann.\\" See also * Governorship of Sarah Palin References External links * Kopp severance agreement * \\"Ethics Disclosure Form\\" filed with State Personnel Board by Palin's attorney, September 1, 2008 * \\"Character Reference for Mike Wooten\\" written by Mayor Palin on January 1, 2000 * Full Abuse of Power Report With Support Documents, October 10, 2008 2008 controversies 2008 in Alaska 2008 in American politics Political scandals in Alaska Sarah Palin Corruption in the United States Political corruption investigations in the United States Commissioner dismissal ","title":"Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal"},{"id":"19096277","text":"Fabian is a 1980 West German drama film directed by Wolf Gremm.

He served briefly in the Idaho House of Representatives in 1979 after being appointed to fill a vacancy by Gov. John V. Evans. He was appointed to the Idaho Senate in 1980, again by Evans to fill a vacancy. Beitelspacher was elected to the Idaho Senate in 1980 from a North Central Idaho based floterial district and reelected throughout the 1980s. Towards the end of his Idaho Senate career Beitelspacher served as the ranking member of the resources and environment committee. He chose not to run for reelection in 1992 after floterial districts were eliminated. Along with several other Democrats, in 1993 Beitelspacher announced his candidacy for Governor of Idaho after it became clear the Democratic incumbent, Cecil D.

Although most of the potential Democratic field dropped out after EchoHawk, the then-attorney general, announced his candidacy in early 1994, Beitelspacher remained in the race.

Rerberg's input to present-day Moscow include Kiyevsky Rail Terminal, Central Telegraph building and the Administration building of Moscow Kremlin. Rerberg, a fourth member in a dynasty of engineers, was credited with innovative approach to structural frames and despised the title of an architect, always signing his drafts Engineer Rerberg. G.

Ivan's elder brother, Fyodor (1863‚Äî1938), became a painter. Ivan was educated in a Cadet Corps, was commissioned into military engineers, and graduated from Saint Petersburg Academy of military engineers in 1896. By this time he had solid practical experience in building dams and roads. In the same year he dropped out of military service and joined the construction team of Kharkov locomotive works. In 1887, Rerberg was hired by Roman Klein as Klein's deputy for structural engineering on the site of Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. Rerberg worked on the museum site for 12 years (1897‚Äî1909) and was awarded an honorary title of its lifetime architect. Simultaneously Rerberg managed other projects of Klein's firm -- Muir & Mirrielees department store (1907‚Äî1908), Moscow State University expansion, Devichye Pole clinics (1897‚Äî1900s), Miusskaya Square college (1903). In 1906‚Äî1909 Rerberg, still an associate of Klein, was gradually switching to independent work. In 1906 he won a contest for the first stage of a large apartment building in Meshchansky District funded by the estate of the late G. G. Solodovnikov. The second stage was designed by Marian Peretyatkovich; construction was managed by Traugott Bardt who completed the project in 1909. This building was styled in a mix of Victorian architecture and Art Nouveau; all subsequent work by Rerberg belonged to the school of Russian neoclassical revival.

Peretyatkovich soon left Moscow, and final, as-build, exterior of the building was shaped by Rerberg alone. This modernized neoclassicism project, completed in 1911, also employed Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky and then unknown trainee Ilya Golosov. Rerberg's career peaked in the five years that preceded World War I. He designed private residences (present-day Embassy of Indonesia), hospitals, colleges, a high school and a shopping arcade. I. A.

In the period of economic collapse that accompanied the Civil War in Russia, Rerberg was employed by three major theaters of Moscow -- Bolshoi, Maly and Moscow Art Theatre. In 1921‚Äî1923 he supervised emergency works on reinforcement of Bolshoi Theater foundations that were flooded by a wash from underground Neglinnaya River. Rerberg published proposals for a thorough renovation of Bolshoy, and these were slowly implemented under his supervision until Rerberg's death. G. M. Scherbo. Ivan Ivanovich I.

Rerberg's draft was authorized in March 1926, and the building was completed in 1927. Rerberg used reinforced concrete frame and moved all staircases outside of main building shell; this resulted in unusually spacious and well- lit open space offices, new to Moscow construction. Large public area actually accounted for only 4% of its 35,000 meters; most of the space was occupied by actual telegraph and mail-sorting equipment, while 20% were allocated to house the Commissar of Communications with his staff. Later, the space taken by equipment was gradually reduced in favor of offices. S. B. Kiselev.

It is situated alongside the small hamlet of Frogmill, on the southern side of the stretch of river above Hurley Lock, and is within the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead unitary authority. The island is very low-lying, such that it is covered with water whenever the Thames floods. It is now heavily wooded, but up until the 1920s it and the adjacent Frog Mill Ait were without vegetation. This was because the towpath was (and still is) on the southern side of the island whilst the boats being towed along by horses had to keep to the main navigation channel on the northern side of the river. The tow lines had to sweep over the islands, and the angle of tow was such that barges could be pulled aground onto the islands. Names The island is at the point where Black Boy Lane meets the Thames. This lane leads from the A4130 Henley Road, the main road from Maidenhead to Henley. Where the lane meets the main road is Black Boys Inn, which claims to date back to the 16th century. In common with various such inns around the country, the inn is said to be named after Charles II who was so dark as a child that his mother called him \\"Black Boy\\". The lane next to it took the same name, as the island formed directly alongside Black Boy Lane it has come to share the name. Another curious nearby name is an old house called \\"Poisson Duc\\", locally corrupted to Poison Duck.

The West section of the site is a quiet zone (no radios allowed). Group camping is available in the east section. Many sites along the east portion of the park back up against the Sauble River. The park is also the downstream terminus of the Rankin River canoe route. History Sauble Falls Provincial Park opened in 1957 after lands were acquired from Ontario Hydro (owners of hydro electric plant and dam built in 1905-1907 by then Sauble Falls Light and Power) and from other owners.http://www.ghosttownpix.com/ontario/intros/sauble.html The former town of Sauble Falls existed from 1864 to 1949 to service a lumber mill (destroyed in 1937). The park office, parts of dam and bridge are the only town structure in intact. Nearby attractions The main summer attractions of the area consist of the Sauble Falls and Sauble Beach. The river meanders around the east section of the park and flows down under the highway to the falls. The majority of the falls are actually rapids to which many people take day trips to play in. There is a section in which people jump from a drop off into a pool in the river. Also in certain years it is possible to slide down the falls if water levels are high enough. The other main summer attraction is Sauble Beach, a fresh water beach at least long.

It was chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot Julius is an ambitious packaging designer, a partner in a prestigious firm. He is cheating on Paula, his wife of 12 years, with his secretary. However when, on their wedding anniversary, he discovers a love- bite on Paula's neck, his life falls apart. She admits to having a lover, who is a penniless freelance artist. Julius moves out, but finds Stefan, the artist, and contrives to share his apartment, calling himself \\"Daniel\\". The two men become friends, going to hockey games together, drinking, and discussing life in general and women in particular. When Paula comes to visit, Julius feigns eccentricity, wearing a gorilla mask the whole time and refusing to speak. Julius begins turning Stefan into a commercial artist, persuading him to give up his bohemian lifestyle and to dress and behave more like a businessman. This causes Paula to lose interest and Julius starts to win her back. Meanwhile Stefan interviews for jobs, one of which happens to be at the same design firm where Julius works. In the final scenes, Julius and Stefan meet at work. Stefan realizes he has been deceived. The two men have a confrontation with Stefan symbolically stripping down to his underwear and Julius doing the same. They then laugh at each other. The film ends with Paula arriving at the agency, not realizing what she is about to witness. In the office building where Julius works there is an unusual kind of elevator known as a paternoster, consisting of a continuous chain of small elevator cars that move slowly enough for people to step in and out at each floor. This is used to comic effect in the film, with Julius and Stefan having their argument in their underwear in one of the downward-traveling cars, while Paula is coming to see Julius in one of the upward cars. During the credits the crew go past in the cars as their names appear on the screen.

He is against the creation of regional benches of the Supreme Court of India.

It featured Ian Maclaine, Liam Redmond, James Hayter, Geoffrey Keen, and Arthur Lowe. The film was shot during the summer of 1958 and set around London's Tower Bridge from which the film takes its name. Synopsis Believing his widowed father, Pat Doyle (Liam Redmond) to have killed a man and that the police, having arrested him, will soon come to put him in a children‚Äôs home, Tommy Doyle (Ian MacLaine), a little cockney boy, runs away from his Bermondsey lodgings and seeks sanctuary within the confines of his dream castle, Tower Bridge. He makes his home in a room at the top of the north tower, coming and going without being seen and, bit by bit, furnishing it with all the ingenuity of a nine year old boy. Here, he makes one friend, a seagull he names Sammy. To the boy, the bridge is a living character with a personality of its own and the catwalks, staircases, engine rooms and bascule chambers are a magic world in which he is king. Although he takes care not to be seen, the maintenance staff become aware of a strange ‚Äúpresence‚Äù and their fears are confirmed when one night, Tommy saves the life of a suicidal woman who is about to jump off the bridge into the river. \\"DON'T\\", he yells down to her, \\"DON'T JUMP OFF MY BRIDGE!\\" The woman is so startled by this voice from somewhere up there, that she changes her mind, believing the voice to be of a supernatural origin. The next day, the newspapers follow up with the story that a protective spirit presides over the bridge. Searching ceaselessly for his son, his father is suddenly confronted by Tommy on the bridge. Following the boy to the top of the tower, he realises that the building has become father, mother and home to the boy, all the things that he should have been. He explains to Tommy that the bridge was built to bring people together and has brought them together too and, as Sammy flies away to join his own kind, Tommy agrees to come home.

These were placed between beams and joists in buildings‚Äô ceilings and eaves. Their origin is typically medieval but subsequent production of these objects is known, mainly in Valencia. There are other words to name objects with similar function such as rajola, ma√≥ prim, atov√≥ or cair√≥. The first register about its existence takes us back to 1604, when D. Feliciano de Figueroa, Bishop of Segorbe, refers to a group of roof and wall tiles written and coloured with koranic transcripts. Traditionally, they‚Äôre said to come from Paterna but the presence of these and other similar objects has been documented too in Manises and in some other places in Valencia, Aragon and Catalonia. http://www.avec.com/lcv/cap11.pdf Socarrat can also refer to the scorched rice crust that forms on the bottom of the pan when cooking paella.  Usage  Socarrats were mainly manufactured in two basic sizes: the smaller with 30 x 15 x 3 cm and the larger with 40 x 30 x 3 cm (approximate measures). The first one could be used in buildings in two main ways: decorating eaves (the lower edges of a roof that project over the walls) either leaning on walls or on joists. They could also be used in ornamental friezes, in balconies and staircases. The largest tiles filled the space between joists on interior ceilings, with both structural and decorative functions, supporting pavements or roofs. The smaller size could carry out the same function. Socarrats were frequently reused to build new walls and levelling out pavements.  Manufacturing  There‚Äôs a wide debate in what concerns to socarrat manufacturing. Being objects with ceramic base, controversy starts when one considers the stages that occur after drying the moulded ceramic paste. Gonz√°lez Mart√≠ and Blat Mons√≥ are the most representative authors on this subject. According to Gonz√°lez Mart√≠, the dry tile should be covered with a kaolin based earth and painted with iron and manganese oxides. Then, it should be fired and the result should be a matte decoration. The existence of a firing process and the nature of pigments were not always clear. Before Gonz√°lez Mart√≠, some authors have referred the lime used to decorate socarrats could not have been fired after application on the tile. Afterwards, Blat Mons√≥ and others have reinforced this statement.  Iconography  There are three basic types of representations in socarrats: religious, magic and social ones. The first one includes crosses and inscriptions, such as the koranic verses written on the socarrats of the Xara mosque in Valdigna. Fatima‚Äôs hands or Hamsa, boats, towers, animals and chimeric figures such as Butoni, a monster in the valencian imaginary are part of the second type of representations. The use of heraldic symbols and decorated elements made visible in public spaces and the representation of courtesan and satiric scenes fulfilled the third one.

Its headquarters is at 1845 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with showrooms in New York City, Memphis, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Hong Kong. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes seasonal and everyday greeting cards and novelties. City Stores Company, 1923‚Äì1985 City Stores was a holding company, incorporated in the state of Delaware, that owned directly or indirectly all or a substantial majority of the stocks of several department and specialty stores in six states. It eventually controlled 39 stores in 19 states. The stores were serviced by a New York resident buying corporation, City Stores Mercantile Company, Inc., a subsidiary wholly owned by City Stores. In the 1950s, City Stores merged with Specialty Stores Co becoming City Specialty Stores. City Stores started in 1923 with the acquisition of three department stores: B. Lowenstein, Inc., of Memphis, Tennessee; Maison Blanche Co., of New Orleans, Louisiana; and Loveman, Joseph & Loeb, of Birmingham, Alabama. The following year City Stores purchased Kaufman-Straus Co. of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1928, the company acquired a majority interest in Lit Brothers of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, later merging it into City Stores' operations in 1951. After going into receivership in 1931, City Stores Company could no longer meet its financial obligation to Bankers Securities Corporation (B.S.C.), the owner of Lit Brothers. Albert M. Greenfield was then installed as Chairman of the Board, a position he would hold for over 20 years. In 1944, City Stores acquired control of R.H. White, a Boston, Massachusetts, department store. In 1946, the company acquired Richards of Miami, Florida. City Stores purchased a majority interest in two New York based women's specialty clothing stores, Oppenheim, Collins & Co. in 1945 and Franklin Simon & Co. in 1949. The two companies were later merged as Franklin Simon & Co.. The company expanded its holdings of department stores with the acquisition in 1948, of Wise, Smith & Co. of Hartford, Connecticut, and Lansburgh's of Washington, D.C., in 1951. In 1961, City Stores acquired the W. & J. Sloane chain of 30 furniture stores in California, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and other states along the east coast. W. & J. Sloane purchased a building at a prime location on Fifth Avenue in New York City from Franklin Simon. In 1966, City Stores acquired Wolf & Dessauer Co. of Fort Wayne, Indiana, but sold the company in 1969, along with Kaufman-Straus to L. S. Ayres. The 1970s brought the company a large decline in sales and the need to liquidate assets. The company discontinued operations at Lansburgh's in 1973, and Lit Brothers in 1977. After several years of low profits or net losses, City Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1979. Under the reorganization plan, City Stores closed 42 Franklin Simon & Co. stores, Hearns Department Store, and the eight Richards stores. In 1980, Loveman, Joseph & Loeb and R.H. White department stores closed and B. Lowenstein Bros. stores were consolidated with Maison Blanche. City Stores was dismantled completely through the bankruptcy process after acquisition by Philadelphia Industries Inc. (PII). Jack Farber, president of PII, became chairman of City Stores and was elected CEO in February 1980. Farber closed or discontinued the remaining department store operations in 1982, and by 1985 liquidated the remaining assets of W. & J. Sloane. CSS Industries, Inc. 1985‚ÄìPresent CSS Industries was established by Farber in 1985, with a new name to reflect a diversified strategy. CSS completed its first acquisition in January 1985 with the purchase of Rapidforms, Inc. of Thorofare, New Jersey.Rapidforms - About designed and manufactured a variety of business forms. It was sold in December 1997. In 1986, CSS acquired Ellisco Co., a manufacturer of metal containers in standard and customized formats. Ellisco's manufacturing locations included sites in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia. CSS sold the subsidiary to U.S. Can in 1994.. CSS added gift wrap and related products to its line of businesses with the 1988 acquisition of Paper Magic Group. Paper Magic designed, manufactured, and distributed seasonal and everyday paper products for gift giving and holiday celebrations. The company also obtained licenses to produce certain products with imprints of cartoon characters, including Care Bears, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Walt Disney characters. In 1991, Paper Magic acquired Spearhead Industries of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a manufacturer of Halloween and Easter products. In 1995 Paper Magic acquired Cleo, Inc., a manufacturer of gift wrap and trim, primarily for the Christmas season, as well as Topstone Industries, Inc., a manufacturer of Halloween products and novelties, and Illusive Concepts, a manufacturer of latex masks, accessories and decorative displays. In 1993, CSS acquired Berwick Industries, Inc., a ribbon and bow manufacturer and integrated it into Paper Magic. In March 2002, Berwick acquired business assets of C. M. Offray & Son, Inc. (a producer and supplier of narrow woven ribbon) and merged them into Berwick. In August 2008, Berwick Offray LLC acquired Hampshire Paper Corp., a manufacturer and supplier of waxed tissue, paper, foil and foil decorative packaging to the wholesale floral and horticultural industries. In the mid-2000s, CSS was reorganized into three affiliates: Berwick Offray (the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of decorative ribbons and bows); Cleo (the premier provider of seasonal gift packaging products); and the Paper Magic Group (a manufacturer of a vast array of seasonal merchandise - ranging from greeting cards to Halloween costumes). The C. R. Gibson business was acquired on December 3, 2007, and in May 2008, it acquired iota, a designer, marketer and seller of stationery products, such as note cards, gift wrap and journals. CSS announced on May 25, 2011, that Cleo would be shut down as of December 31, 2011. CSS acquired the McCall Pattern Company (parent of Butterick and Vogue Patterns).

It was the first of Scott Joplin's rags to appear in print, in early 1899, preceding his \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" by half a year.  Publication history  The tune's copyright was registered on March 15, 1899, and it was first published by Carl Hoffman of Kansas City, Missouri.Jasen, David A. (ed) Scott Joplin: Complete Piano Rags. 1988. New York: Dover Publications, Inc. pp. 1-2. The original cover page showed an elderly black man picking up rags in front of a ramshackle cabin, and has been interpreted as a double pun, first on the activities of a rag (or junk) picker, and second on a slang term for ragtime, \\"picking the piano\\". Rudi Blesh, \\"Scott Joplin: Black-American Classicist\\", Introduction to Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works, New York Public Library, 1981, p. xx. The rag was given the following credits: :::Picked By Scott Joplin :::Arranged By Chas. N. Daniels. It is not known whether Charles N. Daniels actually arranged the piece, or merely transcribed it. Joplin biographer Rudi Blesh thought it more likely that the credit to Daniels was the publisher's way of acknowledging his help in recommending the piece for publication; Blesh wrote that the music was \\"unmistakably Joplin\\" in style.  Structure  The composition has the following musical structure: :::Introduction AA BB CC Modulation A DD EE.Rudi Blesh, \\"Scott Joplin: Black- American Classicist\\", Introduction to Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works, New York Public Library, 1981, p. xxi. The rag is not in the sequence \\"AA BB A CC DD\\" more typical of Joplin. Like the posthumously published \\"Reflection Rag\\", it features five themes, but the \\"Original Rag\\" delays reentry of the first theme until after the modulation. The piece is mostly in G major except for the \\"C\\" section, which is in C major, and the \\"D\\" section (marked \\"Brilliant\\" in the sheet music), which is in D major. Ragtime historians have commented on the harmonic similarity between the \\"D\\" section of \\"Original Rags\\" and the \\"A\\" section of H. O. Wheeler's \\"A Virginny Frolic\\" published by Carl Hoffman the year before. Blesh appreciated it as \\"a charming and auspicious beginning to the life work of the master ragtime composer\\".

He was born in Orange, France. From 1862 he served as assistant to his father-in-law, √âmile Perrin, at the Paris Op√©ra. From 1870, he was co-director at the Op√©ra- Comique with Adolphe de Leuven, and sole director from 1874 to 1876. He is best remembered for mounting the original production of Bizet's Carmen in 1875.Huebner 1992. Du Locle was responsible for completing the libretto of Verdi's Don Carlos (1867) after the death of Joseph M√©ry. He also played a key role in the genesis of Aida in 1869‚Äì70.Budden 1985, p. 105. According to Charles Pigot, Du Locle inspired the subject, words and music of Bizet's Djamileh (1872).Dean 1978, pp. 94‚Äì95. He was a pall-bearer at Bizet's funeral in 1875 and made a speech at his interment at P√®re Lachaise.Dean 1978, p. 128.

Archive copy (22 April 2019). In Capri he was known for his reclusiveness, short temper, and sharp tongue. He often went around in a French suit, causing him to be regarded as a bit eccentric. One day he started attracting attention by wearing a suit and cape made of rough, uncoloured wool, a fabric usually only worn by fishermen. Soon many of the Germans and English on the island adopted attire made of similar material, which stimulated a local industry of hand- woven wool cloth which persisted until machine-made fabrics took over several decades later.Steegmuller 1982, p. 260. His friendship with Ernest Reyer led to him providing libretti for Sigurd (1884) and Salammb√¥ (1890). Du Locle died in Capri in 1903. Notes Bibliography * Budden, Julian (1985). Verdi.

It is based on the 1923 novel by Joseph Roth. It was chosen as West Germany's official submission to the 62nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but did not manage to receive a nomination. The film was the last ever submission by West Germany, due to German reunification in 1990, Germany competed at the 63rd Academy Awards as a single country. The film was also entered into the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot  The film centers on young right-wing Leutnant (lieutenant) Theodor Lohse (Ulrich M√ºhe) who suffers personal and national humiliation during the downfall of the German Empire and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918 as the aftermath of World War I, from whence on he pledges revenge on all those he blames for the new times: Democrats, socialists, and Jews. Thus, he becomes increasingly active in the right-wing underground of the early Weimar Republic, joining an organization called \\"S II\\" (probably based on real-life Organisation Consul that was responsible for a number of political and anti-Semitic assassinations) where his immediate superior is Baron von Rastchuk (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Baron von Rastchuk brings Lohse in contact with Prince Heinrich in order to get Lohse employed, a favor for which the homosexual Prince demands one-time bodily obligingness from Lohse. In spite of his apparent shock and disgust, Lohse yields to the Prince out of his opportunism and willingness to please his superiors. Lohse becomes a full-time spy for the organization, and with unprecedented, relentless opportunism and unscrupulousness he spies in on Communist plots, partakes in the organization's plans to undermine the new German democracy, and disposes of his own right-wing colleagues when he sees fit, all of which to serve his own plans of rising to the top within right- wing circles. During these activities he comes in contact with Benjamin Lenz (Klaus Maria Brandauer), a Jewish man dealing in information on all kinds of criminal and underground political proceedings who will always sell at the highest price, be it paid by left or right-wing conspirators or the police. In spite of Lohse's hatred of Jews, he finds Lenz's services useful, but soon finds himself at his mercy as Lenz through their collaboration finds out more and more about Lohse's schemes and spy activities. When Lenz learns that Lohse ordered a pogrom of the local Jewish ghetto, he confronts the rather short and slim-built Lohse in private, beating him close to senselessness and almost forces Lohse to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, until he realizes that killing Lohse would not make him any better than the anti-Semite that had ordered the violence in the ghetto. Lohse then has his henchmen murder Lenz, also because he knew too much, by pushing him in front of an approaching train. The film ends in late 1923 with Lohse leaving a festivity of conservatives and monarchists, declaring that restoring the monarchy has by now become \\"old hat\\", and with glowing eyes he mentions a \\"new man\\" preparing a putsch in Munich to count on - a man named Adolf Hitler.

It tells the story of a salesman and a beautiful woman who fall in love with each other and develop a relationship. Plot Ted Riker (Michael Keaton) is the top salesman in the New York office of business machine company Bineview. The corporate stock lives by quarterly sales numbers, the competition is very intense, and the economy may be headed into a downturn. Ted's company is marking time until a revolutionary new product is ready, probably within a few months. Some competitors may know something about this secret innovation, through industrial espionage, and fear its impact on the market. A new company hire, callow Midwesterner Jamie Bashant (Brendan Fraser), has moved east with his lovely fianc√©e Belisa (Amber Valletta). Jamie and Belisa are a young couple just starting out, and Jamie has to learn the business as a trainee. Ted is very successful, but also cynical, hard-driving, profane, obnoxious, abusive, and a lousy team player. He has few if any friends in the company, but his shortcomings are tolerated because his output is so outstanding. Ted, assigned to train Jamie, watches Jamie struggle, failing with presentation after presentation; Ted tries, in vain, to help Jamie improve his performance and make a few sales, even giving one of his own sure deals to Jamie, who messes it up. Bashant and Riker head to the sales conference and Riker runs into Leguzza. Then, Ted is introduced to Belisa through normal company friendship, and discovers that he is now in love with her. Belisa is impressed by Ted's success and confident manner and also falls in love with him. They then have sex, and do their best to keep this secret from Jamie, who is worried about being fired because of his weak output. Ted and Belisa then go to Ted's place and sleep with each other, before going to Atlantic City, and having sex in a hotel room. Ted confesses to Belisa that he has a failed love in his past, which affected him very deeply, leading to a career switch from college literature professor at Northwestern University near Chicago (a job he loved) to hard-driving star salesman in New York. Belisa does her best to comfort him. Later that night in bed after sex, the two discover a shared interest in Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, which Belisa studied at college and Ted taught every semester. Ted spends increasingly more time with Belisa and away from the office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to Jamaica and decides to marry Ted. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman (Daniel Stern) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to Atlantic City for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's new relationship with Belisa is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or return messages, fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and marry Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a nervous breakdown. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to Ohio together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to marry him. Ted goes to the office to find the company has been taken over by a competing firm that was able to buy the company cheap because poor sales at all the offices lowered the stock price drastically. The office is being closed with dozens of staff personnel being fired, including Manager Whitman. Despite the news, Ted is happy and leaves to go see Belisa at her home. When he gets there she is gone and her house is now empty except for a few boxes stacked in the living room. In the boxes Ted finds evidence that Jamie and Belisa were actually working together to destroy his sales performance. Jamie and Belisa are seen at a party with the president of the competing firm which has just purchased Bineview. It is revealed that the bumbling Jamie is actually a ruthless leader of a team of double agents sent by this competing firm to infiltrate Bineview. The top salesperson at each office has been targeted by one of the double agents, each having their sales performance ruined in different ways, as part of a strategy to weaken the company in preparation for this corporate takeover. Leguzza explains how he desired to purchase a company but wanted to get it at a cheap price. So he put together a group to cull the company the animals in order to weaken their sales so he would be able to purchase the company. As Jamie explains how he and Belisa were able to distract Ted, destroying his sales performance, his gloating clearly disgusts Belisa who realises that Ted is her true boyfriend. She leaves the party to go to Ted who is seen packing up all his belongings. Jamie confronts his true employer, the corporate shark who masterminded the whole stratagem to gain control of a new, innovative, Bineview business machine, and demands his money using knowledge of the employer's embarrassing sexual proclivity as blackmail. When Belisa arrives at Ted's loft he is already gone, so she goes to her home to find him. As Ted is shown on the road to an unknown destination, she discovers a personal message from Ted in a volume of Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray which he has left behind for her. With the knowledge that Ted knows the truth and is taking a break from her, Belisa is left broken-hearted. The movie closes with a smiling and contented Ted arriving at Northwestern University to return to the job he truly loves, teaching.

A Democrat, Squadron was elected a New York State Senator in 2008, and was a candidate in the 2013 race for New York Public Advocate. In August 2017, he resigned from the NY State Senate to work with entrepreneur Adam Pritzker and Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University to launch Future Now, a national initiative to promote \\"policies focused on creating a better, healthier, fairer future.\\" Early life Daniel Squadron was born in 1979. His mother is Anne Strickland Squadron, and his father was Howard Squadron of Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld and Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. His brother, Bill Squadron, was the head of Bloomberg Sports. Squadron attended the private Fieldston School and graduated from Yale University in 2003. During his junior year, he cofounded and managed What Bar, a bar near Columbia University. Career Early career Squadron served as a consultant to New York City's Department of Education and worked as a staffer on Congressman Anthony Weiner's 2005 mayoral campaign. He served as an aide to U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, helping the New York senator with his book Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time (2007).'' State Senate Squadron ran for the 25th district of the New York State Senate in 2008. He received the endorsements of Schumer, Congressman Anthony Weiner, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Assisted by family friends, Schumer supporters, and an aggressive campaign strategy, Squadron defeated incumbent state senator Martin Connor and took 54% of the vote. On November 6, 2012, Squadron was elected to the state senate again, this time to represent the 26th district. He beat his Republican opponent, J. Haro, 86% to 14%. Squadron won reelection in 2014 in a landslide over Republican candidate Wave Chan; and he ran unopposed in 2016, running on both the Democratic and Working Families Party lines. Squadron's platform included opposition to luxury development in Brooklyn Bridge Park. He negotiated a deal that reduced and delayed housing in the park, and has been credited with returning $11 million in capital funding that had been cut from the park's budget. Squadron also secured millions for a waterfront park project on the Lower East Side at Pier 42, along with Schumer, and also helped secure the future of Governors Island. Squadron's proposal to link New York's wealthiest parks conservancies with under-resourced neighborhood parks resulted in hundreds of millions in new funding for community parks. In 2010, Squadron sponsored the law that brought billions in federal dollars to New York City's public housing. Squadron also passed legislation expanding middle class eligibility for the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program. Squadron's tenure included a noted focus on ethics and campaign finance reform.

Squadron also unsuccessfully pushed to close the \\"LLC Loophole,\\" which allows nearly unlimited, often anonymous campaign contributions to flood the political process. On August 9, 2017, Squadron announced his resignation from the Senate in an opinion piece published in the Daily News. He cited \\"heavily invested special interests\\" and \\"cynical political deals,\\" adding: \\"And the status quo has proven extraordinarily durable: It barely shuddered when the leaders of both legislative chambers [Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver] were convicted of corruption.\\" Race for New York City Public Advocate In the race for Public Advocate, Squadron had the endorsements of mentor Senator Chuck Schumer, and former Public Advocates Betsy Gotbaum and Mark Green. Squadron placed second in the primary and advanced to an October 2013 runoff primary, which he lost to Letitia James, by 59% to 41%.  Post-Senate Career  In August 2017, Squadron announced he would be working with entrepreneur Adam Pritzker and Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University on a national initiative focused on \\"stronger candidates, a sharpened approach and better policies at the state level,\\" emphasizing \\"policies focused on creating a better, healthier, fairer future.\\" In October 2017, that initiative was launched as Future Now. Personal life Squadron is married to Elizabeth Weinstein, a former director in Mayor Bloomberg's Office of Operations. The couple were set up by Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, for whom Weinstein worked as chief of staff at the New York City Department of Transportation.

He is venerated as a beatus by the Catholic Church. Life Prior to his entering the Dominican Order, Carino, was, according to Catholic tradition, a cruel man without scruples who had been hired by Milanese Cathars to kill Peter, a prominent Catholic inquisitor. Carino was a native of Cinisello Balsamo. The murder took place on April 6, 1252, when Peter was returning from Como to Milan. Carino's accomplice was named Manfredo Clitoro, of Giussano. The two assassins followed Peter as far as Barlassina, murdering him and mortally wounding Peter's companion Domenico at a lonely spot. Carino split Peter‚Äôs head open, and mortally wounded Domenico. When he found that Peter was still breathing, he stabbed him with a dagger. Carino fled to a Dominican monastery at Forl√¨, and confessed his crime to Giacomo Salomoni of Venice, also venerated as a beatus. Carino performed penances and become a lay brother there. Manfredo subsequently fled from the authorities and may have found refuge amongst the Waldenses in the Alps. Veneration After his death, Carino was venerated by the people of Forl√¨. The regulation of Carino's cult by the papacy began in 1822, but the death of Pius VII delayed the process, and the paperwork was misplaced. Carino is buried at the Cathedral of Forl√¨, and in 1934, Cinisello Balsamo obtained Carino's head, a translation at which Blessed Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster participated. Carino's feast day is celebrated on April 28, the day of this translation.

In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in France by Jean-Jacques Poech, although they were mistaken for giant bird eggs. The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew in Mongolia.

Dinosaur eggshell can be studied in thin section and viewed under a microscope. The interior of a dinosaur egg can be studied using CAT scans or by gradually dissolving away the shell with acid.

The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered serendipitously in 1923 by an American Museum of Natural History crew while looking for evidence of early humans in Mongolia.\\"First Discoveries,\\" Carpenter (1999); page 4. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore Protoceratops, but are now known to be Oviraptor eggs. Egg discoveries continued to mount all over the world, leading to the development of multiple competing classification schemes. In 1975 Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zi-Kui started a revolution in fossil egg classification by developing a system of \\"parataxonomy\\" based on the traditional Linnaean system which classified eggs based on their physical qualities rather than their hypothesized mothers. Zhao's new method of egg classification was hindered from adoption by Western scientists due to language barriers. However, in the early 1990s Russian paleontologist Konstantin Mikhailov brought attention to Zhao's work in the English language scientific literature. Identification Fossil dinosaur eggshell fragments can be recognized based on three important traits. Their thickness should be roughly uniform, they are usually slightly curved, and their surface is covered in tiny pores. Less frequently, the concave underside of the eggshell fragment will preserve bumps known as mammillae. Sometimes the embryo had absorbed so much of the calcium that the mammilae need a magnifying glass or microscope to be seen. However, there are many kinds of naturally occurring objects which can resemble fossil eggs. These can fool even professional paleontologists. Fossilized dinosaur egg from the Gobi desert, National Museum in Prague False eggs Calculus: Calculi are egg-like objects formed in the stomachs of ruminants such as cattle, deer, elk, and goats. Calculus formation is a defense mechanism protecting the ruminant's stomach from damage if it swallows a foreign object while grazing. After ingestion, the object is covered by the same material composing bone, calcium phosphate, and eventually vomited out of the animal's system. These \\"stomach stones\\" tend to range in size from 1 to 6 centimeters. Larger sizes are known but very rare. Sometimes tiny dimples cover the surface of a stomach stone, which can fool observers into thinking they are the pores of an egg. Fossil egg expert Ken Carpenter has described stomach stones as the most egg- like natural objects, noting that they are \\"the trickiest [egg-like] objects to correctly identify\\". Calculi are so egg-like that on one occasion a detailed description of a stomach stone misidentified as a fossil egg was published in the scientific literature. Calculi can be distinguished from real egg fossils because when they are broken open, they show the layers of calcium phosphate and the foreign object at the core. Multiple layers of eggshell are known in pathological eggs, but these layers don't go all the way down to its core the way a stomach stone's do. Calculi are often suspiciously intact, unlike fossil eggs, which are usually damaged. Stomach stones also lack distinct shells with their attending structural components like continuous or prismatic layers, mammillae, and pores. Concretions: Concretions are formed when decaying organisms change the chemistry of their immediate surroundings in a manner that is conducive to minerals precipitating out of solution. These minerals accumulate in a mass roughly shaped like the region of altered chemistry. Sometimes the is egg-shaped. Most egg-shaped concretions have uniform interiors, however some form through the accumulation of mineral in layers. These layered concretions can be even harder to recognize than those with uniform interiors because the layers can resemble egg white and yolk. The yellow of the false yolk comes from minerals like limonite, siderite, and sulfur. Concretions also generally lack distinct shells, although sometimes they can appear to have them if their outside surfaces have been case- hardened. Since their interiors are softer, erosion can separate the two, creating eggshell pseudofossils. Real egg fossils should preserve eggshell structures like pores, mammillae, and prismatic or continuous layers, which are not present in concretions. Any given concretion is unlikely to be exactly the same size as any other, so associations of egg-like objects of different sizes are probably not real eggs at all. Concretions can also be far larger than any real egg so an apparently unnaturally large \\"egg\\" has probably been misidentified. Insect trace fossils: Sometimes the living or breeding chambers of an insect burrow are so perfectly egg-shaped that even a paleontologist can mistake a natural cast of these chambers for a fossil egg. Insect burrow fossils can sometimes be distinguished from real egg fossils by the presence of \\"scratch marks\\" on their surface left by the insect during the burrow's original excavation. Fossil insect pupae can also resemble eggs. After death and burial, the decomposition of a deceased pupa would leave a gap in the sediment that could be filled with minerals carried by groundwater, forming an egg-like cast. These pseudo-eggs can be recognized by their small size (usually not much longer than a centimeter or two) and lack of an eggshell with its typical anatomy. Stones: The erosive effects of water can sometimes round rocks into egg-like shapes.  Findings  Heyuan's museum boasts the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of dinosaur eggs, with 10,008 individual samples as of 2004. Dinosaur skeletons and fossilized footprints have also been found nearby. A dinosaur egg fossil dated back to the Late Cretaceous was discovered by primary school student named Zhang Yangzhe while playing near the Dong River in 2019 in July. The boy's mother, Li Xiaofang, later contacted the Heyuan Dinosaur Museum members, and under their excavation guidance more than 10 dinosaur egg fossils each about 9 centimeters in diameter and dating back to 66 million years were revealed. Structure Paleontologists' knowledge of the structure of dinosaur eggs is limited to the hard shell. However, it can be inferred that dinosaur eggs had an amnion, chorion, and an allantois, the three major membranes in modern bird and reptile eggs. Dinosaur eggs vary greatly in size and shape, but even the largest dinosaur eggs (Megaloolithus) are smaller than the largest known bird eggs, which were laid by the extinct elephant bird. Dinosaur eggs range in shape from spherical to highly elongated (some specimens three times longer than they are wide). Some elongated eggs are symmetrical, whereas others have one rounded end and one pointed end (similar to bird eggs). Most elongated eggs were laid by theropods and have an avian-like eggshell, whereas the spherical eggs typically represent non-theropod dinosaurs. Diagram of a two- layered eggshell. Fossil dinosaur eggshells, like modern bird and reptile eggshells, are made up of calcium carbonate crystal units. The basic arrangement and structure of these eggshell units (called the ultrastructure) is used to divide fossil eggs into several basic types, including the spherulitic, prismatic, and ornithoid basic types, which contain dinosaurs. Dinosaur eggs further classified by the microstructural aspects of the crystalline structure of the eggshell units and by the type of their pores and their shell ornamentation. Layers Dinosaur eggshells are divided into one, two, or three layers of distinct ultrastructure. The innermost layer, known as the mammillary layer or the cone layer, is only found in theropod eggs (the prismatic and ornithoid basic types). It is composed of cone-shaped structures called mammillae at the base of each shell unit. Mammillae are the first part of the eggshell to form. Each mammilla forms from crystals radiating outward from an organic core until they touch neighboring mammillae and grow upwards into the next layer.Laura E. Wilson, Karen Chin, Frankie D. Jackson, and Emily S. Bray. II. Eggshell morphology and structure. UCMP Online Exhibits: Fossil Eggshell In spherulitic eggs, the eggs of non-theropod dinosaurs, the eggshell units grow upward from their organic cores; the base of each eggshell unit is rounded, but is not a true mammilla because it does not have a distinct ultrastructure from the top of the unit. The second layer is alternately called the prismatic layer, the columnar layer, the continuous layer, the crystalline layer, the cryptoprismatic layer,Simon, D. J. (2014). \\"Giant Dinosaur (theropod) Eggs of the Oogenus Macroelongatoolithus (Elongatoolithidae) from Southeastern Idaho: Taxonomic, Paleobiogeographic, and Reproductive Implications.\\" (Doctoral dissertation, Montana State University, Bozeman). the palisade layer, the spongy layer, or the single layer. In this layer, the shell units can be distinct, partially fused together, or entirely continuous. In some dinosaur eggs, the prismatic layer exhibits squamatic ultrastructure, where the prismatic structure is obscured by a rough texture resembling lizard skin. Though rare in non-avian dinosaurs, some theropod eggs and most bird eggs have a third layer (known as the external layer) made up of vertical calcite crystals. Pore canals In all eggs, the embryo must breathe. In egg-laying amniotes (including dinosaurs), pore canals cutting through the eggshell allow gas exchange between the embryo and the outside world. Dinosaur eggshells exhibit a lot of diversity in pore size, density, and shape. One early attempt at classification of dinosaurian eggs, proposed by the Soviet paleontologist A. Sochava, was based on grouping eggs by their pore systems. This system was abandoned when it was discovered that different eggs could have very similar pores, but pore systems do play an important role in modern eggshell parataxonomy. The density and width of the pores, combined with the eggshell's thickness can be used to predict the gas conductance of a dinosaur's egg. This can provide both information about nesting behavior and about the climate: eggs buried in sediment have higher rates of gas conductance than those laid in the open, and eggs laid in arid environments have lower gas conductance (to prevent water loss) than those laid in more humid conditions.Laura E. Wilson, Karen Chin, Frankie D. Jackson, and Emily S. Bray. V. Paleobiology and eggs. UCMP Online Exhibits: Fossil Eggshell Paleontologist and fossil egg expert Kenneth Carpenter catalogued six types of pore systems: #Angusticanaliculate - Long, narrow, straight pores with low pore density. These eggs would have a low gas exchange rate, and therefore they were typically laid in dry areas. #Tubocanaliculate - Large diameter pores with funnel-shaped openings on both inner and outer surfaces of the shell. These eggs would have a high gas exchange rate, and therefore were probably buried in humid mounds. #Multicanaliculate - Numerous large, branching, and closely spaced pore canals. They have a high gas exchange rate, so like tubocanaliculate eggs they were probably also buried humid mounds. #Prolatocanaliculate - Pores vary in width throughout their length. Gas exchange water loss rates are variable, so these eggs could have been laid in many different environments. This type is subdivided into foveocanaliculate with larger pore openings, and lagenocanaliculate with narrower pore openings. #Rimocanaliculate - Very narrow slitlike pore canals. This pore system is seen in modern ostriches, so these eggs were laid in open nests, similar to how ostriches do today. #Obliquicanaliculate - These canals cut diagonally through multiple eggshell units instead of going between them like in other pore systems. Obliquicanaliculate pores are only found in a single oogenus: Preprismatoolithus. Ornamentation Unlike most modern eggs, many dinosaur eggs had a rough texture formed by nodes and ridges ornamenting the surface of their shell. This is predominant in Cretaceous dinosaur eggs, but very rare in eggs from the Jurassic or Triassic. Because of the lack of modern analogues, the purpose of eggshell ornamentation is unknown, but many functions have been proposed. Possibly, they provided extra strength to the eggshell without having pore canals too long for adequate gas exchange. They could also have helped keep substrate away from the pore openings of eggs that were buried, but modern turtles and crocodylians which bury their eggs have smooth eggshells, so this adaptation is not necessary for animals which bury their eggs. Another hypothesis, proposed by R. M. Mellon in 1982 in his senior thesis at Princeton University, is that the ridges and nodes would have formed pathways for gas to flow across the surface of the eggshell, preventing accumulation of too much CO2 and aiding the flow of oxygen and water vapor. Since it varies from egg to egg, the texture of an eggshell's ornamentation is useful for classification. Six types of ornamentation were catalogued by Carpenter in 1999: #Compactituberculate - The dome-shaped tops of the shell units form a dense covering of nodes on the surface of the eggshell. This type of ornamentation is most commonly seen in megaloolithids. #Sagenotuberculate - The nodes and ridges form a netlike pattern interspersed with pits and grooves. #Dispersituberculate - Scattered nodes. This ornamentation is seen on the poles of elongated eggs, which may have allowed accumulations CO2 at the poles to escape between the nodes. #Lineartuberculate - Ridges, and chains of ridges and nodes form lines parallel to the long axis of the egg. #Ramotuberculate - Irregular chains of nodes, typically found as a transition between the lineartuberculate midsection and dispersituberculate ends of elongated eggs. #Anastomotuberculate - Ridges similar to lineartuberculate, but instead form wavy, branching, or anastomosing patterns resembling the water ripple marks in sand. Classification The classification of dinosaur eggs is based on the structure of the egg shells viewed in thin section via microscope, although new techniques such as electron backscatter diffraction have been used. There are three main categories of dinosaur eggs: spherulitic (sauropods and hadrosaurs), prismatic, and ornithoid (theropods, including modern birds). Oogenera Oogenera are taxonomic names for types of eggshell. Nearly three dozen oogenera have been named for dinosaur eggs: * Ageroolithus * Apheloolithus * BoletuoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * CairanoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Continuoolithus * Dendroolithus * DictyoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Dispersituberoolithus * EllipsoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * ElongatoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Faveoolithus * HeishanoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Laevisoolithus * MacroolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * MacroelongatoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * MegaloolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * NanshiungoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Oblongoolithus * OvaloolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Pachycorioolithus * ParaspheroolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Phaceloolithus * PlacoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Porituberoolithus * Polyclonoolithus * Preprismatoolithus * PrismatoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * ProtoceratopsidovumThe Palaeobiology Database * Pseudogeckoolithus * ShixingoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Sphaerovum * SpheroolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Spheruprismatoolithus * Stromatoolithus * Subtiliolithus * Tacuarembovum * TrachoolithusThe Palaeobiology Database * Tristraguloolithus * Youngoolithus Therizinosaur nest and eggs in from Dinosaurland in Lyme Regis, England. Embryos Dinosaur embryos, the animal inside the eggs, are very rare but useful to understand ontogeny, heterochrony, and dinosaur systematics. Embryo fossils are known from: * Beibeilong * Citipati * Heyuannia * Lufengosaurus * Lourinhanosaurus * Massospondylus * Maiasaura * Troodon Taphonomy The formation of fossil eggs begins with the original egg itself. Not all eggs that end up fossilizing experience the death of their embryo beforehand. Fossil eggs with open tops are common and could result from the preservation of eggs that hatched successfully. Dinosaur eggs whose embryos died were likely victims of similar causes to those that kill embryos in modern reptile and bird eggs. Typical causes of death include congenital problems, diseases, suffocation from being buried too deep, inimical temperatures, or too much or too little water. Whether or not hatching was successful, burial would begin with sediments gradually entering any large openings in the shell. Even intact eggs are likely to fill with sediment once they crack under the strain of deep burial. Sometimes, though, fossilization can begin fast enough to prevent the eggs from being cracked. If the water table is high enough dissolved minerals like calcite can percolate through the pores of the eggshell. When the egg is completely filled it can become sturdy enough to withstand the weight of the overlying sediments. Not all fossil egg specimens are of complete specimens, however. Individual pieces of eggshell are much more robust than the entire egg and can be transported intact long distances from where they were originally laid. When the egg is buried deeply enough, the bacteria decomposing it no longer have access to oxygen and need to power their metabolisms with different substances. These physiological changes in the decomposers also alter the local environment in a way that allows certain minerals to be deposited, while others remain in solution. Generally, however, a fossilizing egg's shell keeps the same calcite it had in life, which allows scientists to study its original structure millions of years after the developing dinosaur hatched or died. However, eggs can also sometimes be altered after burial. This process is called diagenesis. One form of diagenesis is a microscopic cross-hatched pattern imposed on the eggshell by the pressure of being buried deeply. If the pressure gets severe enough, sometimes the eggshell's internal microscopic structure can be completely destroyed. Diagenesis can also happen chemically in addition to physically. The chemical conditions of a decomposing egg can make it easy for silica to be incorporated into eggshell and damage its structure. When iron-bearing substances alter eggshell it can be obvious because compounds like hematite, pyrite, and iron sulfide can turn the shell blackish or rusty colors. Depositional environments Dinosaur eggs are known from a variety of depositional environments. Beach sands: Beach sands were a good place for dinosaurs to lay their eggs because the sand would be effective at absorbing and holding enough heat to incubate the eggs. One ancient beach deposit in northeastern Spain actually preserves about 300,000 fossil dinosaur eggs. Floodplains: Dinosaurs often laid their eggs on ancient floodplains. The mudstones deposited at these sites are therefore excellent sources of dinosaur egg fossils. Sand dunes: Many dinosaur eggs have been recovered from sandstone deposits that formed in the ancient dune fields of what are now northern China and Mongolia. The presence of Oviraptor preserved in their life brooding position suggests that the eggs, nests, and parents may have been rapidly buried by sandstorms. Excavation and preparation Usually the first evidence of fossil dinosaur eggs to be discovered are shell fragments that have eroded away from the original eggs and been transported downhill by the elements. If the source eggs can be found the area must be examined for more unexposed eggs. If the paleontologists are fortunate enough to have found a nest, the number and arrangement of the eggs must be estimated. Excavation must proceed to significant depth since many dinosaur nests include multiple layers of eggs. As the underside of the nest is excavated, it would be covered by material like newspaper, tin foil, or tissue. Afterwards, the entire block is covered in multiple layers of plaster-soaked strips of burlap. When the plaster is dried, the block is undercut the rest of the way and turned over. The fine work of cleaning the egg fossils is performed in a laboratory. Preparation usually begins from the underside of the block, which tends to be the best preserved. Because of their fragility, cleaning fossil eggs requires patience and skill. Scientists use delicate instruments like dental picks, needles, small pneumatic engraving tools, and X-Acto knives. Scientists must determine at what point to stop cleaning based on their own criteria. If eggs are fully extracted they can be more fully studied individually at the cost of information regarding the spatial relationships between eggs or if the eggs had hatched. Commercial fossil dealers tend to expose only the bottom of the eggs since the topsides might be damaged by hatching and therefore less visually appealing to potential customers. Research techniques Acid dissolution Acids can be used to learn more about fossil eggs. Diluted acetic acid or EDTA can be used to expose the microstructure of shell that has been damaged by weathering. Acids are also used to extract embryo skeletons from the egg encasing them. Even fossilized soft tissue like muscle and cartilage as well as fat globules from the original egg yolk can be uncovered using this method. Amateur paleontologist Terry Manning has been credited with groundbreaking work developing this technique.https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/acid-dissolution-fossil-dinosaur-eggs Last paragraph First, the paleontologist must submerge the egg in a very dilute phosphoric acid bath. Since the acid solution can penetrate the egg, every few days the specimen must be soaked in distilled water to prevent the acid from damaging the embryo before it is even exposed. If embryonic fossil bone is revealed after drying from the water bath, the exposed fossils must be delicately cleaned with fine instruments like needles and paint brushes. The exposed bone is then coated with plastic preservatives like Acryloid B67, Paraloid B72, or Vinac B15 to protect it from the acid when submerged for another round. The complete process can take months before the whole embryo is revealed. Even then only about 20% of the eggs subjected to the process reveal any embryo fossils at all. CAT scans CAT scans can be used to infer the 3D structure of a fossil egg's interior by compiling images taken of slices through the egg in small regular increments. Scientists have tried to use CAT scans to look for embryo fossils contained inside the egg without having to damage the egg itself by physically extracting them. However, as of Ken Carpenter's 1999 book on dinosaur eggs, Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs, all alleged embryos discovered using this method were actually false alarms. Variations in the type of infilling mineral or cement binding the infilling sediment into rock sometimes resemble bones in CAT scan images. Sometimes eggshell fragments that fell back into the egg when it hatched have been mistaken for embryonic bones. The use of CAT scans to search for embryonic remains is actually conceptually flawed since embryonic bones have not yet mineralized. Since the infilling sediment is their only source of minerals they will be preserved at basically the same density and therefore have poor visibility in the scan. The validity of this issue has been confirmed by performing Cat scans on fossil eggs known to have embryos inside and noting their poor visibility in the scan images. The only truly reliable way to discover a dinosaur embryo is to cut the egg open or dissolve some of its eggshell away. Cathodoluminescence Cathodoluminescence is the most important tool paleontologists have for revealing whether or not the calcium in fossil eggshell has been altered. Calcite in eggshell is either pure or rich in calcium carbonate. However, the calcite composing the egg can be altered after burial to include significant calcium content. Cathodoluminescence causes calcite altered in this fashion to glow orange. Gel electrophoresis Gel electrophoresis has been used in attempts to identify the amino acids present in the organic components of dinosaur eggshell. Contact with human skin can contaminate eggs with foreign amino acids, so only untouched eggs can be investigated using this technique. EDTA can be used to dissolve the calcite of the eggshell while leaving the shell's organic content intact. The resultant organic residue would be blended and then implanted into gel. Electricity would then be run through the sample, causing the amino acids to migrate through the gel until they stop at levels determined by their physical properties. Protein silver stain is then used to dye the amino acids and make them visible. The bands of amino acids from the dinosaur eggs can then be compared with the banding of samples with known composition for identification. Gel electrophoresis is not necessarily a perfect means of discovering the amino acid composition of dinosaur eggshell because sometimes the amount or type of amino acids present could be altered during or after preservation. One potential confounding factor would be the heating of deeply buried egg fossils, which can break down amino acids. Another potential source of error is groundwater, which can leach away amino acids. These issues cast doubt as to whether the results these sorts of studies give are reliable as the actual composition of the eggshell's organic material in life. However, studies applying these techniques have made suggestive findings, including amino acid profiles in dinosaur eggs similar to those in modern birds. Geneva lens measure The Geneva Lens Measure is a device used to measure curved surfaces. It is most commonly used by opticians to measure lenses but can also be used by paleontologists to estimate the life size of dinosaur eggs from shell fragments. The instrument can be used to help estimate the size of fossil eggshells by measuring their curved surfaces. Since most eggs aren't perfectly round measurements from multiple parts of the egg with varying shell curvatures may be needed to get a full idea of the egg's size. Ideally an eggshell fragment being used to estimate the full size of an egg should be more than 3 cm long. Smaller eggshell fragments are better suited to other methods of study, like the Obrig radius dial gauge. The Geneva Lens measure gives units in diopters which must be converted to the radius in millimeters. Use of the Geneva Lens Measure to estimate the size of a fossil egg was first done by Sauer on fossil ostrich eggs. Light microscopy Light microscopy can be used to magnify the structure of dinosaur eggshell for scientific research. To do so an eggshell fragment must be embedded in epoxy resin and sliced into a thin section with a thin-bladed rock saw. This basic method was invented by French paleontologist Paul Gervais and has remained almost unchanged ever since. Horizontally cut thin sections are called tangential thin sections while vertically cut thin sections are called radial sections. Regardless of direction, the sample must be abraded by fine-grit sand or emery paper until it is translucent. Then the structure of the shell's calcite crystals or pores can be examined under a petrographic microscope. The calcite crystal structure of dinosaur eggshell can be classified by their effect on polarized light. Calcite is capable of acting as a polarizing light filter. When a microscopic thin section sample is rotated relative to polarized light it can eventually block all the light and seem opaque. This phenomenon is called extinction. Different varieties of dinosaur eggs with their different calcite crystal structures have different light extinction properties that can be used to identify and distinguish even eggs that seem very similar on the surface. To reconstruct the three-dimensional structures of the shell's pore channels scientists require a series of multiple radial sections. Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy is used to view dinosaur eggshell under even greater magnification than is possible with light microscopy. However, this does not mean that scanning electron microscopy is necessarily the superior research method. Since both techniques provide differing amounts and types of information they can be used together synergistically to provide a more complete understanding of the specimen under scrutiny. Eggshell specimens best suited for scanning electron microscopy are those recently broken because such a break will usually occur along the plane of the eggshell's calcite crystal lattice. First, a small specimen would be covered with a very thin layer of gold or platinum. The specimen would then be bombarded with electrons. The electrons bounce back off the metal and due to their small size, can be used to form a detailed image of the specimen. Mass spectrometry Mass spectrometry is a method for determining eggshell composition that uses a device called a mass spectrometer. First, the eggshell sample must be powdered and placed in the mass spectrometer's vacuum chamber. The powder is vaporized by the heat of an intense laser beam. A stream of electrons then bombard the gaseous eggshell molecules, which breaks down the molecules in the eggshell and imbues them with a positive charge. A magnetic field then sorts them by mass before they are detected by the spectrometer. One application of mass spectrometry has been to study the isotope ratios of dinosaur eggshell in order to ascertain their diets and living conditions. However this research is complicated by the fact that isotope ratios can be altered post mortem before or during fossilization. Bacterial decomposition can alter carbon isotope ratios in eggs and groundwater can alter the oxygen isotope ratios of eggshell. X rays X-ray equipment, like CAT scans, are used to study the interior of fossil eggs. Unlike CAT scans, x-ray imaging condenses the entire interior of the egg into a single two-dimensional image rather than a series of images documenting the interior in three dimensions. X-ray imaging in the context of dinosaur research has generally been used to look for evidence of embryonic fossils contained inside the egg. However, as of Kenneth Carpenter's 1999 book Eggs, Nests, and Baby Dinosaurs, all putative embryos discovered using x-rays have been misidentifications. This is because the use of x-rays to find embryos is conceptually flawed. Embryo bones are incompletely developed and will generally lack their own mineral content, as such the only source of minerals for these bones is the sediment that fills the egg after burial. The fossilized bones will therefore have the same density as the sediment filling the interior of the egg which served as the source for their mineral content and will be poorly visible in an x-ray image. So far the only reliable method for examining embryonic fossils preserved in dinosaur eggs is to physically extract them through means such as acid dissolution. X-rays can be used to chemically analyze dinosaur eggshell. This technique requires pure shell samples, so the fossil must be completely free of its surrounding rock matrix. The shell must then be further cleaned by an ultrasonic bath. The sample can then be bombarded by electrons emitted by the same sort of probe used by scanning electron microscopes. Upon impact with the samples x-rays are emitted that can be used to identify the composition of the shell. X-ray diffraction is a method for determining eggshell composition that uses X-rays to directly bombard powdered eggshell. Upon impact some of the x-rays will be diffracted at different angles and intensities depending on the specific elements present in the eggshell. Allosterics In order to test out how allosterics played a part in dinosaur egg size, scientists used modern day animal species such as birds, crocodiles, and tortoises in their experiment. They set the bird group as representing the theropods with the reptiles representing the sauropod group. The laid eggs of each species where compared with one another over the course of the study as well as against the fossilized eggs. The results that was retrieved from the experiment was that while sauropods laid smaller eggs in greater amounts each year, dinosaur of the theropod group was revealed to lay larger eggs less frequently over the years, similar to modern birds today.

Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. pp. 252 and 265. Schopenhauer tried to demonstrate physiologically that color is \\"specially modified activity of the retina.On Vision and Colors, ¬ß 1\\" The initial basis for Schopenhauer's color theory comes from Goethe's chapter on physiological colors, which discusses three principal pairs of contrasting colors: red/green, orange/blue, and yellow/violet. This is in contrast to the customary emphasis on Newton's seven colors of the Newtonian spectrum. In accordance with Aristotle, Schopenhauer considered that colors arise by the mixture of shadowy, cloudy darkness with light. With white and black at each extreme of the scale, colors are arranged in a series according to the mathematical ratio between the proportions of light and darkness. Schopenhauer agreed with Goethe's claim that the eye tends toward a sum total that consists of a color plus its spectrum or afterimage. Schopenhauer arranged the colors so that the sum of any color and its complementary afterimage always equals unity. The complete activity of the retina produces white. When the activity of the retina is divided, the part of the retinal activity that is inactive and not stimulated into color can be seen as the ghostly complementary afterimage, which he and Goethe call a (physiological) spectrum. History Schopenhauer met Goethe in 1808 at his mother's parties in Weimar but Goethe then mostly ignored the young and unknown student. In November 1813, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his doctoral dissertation On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason which he received as a gift. Both men shared the opinion that visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write On Vision and Colors. Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in Dresden in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness.\\"...Goethe...was so completely a realist that he absolutely could not get it into his head that the objects as such exist only to the extent that they are projected by the perceiving subject.\\" Schopenhauer's comment as quoted in Safranski's Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy, Chapter 13. Schopenhauer's Kantian transcendental idealism was opposed to Goethe's realism.\\"It is precisely the astonishing objectivity of his mind, everywhere stamping his [Goethe's] works with the mark of genius, which stood in his way where it was of value and prevented him from going back to the subject, in this case the perceiving eye itself, in order to seize here the final threads on which hangs the whole phenomenon of the world of colour. On the other hand, coming from Kant's school, I was prepared and trained for satisfying this demand in the best way.\\" Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume II, Chapter VII, ¬ß 103. For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's retina. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of color stimulus. In 1830, Schopenhauer published a revision of his color theory. The title was Theoria colorum Physiologica, eademque primaria (Fundamental physiological theory of color). It appeared in Justus Radius's Scriptores ophthalmologici minores (Minor ophthalmological writings). \\"This is no mere translation of the first edition,\\" he wrote, \\"but differs noticeably from it in form and presentation and is also amply enriched in subject matter.\\"On Vision and Colors, \\"Preface to the Second Edition,\\" Because it was written in Latin, he believed that foreign readers would be able to appreciate its value. An improved second edition of On Vision and Colors was published in 1854. In 1870, a third edition was published, edited by Julius Frauenst√§dt. In 1942, an English translation by Lt. Col. E. F. J. Payne was published in Karachi, India. This translation was republished in 1994 by Berg Publishers, Inc., edited by Professor David E. Cartwright. Content Preface to the second edition (the first edition had no Preface) Although this work is mainly concerned with physiology,Schopenhauer claimed that Buffon \\"discovered the phenomenon of physiological colours on which the whole of my theory is based....\\" The theory was based on Buffon's physiological phenomena and Goethe's data. Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, Chapter VII, ¬ß 104. it is of philosophical value. In gaining knowledge of the subjective nature of color, the reader will have a more profound understanding of Kant's doctrine of the a priori, subjective, intellectual forms of all knowledge. This is in opposition to contemporary realism which simply takes objective experience as positively given. Realism doesn't consider that it is through the subjective that the objective exists. The observer's brain stands like a wall between the observing subject and the real nature of things. Introduction Goethe performed two services: (1) he freed color theory from its reliance on Newton, and (2) he provided a systematic presentation of data for a theory of color. Before discussing color, there are some preliminary remarks to be made regarding vision. In ¬ß 1, it is shown that the perception of externally perceived objects in space is a product of the intellect's understanding after it has been stimulated by sensation from the sense organs. These remarks are necessary in order for the reader to be convinced that colors are entirely in the eye alone and are thoroughly subjectiveThis was also taught by Descartes (Discourse on the Method, Dioptric, Ch. 1), Locke,(An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book II, Chapter VIII, ¬ß 10), Sextus Empiricus, (Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book II, Chapter VII, . ¬ß¬ß 72‚Äì75) Chapter 1‚ÄîOn Vision =¬ß 1= In the Preface to the 1st Edition of his main work, Schopenhauer wrote that he omitted \\"all that is to be found in the first chapter of my essay On Vision and Colors, which otherwise would have found a place here, word for word.\\" Intuitive perception, or knowledge of an object, is intellectual, not merely sensual. The intellect's understanding regards every sense impression in the observer's body as coming from an external cause. This transition from effect to cause is knowledge of the pure understanding, not a rational conclusion or combination of concepts and judgments according to logical laws. Knowledge of an object never results from mere impression, but always from the application of the law of causality, and consequently of the understanding. The law of causality is the sole form of the understanding and the precondition of the possibility of any objective perception. Illusion occurs when the understanding is given uncommon sensations. If the sensations become commonplace, the illusion may disappear.As, for example, when a person becomes cross-eyed due to a blow on the head and sees double. After a time, the person will see normal single images again, while the eyes remain crossed. Intellectual understanding, or knowing the objective cause of a subjective sensation, distinguishes animals from plants. All animals are able to intuitively perceive objects. Color is usually attributed to external bodies. However, color is actually the activity of the eye's retina. It is a sensation. The external body is perceived as the cause of the sensation of color. We say, \\"The body is red.\\" In reality, though, color exists only in the retina of the eye. It is separate from the external object. Color is a mere sensation in the sense organ. The external object is perceived by the intellect's understanding as being the cause of sensations. Chapter 2‚ÄîOn Colors =¬ß 2= Newton, Goethe, and all other color theorists began by investigating light and colored bodies in order to find the cause of color. They should have started with an investigation of the effect, the given phenomenon, the changes in the eye,cf. Itten, Johannes, The Elements of Color, p. 16, \\"The light waves are not in themselves colored. Color arises in the human eye and brain.\\" we can afterward investigate the external physical and chemical causes of those sensations. The eye's reaction to external stimulus is an activity, not a passive response. It is the activity of the retina. When the eye's retina receives a full impression of light, or when whiteness appears, it is fully active. When light is absent, or when blackness appears, the retina is inactive. =¬ß 3= There are gradations to the intensity or strength of the retina's activity, or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided activity of the retina is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light ‚Äî Half Shade ‚Äî Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White ‚Äî Gray ‚Äî Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the retina's activity increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are made possible by the quantitative intensive divisibility of the retina's activity. =¬ß 4= The activity of the retina also has a quantitative extensive divisibility. The whole extent of the retina is divided into countless small juxtaposed spots or points.\\"There are about 125,000,000 receptors in each human eye [retina].\\" Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, \\"Vision and the Eye.,\\" Each point is individually stimulated by light or whiteness and reacts separately. The eye can receive many impressions at one time, and therefore side by side. =¬ß 5= The qualitative division of the activity is completely different from the two quantitative divisions. It occurs when color is presented to the eye. Schopenhauer described the way in which various points or places on the retina become fatigued from being overstimulated. After staring at a black figure on a white background, the overactive and excited retinal points become exhausted and do not react to stimulation when the eye finally looks away. A ghostly appearance of a black background is seen with a light-colored figure. The retinal positions that were exhausted by the whiteness become completely inactive. The retinal positions that had been rested are now easily stimulated. This explains afterimage (physiological spectra). Both Goethe and Schopenhauer use the word \\"spectrum\\" [Spektrum], from the Latin word \\"spectrum\\" meaning \\"appearance\\" or \\"apparition,\\" to designate an afterimage. If, instead of white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or physiological color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, does not fully stimulate and exhaust the retina's activity. Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The retina's activity has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black. An orange color is not as close to white. It doesn't activate the retina as much as yellow. Orange's complement is blue, which is that much closer to white than was violet. A red color is halfway between white and black. Red's complement is green which is also halfway between white and black. With red and green, the retina's qualitatively divided activity consists of two equal halves. Red and green are two completely equal qualitative halves of the retina's activity. Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¬æ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¬º. The range of all colors contains a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other. Why are red, green, orange, blue, yellow, and violet given names and considered to be the most important? Because they represent the retina's activity in the simplest fractions or ratios. The same is true of the seven keynotes in the musical diatonic scale: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Color is the qualitatively divided activity of the retina. The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active. Knowledge of these six colors is inborn in the mind. They are ideal and are never found pure in nature, in the same way that regular geometrical figures are innate. We have them a priori in our minds as standards to which we compare actual colors. These three pairs of colors are pure, subjective Epicurean anticipations because they are expressed in simple, rational, arithmetical ratios similar to the seven tones of the musical scale and their rational vibration numbers. Black and white are not colors because they are not fractions and represent no qualitative division of the retina's activity. Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number. =¬ß 6= The qualitatively divided activity of the retina is a polarity, like electricity and magnetism. The retina's polarity is successive, in time, whereas the polarity of the others is simultaneous, in space. The retina's activity, like Yin and Yang, is split into two parts which condition each other and seek to reunite. Red, orange, and yellow could be conventionally designated by a plus sign. Green, blue, and violet could be the negative poles. =¬ß 7= According to Goethe, color is like shade or gray in that it is darker than white and brighter than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is activity of the retina. Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the retina's activity is lessened. Colors appear when the whole activity of the retina is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the retina's activity, there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the retina's full activity. No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the activity of the retina, the activity of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an afterimage, or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor. =¬ß 8= Newton recognized that color is darker than white or light. He erroneously investigated light instead of the eye, the objective instead of the subjective. In so doing, he asserted that light rays are composed of seven colored rays. These seven were like the seven intervals of the musical scale. Schopenhauer claimed that there are only four prismatic colors: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. The rays described by Newton are supposed to be variously colored according to laws that have nothing to do with the eye. Instead of Newton's division of sunshine into seven rays, Schopenhauer claimed that color was a division of the eye's retina into two complementary parts. Like the Delphic Oracle, Copernicus, and Kant, Schopenhauer concentrated on the subjective rather than the objective, on the observer's experience rather than the observed object. In general, he believed, the subjective viewpoint leads to correct results. Colors are not in light. Colors are nothing more than the eye's activity, appearing in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. Locke, for example, claimed that color was at the head of his list of secondary qualities. Newton's theory has color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory claims to be more explanatory. He said that each color is a definite + or ‚àí side of the division of the retina's activity, expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation. =¬ß 9= When the entire activity of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, the color and its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then the color loses its energy by mixing with gray. =¬ß 10= If the activity of the retina is divided without a remainder, or if the remainder is active, then a color and its spectrum (afterimage) are bright or pale. When such a color and its spectrum are united, then the eye sees pure light or white. For example, the mixture of bright or pale red and green on the same retinal spot results in the impression there of light or white. White cannot be produced by mixing colored pigments. With colors from a prism, however, the production of white can be demonstrated by using a mixture of colored light from each of the three main pairs of complementary colors: red ‚Äì green, orange ‚Äì blue, or yellow ‚Äì violet. White can be produced from two complementary opposite colors when both of the external causes of the colors excite the same retinal place at the same time. Newton claimed that white could be produced by the aggregation of his seven prismatic colors. He erroneously considered color to be in light instead of in the eye. White is the result of the combination of two opposite colors because their inactivity, or darkness, is removed when the two active parts of the retina combine. According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the achromatic refractor, however, this is not the case. Newtonians explain this by saying that the achromatic refractor's crown glass and flint glass refract light as a whole with equal intensity but disperse individual colors differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color). If an observer looks through a prism at a white disk on a black background, two subsidiary images are seen. This is due to double refraction as the light bends twice, when entering and leaving the prism. With this double refraction, the two subsidiary images appear as one above and one below the main image. The distance of the two subsidiary images from the main image corresponds to the Newtonians' dispersion. The wideness or narrowness of the colored bands are, however, nonessential properties that differ according to the type of light-refracting substance that is used. The top of the upper image is violet. Below the violet is blue. The bottom of the lower image is orange. Above the orange is yellow. In this way, along with the white disk and the black background, four prismatic colors appear: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. This is in disagreement with Newton's claim that there are seven prismatic colors. As the upper image overlaps black, it is seen as violet. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as blue. As the lower image overlaps black, it is seen as orange. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as yellow. This shows how colors are produced when the image mixes with either lightness or darkness, in accordance with Goethe's assertions.\\"[L]ight and its absence, are necessary to the production of colour.\\" \\"[C]olours throughout are to be considered as half-lights, as half-shadows....\\" Theory of Colours, Introduction. \\"Colour itself is a degree of darkness....\\" Ibid., ¬ß 69. Color appears in semi-transparent media when dark passes over light or vice vers√¢. Ibid., ¬ß 239.when =¬ß 11= In the operation of a healthy eye, three kinds of division of retinal activity often occur at once. (1) The quantitative intensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in a loss of color energy and a deviation toward paleness or darkness; (2) After being excited by an external stimulant, the quantitative extensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in the retina being covered by many various juxtaposed spots of color sensation; (3) When the stimulation ceases, an afterimage (physiological spectrum) appears on each retinal spot. =¬ß 12= Afterimages (spectra) appear after a mechanical shock to the eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The retina's activity is disorganized from over- stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The retina's activity is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely that it is a function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the daguerreotype. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are color blind would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye. =¬ß 13= Colors and the laws by which they appear reside within the eye. The external cause of color is a stimulus which excites the retina and separates its polarity. Goethe had organized color into three classes: physiological, physical, and chemical. He proposed that the external causes of color are physical colors and chemical colors.\\"...we considered colours, as far as they may be said to belong to the eye itself, and to depend on an action and reaction of the organ; next they attracted our attention as perceived in, or by means of, colourless mediums; and lastly, where we could consider them as belonging to particular substances. We have denominated the first, physiological, the second, physical, the third, chemical colours. The first are fleeting and not to be arrested; the next are passing, but still for a while enduring; the last may be made permanent for any length of time.\\" Goethe, Theory of Colours, Introduction. The physiological colors are subjective and literally exist in the eye of the beholder. The physical colors are seen through cloudy or turbid media, like a glass or water prism. The chemical colors are objective and exist in the external object.The investigations of Newton started with chemical (objective) colors as given and, from them, explained physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored physiological (subjective) colors. Goethe also started with chemical (objective) colors. From them, he explained physical (seen through prism) colors and physiological (subjective) colors. Schopenhauer, on the contrary, started with physiological (subjective) colors as given. He then used them to explain physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored chemical (objective) colors. Physical colors Physical colors are temporary. They exist when light combines with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible because we know that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know a priori about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¬æ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ¬Ω, green is ¬Ω, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¬º as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the \\"organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal....\\"Schopenhauer, On Vision and Colors, ¬ß 13The accepted conjecture regarding the retina's organic capacities was later published in the Young-Helmholtz theory. Chemical colors Chemical colors are more durable properties of an external object, such as the red color of an apple. A chemical color is incomprehensible because we don't know its cause. Its appearance is only known from experience and it is not an essential part of the object. Chemical colors result from changes in an object's surface. A slight change in the surface may result in a different color. Color, therefore, is not an essential property of an object. This confirms the subjective nature of color. =¬ß 14= Schopenhauer said that he didn't have to worry about his discoveries being attributed to previous thinkers. \\"For, prior to 1816, never at any time did it occur to anyone to regard color ... as the halved activity of the retina, and accordingly to assign to each individual color its definite numerical fraction ‚Äî a fraction that, with another color, goes to make up unity, this unity representing white or the full activity of the retina.\\" Schopenhauer criticized scientists for thinking that color exists in external objects, instead of in the spectator's eye. Color as vibrations of an ether was rejected by him. Fraunhofer lines, according to Schopenhauer, do not exist in light itself. They result from the edges of the slit that light passes through. Schopenhauer on vision and the colors RA Crone - Documenta ophthalmologica, 1997 - Springer Letter to Eastlake In 1841, Schopenhauer wrote a letter in English to Charles Lock Eastlake whose English translation of Goethe's book on colors had recently been reviewed in several journals. Schopenhauer included a copy of his On Vision and Colors with the letter. He briefly communicated the main point of his book as follows: > ...if, bearing in mind the numerical fractions, (of the activity of the > Retina) by which I express the 6 chief colours, You contemplate these > colours singly, then You will find that only by this, and by no other theory > on earth, You will come to understand the peculiar sensation, which every > colour produces in your eye, and thereby get an insight into the very > essence of every colour, and of colour in general. Likewise my theory alone > gives the true sense in which the notion of complementary colours is to be > taken, viz: as having no reference to light, but to the Retina, and not > being a redintegration [restoration] of white light, but of the full action > of the Retina, which by every colour undergoes a bipartition either in > yellow (3/4) and violet (1/4) or in orange (2/3) and blue (1/3) or in red > (1/2) and green (1/2). This is in short the great mystery. Here he explained that color results from the way that the retina reacts to sensation. The cause may be light or other pressure on the retina. The fractions of two complementary colors sum to unity. White is undivided, whole retinal activity. Reception Ludwig Wittgenstein and Erwin Schr√∂dinger were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's works and both seriously investigated color theory. Philipp Mainl√§nder considered the work to be among the most important things ever written. Johannes Itten based his work on Schopenhauer's theory of color. The mathematician Brouwer wrote: \\"Newton's theory of color analyzed light rays in their medium, but Goethe and Schopenhauer, more sensitive to the truth, considered color to be the polar splitting by the human eye.\\" The physicist Ernst Mach praised that \\"men such as Goethe, Schopenhauer\\" had started to \\"investigate the sensations themselves\\" on the first page of his work Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verh√§ltnis des Physischen zum Psychischen. According to Rudolf Arnheim, Schopenhauer‚Äôs \\"‚Ä¶basic conception of complementary pairs in retinal functioning strikingly anticipates the color theory of Ewald Hering.\\"Rudolf Arnheim, Art and Visual Perception, Chapter VII Nietzsche noted that the Bohemian physiologist, Professor Czermak, acknowledged Schopenhauer‚Äôs relation to the Young-Helmholtz theory of color.\\"I recently found in the reports of the Vienna Academy of Sciences an article by Professor Czermak on Schopenhauer's theory of colors. [Johann Nepomuk Czermak, √úber Schopenhauers Theorie der Farbe: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Farbenlehre (Regarding Schopenhauer's theory of color: a contribution to the history of color theory), Vienna, 1870]. This confirms that Schopenhauer discovered independently and originally what is now known as the Young‚ÄìHelmholtz theory of colors: the latter and the Schopenhauerian theory correspond in a most marvelous way, down to the very infinitesimals. It is claimed that the whole point of departure, color as primarily a physiological product of the eye, was first established by Schopenhauer.\\" (Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche, Edited and Translated by Christopher Middleton, Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. Indianapolis/ Cambridge, Letter to Carl von Gersdorff, Basel, December 12, 1870) Bosanquet claimed that Schopenhauer‚Äôs color theory was in accord with scientific research.\\"Schopenhauer's ingenious modification and defence of Goethe's colour theory appears to be in harmony with modern [1892] physiological ideas. He interprets Goethe's account of colour as light mixed with darkness, to mean that colour involves a partial activity of the retina (light), and a partial inactivity (dark), and lays down the principle that the retina always tends to a complete activity, the parts of which, if not simultaneous, as in white light, are successive, as in complementary images.\\" (A History of Aesthetic, Bernard Bosanquet, page 366, note 4) Notes Bibliography * Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, Theory of Colours, Translated by Charles Lock Eastlake, M.I.T Press, 1970, * Itten, Johannes, and Birren, Faber (1970).

She animated the children's television series Paddington, has taught in schools and universities, and has won numerous awards. Early life Graber was born in 1940, and raised in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England. She gained a National Diploma in Fine Art from the Sunderland Art College (now part of the University of Sunderland) in 1959. In 1960 she studied for her ATD with Mrs Burroughs and team in Birmingham School for Training Art teachers where she was shown that EVERYONE IS AN ARTIST IN THEIR OWN WAY - as Sir Herbert Read said in 1943 in his \\"Education through Art.\\" Sheila has followed this philosophy all her teaching career. After twenty years of teaching, Graber first began to make animated films in 1970, initially using the medium to teach her students another form of art, following on from painting, clay modelling, woodwork and metalwork. Animation Between 1975 and 1980, Graber created a selection of animated shorts which were shown worldwide. One animation, Mondrian, about the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian was screened at the Tate Gallery, Mondrian‚Äôs own house in the Netherlands, the Open University and British Broadcasting Corporation's children's television series Blue Peter. In 1985, Graber worked for Filmfair, and created the cut out animation for Paddington Bear Specials for the television series Paddington. She also animated the 1983 BBC series Just So Stories, adapted from a collection of children's stories of the same name, written by Rudyard Kipling. Newly divorced in 1970 Sheila began experimenting at home with Super 8 film animation.By 1975 Tate Gallery invite her to make an animation on William Blake for their Exhibition. She actually created it in the sculpture hall at the gallery to encourage the general public to see the use of animation in education. 1980 Sheila left her role as head of Creative Studies at a large comprehensive school as she was invited by Nicole Jouve of Interama. Agent for The films of Jean Renoir and The Magic Roundabout to create A 10x10 minute animated series of The Just So Stories for World TV. This she did at home single handed in one year using classic hand painted cels, scripting, recording mixing sound track, drawing, tracing, painting, filming on 16mm. A World Record. The series was screened in over 15 countries . She has since pursued a career as a full-time professional artist animator and educator . Some of Sheila's animation art work is stored by the BFI Animation Archives Many of Graber's films are screened by the BFI and held in The North East Film Archive and the archive of the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers film and video institute , including a number she made as the introduction for events and conferences hosted by that organisation. Later life In 2001, Sheila took a position at the University of Teesside, as the Animator in Residence. Commenting on her appointment, she said, \\"I‚Äôm hoping to work ... on making a film and explore the potential of computer animation.\\" After creating over 60 shorts and three series for World TV, she teamed up with fellow director Jen Miller in 1996 to form the company Sheila Graber Animation Ltd. In 2004 she moved to the Republic of Ireland to open a studio to provide guidance and inspiration to a new generation of animators, before taking up a position at the University of Sunderland later that same year. Speaking of her role as Senior Research and Teaching Fellow in Animation, Graber said, \\"it's great to work with older students. It's a real two-way process and I hope I inspire them as much as they inspire me.\\" As of 2008, Graber continues to work at the university. On 19 November 2007 she created a YouTube account under the name Sheila Graber. She has been using it to upload her animations. Awards and recognition Graber was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Sunderland in 1998 for Outstanding services to Education and Art.

He is known for the Norwegian expression \\"Gi ungdommen en flaske brennevin f√∏r idretten tar dem\\" (). In 2007 he was elected into the city council in Stavanger for the Liberal Party of Norway. Between 2003 and 2007 he was the leader of the Eiganes og V√•land borough council. He is listed as a clown in the telephone book. Born in Stavanger, Torkelsen is a trained teacher of English, but is most well known as a comedian. He has worked as a postman, scrap dealer, illusionist, and was the Norwegian champion of magic. He has held talks for companies and has been involved in debates. He has also been the host of children's television programmes in Norway and for a time he had a permanent role as part of the long-running NRK program Norge rundt. Starting in 1980, he was a member of the municipality council in his home city of Stavanger. Today he is the leader of the Eiganes og V√•land city district council for the Liberal Party of Norway. He was only 15 years old when he was first noticed in the national media. He fooled all of Norway's archaeologists by placing five Chinese coins from the 10th century in an excavation field in Stavanger. In the end of the 1960s, Stavanger prison and some other buildings in the market area of Stavanger were torn down, and at the same time archaeologists were excavating. Stavanger museum sent out press releases about the find, and soon the discovery was known around the world. But after some time, Torkelsen contacted regional newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad in order to tell the truth about the coins. Oddmund M√∏llerop, the director of the Stavanger archaeological museum at the time, has said that Torkelsen had planted the coins in the perfect spot. The coins happened to be planted in a location where the age of the land that the archaeologists were excavating was precisely the same age as the coins. Had the coins been placed anywhere else in the excavation site, the archaeologists would have been able to tell that they were planted there. Torkelsen is also known as a talented spokesperson for smokers and he has many times played around with this theme. He is also known for collecting comic books and owns one of Norway's biggest collections with over 28,000 books. Most of them are displayed in the children's museum in Stavanger. In addition, he is known for the release of the books Den store stygge idrettsboka (), Den store norske begravelsesboka (), Ikkje heilt rektige (), and the controversial Den store, stygge eldreboka (). In addition to all this, he has had success with the variety show group L√∏gnaslaget (together with Dag Schreiner and Steinar Lyse). The group has also released music. Torkelsen was one of the founders of Den Store Norske Humorfestivalen (). Since 2003, he has been a permanent weekly radio columnist for the radio program Norgesglasset on NRK radio.  Controversies In 2000 there was much debate and resentment from the public when Torkelsen released the book Den store stygge eldreboka, which he initially wanted to call Drep de eldre (). The book contains a bunch of negative characteristics of the elderly. Because of this he has received death threats and been attacked on the street. In the same year, he reported regional newspaper Rogalands Avis to the police because of someone who wrote in to the newspaper urging pensionists to shoot Torkelsen. When the report was dismissed, he filed a complaint against the newspaper, but the paper was found not to be at fault. In the book, Torkelsen wrote, among other things, that pensioners that have too much money should pay for themselves, so that other pensioners without any income, single mothers and families just starting out would have it better. Torkelsen says that there would be no requirement for them to do this, however. He has said that he expected to cause a stir after his confrontation with the conservatives among the elderly, but didn't expect death threats or physical attacks. There was also controversy when he released one of his older books, Den store norske begravelsesboka in 1996. Earlier, in 1992, he released Den store stygge idrettsboka, where he attacked sports. After publishing the book, he was sued by the javelin thrower Trine Hattestad because she thought that he had defamed her. The case was settled in court and Torkelsen said he was willing to pay 100,000 NOK in damages. Other engagements In 2006, he was the master of ceremonies for the theatre festival in Sandnes where there were 13 different theatres. From the fall of 2006 until the spring of 2008 he was a director for Teaterverkstedet Ganddal in cooperation with Rogaland amateur theatre. As a director for the theater company Teaterverkstedet Ganddal, he has directed two pieces: * Zapp p√• ein m√•de * Pengane eller livet These two performances were a huge success for both Torkelsen and Teaterverkstedet Ganddal.

Beginning 1857, he attended the Kunstakademie (Art Academy) in D√ºsseldorf, where he studied painting under Ernst Deger and Eduard Bendemann. During a visit to L√ºbeck in 1865, where he copied Hans Memling's Passion, he made some attempts at architectural and landscape painting. These turned out so well that from then on he dedicated himself to landscape painting. Beginning in 1870 he focused his artistic efforts mainly on Norwegian landscapes, for which he devoted several study trips. Together with his friend Carl Rodeck he also visited the Netherlands, Belgium and England. He lived in Hamburg and received a first-class medal from the M√ºnchener Ausstellung (Munich Exhibition).

When used in a historical context, \\"British\\" or \\"Britons\\" can refer to the Celtic Britons, the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain and Brittany, whose surviving members are the modern Welsh people, Cornish people, and Bretons. It also refers to citizens of the former British Empire, who settled in the country prior to 1973, and hold neither UK citizenship nor nationality. Though early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages, the Union of the Crowns in 1603 and the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity.. The notion of Britishness and a shared British identity was forged during the 18th century and early 19th century when Britain engaged in several global conflicts with France, and developed further during the Victorian era.. The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a \\"particular sense of nationhood and belonging\\" in Great Britain and Ireland; Britishness became \\"superimposed on much older identities\\", of English, Scots, Welsh, and Irish cultures, whose distinctiveness still resists notions of a homogenised British identity.. Because of longstanding ethno-sectarian divisions, British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial, but it is held with strong conviction by Unionists. Modern Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic groups that settled in Great Britain in and before the 11th century: Prehistoric, Brittonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Normans. The progressive political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration, cultural and linguistic exchange, and intermarriage between the peoples of England, Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages, early modern period and beyond... Since 1922 and earlier, there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from what is now the Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens, with some assuming a British, dual or hyphenated identity.. This includes the groups black British and Asian British people, which constitute around 10% of the British population.

Retrieved 13 August 2010. multicultural and multilingual society, with \\"strong regional accents, expressions and identities\\".. The social structure of the United Kingdom has changed radically since the 19th century, with a decline in religious observance, enlargement of the middle class, and increased ethnic diversity, particularly since the 1950s, when citizens of the British Empire were encouraged to immigrate to Britain to work as part of the recovery from World War II. The population of the UK stands at around 66 million, with a British diaspora of around 140 million concentrated in the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, with smaller concentrations in the Republic of Ireland, Chile, South Africa, and parts of the Caribbean.  History of the term  The earliest known reference to the inhabitants of Great Britain may have come from 4th century BC records of the voyage of Pytheas, a Greek geographer who made a voyage of exploration around the British Isles. Although none of his own writings remain, writers during the time of the Roman Empire made much reference to them. Pytheas called the islands collectively (hai Brettaniai), which has been translated as the Brittanic Isles, and the peoples of what are today England, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man of Prettanike were called the (Prettanoi), Priteni, Pritani or Pretani. The group included Ireland, which was referred to as Ierne (Insula sacra \\"sacred island\\" as the Greeks interpreted it) \\"inhabited by the different race of Hiberni\\" (gens hibernorum), and Britain as insula Albionum, \\"island of the Albions\\". The term Pritani may have reached Pytheas from the Gauls, who possibly used it as their term for the inhabitants of the islands. Greek and Roman writers, in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, name the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland as the Priteni, the origin of the Latin word Britanni. It has been suggested that this name derives from a Gaulish description translated as \\"people of the forms\\", referring to the custom of tattooing or painting their bodies with blue woad made from Isatis tinctoria. Parthenius, a 1st-century Ancient Greek grammarian, and the Etymologicum Genuinum, a 9th-century lexical encyclopaedia, mention a mythical character Bretannus (the Latinised form of the , Brettan√≥s) as the father of Celtine, mother of Celtus, the eponymous ancestor of the Celts. By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of Prettanikƒì as a collective name for the British Isles. However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia was used for the island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia (modern day Scotland north of the rivers Forth & Clyde), although the people of Caledonia and the north were also the self same Britons during the Roman period, the Gaels arriving four centuries later.4.20 provides a translation describing Caesar's first invasion, using terms which from IV.XX appear in Latin as arriving tamen in Britanniam, the inhabitants being Britannos, and on p.30 principes Britanniae is translated as \\"chiefs of Britain\\". Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors such as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Jutes from Continental Europe, who gained control in areas around the south east, and to Middle Irish-speaking people migrating from what is today Northern Ireland to the north of Great Britain (modern Scotland), founding Gaelic kingdoms such as D√°l Riata and Alba, which would eventually subsume the native Brittonic and Pictish kingdoms and become Scotland. In this sub-Roman Britain, as Anglo-Saxon culture spread across southern and eastern Britain and Gaelic through much of the north, the demonym \\"Briton\\" became restricted to the Brittonic-speaking inhabitants of what would later be called Wales, Cornwall, North West England (Cumbria), and a southern part of ScotlandFoster, Sally M. (2014). Picts, Scots and Gaels ‚Äî Early Historic Scotland. Edinburgh: Birlinn. .(Strathclyde). In addition the term was also applied to Brittany in what is today France and Britonia in north west Spain, both regions having been colonised by Britons in the 5th century fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions. However, the term Britannia persisted as the Latin name for the island. The Historia Brittonum claimed legendary origins as a prestigious genealogy for Brittonic kings, followed by the Historia Regum Britanniae which popularised this pseudo-history to support the claims of the Kings of England. During the Middle Ages, and particularly in the Tudor period, the term \\"British\\" was used to refer to the Welsh people and Cornish people. At that time, it was \\"the long held belief that these were the remaining descendants of the Britons and that they spoke 'the British tongue.. This notion was supported by texts such as the Historia Regum Britanniae, a pseudohistorical account of ancient British history, written in the mid-12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth. The Historia Regum Britanniae chronicled the lives of legendary kings of the Britons in a narrative spanning 2000 years, beginning with the Trojans founding the ancient British nation and continuing until the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 7th century forced the Britons to the west, i.e. Wales and Cornwall, and north, i.e. Cumbria, Strathclyde and northern Scotland. This legendary Celtic history of Great Britain is known as the Matter of Britain. The Matter of Britain, a national myth, was retold or reinterpreted in works by Gerald of Wales, a Cambro-Norman chronicler who in the 12th and 13th centuries used the term British to refer to the people later known as the Welsh.  History   Ancestral roots  The indigenous people of the British Isles have a combination of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Norman ancestry. Between the 8th and 11th centuries, \\"three major cultural divisions\\" had emerged in Great Britain: the English, the Scots and the Welsh, the earlier Brittonic Celtic polities in what are today England and Scotland having finally been absorbed into Anglo-Saxon England and Gaelic Scotland by the early 11th century. The English had been unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh. Before then, the English (known then in Old English as the Anglecynn) were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states, the most powerful of which were Mercia and Wessex. Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver said that the Battle of Brunanburh would \\"define the shape of Britain into the modern era\\", it was a \\"showdown for two very different ethnic identities ‚Äì a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon. It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms, a split in perceptions which is still very much with us today\\". However, historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely \\"responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood\\" in the 13th century. Schama hypothesised that Scottish national identity, \\"a complex amalgam\\" of Gaelic, Brittonic, Pictish, Norsemen and Anglo-Norman origins, was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Medieval tapestry showing King Arthur, a legendary ancient British ruler who had a leading role in the Matter of Britain, a national myth used as propaganda for the ancestral origins of the British Royal Family and their British subjects. Though Wales was conquered by England, and its legal system replaced by that of the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542, the Welsh endured as a nation distinct from the English, and to some degree the Cornish people, although conquered into England by the 11th century, also retained a distinct Brittonic identity and language.. Later, with both an English Reformation and a Scottish Reformation, Edward VI of England, under the counsel of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, advocated a union with the Kingdom of Scotland, joining England, Wales, and Scotland in a united Protestant Great Britain.. The Duke of Somerset supported the unification of the English, Welsh and Scots under the \\"indifferent old name of Britons\\" on the basis that their monarchies \\"both derived from a Pre-Roman British monarchy\\". Following the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by James VI, King of Scots, so that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI of Scotland and I of England, an event referred to as the Union of the Crowns. King James advocated full political union between England and Scotland,. and on 20 October 1604 proclaimed his assumption of the style \\"King of Great Britain\\", though this title was rejected by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland,. and so had no basis in either English law or Scots law.  Union and the development of Britishness  On 12 April 1606, the Union Flag representing the personal union between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree. The St George's Cross and St Andrew's saltire were \\"joined together ... to be published to our Subjects.\\" Despite centuries of military and religious conflict, the Kingdoms of England and Scotland had been \\"drawing increasingly together\\" since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century and the Union of the Crowns in 1603.. A broadly shared language, island, monarch, religion and Bible (the Authorized King James Version) further contributed to a growing cultural alliance between the two sovereign realms and their peoples. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 resulted in a pair of Acts of the English and Scottish legislatures‚Äîthe Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 respectively‚Äîwhich ensured that the shared constitutional monarchy of England and Scotland was held only by Protestants. Despite this, although popular with the monarchy and much of the aristocracy, attempts to unite the two states by Acts of Parliament in 1606, 1667, and 1689 were unsuccessful; increased political management of Scottish affairs from England had led to \\"criticism\\", and strained Anglo-Scottish relations. While English maritime explorations during the Age of Discovery gave new-found imperial power and wealth to the English and Welsh at the end of the 17th century, Scotland suffered from a long-standing weak economy. In response, the Scottish kingdom, in opposition to William II of Scotland (III of England), commenced the Darien Scheme, an attempt to establish a Scottish imperial outlet‚Äîthe colony of New Caledonia‚Äîon the isthmus of Panama. However, through a combination of disease, Spanish hostility, Scottish mismanagement and opposition to the scheme by the East India Company and the English government (who did not want to provoke the Spanish into war). this imperial venture ended in \\"catastrophic failure\\" with an estimated \\"25% of Scotland's total liquid capital\\" lost. The events of the Darien Scheme, and the passing by the English Parliament of the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting the right to choose the order of succession for English, Scottish and Irish thrones, escalated political hostilities between England and Scotland, and neutralised calls for a united British people. The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704, allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England, if it so wished. The English political perspective was that the appointment of a Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco-Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. The Parliament of England passed the Alien Act 1705, which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies (about half of Scotland's trade).. However, the Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain, which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme. Union of Scotland and England Despite opposition from within both Scotland and England,. a Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706 and was then ratified by the parliaments of both countries with the passing of the Acts of Union 1707. With effect from 1 May 1707, this created a new sovereign state called the \\"Kingdom of Great Britain\\".Acts of Union 1707 Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Retrieved 9 January 2011 This kingdom \\"began as a hostile merger\\", but led to a \\"full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world\\"; historian Simon Schama stated that \\"it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history\\". After 1707, a British national identity began to develop, though it was initially resisted, particularly by the English. The peoples of Great Britain had by the 1750s begun to assume a \\"layered identity\\": to think of themselves as simultaneously British and also Scottish, English, or Welsh. The Battle of Trafalgar by J. M. W. Turner (oil on canvas, 1822‚Äì1824) combines events from several moments during the Napoleonic Wars' Battle of Trafalgar‚Äîa major British naval victory upon which Britishness has drawn influence. The terms North Briton and South Briton were devised for the Scots and the English respectively, with the former gaining some preference in Scotland, particularly by the economists and philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment... Indeed, it was the \\"Scots [who] played key roles in shaping the contours of British identity\\";. \\"their scepticism about the Union allowed the Scots the space and time in which to dominate the construction of Britishness in its early crucial years\\",. drawing upon the notion of a shared \\"spirit of liberty common to both Saxon and Celt ... against the usurpation of the Church of Rome\\".. James Thomson was a poet and playwright born to a Church of Scotland minister in the Scottish Lowlands in 1700 who was interested in forging a common British culture and national identity in this way. In collaboration with Thomas Arne, they wrote Alfred, an opera about Alfred the Great's victory against the Vikings performed to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1740 to commemorate the accession of George I and the birthday of Princess Augusta.. \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" was the climactic piece of the opera and quickly became a \\"jingoistic\\" British patriotic song celebrating \\"Britain's supremacy offshore\\".. An island country with a series of victories for the Royal Navy associated empire and naval warfare \\"inextricably with ideals of Britishness and Britain's place in the world\\". Britannia, the new national personification of Great Britain, was established in the 1750s as a representation of \\"nation and empire rather than any single national hero\\". On Britannia and British identity, historian Peter Borsay wrote: From the Union of 1707 through to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Great Britain was \\"involved in successive, very dangerous wars with Catholic France\\",. but which \\"all brought enough military and naval victories ... to flatter British pride\\".. As the Napoleonic Wars with the First French Empire advanced, \\"the English and Scottish learned to define themselves as similar primarily by virtue of not being French or Catholic\\".. In combination with sea power and empire, the notion of Britishness became more \\"closely bound up with Protestantism\\",. a cultural commonality through which the English, Scots and Welsh became \\"fused together, and remain[ed] so, despite their many cultural divergences\\".. The neo-classical monuments that proliferated at the end of the 18th century and the start of the 19th century, such as The Kymin at Monmouth, were attempts to meld the concepts of Britishness with the Greco-Roman empires of classical antiquity. The new and expanding British Empire provided \\"unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth\\", and so the \\"Scottish, Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds\\". The British Empire was \\"crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self-image of Britishness\\". Indeed, the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century \\"for it offered a context within which they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in, and benefiting from, the expansion of the [British] Empire\\". Similarly, the \\"new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons ‚Äì a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh\\".. For the English, however, by the Victorian era their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness had meant that, for them, Britishness \\"meant the same as 'Englishness'\\",. so much so that \\"Englishness and Britishness\\" and \\"'England' and 'Britain' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts\\".. Britishness came to borrow heavily from English political history because England had \\"always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size, population and power\\"; Magna Carta, common law and hostility to continental Europe were English factors that influenced British sensibilities. Union with Ireland The political union in 1800 of the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain, coupled with the outbreak of peace with France in the early 19th century, challenged the previous century's concept of militant Protestant Britishness.. The new, expanded United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland meant that the state had to re-evaluate its position on the civil rights of Catholics, and extend its definition of Britishness to the Irish people.. Like the terms that had been invented at the time of the Acts of Union 1707, \\"West Briton\\" was introduced for the Irish after 1800. In 1832 Daniel O'Connell, an Irish politician who campaigned for Catholic Emancipation, stated in Britain's House of Commons: Ireland, from 1801 to 1923, was marked by a succession of economic and political mismanagement and neglect, which marginalised the Irish, and advanced Irish nationalism. In the forty years that followed the Union, successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had as Benjamin Disraeli, a staunch anti-Irish and anti-Catholic member of the Conservative party with a virulent racial and religious prejudice towards Ireland put it in 1844, \\"a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church, and in addition the weakest executive in the world\\".. Although the vast majority of Unionists in Ireland proclaimed themselves \\"simultaneously Irish and British\\", even for them there was a strain upon the adoption of Britishness after the Great Famine.. War continued to be a unifying factor for the people of Great Britain: British jingoism re-emerged during the Boer Wars in southern Africa. The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility for Britishness. In 1887, Frederic Harrison wrote: The Catholic Relief Act 1829 reflected a \\"marked change in attitudes\\" in Great Britain towards Catholics and Catholicism.. A \\"significant\\" example of this was the collaboration between Augustus Welby Pugin, an \\"ardent Roman Catholic\\" and son of a Frenchman, and Sir Charles Barry, \\"a confirmed Protestant\\", in redesigning the Palace of Westminster‚Äî\\"the building that most enshrines ... Britain's national and imperial pre- tensions\\". Protestantism gave way to imperialism as the leading element of British national identity during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, and as such, a series of royal, imperial and national celebrations were introduced to the British people to assert imperial British culture and give themselves a sense of uniqueness, superiority and national consciousness.. Empire Day and jubilees of Queen Victoria were introduced to the British middle class, but quickly \\"merged into a national 'tradition'\\"..  Modern period  First World War-era recruitment poster, stressing the concept of British national identity The First World War \\"reinforced the sense of Britishness\\" and patriotism in the early 20th century. Through war service (including conscription in Great Britain), \\"the English, Welsh, Scots and Irish fought as British\\". The aftermath of the war institutionalised British national commemoration through Remembrance Sunday and the Poppy Appeal. The Second World War had a similar unifying effect upon the British people, however, its outcome was to recondition Britishness on a basis of democratic values and its marked contrast to Europeanism. Notions that the British \\"constituted an Island race, and that it stood for democracy were reinforced during the war and they were circulated in the country through Winston Churchill's speeches, history books and newspapers\\". At its international zenith, \\"Britishness joined peoples around the world in shared traditions and common loyalties that were strenuously maintained\\".. But following the two world wars, the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation. The secession of the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom meant that Britishness had lost \\"its Irish dimension\\" in 1922, and the shrinking empire supplanted by independence movements dwindled the appeal of British identity in the Commonwealth of Nations during the mid-20th century.. Since the British Nationality Act 1948 and the subsequent mass immigration to the United Kingdom from the Commonwealth and elsewhere in the world, \\"the expression and experience of cultural life in Britain has become fragmented and reshaped by the influences of gender, ethnicity, class and region\\".. Furthermore, the United Kingdom's membership of the European Economic Community in 1973 eroded the concept of Britishness as distinct from continental Europe... As such, since the 1970s \\"there has been a sense of crisis about what it has meant to be British\\",. exacerbated by growing demands for greater political autonomy for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The late 20th century saw major changes to the politics of the United Kingdom with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-legislative referendums. Calls for greater autonomy for the four countries of the United Kingdom had existed since their original union with each other, but gathered pace in the 1960s and 1970s. Devolution has led to \\"increasingly assertive Scottish, Welsh and Irish national identities\\",. resulting in more diverse cultural expressions of Britishness,. or else its outright rejection: Gwynfor Evans, a Welsh nationalist politician active in the late 20th century, rebuffed Britishness as \\"a political synonym for Englishness which extends English culture over the Scots, Welsh and the Irish\\". Britons gathered in Whitehall to hear Winston Churchill's victory speech on 8 May 1945 In 2004 Sir Bernard Crick, political theorist and democratic socialist tasked with developing the life in the United Kingdom test said: Gordon Brown initiated a debate on British identity in 2006. Brown's speech to the Fabian Society's Britishness Conference proposed that British values demand a new constitutional settlement and symbols to represent a modern patriotism, including a new youth community service scheme and a British Day to celebrate. One of the central issues identified at the Fabian Society conference was how the English identity fits within the framework of a devolved United Kingdom. An expression of Her Majesty's Government's initiative to promote Britishness was the inaugural Veterans' Day which was first held on 27 June 2006. As well as celebrating the achievements of armed forces veterans, Brown's speech at the first event for the celebration said: In 2018, the Windrush scandal illustrated complex developments in British peoplehood, when it was revealed hundreds of Britons had been wrongfully deported. With roots in the break-up of the empire, and post-war rebuilding; the Windrush generation had arrived as CUKC citizens in the 1950s and 1960s. Born in former British colonies, they settled in the UK before 1973, and were granted ‚Äúright of abode‚Äù by the Immigration Act 1971. Having faced removal, or been deported, many British people of African Caribbean heritage suffered with loss of home, livelihood, and health. As a result of the political scandal, many institutions and elected politicians publicly affirmed that these individuals, while not legally holding British citizenship or nationality, were, in fact, British people. These included British Prime Minister Theresa May, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Her Majesty's CPS Inspectorate Wendy Williams and her House of Commons-ordered Windrush Lessons Learned Review, the Chartered Institute of Housing, Amnesty International, University of Oxford's social geogapher Danny Dorling, and other public figures.

Legend: The earliest migrations of Britons date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD, when Brittonic Celts fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions migrated what is today northern France and north western Spain and forged the colonies of Brittany and Britonia. Brittany remained independent of France until the early 16th century and still retains a distinct Brittonic culture and language, whilst Britonia in modern Galicia was absorbed into Spanish states by the end of the 9th century AD. Britons ‚Äì people with British citizenship or of British descent ‚Äì have a significant presence in a number of countries other than the United Kingdom, and in particular in those with historic connections to the British Empire. After the Age of Discovery the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of Europe, and the British Empire's expansion during the first half of the 19th century triggered an \\"extraordinary dispersion of the British people\\", resulting in particular concentrations \\"in Australasia and North America\\".. The British Empire was \\"built on waves of migration overseas by British people\\",. who left the United Kingdom and \\"reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents\\". As a result of the British colonisation of the Americas, what became the United States was \\"easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British\\", but in Australia the British experienced a birth rate higher than \\"anything seen before\\" resulting in the displacement of indigenous Australians. In colonies such as Southern Rhodesia, British East Africa and Cape Colony, permanently resident British communities were established and whilst never more than a numerical minority these Britons \\"exercised a dominant influence\\" upon the culture and politics of those lands. In Australia, Canada and New Zealand \\"people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population\\" contributing to these states becoming integral to the Anglosphere. The United Kingdom Census 1861 estimated the size of the overseas British to be around 2.5 million, but concluded that most of these were \\"not conventional settlers\\" but rather \\"travellers, merchants, professionals, and military personnel\\". By 1890, there were over 1.5 million further UK-born people living in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 5.6 million Britons lived outside of the United Kingdom. Outside of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories, the largest proportions of people of self-identified ethnic British descent in the world are found in New Zealand (59%), Australia (46%) and Canada (31%), followed by a considerably smaller minority in the United States (10.7%) and parts of the Caribbean. Hong Kong has the highest proportion of British citizens outside of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories, with 47% of Hong Kong residents holding a British National (Overseas) citizenship or a British citizenship.  Australia  The flag of Australia was approved by Australian and British authorities, and features a Union Flag‚Äîthe flag of the United Kingdom‚Äîin the canton. Australia has one of the largest concentrations of people of British heritage. From the beginning of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up a large majority of people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self- governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901. Its history of British dominance meant that Australia was \\"grounded in British culture and political traditions that had been transported to the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century and become part of colonial culture and politics\\". Australia maintains the Westminster system of Parliamentary Government and Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia. Until 1987, the national status of Australian citizens was formally described as \\"British Subject: Citizen of Australia\\". Britons continue to make up a substantial proportion of immigrants. By 1947, Australia was fundamentally British in origin with 7,524,129 or 99.3% of the population declaring themselves as European.Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia No. 37 ‚Äì 1946 and 1947 In the most recent 2016 census, a large proportion of Australians self-identified with British ancestral origins, including 36.1% or 7,852,224 as English and 9.3% (2,023,474) as Scottish alone.THE ANCESTRIES OF AUSTRALIANS ‚Äì Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia ‚Äì Stories from the Census, 2016Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia ‚Äì Ancestry 2016 A substantial proportion ‚Äî33.5%‚Äî chose to identify as ‚ÄòAustralian‚Äô, the census Bureau has stated that most of these are of Anglo- Celtic colonial stock.Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who list \\"Australian\\" as their ancestry are part of the \\"Anglo-Celtic\\" group. All 6 states of Australia retain the flag of the United Kingdom in the canton of their respective flags.  British overseas territories  The approximately 250,000 people of the British overseas territories are British by citizenship, via origins or naturalisation. Along with aspects of common British identity, each of them has their own distinct identity shaped in the respective particular circumstances of political, economic, ethnic, social and cultural history. For instance, in the case of the Falkland Islanders, Lewis Clifton the Speaker of the Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands, explains: In contrast, for the majority of the Gibraltarians, who live in Gibraltar, there is an \\"insistence on their Britishness\\" which \\"carries excessive loyalty\\" to Britain. The sovereignty of Gibraltar has been a point of contention in Spain‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations, but an overwhelming number of Gibraltarians embrace Britishness with strong conviction, in direct opposition to Spanish territorial claims.  Canada  V-E Day celebrations in Toronto, May 1945 Canada traces its statehood to the French, English, and Scottish expeditions of North America from the late-15th century. France ceded nearly all of New France in 1763 after the Seven Years' War, and so after the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776, Quebec and Nova Scotia formed \\"the nucleus of the colonies that constituted Britain's remaining stake on the North American continent\\". British North America attracted the United Empire Loyalists, Britons who migrated out of what they considered the \\"rebellious\\" United States, increasing the size of British communities in what was to become Canada. Queen Elizabeth II, 1954 In 1867 there was a union of three colonies with British North America which together formed the Canadian Confederation, a federal dominion. This began an accretion of additional provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the parliament of the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a \\"continuing importance of Canada's long and close relationship with Britain\\";. large parts of Canada's modern population claim \\"British origins\\" and the cultural impact of the British upon Canada's institutions is profound.. It was not until 1977 that the phrase \\"A Canadian citizen is a British subject\\" ceased to be used in Canadian passports. The politics of Canada are strongly influenced by British political culture. Although significant modifications have been made, Canada is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II as The Queen of Canada and Head of State. English is the mostly commonly spoken language used in Canada and it is an official language of Canada. British iconography remains present in the design of many Canadian flags, with 10 out of 13 Canadian provincial and territorial flags adopting some form of British symbolism in their design. The flag of the United Kingdom is also an official ceremonial flag in Canada known as the Royal Union Flag which is flown outside of federal buildings three days of the year.  New Zealand  The flag of New Zealand features a Union Flag‚Äîthe flag of the United Kingdom‚Äîin the canton. A referendum held in 2016 found that 57% of New Zealand voters wanted to retain the current design of the New Zealand flag. A long-term result of James Cook's voyage of 1768‚Äì1771,. a significant number of New Zealanders are of British descent, for whom a sense of Britishness has contributed to their identity. As late as the 1950s, it was common for British New Zealanders to refer to themselves as British, such as when Prime Minister Keith Holyoake described Sir Edmund Hillary's successful ascent of Mount Everest as putting \\"the British race and New Zealand on top of the world\\". New Zealand passports described nationals as \\"British Subject: Citizen of New Zealand\\" until 1974, when this was changed to \\"New Zealand citizen\\". In an interview with the New Zealand Listener in 2006, Don Brash, the then Leader of the Opposition, said: The politics of New Zealand are strongly influenced by British political culture. Although significant modifications have been made, New Zealand is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system, and retains Elizabeth II as the head of the monarchy of New Zealand.. English is the dominant official language used in New Zealand.  Hong Kong  British nationality law as it pertains to Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life. Citizenship matters were complicated by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in Hong Kong as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as \\"unequal\\", including the ones which ceded Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as British National (Overseas), which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4 million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship. Both British Nationals (Overseas) and British citizens are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens according to the British Nationality Law, which enables them to various rights in the United Kingdom and the European Union.  United States  An English presence in North America began with the Roanoke Colony and Colony of Virginia in the late-16th century, but the first successful English settlement was established in 1607, on the James River at Jamestown. By the 1610s an estimated 1,300 English people had travelled to North America, the \\"first of many millions from the British Isles\\".. In 1620 the Pilgrims established the English imperial venture of Plymouth Colony, beginning \\"a remarkable acceleration of permanent emigration from England\\" with over 60% of trans- Atlantic English migrants settling in the New England Colonies. During the 17th century an estimated 350,000 English and Welsh migrants arrived in North America, which in the century after the Acts of Union 1707 was surpassed in rate and number by Scottish and Irish migrants.. The British policy of salutary neglect for its North American colonies intended to minimise trade restrictions as a way of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal acknowledgement of the United States' sovereignty at the end of the American Revolutionary War. Nevertheless, longstanding cultural and historical ties have, in more modern times, resulted in the Special Relationship, the historically close political, diplomatic, and military co-operation between the United Kingdom and United States. Linda Colley, a professor of history at Princeton University and specialist in Britishness, suggested that because of their colonial influence on the United States, the British find Americans a \\"mysterious and paradoxical people, physically distant but culturally close, engagingly similar yet irritatingly different\\".. For over two centuries (1789-1989) of early U.S. history, all Presidents with the exception of two (Van Buren and Kennedy) were descended from the varied colonial British stock, from the Pilgrims and Puritans to the Scotch-Irish and English who settled the Appalachia. The largest concentrations of self-reported British ethnic ancestry in the United States were found to be in Utah (35%), Maine (30%), New Hampshire (25%) and Vermont (25%) at the 2015 American Community Survey.https://statisticalatlas.com/United-States/Overview 'Overview of the United States' Overall, 10.7% of Americans reported their ethnic ancestry as some form of \\"British\\" in the 2013‚Äì17 ACS, behind German and African ancestries and on par with Mexican and Irish ancestries.  Chile  British and Chilean flags in a monument in Antofagasta city Coat of arms of Coquimbo, with the Union Flag. Approximately 4% of Chile's population is of British or Irish descent. Over 50,000 British immigrants settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially in the city of Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valpara√≠so, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe. In Valpara√≠so, they created their largest and most important colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, social clubs, sports clubs, business organisations and periodicals. Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as football, horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea. During the movement for independence (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the Chilean Navy, under the command of Lord Cochrane. British investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the War of the Pacific, in 1878‚Äì79, against an alliance between Peru and Bolivia. The liberal-socialist \\"Revolution of 1891\\" introduced political reforms modelled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking. British immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the saltpetre boom, in the ports of Iquique and Pisagua. The \\"King of Saltpetre\\", John Thomas North, was the principal tycoon of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the Club H√≠pico (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s. Some Scots settled in the country's more temperate regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as merchants, tradesmen and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports. An important contingent of British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of Magallanes. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as Santiago, Coquimbo, the Araucan√≠a, and Chilo√©. The cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community into society at large. Customs taken from the British include afternoon tea (called onces by Chileans), football, rugby union and horse racing. Another legacy is the widespread use of British personal names by Chileans. Chile has the largest population of descendants of British settlers in Latin America. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, Scottish and Welsh) origin, amounting to 4.5% of Chile's population.  South Africa  Cecil John Rhodes, the 6th Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (divided between two provinces in modern-day South Africa) and founder of the De Beers diamond company. The British arrived in the area which would become the modern-day South Africa during the early 18th century, yet substantial settlement only started end of the 18th century, in the Cape of Good Hope; the British first explored the area for conquests for or related to the Slave Trade. In the late 19th century, the discovery of gold and diamonds further encouraged colonisation of South Africa by the British, and the population of the British-South Africans rose substantially, although there was fierce rivalry between the British and Afrikaners (descendants of Dutch colonists) in the period known as the Boer Wars. When apartheid first started most British- South Africans were mostly keen on keeping and even strengthening its ties with the United Kingdom. The latest census in South Africa showed that there are almost 2 million British-South Africans; they make up about 40% of the total White South African demographic, and the greatest white British ancestry populations in South Africa are in the KwaZulu-Natal province and in the cities of Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth.  Ireland  Paddy Mayne from County Down; a founding member of the SAS; was one of the most decorated British soldiers of World War II. He also played rugby for Ireland. Plantations of Ireland introduced large numbers of people from Great Britain to Ireland throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period. The resulting Protestant Ascendancy, the aristocratic class of the Lordship of Ireland, broadly identified themselves as Anglo-Irish.. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Protestant British settlers subjugated Catholic, Gaelic inhabitants in the north of Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster and the Williamite War in Ireland; it was \\"an explicit attempt to control Ireland strategically by introducing ethnic and religious elements loyal to the British interest in Ireland\\".. The Ulster Scots people are an ethnic group of British origin in Ireland, broadly descended from Lowland Scots who settled in large numbers in the Province of Ulster during the planned process of colonisations of Ireland which took place in the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Together with English and Welsh settlers, these Scots introduced Protestantism (particularly the Presbyterianism of the Church of Scotland) and the Ulster Scots and English languages to, mainly, northeastern Ireland. With the partition of Ireland and independence for what is now the Republic of Ireland some of these people found themselves no longer living within the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland itself was, for many years, the site of a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict‚ÄîThe Troubles‚Äîbetween those claiming to represent Irish nationalism, who are predominantly Roman Catholic, and those claiming to represent British unionism, who are predominantly Protestant. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists desire a united Ireland. Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, most of the paramilitary groups involved in the Troubles have ceased their armed campaigns, and constitutionally, the people of Northern Ireland have been recognised as \\"all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence\\". The Good Friday Agreement guarantees the \\"recognition of the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\\".  Culture  Result from the expansion of the British Empire, British cultural influence can be observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture. As a result of the history of the formation of the United Kingdom, the cultures of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness.  Cuisine  Fish and chips, a popular take-away food throughout the United Kingdom, has been described as the quintessential British dish.. Historically, British cuisine has meant \\"unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients, matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour, rather than disguise it\\". It has been \\"vilified as unimaginative and heavy\\", and traditionally been limited in its international recognition to the full breakfast and the Christmas dinner.. This is despite British cuisine having absorbed the culinary influences of those who have settled in Britain, resulting in hybrid dishes such as the British Asian Chicken tikka masala, hailed by some as \\"Britain's true national dish\\". Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for Celts and Britons. The Anglo-Saxons developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The Norman conquest of England introduced exotic spices into Britain in the Middle Ages. The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of India's food tradition of \\"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\\". Food rationing policies, imposed by the British government during wartime periods of the 20th century, are said to have been the stimulus for British cuisine's poor international reputation. British dishes include fish and chips, the Sunday roast, and bangers and mash. British cuisine has several national and regional varieties, including English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine, each of which has developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese, Cheshire cheese, the Yorkshire pudding, Arbroath Smokie, Cornish pasty and Welsh cakes. The British are the second largest per capita tea consumers in the world, consuming an average of per person each year. British tea culture dates back to the 19th century, when India was part of the British Empire and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent.  Languages  There is no single British language, though English is by far the main language spoken by British citizens, being spoken monolingually by more than 70% of the UK population. English is therefore the de facto official language of the United Kingdom. However, under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, Irish Gaelic, Ulster Scots, Manx, Scots and Lowland Scots languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government. As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic have a different legal status from other minority languages. In some parts of the UK, some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language; in wider areas, their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported or promoted by central or local government policy. For naturalisation purposes, a competence standard of English, Scottish Gaelic or Welsh is required to pass the life in the United Kingdom test. However, English is used routinely, and although considered culturally important, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are much less used. Throughout the United Kingdom there are distinctive spoken expressions and regional accents of English, which are seen to be symptomatic of a locality's culture and identity.. An awareness and knowledge of accents in the United Kingdom can \\"place, within a few miles, the locality in which a man or woman has grown up\\"..  Literature  J.K. Rowling is one of the world's best selling British authors. Her Harry Potter series of books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide. British literature is \\"one of the leading literatures in the world\\". The overwhelming part is written in the English language, but there are also pieces of literature written in Scots, Scottish Gaelic, Ulster Scots, Cornish and Welsh. Britain has a long history of famous and influential authors. It boasts some of the oldest pieces of literature in the Western world, such as the epic poem Beowulf, one of the oldest surviving written work in the English language. Famous authors include some of the world's most studied and praised writers. William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe defined England's Elizabethan period. The British Romantic movement was one of the strongest and most recognisable in Europe. The poets William Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature. Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing, including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray. Women's literature in Britain has had a long and often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot. Other great female novelists that have contributed to world literature are Frances Burney, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen and the Bront√´ sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne. Non-fiction has also played an important role in the history of British letters, with the first dictionary of the English language being produced and compiled by Samuel Johnson, a graduate of Oxford University and a London resident.  Media and music  The Proms is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts held across the United Kingdom. The Last Night of the Proms celebrates British tradition with patriotic classical music of the United Kingdom. Although cinema, theatre, dance and live music are popular, the favourite pastime of the British is watching television.. Public broadcast television in the United Kingdom began in 1936, with the launch of the BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels available on a national basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five. 100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000, chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened. Topping the list was Fawlty Towers, a British sitcom set in a fictional Torquay hotel starring John Cleese. \\"British musical tradition is essentially vocal\\", dominated by the music of England and Germanic culture,. most greatly influenced by hymns and Anglican church music.. However, the specific, traditional music of Wales and music of Scotland is distinct, and of the Celtic musical tradition. In the United Kingdom, more people attend live music performances than football matches. British rock was born in the mid-20th century out of the influence of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from the United States. Major early exports were The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks.. Together with other bands from the United Kingdom, these constituted the British Invasion, a popularisation of British pop and rock music in the United States. Into the 1970s heavy metal, new wave, and 2 tone. Britpop is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands reviving British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. Leading exponents of Britpop were Blur, Oasis and Pulp. Also popularised in the United Kingdom during the 1990s were several domestically produced varieties of electronic dance music; acid house, UK hard house, jungle, UK garage which in turn have influenced grime and British hip hop in the 2000s. The BRIT Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's annual awards for both international and British popular music.  Religion  Westminster Abbey is used for the coronation of the British monarchs, who are also made the head of the Church of England. Historically, Christianity has been the most influential and important religion in Britain, and it remains the declared faith of the majority of the British people. The influence of Christianity on British culture has been \\"widespread, extending beyond the spheres of prayer and worship. Churches and cathedrals make a significant contribution to the architectural landscape of the nation's cities and towns\\" whilst \\"many schools and hospitals were founded by men and women who were strongly influenced by Christian motives\\". Throughout the United Kingdom, Easter and Christmas, the \\"two most important events in the Christian calendar\\", are recognised as public holidays. Christianity remains the major religion of the population of the United Kingdom in the 21st century, followed by Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and then Judaism in terms of numbers of adherents. The 2007 Tearfund Survey revealed 53% identified themselves as Christian, which was similar to the 2004 British Social Attitudes Survey, and to the United Kingdom Census 2001 in which 71.6% said that Christianity was their religion, However, the Tearfund Survey showed only one in ten Britons attend church weekly. Secularism was advanced in Britain during the Age of Enlightenment, and modern British organisations such as the British Humanist Association and the National Secular Society offer the opportunity for their members to \\"debate and explore the moral and philosophical issues in a non-religious setting\\". The Treaty of Union that led to the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists. The Presbyterian Church of Scotland (known informally as The Kirk), is recognised as the national church of Scotland and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member and is required to swear an oath to \\"defend the security\\" of the church upon his or her accession. The Roman Catholic Church in Scotland is Scotland's second largest Christian church, with followers representing a sixth of the population of Scotland. The Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland over matters of theology and ritual. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the 19th century, led to the creation of other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the Free Church of Scotland. In the 1920s, the Church in Wales became independent from the Church of England and became 'disestablished' but remains in the Anglican Communion. Methodism and other Protestant churches have had a major presence in Wales. The main religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis. Though collectively Protestants constitute the overall majority, the Roman Catholic Church of Ireland is the largest single church. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, closely linked to the Church of Scotland in terms of theology and history, is the second largest church followed by the Church of Ireland (Anglican) which was disestablished in the 19th century.  Sport  The British gold medalist relay team of the 2008 World Orienteering Championships. Sport is an important element of British culture, and is one of the most popular leisure activities of Britons. Within the United Kingdom, nearly half of all adults partake in one or more sporting activity each week. Some of the major sports in the United Kingdom \\"were invented by the British\\", including football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket, and \\"exported various other games\\" including tennis, badminton, boxing, golf, snooker and squash.. In most sports, separate organisations, teams and clubs represent the individual countries of the United Kingdom at international level, though in some sports, like rugby union, an all-Ireland team represents both Northern Ireland and Ireland (Republic of), and the British and Irish Lions represent Ireland and Britain as a whole. The UK is represented by a single team at the Olympic Games and at the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Great Britain team won 65 medals: 29 gold (the most since the 1908 Summer Olympics), 17 silver and 19 bronze, ranking them 3rd.See the articles entitled All-time Olympic Games medal table and Great Britain at the Olympics. In total, sportsmen and women from the UK \\"hold over 50 world titles in a variety of sports, such as professional boxing, rowing, snooker, squash and motorcycle sports\\". A 2006 poll found that association football was the most popular sport in the UK. In England 320 football clubs are affiliated to The Football Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs to regional or district associations. The FA, founded in 1863, and the Football League, founded in 1888, were both the first of their kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 full and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Football Association. Two Welsh clubs play in England's Football League, one in the Premier league, and others at non-league level, whilst the Welsh Football League contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In Northern Ireland, 12 semi- professional clubs play in the IFA Premiership, the second oldest league in the world. Recreational fishing, particularly angling, is one of the most popular participation activities in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 3‚Äì4 million anglers in the country. The most widely practised form of angling in England and Wales is for coarse fish while in Scotland angling is usually for salmon and trout.  Visual art and architecture  For centuries, artists and architects in Britain were overwhelmingly influenced by Western art history. Amongst the first visual artists credited for developing a distinctly British aesthetic and artistic style is William Hogarth.. The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire, led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom. Britons used their art \\"to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world\\", whilst the permanent settlers in British North America, Australasia, and South Africa \\"embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity\\". The empire has been \\"at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art\\", and imperial British visual arts have been fundamental to the construction, celebration and expression of Britishness. British attitudes to modern art were \\"polarised\\" at the end of the 19th century.. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by \\"many conservative critics\\" as a \\"subversive foreign influence\\", but became \\"fully assimilated\\" into British art during the early-20th century. Representational art was described by Herbert Read during the interwar period as \\"necessarily... revolutionary\\", and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s, Classicism was effectively void in British visual art. Post-modern, contemporary British art, particularly that of the Young British Artists, has been pre-occupied with postcolonialism, and \\"characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture ... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety\\". Architecture of the United Kingdom is diverse; most influential developments have usually taken place in England, but Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have at various times played leading roles in architectural history. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the British Isles, British architecture effectively begins with the first Anglo-Saxon Christian churches, built soon after Augustine of Canterbury arrived in Great Britain in 597. Norman architecture was built on a vast scale from the 11th century onwards in the form of castles and churches to help impose Norman authority upon their dominion. English Gothic architecture, which flourished between 1180 until around 1520, was initially imported from France, but quickly developed its own unique qualities. Secular medieval architecture throughout Britain has left a legacy of large stone castles, with the \\"finest examples\\" being found lining both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border, dating from the Wars of Scottish Independence of the 14th century. The invention of gunpowder and canons made castles redundant, and the English Renaissance which followed facilitiated the development of new artistic styles for domestic architecture: Tudor style, English Baroque, The Queen Anne Style and Palladian. Georgian and Neoclassical architecture advanced after the Scottish Enlightenment. Outwith the United Kingdom, the influence of British architecture is particularly strong in South India,. the result of British rule in India in the 19th century. The Indian cities of Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai each have courts, hotels and train stations designed in British architectural styles of Gothic Revivalism and neoclassicism.  Political culture  The Palace of Westminster is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which houses the Parliament of the United Kingdom. British political culture is tied closely with its institutions and civics, and a \\"subtle fusion of new and old values\\".. The principle of constitutional monarchy, with its notions of stable parliamentary government and political liberalism, \\"have come to dominate British culture\\".. These views have been reinforced by Sir Bernard Crick who said:. British political institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and Privy Council of the United Kingdom.. Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body.. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made Privy Counsellors, as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy Counsellors. Universal suffrage for all males over 21 was granted in 1918 and for adult women in 1928 after the Suffragette movement.. Politics in the United Kingdom is multi-party, with three dominant political parties: the Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party. The social structure of Britain, specifically social class, has \\"long been pre-eminent among the factors used to explain party allegiance\\", and still persists as \\"the dominant basis\\" of party political allegiance for Britons.. The Conservative Party is descended from the historic Tory Party (founded in England in 1678), and is a centre-right conservative political party, which traditionally draws support from the middle classes.. The Labour Party (founded by Scotsman Keir Hardie) grew out of the trade union movement and socialist political parties of the 19th century, and continues to describe itself as a \\"democratic socialist party\\". Labour states that it stands for the representation of the low-paid working class, who have traditionally been its members and voters. The Scottish National Party is the third largest political party in the UK in terms of both party membership and representation in parliament, having won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats at the 2015 General Election. The Liberal Democrats are a liberal political party, and fourth largest in England in terms of membership and MPs elected. It is descended from the Liberal Party, a major ruling party of 19th-century UK through to the First World War, when it was supplanted by the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats have historically drawn support from wide and \\"differing social backgrounds\\".. There are over 300 other, smaller political parties in the United Kingdom registered to the Electoral Commission.  Classification  According to the British Social Attitudes Survey, there are broadly two interpretations of British identity, with ethnic and civic dimensions: Of the two perspectives of British identity, the civic definition has become \\"the dominant idea ... by far\\", and in this capacity, Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity. This has been used to explain why first-, second- and third-generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British, rather than English, because it is an \\"institutional, inclusive\\" identity, that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law; the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British. However, this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales; \\"white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people\\". Contrawise, in Scotland and Wales, White British and ethnic minority people both identified more strongly with Scotland and Wales than with Britain. Studies and surveys have \\"reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish/Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis\\". The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain, \\"the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh\\". However, \\"English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British, while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British\\". Some persons opted \\"to combine both identities\\" as \\"they felt Scottish or Welsh, but held a British passport and were therefore British\\", whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and \\"felt quite divorced from the British, whom they saw as the English\\". Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as \\"nationalism\\", a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as \\"cultural imperialism imposed\\" upon the United Kingdom by \\"English ruling elites\\",. or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word \\"English\\" with \\"British\\", which has \\"brought about a desire among Scots, Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity\\".

The international movement was instigated by Willi M√ºnzenberg the German Comintern leader who founded a multitude of front organisations in his quest to spread the word and power of International Communism. The Australian movement set out to attract \\"fellow-travellers\\" and pacifists, and was relatively independent of the international organisation. MAWF organised political rallies and protests and issued the magazine War! What For? (February 1934 - May 1936), later World Peace (June 1936 - June 1939),Partial sets of War! What For? / World Peace are available from various Australian libraries, and a complete set is held by the State Library of Victoria: slv.vic.gov.au to expose the development of fascism in Europe in the 1930s - particularly in Germany and Italy, and during the Spanish Civil War - while promoting the cause of Communism. The movement disbanded in 1939. The movement instigated the events which led to the attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia in late 1934 and early 1935. During the 1936 to 1939 Spanish Civil War, the MAWF played a prominent role in publicising stories from the front and condemned democratic governments for failing to come to the aid of the elected socialist government while fascist governments were supporting the right-wing rebels led by General Francisco Franco. The organisation continued to criticise democratic governments, including that led by Joseph Lyons in Australia, for anti-free speech and anti-Communist policies, which some historians have argued weakened its otherwise prescient message about the escalating threat posed by fascism and Nazism. Indeed, the main debate between historians with an interest in the MAWF has been a preoccupation about the extent to which it was first and foremost a Communist front organisation.Rose, David.

It is set during the French Revolutionary Wars and later in the series during the Napoleonic wars. Plot Nicholas Lord Ramage is the third lieutenant on His Majesty's ship Sibella, but assumes command when the Captain, and the First and Second Lieutenants are killed by fire from a French ship. The French ship had fatally crippled the Sibella and had killed over half of her crew, including the surgeon and surgeon's mate. As the new Captain, Ramage decides to abandon the sinking ship. He leaves the injured on the deck to be taken prisoner by the French and hopefully treated by their surgeon. Before he abandons the ship, Ramage retrieves some documents and the late Captain's last orders. The remaining crew then loads into the four lifeboats and rows away. As they are rowing away, the crew of the French ship set the Sibella on fire after taking the injured off. Ramage opens Sir John Jervis's orders to the late Captain and finds that the Sibella was on a rescue mission to extricate the Marchesa di Volterri along with five other nobles including the Marchesa's two cousins. Austria was proving unable to defend its possessions in northern Italy, despite the subsidies the British government was paying to support the Austrian army. Britain, unable to deploy major forces on the European continent, used its commercial power to bolster the land armies of allies like Austria and Spain against the French for over a decade. Ramage decides to go through with the rescue. He takes the captain's gig with several topmen and the former Captain's coxswain, Jackson, with him and sends the other surviving sailors to Bastia. Ramage and his men then land upon Monte Argentario and find the Marchesa with the help of a local charcoal maker. Half of the nobles decide not to risk trying to escape in a small boat, but Ramage rescues the Marchesa and one of her cousins, Count Pisano, although the other cousin, Count Pitti, is apparently killed by Napoleon's cavalry during the escape. The refugees are eventually picked up by the Lively frigate under the command of Captain Probus. That night Pisano accuses Ramage of cowardice in connection with the death of Count Pitti, submitting a formal accusation to Probus. During their time together, the Marchesa and Ramage develop a Romeo-and- Juliet-esque relationship, with the conniving of her family and the demands of discretion upon them.Ramage 186 (McBook ed). Captain Probus makes this comparison, \\"Well you can console yourself it's a lot worse on shore in Corsica with the vendetta:Romeo and Juliet....Are you in love with the girl?\\" After the Marchesa is safe, Ramage is sent to trial according to the Articles of War for his loss of the Sibella. Captain Croucher, a political enemy of Ramage's father, brings the accusation of cowardice into the trial. Ramage's trial is interrupted by Commodore Nelson's arrival, effectively ending the trial. Nelson gives him the command of the cutter Kathleen sending him to rescue the crew of the frigate HMS Belette which had run aground and was under fire from Napoleon's troops. Ramage saves the stranded crew and returns to Nelson. Upon his return, he learns that Count Pitti, who he had been unable to rescue had not been killed, but instead had hidden and later escaped. The book ends as Ramage considers his orders to carry the Marchesa and Count Pitti to Gibraltar.

BATCO, short for Battle Code, is a hand- held, paper-based encryption system used at a low, front line (platoon, troop and section) level in the British Army. It was introduced along with the Clansman combat net radio in the early 1980s and was largely obsolete by 2010 due to the wide deployment of the secure Bowman radios. BATCO consists of a code, contained on a set of vocabulary cards, and cipher sheets for superencryption of the numeric code words. The cipher sheets, which are typically changed daily, also include an authentication table and a radio call sign protection system. BATCO is similar to older Slidex system. The use of BATCO is still taught to Royal Signals Communication Systems Operators as a back-up should secure equipment fail or be unavailable. It is also taught to Army Cadets and Combined Cadets as part of the Signal Classification qualification. The BATCO code Messages in BATCO are first encoded into numbers using one of several vocabulary cards. The BATCO cipher is then used to encrypt the numbers into letters, which can be transmitted over unsecure channels. The process is reversed at the receiving end. Each BATCO vocabulary card groups words needed for a particular function, so card changes are infrequent. Every vocabulary word on a card is assigned a two digit code. Some vocabulary card entries call for a fixed number of digits after the two digit code. For example, the code for ETA (estimated time of arrival) is followed by a four digit time of day. Each card in a set has a three digit number and there is always a code word on the card that means switch to card number xxx.http://www.campx.ca/crypto.html Site with photo of BATCO vocabulary card and slide rule Vocabulary cards used in conjunction with British Army BATCO encryption system. The BATCO cipher Each BATCO cipher sheet is composed of a double-sided sheet of about A5 size that fits in a specially made BATCO wallet. Each single side is usually valid for 24 Hours. The wallet has a slide that aids in reading the tables correctly. The plaintext character set in BATCO consists of 12 symbols, the digits 0 to 9, the decimal point and a \\"change\\" character denoted as CH. The BATCO ciphertext character set is the letters A through Z. BATCO can also be used to transmit numeric information, such as grid coordinates. Switching to this mode is accomplished by sending the vocabulary code for an appropriate proword, such as FIGURES or GRID. The decimal point plaintext character is used as needed in numeric mode, having its normal meaning. The CH symbol is used to mark the end of a numeric string transmission, returning to the vocabulary card codes. The main BATCO cipher table is a matrix of 19 columns and 26 rows. The columns are divided into two groups. The seven left columns are numbered 2 through 7. The column under each digit contains a randomly scrambled alphabet. The right 13 columns are labeled 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, CH, \\".\\", i.e. the plaintext symbols with 0 repeated. Each row in the right columns set contains a scrambled alphabet, with two letters in each cell. (There are 13 columns, so two letters per cell exhausts the alphabet.) A traffic key consist of a digit (from 2 to 7) and a letter. The operator selects one of the first 7 columns using the key digit and then finds the row in which the key letter occurs. That row in the second set of columns is used to encipher and decipher BATCO messages. The scrambled alphabet in the selected row defines the correspondence between plaintext symbols in the column headings and ciphertext symbols in the individual cells. Note that there are two possible ciphertexts for each plaintext symbol, except for 0, which has four possible ciphertexts. BATCO users are instructed to choose different ciphertext symbols when the same plaintext symbol repeats in a message. Security is maintained by frequent key changes. BATCO instructions require a new key for every message and that no more than 22 symbols should be encoded with a single key. Keys are rotated in alphabetical order, so key 5F would be followed by 5G. Key column 7 is kept in reserve for emergencies. Other functions In addition to the cipher, each BATCO sheet has a: * Spelling box * Authentication table * Callsign Indicator chart The spelling box converts letters into two digit numbers which can then be encoded using the procedure described above. It is used is special situations to spell out words that are sensitive and are not on any of the vocabulary cards. The spelling box is a 6 column by 5 row matrix labeled horizontally and vertically with single digits. The matrix contains a scrambled alphabet and four blank cells. The authentication table converts a two digit challenge number into a two digit response. It is a 10 by 5 grid, also labeled horizontally and vertically with single digits. Each cell contains a random two digit number, with no repeated cells. A challenge is issued as a two digit number specifying the columns and row that selects a cell in the table. The response is the contents of the cell. A final scrambled alphabet at the bottom of the cipher sheet is used for a call sign scrambling system. British army 1980's paper based code system wallet.

Tommy Russell is seated in the driver's seat of the first car. The Russell Motor Car Company was an automobile manufacturer in Toronto, Canada, that produced cars from 1904 to 1916. The company is considered to have produced Canada's first successful automobile.Filey, Mike. Mount Pleasant Cemetery: An Illustrated Guide. (Dundurn Press Ltd., 1999) p. 188. In 1903, weakness in the bicycle market prompted Canada Cycle and Motor Co. (C.C.M.), a bicycle manufacturer, to acquire the assets of Canadian Motors Ltd., a failed automobile producer. Tommy Russell (1877-1940), C.C.M.'s new general manager, saw an opportunity to diversify his company's product line.Vance, Bill. Russell: a truly native Canadian car. Canadian Driver. Retrieved 2008-08-29. From 1903 to 1905, C.C.M.'s new automobile division, named Russell Motor Car Company with Russell serving as president, began production of electric-powered two-passenger runabouts. In 1905, the company produced its first \\"Model A\\" car with a two-cylinder gasoline engine. A larger \\"Model B\\", and a four-cylinder \\"Model C\\", arrived in 1906. A 40 horsepower touring car was introduced in 1907, with a more prestigious 50 horsepower model coming in 1908. The Russell vehicles developed a reputation as well- built and engineered cars, and success allowed Russell to focus on the high- end market. Sales offices were opened in England, Australia and New Zealand. In Canada, Russell promoted its vehicles as \\"The Thoroughly Canadian Car,\\" built with Canadian material, labour and capital. Marketing included publicity stunts such as races on frozen Lake Ontario between Russell cars and ice- yachts. The Russell Motor Car Company Limited was incorporated separately from C.C.M. in 1911.Russell Industries Limited. Canadian Register of Commerce & Industry, 1959. The company began to experience difficulties with its sleeve valve engines in 1913. A downturn in the high-end market, coupled with the commencement of the First World War in 1914, resulted in Russell selling its automobile production business to the American manufacturer Willys-Overland Motors in 1916. Russell produced munitions during the war, and manufactured automobile parts after the war ended. In 1938, the company changed its name to Russell Industries Limited, as it continued its shift away from the automobile industry, expanding into the manufacture of machine parts. The company continued to exist into the 1950s.

The first Bah√° º√≠s arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and the first of these to have become a Bah√° º√≠ was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bah√° º√≠s in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Circa 2006 the Bah√° º√≠s showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies. Early days Far East The Bah√° º√≠ Faith entered the region of the Far East, in Hong Kong, in the 1870s, during the lifetime of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. While the religion continued to enter other nearby regions to Taiwan -- Bah√° º√≠s being in Shanghai in 1902, Japan in 1912, Canton in 1949, and Macau in 1953, there was no Bah√° º√≠ contact with the island until 1949. Between 1895 and 1945, until ending with World War II, Taiwan was under Japanese rule and then there was the period of the Chinese Civil War. Beginning in Taiwan Four Bah√° º√≠s arrived in Taiwan in 1949 as part of the wave of refugees of Chiang Kai-shek's retreat from the mainland: Jerone Chu, Yan Hsu-chang, Chien Tien-lee, and Gellan Wang. The first Bah√° º√≠ in Taiwan was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung), a newspaper man, who had become a Bah√° º√≠ in Washington D.C. in 1945. Chu arrived in Taiwan after a stay in Nanking where an associate, Yuan Hsu-chang, had accepted the religion and also came to Taiwan. Major Chien Tien-lee (Lee L.T. Chang) had had a Bah√° º√≠ marriage ceremony in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. and came to Taiwan after a stay in Shanghai. The first American Bah√° º√≠ visitors to Taiwan were Dr. David Earl and Lt. Col. John McHenry in 1952, and Rafi and Mildred Mottahedeh in 1953. In October of that year Dhikru'llah Khadem visited Taiwan, the first Hand of the Cause -- people who achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion -- to do so and at a meeting he held in Chu's home three more people accepted the Bah√° º√≠ Faith: these three were Professor Tsao Li-shih, who was an instructor of architecture at the College of Engineering at the National Taiwan University; Hong Li-ming (Jimmy), the first native-born Taiwanese to become a Bah√° º√≠; and Wong Ho-len (Wong Ho-jen). Later, Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani, who were Bah√° º√≠s in Shanghai, left that city in 1950, and arrived in Taiwan in 1954 at port Keelung where they found there was already a community of ten Bah√° º√≠s spread among some of the cities of Taiwan: Taipei (2), Tainan (4), Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Chiayi. Mrs. Suleimani was from a Bah√° º√≠ family from Ashqabad who left in 1923. Growth By May 1955 there were eighteen Bah√° º√≠s in six localities across Taiwan. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956, which was noted by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion. The members were Mr. Wang Chi- chang, Mrs. Suleimani, Mr. Pai Chung-chen, Mrs. Ruthy Tu, Mr. Tsao Li-shih. Standing. Dr. Ni Jun-chung (ching), Mr. Chu, Mr. Winston Luk, and Mr. Ho Chung-tzu. Mrs. Tu was the first woman citizen of Taiwan to become a Bah√° º√≠ and was elected to be a delegate in 1957 to the election of the regional National Spiritual Assembly but was unable to travel. Noted Bah√° º√≠ Agnes Alexander visited the island in 1956, and, after being appointed as a Hand of the Cause, visited the island again in 1958 and 1962. From 1955 through 1957, petitions by the Bah√° º√≠ community were submitted to the Taiwanese government to be recognized as a religion by the government had failed, though permission was given to have a temporary Bah√° º√≠ summer school in September 1957. In 1957, the first regional National Assembly election convention of the Bah√° º√≠s of North East Asia, held in Tokyo, was convened; the jurisdiction of the National Assembly included Taiwan. In 1958, the second Local Spiritual Assembly of the island was established in Taipei with the arrival of two pioneers and one more citizen convert. By April 1958 the number of Bah√° º√≠s in Taiwan had reached twenty-two. The first official use of the Tainan Bah√° º√≠ Centre was in 1959. In 1960 the book Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era was revised, translated and reprinted and one copy was given to every Bah√° º√≠ in Taiwan. In 1963 Mrs. Tu was able to attend the first Bah√° º√≠ World Congress which also the year of the first Bah√° º√≠ marriage ceremony in Taiwan. The first Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of Taiwan was first elected in 1967 -- the members of the institution were Mrs. Isabel Dean and Mrs. Ridvaniyyih Suleimani, Mr. Kuo Rong-hui, Mr. Robert Yen, Dr. Sidney Dean, Mr. S.A. Suleimani, Mr. Tsao Kai-min, Mr. Huang Tsen-min and Mr. Huang Ting-seng. At the time there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Then in 1970 the Bah√° º√≠ community of the island was recognized by the government. In 1990, the Chief of the indigenous Puyuma Tribe, Mr. Chen Wen-sheng, became a Bah√° º√≠. Multiplying interests Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio- economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In more recent years the Bah√° º√≠s of Taiwan have participated in a number of local and international activities. By 1995, the Bah√° º√≠ Office of the Environment for Taiwan, in collaboration with the national government, had trained hundreds of teachers throughout the country to introduce conservation issues into curricula. The Office also produced a series of national radio educational programs on environmental care and protection. In December 1997 Bah√° º√≠s were invited to participate in a local exhibit of religions. In 2001 Bah√° º√≠s from Taiwan attended the opening of the Seat of the International Teaching Centre. In 2004, the Taiwanese Bah√° º√≠ community organizes 20 regular children's classes, attracting some 200 children. Modern Community Circa 2006 the Bah√° º√≠s showed up in the national census with 16,000, or 0.1% of the national population with 13 assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) agreed with that estimate in 2005.

Palin was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President in the 2008 presidential election alongside Arizona Senator John McCain. She has provided political commentary for Fox News, and expressed her positions on a wide range of political issues during her career in the public eye. Social and legal issues Religion in public life Despite attending a Pentecostal church which supported abstinence from alcohol, Palin, then on the Wasilla City Council, cast the deciding vote against restricting the hours during which the city's bars could operate. According to Gene Straatmeyer, a local Presbyterian minister, Palin told him during a city council hearing, \\"'I go to Assembly of God Church and I am a Sunday school teacher there and I see no relationship between my Christian faith and what hours the bars close.'\\" Straatmeyer continued, \\"She felt it was out of line for me to testify on behalf of the church groups I represented.\\" The effort to restrict bar hours was intended to combat drunken driving and spousal abuse, but Palin felt that restricting bar hours would hurt the local economy. During a candidates' debate for governor in 2006, when asked how she would feel if a church pastor endorsed a candidate for governor, Palin said that she \\"would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech,\\" but would caution the pastor that the endorsement could result in \\"frustration\\" and \\"fewer dollars in the offering plate\\". In 2006, Palin told the Associated Press that her personal beliefs would not dictate her public policies, adding that she was \\"not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else.\\" During a debate for Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin said she was a proponent of teaching both creationism and evolution in the Alaska public schools. The following day she said: \\"It doesn't have to be part of the curriculum\\", and that she would not push to have it added. She also said she would not use religion or views on creationism as a litmus test in picking members of the Alaska Board of Education. (Under state law, the board of education determines the content of the public schools' curriculum.) Palin has also said that evolution \\"should be taught as an accepted principle. And, as you know, I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher, a science teacher, who has really instilled in me a respect for science. It should be taught in our schools. And I won't deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth. But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught in science class.\\" While Governor, Palin vetoed public funding for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, \\"I'm a Christian.... [The funding is] unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had to go in there and veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're not a real conservative or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal.\\"(At 16:52). Palintv.com. Retrieved on June 4, 2011. As Alaska Governor, she signed the \\"Christian Heritage Week\\" Proclamation in October 2007 which \\"reminds Alaskans of the role Christianity has played in our rich heritage.\\" She also declared the week of November 18‚Äì25, 2007 as Bible Week in Alaska, stating that \\"the Bible has profoundly influenced art, literature, music, and codes of law.\\" After the 2008 Republican National Convention, Palin's religious views became the subject of media interest and even scrutiny. She had attended a Pentecostal church for 26 years which practiced laying on of hands and speaking in tongues during church services. She was quoted as saying that she had grown up in the Pentecostal Assembly of God church and that nothing about the service disturbed her. Before running for statewide office in 2002, however, she began attending the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church, a church which was described by The Times as \\"more reserved\\". In June 2008 she made a return visit to her former church, where she gave a speech to ministry students linking religion to war and energy. She said that it was God's will that the Alaska gas pipeline be completed. In October 2008, the McCain campaign said that Palin had deeply held religious beliefs and did not consider herself a Pentecostal. On June 10, 2010, Palin expressed dismay on her Twitter account that the floodlights of the Empire State Building would not be changed blue and white in honor of Mother Teresa's 100th birthday. Palin asked why the building's owner \\"won't honor Mother Theresa's compassionate, selfless efforts for humanity, but [you will] honor [the] Communist Mao?\\"Twitter / Sarah Palin: U kidding, Empire State Bl. Twitter.com (June 10, 2010). Retrieved on June 4, 2011. Palin was referring to the Empire State Building's September 9, 2009 lighting scheme, when it was bathed in red and yellow to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Palin opposed the construction of Park51, a proposed 13-story Islamic cultural center with mosque, planned to be built in New York City on Park Place between West Broadway and Church Street, two blocks away from Ground Zero. In the wake of the Supreme Court decision Snyder v. Phelps, which held that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket the funerals of dead soldiers on a public sidewalk, Palin asserted that the Court held a double standard for the WBC's speech, as opposed to other religious speech. On March 2, 2011, she tweeted: \\"Common sense & decency absent as wacko 'church' allowed hate msgs spewed@ soldiers' funerals but we can't invoke God's name in public square\\"Twitter / Sarah Palin: Common sense & decency abs. Twitter.com. Retrieved on June 4, 2011. Palin clarified her tweet the next day: \\"Obviously my comment meant that when we're told we can't say 'God bless you' in graduation speeches or pray before a local football game but these wackos can invoke God's name in their hate speech while picketing our military funerals, it shows ridiculous inconsistency. I wasn't calling for any limit on free speech, and it's a shame some folks tried to twist my comment in that way. I was simply pointing out the irony of an often selective interpretation of free speech rights.\\" Gun rights Palin, a strong proponent of gun ownership rights, and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, has stated that she is against a ban on semi-automatic firearms, and was shown firing a military assault rifle in a 2008 campaign video. She praised District of Columbia vs. Heller, the Supreme Court decision in that invalidated Washington D.C.'s ban on handguns, and believes that any regulation of handgun possession violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. She is in favor of gun-safety education for children, and is said to be popular among gun rights advocates. Sandra Froman, a member of the NRA Board of Directors, described McCain's selection of Palin as \\"outstanding.\\" Abortion Palin is opposed to abortion in almost all cases, including rape and incest, but not if the life of the mother is endangered. In 2006, while running for governor, Palin was asked what she would do if her own daughter were raped and became pregnant; she responded that she would \\"choose life.\\" She and her husband have stated that they have \\"faith that every baby is created for a good purpose.\\" When asked what she would do as governor if Roe v. Wade were overturned, she responded \\"it would not be up [to me] to unilaterally ban anything. It would be up to the people of Alaska to discuss and decide how we would like our society to reflect our values.\\" Palin personally supported bills to outlaw late-term abortions and to require parental consent for underage abortions in Alaska, but rebuffed religious conservatives who wanted to legislate restrictions on abortion even though she agreed with the bills. In her televised interview with ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson on September 12, 2008, she made the statement that as a politician she felt that her opinions were to be made openly to the public, but that sometimes it may differ with political legislation. When Gibson asked if she thought Roe v. Wade should be overturned, she replied, \\"I think it should and I think that states should be able to decide that issue.\\" Palin also said that she hoped \\"to reach out and work with those who are on the other side of this issue, because I know that we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life.\\" A culture of life holds human life sacred at all stages. Gibson noted that Republican presidential nominee John McCain allows exceptions for rape or incest, and asked, \\"Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?\\" Palin answered, \\"That is my personal opinion.\\" When pressed on the matter, she said, \\"My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the mother is endangered. Please understand me on this. I do understand McCain's position on this. I do understand others who are very passionate about this issue who have a differing [opinion].\\" Stem cell research Palin stated in 2006 that because she believes embryonic stem cell research causes the destruction of life, this research is inconsistent with her pro- life position and she does not support it. All of the various adult stem cell research approaches are supported by Palin. In an interview with Charlie Gibson, Palin differentiated between the two types of stem cell research \\"And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we're getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount of other options, like, as I mentioned, the adult stem cell research\\". Sex education Palin answered a 2006 gubernatorial questionnaire by choosing support for funding of abstinence-before-marriage programs over support for \\"explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics and the distribution of contraceptives in schools\\". In a subsequent radio interview with KTOO (FM) in Juneau, Alaska, she clarified her position by saying she was against explicit sex education, but was in favor of contraceptive education. She characterized in-school discussion of condoms as \\"relatively benign\\" and not something that would define an \\"explicit\\" program. Palin said of contraception that \\"kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues.\\" Rebecca Traister of Salon.com analyzed Palin's political record as one that demonstrated her lack of enthusiasm about the Bush era promotion of abstinence-before-marriage education, and one that showed she did not work against existing sex education laws in Alaska. Women's issues =Feminism= Palin has been a member of Feminists for Life since 2006. In August 2006, she told the Anchorage Daily News that \\"no woman should have to choose between her career, education and her child.\\" In an interview with Katie Couric on September 30, 2008, Palin said, \\"I'm a feminist who believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a man has to succeed, and to try to do it all, anyway. And I'm very, very thankful that I've been brought up in a family where gender hasn't been an issue.\\" In subsequent interviews with Brian Williams on October 29, 2008, Palin was quoted as saying, \\"I am not going to label myself anything, Brian, and I think that's what annoys a lot of Americans, especially in a political campaign is start trying to label different parts of America, different backgrounds. I'm not going to label myself, but I do believe in women's rights; I believe in equal rights, and I am so thankful I was brought up in where really gender has never been an issue.\\" During various public appearances, such as her May 14 Susan B. Anthony List speech,http://www.suzyb.org/blog/_archives/2010/5/19/4532543.html Palin has referred to the suffragettes as \\"feminist foremothers\\" and has called for a \\"new, conservative feminist movement\\".Is Sarah Palin a feminist?.

She stated, \\"I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers.\\" When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, \\"I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records ‚Äì all of that is fair game.\\" She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, \\"the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son ‚Äì 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done. Maybe we can reverse that.\\" Palin later clarified her position in a Facebook posting by stating: \\"Voters have every right to ask candidates for information if they so choose. I've pointed out that it was seemingly fair game during the 2008 election for many on the left to badger my doctor and lawyer for proof that Trig is in fact my child.

While campaigning for election as Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin declared that she supported the 1998 Alaska constitutional amendment that proposed adding \\"...a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman\\" to the Alaskan constitution in order to ensure that same-sex marriage did not become legal in that state. Palin opposed state-covered health and retiree benefits to same-sex partners of state employees but complied with an Alaska Supreme Court directive to do so and subsequently vetoed a bill that would have denied the benefits. \\"'signing this bill would be in direct violation of my oath of office' due to the state Supreme Court ruling\\" In an interview with Newsweek in 2007, she affirmed her support for an amendment to the state constitution denying benefits to same- sex couples. She later signed a bill ordering a non-binding referendum for a constitutional amendment to deny the benefits. Although the referendum passed in April 2007, with 53 percent of voters supporting a constitutional amendment, a bill to place such an amendment on the ballot in November 2008 stalled in the state legislature. Palin has stated that she supports a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization.\\" On March 1, 2011, Palin told National Organization for Marriage Chairman Maggie Gallagher that she opposed the Obama administration's refusal to continue defending the Defense of Marriage Act: \\"I have always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman. Like the majority of Americans, I support the Defense of Marriage Act and find it appalling that the Obama administration decided not to defend this federal law which was enacted with broad bipartisan support and signed into law by a Democrat president.

Palin has also said she is more concerned about methamphetamine, which she sees as a greater social threat. During her June 12, 2010, appearance on Freedom Watch, Palin elaborated on her stance that even though marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: \\"Well, if we're talking about pot, I'm not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people to think that it was okay to go ahead and use it. And I'm not an advocate for that. However, I think that we need to prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody's gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country.\\"(At 15:56).

In a November 19, 2015 radio interview with Hugh Hewitt, Palin was asked about the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, \\"We've got that libertarian streak in us, and I grew up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it.

Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'\\" Illegal immigration On October 31, 2008, Palin told reporter Greta Van Susteren that closing the borders should be the first priority in dealing with illegal immigration. She rejects amnesty for illegal immigrants who have violated federal law. Palin did, however, state that she supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On July 31, 2009, Palin announced in a tweet that she supported a bill by Alaska State Representative Bob Lynn which would forbid issuance of a State identification card or driver's license \\"to a person who has not presented to the department valid documentary evidence that the person is a citizen of the United States, a national of the United States, a legal permanent resident of the United States, or a conditional resident alien of the United States.\\" In a December 3, 2009, radio interview with Rusty Humphries, Palin was asked her position on illegal aliens and closing the Mexico ‚Äì United States border, to which she replied, \\"We must close the border. They're called 'illegal aliens' for a reason, and if they're not going to follow the rules, they should not be in our country.\\" On the April 28, 2010, episode of Hannity, Palin expressed support for the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, which makes it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, and requires police to make an attempt, when practicable, to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien, during a police stop for some other offense. Palin has since endorsed Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's \\"Secure The Border ‚Äì Support Arizona\\" campaign. On the July 9, 2010, episode of The O'Reilly Factor, Palin again indicated support for a path to citizenship but clarified that illegal aliens should not be \\"rewarded for bad behavior\\": \\"We won't complicate it any more. Let's keep it simple, and let's say, 'No, if you are here illegally and you don't follow the steps that at some point through immigration reform we're going to be able to provide, and that is to somehow allow you to work. If you're not going to do that, then you will be deported. You will be gone.\\" Palin emphasized that more border enforcement should come first and said that current attempts at reform should \\"learn from history\\", with reference to the amnesty granted by Ronald Reagan, which she believed was \\"botched\\".Sarah Palin  Illegal Immigrants  Bill O'Reilly.

I'd like to see that continue, but unfortunately, the Dream Act kind of usurps that, the system, that is a legal system, to make sure that immigrants who want to be here legally, working hard, producing and supplying revenue and resources for their family, that they're able to do that right and legally. Unfortunately, the DREAM act doesn't accomplish that.\\" On June 15, 2013, Palin delivered an address at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference. She condemned the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 as a \\"pandering, rewarding-the-rule-breakers, still-no-border-security, special-interest-written amnesty bill.\\" She also cautioned against supporting such a bill merely because Hispanic immigrants have higher fertility rates and said that there were other ways to \\"incentivize the hard-working, responsible families who want to be in the line, follow the law and become Americans, versus those whose very first act on our soil is to break the law.\\" Economic issues Palin describes herself as a fiscal conservative. At the Republican National Convention, Palin stated \\"I came to office promising to control spending ‚Äì by request if possible and by veto if necessary... I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.\\" Shortly after becoming governor, Palin canceled a contract for the construction of an gravel road outside Juneau to a mine and sold the state's Westwind II jet, which had been purchased by the Frank Murkowski administration against the wishes of the legislature. While governor, she slashed the state budget by $231 million for FY2008. The vetoes ‚Äì which covered 36 spreadsheet pages ‚Äì drew praise from those who believed the budget originally reflected too much spending, but anger from those who thought Palin went too far. The $231 million in cuts represented over 300 local projects including an expansion of the Port of Anchorage and the Fire Island wind energy project. Bailout In September 2008, responding to Katie Couric's question asking if America can enter another Great Depression without the $700-billion bailout, Palin said, \\"Unfortunately, that is the road that America may find itself on. Not necessarily this, as it's been proposed, has to pass or we're going to find ourselves in another Great Depression. But, there has got to be action ‚Äì bipartisan effort ‚Äì Congress not pointing fingers at one another but finding the solution to this, taking action, and being serious about the reforms on Wall Street that are needed.\\" Earmarks While Palin was Mayor of Wasilla, the town paid a lobbying firm $24,000 to $36,000 per year to help secure federal earmarks for the town. Palin herself went to Washington to ask for more earmarks from the state's congressional delegation. According to a review by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group, Wasilla (a town of 6,700 residents) benefited from $26.9 million in earmarks in Palin's final four years in office. According to reporting by ABC News, however, Wasilla only directly received $7.95 million, and the $26.9 million figure refers to the amount the entire Matanuska-Susitna Borough received. In the 2005 budget year, Alaska governor Frank Murkowski had requested $550 million in earmarks. In 2008 budget year, Palin sought $256 million in earmarks, and for the 2009 budget Palin gave a list of 31 proposed earmarks, totaling $197 million, to Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens. For the fiscal year 2010 budget, the last one before her resignation, Palin requested eight earmarks worth $69.1 million. Housing issues On September 6, 2008, Palin stated that the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \\"gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers. The McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help.\\" Health care Palin supports free-market competition in health care, and laws allowing patients better access to medical pricing information. In 2008, Palin said she was considering incentives for employers to provide health insurance. She added that changes must also include citizens \\"choosing to take more personal responsibility\\" to be healthier. In a Wall Street Journal editorial, Palin argued in favor of a free-market approach to health care including deregulation, tort reform and \\"providing Medicare recipients with vouchers that allow them to purchase their own coverage.\\" Palin's Healthcare Decisions Day proclamation in April 2008 stated that it was \\"designed to raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for healthcare decisions, related to end of life care and medical decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance directives to communicate these important healthcare decisions.\\"Sarah Palin, April 16, 2008, Healthcare Decisions Day Archived July 20, 2008. =Death panels= Articles that Palin wrote and posted to her Facebook page include Statement on the Current Health Care Debate (August 7, 2009) and Concerning the \\"Death Panels\\" (August 12, 2009).

Palin expressed her opinion of Obama's plans for health care reform, stating in part in the first article: In August 2009, Palin's spokesperson said that Palin's \\"death panel\\" statements referred to H.R. 3200 Advance Care Planning Consultation page 425. According to PolitiFact, \\"Palin seems to acknowledge that the counseling isn't explicitly mandatory, but that in practice it would be.\\" PolitiFact concluded that \\"the end-of-life counseling sessions in the House bill are voluntary.\\" Palin told the media through her spokesperson and three posts to her Facebook page that statements about Ezekiel Emanuel were reasons for her death panel comments. These statements were first made by Betsy McCaughey, and were described by TIME as lacking context, and by PolitiFact and FactCheck as false euthanasia claims. In early November 2009, Palin said that despite other's prior denials that it contained \\"death panels\\", the health care legislation voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives had a \\"provision mandating bureaucratic panels that will be calling the shots regarding who will receive government health care\\". In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin acknowledged that none of the health care bills included the actual word pair; \\"No, death panel isn't there.\\" In November 2009, when asked about how she came up with the term \\"death panels,\\" Palin said, \\"To me, while reading that section of the bill, it became so evident that there would be a panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage. Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death.\\" Palin also clarified that, \\"The term I used to describe the panel making these decisions should not be taken literally.\\" Palin later said that revisions of medical guidelines for cervical and breast cancer brought to mind \\"rationed care\\", and she questioned \\"what Washington has in mind with a government-controlled takeover of a health care system\\".

This includes new model nuclear reactors, such as those developed by Hyperion Power Generation, such as the deployment of a 225MW reactor for Alaska. Furthermore, she supports the overhaul of nuclear regulatory regime to allow the ready deployment of these new, smaller, nuclear reactors. Oil and gas development Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Map: 1002 Area, the proposed drilling area As governor, Palin strongly promoted oil and natural gas resource development in Alaska, and advocates exposing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, controverting McCain's position. In an interview with Time in 2008, Palin argued that energy independence through ANWR drilling was essential to reducing American dependence on hostile foreign regimes. \\"We need to drill, drill, drill,\\" she told the Wall Street Journal; she argues that \\"ANWR is only the size of the Los Angeles airport, and drilling there isn't environmentally destructive.\\" In order to assuage a fear that oil and gas development would be hampered by the listing of polar bears as a threatened species, Palin tried to sue the US government. Palin told RealClearPolitics on May 31, 2011, that she supports the elimination of all energy subsidies, such those for ethanol: \\"I think that all of our energy subsidies need to be relooked at today and eliminated, and we need to make sure that we're investing and allowing our businesses to invest in reliable energy products right now that aren't going to necessitate subsidies because, bottom line, we can't afford it.\\" She continued, \\"We've got to allow the free market to dictate what's most efficient and economical for our nation's economy.

Predator control In 2007, Palin supported the Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy allowing Alaska the hunting of wolves from helicopters as part of a predator control program intended to increase moose and caribou populations. The Program has come under criticism and legal actions from wildlife activists stating the purpose of the program is to increase the numbers of prey species to unsustainable levels for sport hunters, residents and non-residents of Alaska. In May 2007, Palin introduced Bill 256 to streamline the Predator Program\\" Alaska Department of Game and Fish\\" ADF & G Press Release May 11, 2007 and make it more difficult for conservation groups to sue the State. Critics of the Bill claimed it removed scientific standards and claimed the programs are expensive and not effective.\\"Palin wants to shoot down wolf lawsuits\\" Anchorage Daily News, January 30, 2008 Endangered species =Polar bears= In December 2007, Palin wrote an opinion column in which she described her opposition to the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. In it she also stated that the polar bear population is more numerous now than 40 years ago and \\"there is insufficient evidence of polar bears becoming extinct in the foreseeable future\\".Palin, Sarah \\"Bearing Up\\" The New York Times January 5, 2008 After Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior listed the bear as threatened on May 14, 2008, Palin (representing the state of Alaska) sued the federal government, claiming that the listing would adversely affect energy development in the bears' habitat off Alaska's northern and northwestern coasts, while again questioning the scientific basis for the listing. Palin claimed that scientists found no ill effects of global warming on the polar bear, a claim disputed by Alaskan state scientists and environmental groups. =Beluga whales= Cook Inlet stretches from the Gulf of Alaska to Anchorage in south-central Alaska. Palin opposed strengthening protections for beluga whales in Alaska's Cook Inlet. She cited state scientists who claimed that hunting was the only factor causing the whales' decline and that the hunting had been effectively controlled through cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations. Recent research states that hunting controls have halted the decline of beluga whales in Cook's Inlet but that the population remains severely depleted and at high risk of extinction.Hunter, Don. \\"Alaska's beluga whales in decline: Federal assessment shows chance of extinction in 100 years\\", Anchorage Daily News, January 8, 2007. \\"Cook Inlet beluga whales in decline\\" Federal scientists do not attribute the decline in the Cook Inlet beluga population to human pollution.

As Governor of Alaska, Palin criticized proposed Obama administration cuts to missile defense programs, in response to North Korea's April 5, 2009 rocket test. In May 2009, North Korea conducted a series of short-range missile tests. Military experts believe a long-range missile could reach Alaska, where part of the United States' missile defense system is located. Palin called for the full restoration of Missile Defense Agency funding \\"to guarantee our protective measures remain the best in the world.\\" The Defense Department had recommended not moving forward with a planned expansion of the missile defense system at Fort Greely in that year's budget. Palin disagreed: \\"Fort Greely plays a crucial role in the nation's security.\\"Palin wants missile defense funding restored: Politics  Alaska news at . Adn.com (May 30, 2009).

Don't Ask, Don't Tell During an interview on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, \\"I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent of his time in the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now.

This article was available online the first days of September, despite its later 'printed' date. Iran, Syria In the September 2008 CBS interview, Palin criticized Barack Obama for saying he would meet with leaders of Syria and Iran without preconditions. Reminded by the interviewer that Henry Kissinger, whom Palin had recently met, supports direct diplomacy with both countries, Palin responded: \\"I've never heard Henry Kissinger say, 'Yeah, I'll meet with these leaders without preconditions being met.' \\" Five days earlier Kissinger had made a televised statement of his position regarding Iran: \\"I am in favor of negotiating with Iran...[and] I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations.\\" However, Kissinger does not advocate negotiations at the presidential level. During the 2008 vice-presidential debate on October 2, 2008, Palin stated that \\"A leader like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is not sane or stable when he says things like that, is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons.\\" She also further criticized Obama's proposal in 2007 to meet with Ahmadinejad without preconditions, stating that such an action \\"is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad, who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the Earth an ally like we have in Israel, should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first.\\" In her June 2013 address to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, Palin declared her opposition to American involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war: \\"Militarily, where is our Commander-in-Chief? We're talking now more new interventions. I say, until we know what we're doing, until we have a Commander-in-Chief who knows what he's doing, well, Chief, in these radical Islamic countries who aren't even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, 'Allah Akbar,' I say, until we have someone who knows what they're doing, I say, let Allah sort it out!\\" \\"Allah Akbar\\" is usually translated \\"God is Great\\" and used in various contexts by Muslims; \\"Allah\\" is the Arabic word for God. Israel In a meeting on September 2, 2008, with leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby, Palin stated that she would \\"work to expand and deepen the strategic partnership between U.S. and Israel.\\" Following the meeting, an AIPAC spokesman stated that Palin had \\"expressed her deep, personal, and lifelong commitment to the safety and well-being of Israel.\\"Palin expresses support for Israel by Yitzhak Benhorin, Ynetnews.com, September 3, 2008.

During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin expressed support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that \\"Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements.\\" Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that \\"I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden.

In November 2009, Palin expressed her support for the expansion of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, a position contrary to that of every U.S. presidential administration in the past 40 years. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin stated, \\"I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon, because that population of Israel is going to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead. And I don't think that the Obama administration has any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand.\\" On March 5, 2011, Palin stated that the United States should refrain from cutting off foreign aid to Israel, while eliminating \\"waste and fraud\\" and \\"inefficiencies\\": \\"I don't support that kind of foreign aid at all, but when it comes to Israel ‚Äì No...

On May 23, 2011, Palin reiterated her opposition to President Obama's statement that an independent Palestine be based on the borders of 1967, before the Yom Kippur War in which Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Palin questioned whether Obama's call for a \\"sovereign and contiguous\\" Palestinian state could mean \\"carving Israel in half\\" and echoed The Independent, which asked, \\"Was the President implying that the new improved Israel will border neither Jordan nor Egypt, as it does now? Would Palestine's contiguous territory come at the expense of Israel's? Would Israel get the Gaza Strip and the Mediterranean and Palestine get the Negev and a Red Sea port?\\" Libya On February 22, 2011, Palin criticized what she felt was the Obama administration's slow response to Muammar Gaddafi's violent response to the 2011 Libyan civil war and said that \\"NATO and our allies should look at establishing a no-fly zone so Libyan air forces cannot continue slaughtering the Libyan people.\\" Palin has since been critical of Obama's handling of the United States' military role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On April 16, 2011, she said Obama \\"willfully ignored the will of the American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford.\\" She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama \\"step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out.\\" She continued, \\"Simply put, what are we doing there? You've put us in a strategic no man's land. If Gaddafi's got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we're not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country's leadership, and if you can't explain to Americans why we're willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria's, Yemen's, Bahrain's, Egypt's, Israel's, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent.\\" Following the Battle of Tripoli, Palin celebrated Gaddafi's defeat but cautioned against \\"triumphalism\\" and warned that the future Libyan government might not be democratic. She supported \\"work[ing] through diplomatic means to help those who want democracy to come out on top.\\" Palin also said the United States should not commit \\"troops or military assets to serve as peacekeepers or perform humanitarian missions or nation-building in Libya. Our military is already over-committed and strained, and a vaguely designed mission can be the first step toward a quagmire.\\" NATO, Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine Palin has said that the former Soviet states of Georgia and Ukraine should be admitted into NATO, and that if Russia invaded a NATO signatory country, the United States should be prepared to go to war in that country's defense.Palin 'prepared for war with Russia on Georgia' , The Scotsman, September 13, 2008 Palin opposes New START, a bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation.

Enormous numbers of Russian 7.62 cm Model 1910 Putilov fortress guns had been captured early in the war and Krupp was told to adapt them for use as infantry guns.

The gun retained its extraordinary depression of -18.6¬∞, which was a legacy of its original purpose to fire down into fortress ditches, although its limited elevation prevented it from ranging past without digging in the trail. It used captured Russian canister ammunition for short-range engagements, but Rheinmetall manufactured its HE shell. It proved to be popular with its crews, who appreciated its light weight, accuracy and good effect of the shell.J√§ger, p. 137 Unfortunately the gun wore out quickly due to the poor-quality steel used by the Russians, and this degraded its accuracy significantly.

It was one of 25 stations on the Nelson Section, and lasted from 1912 to 1955. Facilities at this station included: stockyards, accessed via a 22-wagon backshunt; two loops, having a 37 and 27 wagon capacity respectively; a station building; a main goods shed with dimensions of and a second smaller goods shed; a loading bank; an outhouse; a railway house (for many years occupied by the local surfaceman); and a water vat.  History  Tui station was opened along with the Kiwi to Glenhope section of the line on 2 September 1912, the date the Public Works Department handed control over to the Railways Department. This section became the last section of the line for most of the life of the Nelson Section, with Glenhope remaining the terminus for all but five years of its operation. The area in which the station was located was originally known as Mana, and was home to several sawmills. Much of the verdant growth was cleared so farms could be established on the land. While initially successful, these farms eventually proved to be uneconomic. One of the more prominent local facilities was a school, which opened the same year as the railway and lasted until amalgamation with the nearby Tapawera school in 1942. This proved to be an unpopular move with local parents of school-aged children, until they were mollified by the decision of the last teacher to work at the school to remain in the area and drive a school bus to and from Tapawera. With the increasing popularity of motor cars in the early 20th century, the plan for the Tui area included the construction of a road overbridge at the southern end of the station yard to safely convey traffic for the upper Sherry River valley over the railway line. The bridge was completed with no problems in 1909. About along Tui Road from its junction with the main highway nearest the station, the road turned left to cross the overbridge. On the other side of the bridge, the road rounded a 90-degree right-hand curve to pass behind the station yard before turning left again to cross the river. This station was closed for three days in June 1954 until the Nelson Section was granted a reprieve, and closed permanently on 3 September 1955. Shortest names: The three stations with the shortest (three-letter) names in New Zealand are Tui; with Ava in Wellington and Oio in the Ruapehu District.  Today  The road overbridge at the southern end of the yard has been removed, and Tui Road now runs straight through where it used to turn left towards the bridge. At the northern end of the former station yard, the road curves left and heads towards the river. Tui station was one of the longest surviving and best preserved of the former Nelson Section stations still on its original site. The station building and smaller goods shed remained in situ until 2006 when they were donated to the Nelson Railway Society and moved to Founders Park, Nelson for restoration. The Society received a Merit Award at the 2008 FRONZ Conference for their work on this restoration project. The restored station was officially reopened at a ceremony on Saturday, 16 August 2008.

For example, in some jurisdictions, those convicted of a crime may not sue their defence attorney for incompetence or legal malpractice if the civil lawsuit would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction. Finality is considered to be important because otherwise, there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law, or the outcome of any legal process. The principle is an aspect of the separation of powers, that being a distinction between the executive and the judicial power. That concept was defined in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) in which a court stated that unless orders were valid until set aside, \\"the exercise of judicial power could yield no adjudication of right and liability to which immediate effect could be given\\".

Wynnewood covers . The village was once known for buildings having old decorative wood flooring. The United States Air Force, Air Defense Command, maintained a Filter Center in the Wynnewood Professional Building, during the late 1950s. The filter center recorded all air traffic ( and many tornadoes ) in its 72,000 thousand square mile area of responsibility, which reached from Muleshoe in the west, to Ranger in the east, and up to the Red River, and Lake Texoma.  History  The foundation for the first house in Wynnewood is being poured. (from The Dallas Morning News [March 5, 1946], Section II, p. 1) The history of Wynnewood is inextricably connected with the development of suburban living in post-World War II America. Indeed, Wynnewood is the southern equivalent of the famous Levittown, New York, a planned community with which Wynnewood is exactly contemporaneous. However, the parallels do not end there. Just as Levittown was named after Levitt and Sons, the company that planned and built the suburb, so Wynnewood carries the name of the Wynne family. The that were to become Wynnewood were originally purchased in 1913 by the American Home Realty Company, but remained undeveloped until the 1940s; at that point the company was acquired by Toddie Lee Wynne, Sr., and Benjamin Hick Majors. When Wynne's nephew Angus Gilchrist Wynne, Jr., returned from the war, he was appointed president of American Home Realty. His task was to take advantage of the post- war boom, which was propitious for housing development.See Wynnewood Scrapbook. Construction took place in several phases. It started in March, 1946, in the triangle marked by Illinois, Bristol, and Garapan.The Dallas Morning News (February 26, 1946), Section II, p. 1; (March 5, 1946), Section II, p. 1. The first homes to be completed were those on Veasy Street (later renamed Wynnewood Drive). The first resident to occupy a Wynnewood home was J. D. Jones of 2342 Veasy.The Oak Cliff Tribune (April 11, 1947), Section II, p. 1. The entire development was largely complete by 1954.  Conception of the \\"City of Wynnewood, U.S.A.\\"  Advertisement of the American Home Realty Company. Note the map showing the exact boundaries of Wynnewood. (from The Dallas Morning News [March 3, 1946], Section II, p. 14) Angus Wynne and his architect, Roscoe DeWitt, conceived of Wynnewood as \\"one-self-contained community,\\" as the American Home Realty Company declared in a contemporary advertisement.The Dallas Morning News (March 3, 1946), Section II, p. 14. Another contemporary ad referred to the \\"City of Wynnewood, U.S.A.\\"The Daily Times Herald (December 16, 1951), Section VI, p. 8. Of course, the Wynnewood community did not grow organically over decades or even centuries, like traditional cities; it reflected the carefully thought-out blueprint of its creators. Wynnewood was to consist of 2,200 homes and 1,000 apartments, with a large shopping area at their center. The homes cost between $6,000 and $20,000, ranging from modest floor plans in the original core of Wynnewood to upscale residences in Wynnewood North. The mix of apartments and homes in different price ranges ensured a certain socio-economic diversity; racial diversity, on the other hand, was not yet conceivable: the community was initially all-white. In Wynnewood, Wynne and DeWitt attempted to marry the principles of mass production with individuality. In Wynnewood, one would not find \\"regimented rows upon rows of houses, [or] dreadful uniformity.\\" Indeed, the homes in the Wynnewood community have a sufficient diversity of styles and layouts not to appear like \\"cookie-cutter\\" houses. Nevertheless, they were built with great efficiency, from components manufactured in specially established \\"pre-fabrication mills.\\"J. L. McClure, \\"Adequate Wiring Basic in Country's Largest Residence Development,\\" Qualified Contractor (May, 1947), pp. 16‚Äì17, at 16. A contemporary article describes the work method of the construction teams in the following words: > Employing nearly 300 workers, one-third of whom are carpenters, the > contractors have their forces set up in skilled groups specializing in their > fields. For example, the employees include groups such as wall erection, > rafter erection, frame gables, window and door frames. The groups start down > a street in the addition, taking each house in order, and with the > completion of their repetitive work on that street, cross over and return > down the next street, working much on the order of an assembly line. > Following are brick masons who are equipped to complete one house daily.J. > L.

For example, the electric wiring in the Wynnewood community followed the standards of the Dallas Adequate Wiring Committee, set up to promote the kind of wiring that would be able to handle the expanding use of electricity for household appliances. The streets at the core of Wynnewood are named after WWII Navy commanders, ships, and battles: for example, Eisenhower, Salerno, Nicholson, Garapan, Anzio, Grayson, O'Banion, and Bristol. This reflects Angus Wynne's Navy career. DeWitt Circle commemorates the architect.  Wynnewood Shopping Village  Aerial photograph from 1951 showing the location of the Wynnewood Shopping Village within the neighborhood (from The Daily Times Herald [December 16, 1951], Section VI, p. 1.) Unlike modern-day developers, who often fail to provide neighborhoods with the facilities necessary for everyday life, Wynne and his advisers planned a large shopping center at the heart of their community. Begun in the summer of 1947, by 1954 the Wynnewood Shopping Village had expanded to 150 shops on with 6,400 parking spaces. There was a movie theater, a post office, the Wynnewood State Bank, department stores, grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants, furniture and jewelry stores, doctors' offices, and even a hotel. What made (and still makes) the Wynnewood Shopping Center unique is the fact that it is laid out like a \\"village\\": shops are not crammed into one huge air-conditioned complex, but are housed in blocks of one-story buildings surrounded by trees.The ABC of Living in Dallas and Wynnewood (an illustrated brochure published by the American Home Realty Company, ca. 1953)  Wynnewood today  Over the decades, Wynnewood has in some ways lost the identity that the founders were hoping to achieve in this particular community. Many of the residents of Wynnewood North, however, engaged through their neighborhood association, still actively press to maintain the uniqueness of their distinctive neighborhood. Wynnewood has retained some of its original characteristics: it is still one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Dallas, not only in socio- economic but now also in racial terms. The homes have turned out to be as solid as their creators promised. The tree-lined streets exude a sense of quietness and comfort. The apartments have become subsidized housing, with some of the problems attendant upon this type of dwelling. The most disappointing aspect in the recent history of Wynnewood is the fate of the shopping village, which is only a shadow of its former self. Many of its buildings have been razed: the Professional Building (which used to be occupied by doctors' offices) is gone, as are the movie theater, the hotel, and the department stores. There have been discussions in recent years about reviving the shopping center, whose services are still badly needed by the community, but as of the fall of 2008, nothing has come of these discussions.For these discussions, see, for example, Philipp W. Rosemann, \\"Save Wynnewood Village from 'Progress,'\\" The Dallas Morning News (June 30, 2006), p. 27A. The following images give an impression of Wynnewood as it looked in 2008.

He passed the Navajo Nation bar examination in 2005 and now chairs the Committee on Training for the Navajo Nation Bar Association, which is responsible for legal education and the semi-annual bar exam on the country's largest Indian reservation. Eid served as a law clerk to Edith Jones, Chief Judge of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before entering private law practice in 1992 at Holme Roberts & Owen in Denver. From 1994 to 1999, Eid served as general counsel and chief operating officer of the National Information Infrastructure Testbed, an Internet technology research consortium formed to prototype advanced Internet applications in such areas manufacturing, health care and environmental protection. In his capacity with the consortium, Eid directed engineering teams in North America, Europe and Asia.  Cabinet of Bill Owens  From 1999 to 2003, Eid served in the cabinet of then-Colorado Governor Bill Owens. Owens first appointed him chief legal counsel, where he oversaw the appointment of 34 state judges. Eid also served as executive director for the Department of Personnel & Administration, where he was responsible for Colorado's workforce of 70,000. Within days of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, Eid was chosen to head an independent commission reviewing the Jefferson County law enforcement response. He also chaired the Colorado State's Board of Ethics, served on more than a dozen state boards during his time in Owens' cabinet and eventually served as chief administrative officer for Colorado's $13-billion state government. Owens described Eid as a model of integrity and uprightness while serving on the cabinet, and said of his work during that time, \\"It's a trial by fire, and when you survive it, typically it means you're going to be a very good lawyer.\\" In recognition of his reforms to the state personnel system, Eid ‚Äì who co-chaired a statewide commission with former Colorado Governor Richard D.

B-01. Eid also withdrew in part because his wife, Allison Eid, was under consideration for the Denver-based Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; the appointment would have created a conflict of interest since the U.S. Attorney oversees cases that often end up in the circuit court. Eid denied that his withdrawal had anything to do with Jack Abramoff, who had recently been fired from Greenberg Traurig and who was later sentenced to serve five years and ten months in prison on numerous fraud convictions. Eid insisted the fact that he had been selected for an internal ethics committee at the firm indicated that he didn't \\"have an Abramoff problem.\\" After withdrawing, Eid announced he would run for an at-large seat on the University of Colorado Board of Regents. In March 2006, Allison Eid was appointed Associate Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court, which removed the potential conflict because the U.S. Attorney does not get involved in state court matters. By that time, VanMeveren and Peters had also been removed from consideration for U.S. Attorney. When the White House asked for three more names, Senator Wayne Allard recommended only William Leone, who had been serving as acting U.S. Attorney since January 1, 2005. Leone, however, had been placed on a list of U.S. Attorneys to be fired for political reasons by Kyle Sampson, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales,Taylor, Marisa and Talev, Margaret. \\"2 additional prosecutors were considered for ouster.\\" Knight Ridder Washington Bureau, May 16, 2007.

White House officials did not consider any other candidates besides Eid, who suspended his campaign for the University of Colorado Board of Regents in order to accept the U.S. Attorney position. Eid was appointed to the position by President George W. Bush on June 9, 2006, making him the 41st United States Attorney for the state of Colorado and the first Arab-American ever appointed to serve as a U.S. Attorney. Eid, who said he was \\"totally stunned\\" by the invitation, was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on August 4, 2006. He served as Colorado's chief federal criminal prosecutor and represented the United States in civil cases where the government was party to a lawsuit. When Eid started the position with about 2,500 civil and criminal cases among 120 people, which he described as one of the heaviest caseloads outside of Washington, D.C. In addition to the cases, Eid said his priorities upon assuming the office were enforcing immigration laws, cracking down on drug trafficking, and creating a cyber-crime unit to fight child solicitation and pornography. In his first few weeks on the job, Eid visited with local, state and federal law enforcement and met one-on-one with everybody on his approximately 140-person staff. In August 2008, Eid charged Marc Garold Ramsey, 39, for sending a threatening letter with a white powdery substance to 2008 Republican Party presidential nominee Senator John McCain.\\"The Trail: McCain Campaign: Colo.

He partnered with the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the Director of its Justice Department, Janelle Doughty, to create a regional program to train tribal, state and local law enforcement officers to enforce federal criminal law on Indian reservations in Southwestern Colorado. This program later expanded to include officers from more than 35 Indian tribes from 17 states. Eid's pilot program gained the attention of Senator Byron L. Dorgan, who praised it as a national success story in strengthening criminal justice in Indian Country and used it as the model for the bill's expanded training provisions.http://indian.senate.gov/upload/Report-111-93.pdf  Joseph Nacchio trial  Eid was appointed as the United States Attorney for the District of Colorado on June 9, 2006. Among the cases Eid inherited from his predecessor, acting U.S. Attorney Bill Leone, was the ongoing prosecution of Joseph Nacchio, the former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International indicted on 42 counts of insider trading. Nacchio was accused of selling $101 million of Qwest stock in the first five months of 2001 despite knowledge from company insider's that Qwest's financial condition was deteriorating. Leone had been lead prosecutor on the Nacchio case since 2002, but several members of the prosecution team had left throughout the yearsSmith, Jeff. \\"D.C. may take stronger role in Nacchio's case.\\" Rocky Mountain News, August 11, 2006, Business section, pg. 4B. due to infighting that threatened to derail the case. Due to the problems with the Nacchio team and prior failures to achieve convictions against other Qwest employees, U.S. Department of Justice officials became concerned about the Denver office's ability to get a conviction and considered taking over the prosecution.

Although Stricklin was difficult to woo following his Enron success, Eid successfully hired Stricklin in August 2006 as First Assistant U.S. Attorney of Colorado and the head prosecutor for the Nacchio case The prosecution team, which had about seven months to prepare for trial, also included Justice Department litigator Colleen Conry; Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Traskos; former tobacco litigation task force prosecutor Leo Wise; and Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney James Hearty, the only prosecutor who served on Leone's original Qwest team. The prosecutors reportedly got along very well and heeded lessons from previous unsuccessful corporate fraud, which prompted Stricklin to describe them as \\"the very best team\\" he ever worked with.Smith, Jeff. \\"Prosecution lands the big one; A different team of lawyers prevails in 5-year-long case.\\" Rocky Mountain News, April 20, 2007, Business section, pg. 4. The trial began in March 2007 and in April, Nacchio was convicted of 19 of the 42 counts of insider trading. On July 28, he was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay a $19 million fine and forfeit the $52 million he grossed on the illegal sales. Eid described the Nacchio case as the largest insider trading case in United States history; regarding the verdict and sentencing, Eid said, \\"This is what the American criminal justice system is all about\\"Burnett, Sara. \\"Six years in prison. $19 million in fines, $52 million in stock forfeited.\\" Rocky Mountain News, July 27, 2007, Business section, pg. 1. and said, \\"'Convicted felon Joe Nacchio' has a very nice ring to it.\\" Nacchio appealed the verdict, arguing that then-federal Judge Edward Nottingham had improperly excluded a defense witness from offering expert evidence during the trial.

Operation Central  Beginning in 2007, Eid oversaw the nationally recognized Operation Central, a successful joint U.S.-Mexican prosecution of criminal trafficking in endangered sea turtles. A three-year international investigation led to multiple arrests on charges of smuggling the skins of endangered sea turtles and other protected animals for use in making boots, belts and wallets. Eid described as \\"unprecedented\\" the cooperation between U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents and Mexican authorities.Sea turtles are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a multilateral treaty of which the U.S., Mexico and 170 other countries are parties. In recognition of the success of Operation Central, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Justice were later awarded the Animal Welfare Institute's prestigious Clark R. Bavin Law Enforcement Award for this multi-year undercover investigation of unlawful international trafficking in sea turtle parts and products. The award was presented by Willem Wijnstekers, Secretary- General of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Operation Central was the largest probe ever of the unlawful commercial exploitation of highly endangered sea turtles ‚Äì all of which are listed under Appendix I of CITES which bans international trade. Operation Central was planned and designed to infiltrate two widely active segments of the black market wildlife trade ‚Äì sea turtle skin and skin products moving illegally from Mexico to the United States and sea turtle shell and shell products being smuggled to the United States from China. The investigation also documented the role of U.S. retailers in the unlawful commercial exploitation of other CITES-listed species (including caimans and lizards) in the exotic boot trade. The government of Mexico coordinated enforcement activities with the Fish and Wildlife Service that also resulted in arrests in Mexico. The Clark R. Bavin Wildlife Law Enforcement Awards are named in memory of the late Chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Law Enforcement, who pioneered the agency's highly effective use of covert investigations and \\"sting\\" operations to uncover illegal wildlife trade. The awards have traditionally been presented by the Secretary-General of CITES during meetings of the Conference of the Parties.http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=637E7B02-F702-F5EB-E034DAA9CD5FDC2D  Resignation and Attorney General bid  With the election of President Barack Obama, Eid was expected to be replaced as U.S. Attorney, as is the custom with a change of presidential administrations. On January 7, 2009, Eid announced he would resign as U.S. Attorney on January 19, the day before President Barack Obama's inauguration, and run for Colorado Attorney General in 2010. Eid sought to fill the position expected to be vacated by John W. Suthers, who was planning to run for governor or U.S. Senate. However, shortly after Eid's resignation, Suthers announced that he would seek re-election as attorney general rather than run for higher office. In response, Eid dropped plans to run for attorney general, describing Suthers as one of his close friends and claiming, \\"Challenging John is not part of my equation.\\"Harden, Mark. \\"Colorado AG Suthers will seek re-election; Eid changes plans.\\" Denver Business Journal, January 26, 2009.

Writings Eid wrote the article \\"Strategic Democracy-Building: How U.S. States Can Help\\" for The Washington Quarterly magazine, anthologized in the 2003 book, Winning Hearts and Minds: Using Soft Power to Undermine Terrorist Networks. He also wrote a 2007 article for The Federal Lawyer entitled \\"Beyond Oliphant: Strengthening Criminal Justice in Indian Country.\\" Eid and one of his former students at CU Law School, Carrie Covington Doyle, co-authored an article concluding that the federal criminal justice system in Indian Country illegally discriminates against the rights of Native Americans in violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

H. Bullen, ed., The Works of Robert Davenport, Old English Plays, New Series, London 1890; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1968. One of only three surviving Davenport plays, it has been called an entertaining and extravagant farce.Felix Emmanuel Schelling, Elizabethan Drama 1558‚Äì1642, 2 Volumes, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1908; Vol. 2, pp. 259‚Äì61. Publication The play was first published in 1639, in a quarto printed by John Okes for the bookseller Humphrey Blunden. This was the only edition of the play prior to the nineteenth century. The 1639 quarto includes a short preface, apparently written by the bookseller. This prefatory note describes the play as \\"an Orphant, and wanting the Father which first begot it....\\" This seems to indicate that Davenport was dead by 1639; but other evidence suggests that he was still alive. In the following year, two plays, Nathanael Richards's Messalina and Thomas Rawlins's The Rebellion, were printed with commendatory poems written by Davenport.Bullen, p. xii. And the address \\"To the knowning Reader\\" prefixed to Davenport's King John and Matilda suggests that Davenport was still alive in 1655, when that play was first published. Date No firm evidence on the play's date of authorship is extant. The earliest evidence for Davenport's career as a dramatist comes from 1624; the period from 1624 to its publication in 1639 has been regarded as the range of possible dates for New Trick. One curious feature is that the play contains a \\"yellow starch\\" reference. in Act IV, scene 1, the Devil says \\"I was first father to this yellow Sterch....\\" This is an allusion to the fashion for wearing ruffs and cuffs dyed yellow, which was strongly associated with Mistress Anne Turner, the woman executed for her role in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury on 15 November 1615. References to yellow starch and \\"yellow bands\\" are common in plays written in the 1615‚Äì18 years, but seem rather dated in a play from the 1620s or '30s. (The same dating conundrum applies to Davenport's other comedy, The City Nightcap.) [For more data on yellow starch references, see: The World Tossed at Tennis.] Devil and prodigal New Trick naturally belongs in at least two classes of English Renaissance play. It is a \\"prodigal son\\" drama, one of a long series of plays that trace the fall and recovery of a protagonist in the manner of the Biblical parable.Alan R. Young, The English Prodigal Son Plays: A Theatrical Fashion of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Salzburg, Austria, Institut fur Anglistik und Amerikanistik, University of Salzburg, 1979. It is also, as its title indicates, a devil play, a subgenre that extended the influence of the Medieval morality play into English Renaissance theatre.John D. Cox, The Devil and the Sacred in English Drama, 1350‚Äì1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000.Jan Frans van Dijkhuizen, Devil Theatre: Demonic Possession and Exorcism in English Renaissance Drama, Rochester, NY, D. S. Brewer, 2007. Earlier plays in the Devil subgenre, like Doctor Faustus and The Devil's Charter, presented the infernal influences as real aspects of the world. Later plays in the tradition, like New Trick or The Soddered Citizen (c. 1630), treat Satanic matters as spurious and fraudulent. Sources As in his other plays, Davenport draws plot materials in New Trick from folklore and from previous dramas, more so than from the formal prose literature of his day. Uncertainty in the play's date makes it difficult, in many cases, to say which plays may have influenced Davenport's work, and in turn which plays might have been influenced by Davenport's work. Influence from Shakespeare is plain and evident;W. J. Olive, \\"Shakespeare Parody in Davenport's A New Tricke to Cheat the Divell,\\" Modern Language Notes Vol. 66 (1951), pp. 478‚Äì80. A passage in I,2 that is rich in classical allusions draws heavily upon Ovid. The play's brief subplot also depends on folklore material. A version of the same story appears in a poem printed in Scotland in 1603 and 1622. Folktales in several traditions replicate similar plots. Synopsis The play opens with its hero and heroine, Slightall and Anne Changeable; they are in love and plan to marry. Anne's father, Master Changeable, supports the match, but her social- climber harridan mother, Mistress Changeable, wants her daughter to wed an aristocrat, Lord Skales. The young and naive Anne is swayed by her mother's materialist temptations, and rejects Slightall for the lord. Slightall is crushed and devastated, and quickly lapses into spendthrift debauchery. When she actually meets the lord, however, Anne is deeply disappointed; man for man, she much prefers Slightall, and is not shy about saying so. She seeks out Slightall to express her regret, but he is too deeply enmeshed in his heartbreak to respond. Anne, in deep psychological distress, reproaches everyone in her circle, father, mother, lordly future husband and others, for their faults; they think she has lost her reason. Slightall mortgages his lands to an Usurer to gain funds to waste on self-indulgence. The Usurer tells his Scrivener how he conspires with Slightall's corrupt servant Geoffrey to drag Slightall down into bankruptcy. The Usurer's scenes allow Davenport to comment on the social and economic conditions of the day. Slightall's bad servant Geoffrey is counterbalanced by a loyal servant, Roger, who stands by his master even when his formal employment has come to an end. Master Changeable is also a partisan in Slightall's cause. Anne's father arranges a complex charade: after a masque of infernal spirits dressed as a Beggar, a Whore, a Puritan and similar figures, Changeable himself masquerades as the Devil and draws Slightall into the standard infernal bargain. He, the \\"Devil,\\" will provide financial support to Slightall in return for Slightall's soul. Slightall gains the funds to redeem his mortgages from the Usurer on the final day possible. The time comes for Slightall to pay the Devil his due: Mistress Changeable, Lord Scales, and others watch what they think is an infernal marriage, in which Slightall will marry a \\"shee Lamia,\\" a succubus. Slightall actually marries Anne, to their own delight and the discomfiture of the rival party. The drama's subplot is confined to a single long scene, III,1. Two friars, Bernard and John, pay a late-night call upon their friend, the Host of an inn. They seek shelter for the night. The Host is absent, and his wife the Hostess is ready to meet her lover, the local Constable, for a tryst. She is naturally unhappy with the presence of her visitors, and confines the two monks to an upper room. The humble Friar Bernard goes to sleep, but Friar John is disquiet; he spies on the Hostess through a chink, and sees the Constable arrive and lay out a tasty supper for the two of them. When the Host suddenly and unexpectedly returns, the Hostess hides the food and the Constable ‚Äì all of which Friar John witnesses. John makes enough noise to attract the attention of the Host, who is happy to greet his monkish friends. The Hostess, very dissatisfied, denies that there is any good cheer to be had in the house. The crafty John pretends to conjure the demon Asteroth to supply a magic meal; he exposes, item by item, the Constable's hidden delectables, which the Host and friars enjoy. Finally, John tells the Host that he will conjure the demon Asteroth in person, in the guise of the local Constable; the Host must not be fooled be this appearance, but must beat the demon soundly. Of course, the friar exposes the real Constable in his hiding place, and the Host gives the would-be adulterer a vigorous beating before the man escapes.

He is a neighbor and friend of the Griffin family and is best known for his hypersexuality and his catchphrase, \\"Giggity\\". The show's creator and voice actor Seth MacFarlane describes him as \\"an appalling human being who is still caught in the Rat Pack era\\" based on anachronistic 1950s party-animal clich√©s. Origins and vocal style The name Quagmire was chosen by a college acquaintance of MacFarlane's. MacFarlane came up with Quagmire's voice after listening to fast-talking radio jockeys from the 1950s era, describing the character as a \\"50s radio guy on coke.\\" The \\"giggity\\" phrase was inspired by Steve Marmel's Jerry Lewis impression. Role in the show Quagmire is a bachelor who works as a commercial airline pilot. He lives on Spooner Street where he is a neighbor and friend of Peter Griffin, Cleveland Brown and Joe Swanson. He has had two spouses: Joan, a maid for the Griffins who died; and Charmise, a prostitute whom he divorced. The former episode, \\"I Take Thee Quagmire\\", was acknowledged by MacFarlane as the first to have a plot revolving around Quagmire. During his time in Korea in service in Busan, he had a brief career as a Korean soap opera star and was lovers with his co- star, Sujin. They would reconnect ties during his brief travel there with Peter, Joe and Cleveland. Quagmire briefly dated Cheryl Tiegs in the early 1980s, but she dumped him because of his constant jealousy and his sex addiction. Cheryl, who Quagmire considers his long-lost one true love, would again appear twice in Quagmire's life, both times due to Brian Griffin's meddling: the first one, when Brian invited him to dinner under the pretense he was going to dinner with her; the second one, when Brian dated her just to torment him (Quagmire retaliates by dating Brian's ex-girlfriend Jillian). Quagmire despises Brian, and they have a feud that spans several episodes. In the episode \\"Quagmire's Baby\\", he discovers that he has a daughter, Anna Lee, but puts her up for adoption; several episodes imply that Quagmire has fathered several other children. His father, Dan, is introduced in the episode \\"Quagmire's Dad\\"; he is a naval veteran of the Vietnam War who has a sex reassignment and becomes a woman named Ida. Quagmire's sister, Brenda, is first seen in the episode \\"Jerome is the New Black\\" and is the subject of \\"Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q\\". In both episodes she is the victim of domestic violence from her partner Jeff, whom Quagmire murders in order to protect her. The episode \\"Quagmire's Mom\\" reveals that he has a strained, dysfunctional relationship with his mother, who was inappropriately sexual with him; other episodes have implied that the two have actually had sex. He is characterized as indulging in numerous sexual fetishes such as BDSM, frotteurism, biastophilia, somnophilia, erotic asphyxiation, voyeurism, exhibitionism, zoophilia, and necrophilia. He also has a predilection for teenage girls, including Peter's daughter Meg, whenever they turn 18. Following the episode \\"Family Goy\\", he develops a pornography addiction after discovering the existence of internet pornography. When in sexual situations, he often shouts variations of his catchphrase \\"giggity\\", which has been used on Family Guy merchandise such as keyrings. Scenes involving Quagmire's sexual behavior have sometimes been censored by Fox, such as a cutaway in the episode \\"Airport '07\\" which implied that he engaged in necrophilia with a dead virgin at her funeral. The Parents Television Council, a long-term critic of Family Guy, says that Quagmire provides \\"some of the tawdriest moments\\" in the show.

From late 1970s to early 1980s, Chen claimed most world champions in women's platform diving. However, due to China's boycott to 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, Chen didn't win Olympic champion in the climax of her career. Four years later, Chen competed at 1984 Olympic Games, and claimed the 4th place. She retired after that.

The name Balagasan came from the word Balagas, which means a kind of soil with plenty of boulders and easily eroded. When American soldiers came, the name Balagas was extended by a syllable ‚Äúsan‚Äù. From that time so was coined the name Balagasan. Over century‚Äôs different customs, practices and beliefs have been added to their life, creating a unique cultural tradition in every barangay in the province. Land, climate and tourist spot Balagasan has a rugged, mountainous landscape and it is frequently used for agricultural purposes. The other side of the Balagasan land was the long river of Boac (Boac River), wherein aquaculture activities cultivated. It has a total land area of 310.4761 km¬≤.

Origin Researchers built SARG04 when they noticed that by using the four states of BB84 with a different information encoding they could develop a new protocol which would be more robust, especially against the photon-number-splitting attack, when attenuated laser pulses are used instead of single-photon sources. SARG04 was defined by Scarani et al. in 2004 in Physical Review Letters as a prepare and measure version (in which it is equivalent to BB84 when viewed at the level of quantum processing). An entanglement-based version has been defined as well. Description In the SARG04 scheme, Alice wishes to send a private key to Bob. She begins with two strings of bits, a and b, each n bits long. She then encodes these two strings as a string of n qubits, psirangle = bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}psi_{a_ib_i}rangle. a_i and b_i are the i^mathrm{th} bits of a and b, respectively. Together, a_ib_i give us an index into the following four qubit states: psi_{00}rangle = 0rangle psi_{10}rangle = 1rangle psi_{01}rangle = +rangle = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}0rangle + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}1rangle psi_{11}rangle = -rangle = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}0rangle - frac{1}{sqrt{2}}1rangle. Note that the bit b_i is what decides which basis a_i is encoded in (either in the computational basis or the Hadamard basis). The qubits are now in states which are not mutually orthogonal, and thus it is impossible to distinguish all of them with certainty without knowing b. Alice sends psirangle over a public quantum channel to Bob. Bob receives a state varepsilonrho = varepsilonpsiranglelanglepsi, where varepsilon represents the effects of noise in the channel as well as eavesdropping by a third party we'll call Eve. After Bob receives the string of qubits, all three parties, namely Alice, Bob and Eve, have their own states. However, since only Alice knows b, it makes it virtually impossible for either Bob or Eve to distinguish the states of the qubits. Bob proceeds to generate a string of random bits b' of the same length as b, and uses those bits for his choice of basis when measuring the qubits transmitted by Alice. At this point, Bob announces publicly that he has received Alice's transmission. For each qubit sent, Alice chooses one computational basis state and one Hadamard basis state such that the state of the qubit is one of these two states. Alice then announces those two states. Alice will note whether the state is the computational basis state or the Hadamard basis state; that piece of information makes up the secret bit that Alice wishes to communicate to Bob. Bob now knows that the state of his qubit was one of the two states indicated by Alice. To determine the secret bit, Bob must distinguish between the two candidate states. For each qubit, Bob can check to see whether his measurement is consistent with either possible state. If it is consistent with either state, Bob announces that the bit is invalid, since he cannot distinguish which state was transmitted based on the measurement. If on the other hand, one of the two candidate states was inconsistent with the observed measurement, Bob announces that the bit is valid since he can deduce the state (and therefore the secret bit). Consider for example the scenario that Alice transmits psi_{00}rangle and announces the two states psi_{00}rangle and psi_{01}rangle. If Bob measures in the computational basis, his only possible measurement is psi_{00}rangle. This outcome is clearly consistent with the state having been psi_{00}rangle, but it would also be a possible outcome if the state had been psi_{01}rangle. If Bob measures in the Hadamard basis, either psi_{01}rangle or psi_{11}rangle could be measured, each with probability ¬Ω. If the outcome is psi_{01}rangle then again this state is consistent with either starting state. On the other hand, an outcome of psi_{11}rangle cannot possibly be observed from a qubit in state psi_{01}rangle. Thus in the case that Bob measures in the Hadamard basis and observes state psi_{11}rangle (and only in that case), Bob can deduce which state he was sent and therefore what the secret bit is. From the remaining k bits where both Bob's measurement was conclusive, Alice randomly chooses k/2 bits and discloses her choices over the public channel. Both Alice and Bob announce these bits publicly and run a check to see if more than a certain number of them agree. If this check passes, Alice and Bob proceed to use privacy amplification and information reconciliation techniques to create some number of shared secret keys. Otherwise, they cancel and start over. The advantage of this scheme relative to the simpler BB84 protocol is that Alice never announces the basis of her bit. As a result, Eve needs to store more copies of the qubit in order to be able to eventually determine the state than she would if the basis were directly announced. Intended use The intended use of SARG04 is in situations where the information is originated by a Poissonian source producing weak pulses (this means: mean number of photons < 1) and received by an imperfect detector, which is when attenuated laser pulses are used instead of single photons. Such a SARG04 system can be reliable up to a distance of about 10 km. Modus operandi The modus operandi of SARG04 is based on the principle that the hardware must remain the same (as prior protocols) and the only change must be in the protocol itself. In the original \\"prepare and measure\\" version, SARG04's two conjugated bases are chosen with equal probability. Double clicks (when both detectors click) are important for comprehending SARG04: double clicks work differently in BB84 and SARG04. In BB84, their item is discarded because there is no way to tell what bit Alice has sent. In SARG04, they are also discarded, \\"for simplicity\\", but their occurrence is monitored to prevent eavesdropping. See the paper for a full quantum analysis of the various cases. Security Kiyoshi Tamaki and Hoi-Kwong Lo were successful in proving security for one and two-photon pulses using SARG04. It has been confirmed that SARG04 is more robust than BB84 against incoherent PNS attacks. Unfortunately an incoherent attack has been identified which performs better than a simple phase-covariant cloning machine, and SARG04 has been found to be particularly vulnerable in single- photon implementations when Q >= 14.9%. Comparison with BB84 In single- photon implementations, SARG04 was theorised to be equal with BB84, but experiments have shown that it is inferior.

Until 2015, the relevant legislation provided for the provision of water and wastewater services by local authorities in Ireland, with domestic usage funded indirectly through central taxation (including motor taxation), and non-domestic usage funded via local authority rates. From 2015, the legislation provided for the setup of a utility company, Irish Water, which would be responsible for providing water and wastewater services, and funded through direct billing. The transition between these models, and certain aspects of operation of the new company, caused controversy in its initial period of operation. In general in Ireland, water resources are abundant and 83% of drinking water comes from surface water. However, wastage levels were estimated at 800 million litres lost to leaks each day in 2015, while usage levels were calculated at 80 litres per capita per day in 2016. The quality of water from the public mains is usually quite high, with, for example, 98.9% of public water supplies complying with the standards for E. coli levels in 2004. However, the microbiological quality of some rural private group water schemes led to Ireland being cited in 2002 by the European Court of Justice for failing to abide by EU drinking water guidelines. For wastewater treatment, 94% of wastewater collected in urban area sewers receives at least secondary treatment, and 1.6 billion litres of water are treated each day nationally.https://www.water.ie/docs/WSSPContentsExecSummary.pdf Wastewater infrastructure includes 25,000 km of pipes to approximately 1,000 wastewater treatment plants.  Water resources and use  Water resources are abundant in Ireland, with 82% of drinking water supplies in Ireland sourced from surface water (i.e. rivers and lakes) and 18% coming from groundwater ‚Äì 10.5% from groundwater and 7.6% from springs. This high dependence on surface water is above the EU average.Eurostats, water statistics Approximately 2% of Ireland's water resources are abstracted for human use. Unaccounted-for water constitutes 41% of total water supply, followed by supply for domestic demand (39%), and non-domestic demand (20%).Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government River Lee is a source of water supply for the city of Cork 80% of the Irish population is served by centralised water supplies. The remaining 20% is served by 643 public group water schemes (serving 2.3% of the population), 486 private group water schemes (serving 4.7%), 1,429 small private supplies (serving 0.7%) and private wells that are exempt from the regulations (serving 12.3%). Domestic water use is in line with other European countries, with daily domestic consumption of water per capita at approximately 80 litres in Ireland, compared to 121 litres in Germany and 114 litres in Denmark (all users are metered in the latter two countries). At 141m¬≥ per inhabitant, Ireland has the third highest freshwater abstraction rate per inhabitant of 26 EU countries, ranked behind only Italy and Croatia.Eurostat, water statistics Water shortages have left some larger urban areas ‚Äì particularly Dublin ‚Äì with supply issues during prolonged dry spells. A 2006 feasibility study for the Greater Dublin water supply urged the development of a new water source, pointing out that it would be needed by 2015‚Äì2016 to avert water rationing and the curtailment of economic growth. It also noted that it would take at least a decade to build the proposed new source, with a 2007 report suggesting a lengthy pipeline to Dublin from Lough Derg and the Shannon.  Water supply service provision  Upper reservoir of Bohernabreena Waterworks, Glenasmole Public (mains) water supply  80% of the population is supplied by centralised public water systems. Public water supply systems and providers are governed by the Water Services Acts of 2007 to 2014. Until 2015, this legislation provided for the provision of water and wastewater services by local authorities, with domestic usage funded through central taxation, and non-domestic usage funded via local authority rates. From 2015, legislation came into force such that a new utility company, Irish Water, became responsible for providing water and wastewater services. The new company was set up as a subsidiary of an existing semi-state corporation, Bord G√°is (Ervia). The newly created company effectively took on the existing local authority employees and water management facilities, pipes and infrastructure. Operationally, Irish Water delegated some work, for example water meter installation and customer support, to sub-contractors. Group water schemes 20% of the population is supplied by wells, small private supplies and public or private group schemes. Group water schemes are found in rural areas and are outside the scope of the centralised public mains systems. A group scheme is a scheme servicing water or wastewater services to two or more households not connected to the centralised water supply and/or wastewater collection systems. Group schemes are private or public, depending on whether their water is supplied from the public mains or a private source. All group schemes connected to centralised supplies are fitted with a water meter for monitoring the amount of water used by the group. The EPA 2011 report on drinking water quality in Ireland indicated that there were 1,129 group water schemes, serving 7% of the public, covered by the Drinking Water Regulations because they serve more than 50 people or supply a commercial operation. 643 are public group schemes and 486 are private group water schemes. The National Federation of Group Water Schemes was established to represent the interests of members of group water schemes, and to provide advisory, training, developmental and other services to scheme members.  Water supply quality  The quality of water from the public mains is usually quite high and compliant with EU drinking water standards. However, 2011 reports noted poor microbiological quality in some rural private group water schemes and groundwater and challenged the authorities then responsible for drinking water. The city of Galway, supplied with water by the River Corrib, was subject to an outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis in 2007 In 2007, there was an outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis in Galway, which caused illness in over 240 people, and led to the imposition of a boil water notice in Galway for a period of 5 months during the peak tourist season. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while \\"many have taken the quality of drinking water in Ireland for granted in the past, this can no longer be the case\\".Environmental Protection Agency, 2008, The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland ‚Äì A Report for the Years 2006‚Äì2007, p. 1 On 14 November 2002, authorities in Ireland were cited by the European Court of Justice over the microbiological contamination of hundreds of public and private water supplies. The EU's Drinking Water Directive requires an absence of E. coli in drinking water supplies to protect human health. The Environmental Protection Agency's 2011 report on drinking water stated that drinking water quality in public water supplies was continuing to improve. At that time, chemical standard compliance stood at 99.5%. 1.3% of supplies were found to have had E.coli, a reduction of 86% since 2005. 10.2% of private group supplies had E.coli, down from 11.6% in 2010. 7.7% of small private supplies were found to have E.coli exceedences, down from 7.4% in 2010. In October and November 2013, difficulties were encountered with the water supply to Dublin. The Ballymore Eustace water treatment works which processes water from its main supply, the Poulaphouca reservoir, experienced a change in water characteristics. The effect was that particles in the water would not settle, leaving tap water cloudy. As a result, the supply to the Dublin was restricted for two days. Cryptosporidium contamination risk led to \\"boil notices\\" remaining in place in parts of County Roscommon for approximately six-years from 2009 to 2015. In 2017 there was significant disruption to water supply services in parts of County Meath, County Louth and Drogheda, with 70,000 people without water for some time during July.  Wastewater treatment  The proportion of waste water discharges where secondary treatment facilities have been provided increased significantly from 26% between 1998‚Äì1999 to 93% by 2011. This was due predominantly to the new wastewater treatment plants at Ringsend (Dublin) (which, at the time, was believed to be the largest construction of a new water treatment facility in Europe serving 1.5million people), Cork City, Limerick City, Galway City and Dundalk. According to a 2011 EPA report, 11 of 174 agglomerations covered by the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive did not have the required level of wastewater treatment, but were expected to have secondary treatment by 2015. 70% of agglomerations (larger urban areas in Ireland) were compliant with the requirements of the Directive in 2011, an improvement on 63% compliance in 2010 and 57% in 2009. As of 2011, while 66% of households were connected to public sewerage schemes, with the majority in urban areas, 27.5% of households used an individual septic tank, and 3% adopted other individual sewerage systems. In October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland regarding septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. It deemed Ireland non- compliant with Articles 4 and 8 of the Waste Directive in relation to domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside. Ireland was fined ‚Ç¨2 million and the court imposed daily fines of ‚Ç¨12,000 for each day of delay in achieving compliance. Central to ending the case against Ireland was establishing a national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems, and in 2012, the government passed the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. A new registration and inspection regime was introduced in June 2012, and by July 2013, almost 90% of owners of premises connected with such systems had registered their systems.  Regulation  Environmental and quality regulation Water services authorities were historically responsible for the monitoring of drinking water. Local authorities were responsible for testing the quality of water, in conjunction with the Local Health Office (HSE). Under the 2007 Drinking Water Regulations, the EPA had supervisory powers for public water supplies, and could direct a water services authority to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. Where the EPA found deficiencies, it would make recommendations as to what action the water services authority needs to take to remedy any deficiency. Likewise, water services authorities had a supervisory role in relation to group water schemes and private supplies, and would notify the EPA of drinking water non- compliances or risks to public health from a public water supply. Since the formation of Irish Water, it is legally obliged to \\"submit all drinking water quality results for compliance testing to the EPA on an annual basis\\". Economic regulation Prior to 2013, there was no economic regulator for water supply and sanitation in Ireland. Under the 2013 Water Services Act and Water Services (Amendment) No. 2 Bill 2013, the Commission for Energy Regulation was assigned powers to advise the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the development and become the economic regulator of water services.  Financial aspects and efficiency   Tariffs  In 2013, ‚Ç¨326 million was allocated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for infrastructural spending on water, corresponding to ‚Ç¨71 per capita. In July 2014 the Commission for Energy Regulation announced that the standard metered rate for water and wastewater would include 30m¬≥ per year of free basic water, after which ‚Ç¨4.88/m¬≥ including taxes would be charged. Rates were to be capped until March 2015 at an annual fixed rate of ‚Ç¨176 plus ‚Ç¨102 for every additional adult living in a household. Prior to the formation of Irish Water, all water charges for domestic use in urban areas in Ireland were paid for by general taxation. Domestic use is defined as drinking, washing, heating and sanitation. There were approximately 1.35 million domestic water connections served by public water supplies. Members of rural group water schemes usually pay for domestic water and wastewater services. As part of a Programme of Assistance agreed with the EC-ECB-IMF 'troika' in November 2010, the Fianna F√°il-Green Party government committed to introducing domestic water charges in 2012/2013. This followed a commitment made in the Renewed Programme for Government, published in October 2009, to introduce charges based on a system of a free allowance per household, with charges on usage above the allowance. One month before the government's agreement with the troika, the administration's 'National Recovery Plan 2010‚Äì2014' stated that metering would form part of charges and be introduced by 2014. Domestic water charges, a requirement under the EC-ECB- IMF's Programme of Assistance, were to be introduced in Quarter 4 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015. Bills would be issued for usage in arrears, similar to those for electricity or gas. Households were to receive a free allowance, with charges based on metered usage above the free allowance. Environment Minister Phil Hogan said households unmetered at the time of charges introduction would be charged on an assessed basis (e.g. dwelling type, number of people in a house etc.).Irish Times:Water charges 'to raise ‚Ç¨1 billion', 17 December 2010 Non-domestic customers pay a combined charge for water and wastewater. Local authorities set the rates. In 2013, the national average water rate stood at ‚Ç¨1.13 per m¬≥. The national average wastewater rate was ‚Ç¨1.19 per m¬≥. ‚Ç¨2.37 per m¬≥ is the average combined rate. Some variation exists in the local authorities' rates, with Kildare County Council having a combined rate of ‚Ç¨1.59 per m¬≥, in contrast with ‚Ç¨3.04 per m¬≥ charged by Wicklow County Council. The cost of water for industrial users has remained relatively static since 2007.Forf√°s, 2012, Ireland‚Äôs Competitiveness Scorecard 2012  Investment  Under the EU's Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 1991, local authorities are obliged to construct secondary and tertiary water treatment plants by 2008. New wastewater treatment plants were built in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway between 2000 and 2011, generating additional capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.96 million. Over the same period, drinking water treatment capacity has been increased by an amount sufficient to meet the needs of a population equivalent of 1.4 million people. The compliance level under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive increased from 25% to 93%. Under the government's 'Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012‚Äì2016' blueprint, ‚Ç¨1.58 billion in capital investment is to be allocated for water services between 2012‚Äì2016, with ‚Ç¨326 million now earmarked for 2013.Government of Ireland, 2011, Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012‚Äì2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework The majority of the funding will be channelled through the 2010‚Äì2013 Water Services Investment Programme, which is targeting reduction in leakage levels; improvements in drinking water standards; capacity and security of supply (including planning a new long-term source for the Greater Dublin Area) and wastewater discharges. Infrastructure under the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Strategy is also promised.  Financing and Subsidies  Funding for maintaining and improving the water supply and sanitation infrastructure comes from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Indirectly, substantial funding historically came from the European Union through its European Regional Development Fund. In addition, local authorities levy planning contributions mainly for small capital improvements. Group scheme members are entitled to a subsidy from their local authority. After the abolition of domestic water charges in 1997, it was intended that this scheme would extend those benefits to households supplied by group water schemes. The amount of subsidy is 100% of the qualifying expenditure, meaning that all running costs of the scheme are covered by the subsidy as long as they do not exceed the subsidy limit. The amount is around ‚Ç¨50 per house per year. Group water schemes are also entitled to technical and grant assistance for any upgrading works that may need to be carried out.  Efficiency and levels of water leakage  Leakage levels in Ireland currently stand at 41%, with considerable variation between local authorities, in part explained by corrosion of antiquated pipes. As part of the National Water Study, conducted in 2000, a water audit was undertaken for 91 water schemes outside Dublin to establish levels of non-revenue water (NRW). The report noted that the poor quality of data and the low level of consumer metering limited the reliability of their figures. They found an average level of NRW of 47%, corresponding to 34 litres/connection/hour and 29 m3/km/day.National Water Study , WS Atkins Ireland p. 7 This compares to only 10.1 m3/km/day in England, Scotland 21.3 m3/km/day, Netherlands 1.6 m3/km/day and Denmark 1.7 m3/km/day.DANVA, 2010, Water in figures ‚Äì DANVA's Benchmarking and Water Statistics 2010  Development of water charges   First abolition of domestic water charges (1970s)  Domestic rates, which financed the cost of water services, were abolished for the first time by a Fianna F√°il government following the 1977 general election. In the same period, an increase took place in Income Tax and Value Added Tax. The revenue from these increases, and from borrowing (which was high during the late 1970s and early 1980s), was used to fund the local authorities. These had previously relied on domestic rates for their funding, but from this time the central government paid a \\"rate support grant\\" to local authorities. However, in 1983 the then Fine Gael-Labour government decided to cut this grant and passed legislation to allow councils to levy service charges. This was perceived by some as \\"double taxation\\", since the previously increased taxes remained at their high levels. Opponents also argued that rates were unrelated to consumption and that there were insufficient provisions to protect the poor.  Dublin fight against water charges (1994‚Äì1997)  A number of councils decided to introduce water charges, while others such as Dublin initially decided against introducing them. After water charges were introduced in Dublin in 1994, an anti-water charges campaign was initiated and included demonstrations and a boycott of the new charges. The city threatened to cut the water supply to those who did not pay. After lengthy court battles, some non-paying users were cut off, but the non-payment of water charges continued. On 19 December 1996, on the eve of general elections, the Minister for the Environment Brendan Howlin from the Labour Party of the Rainbow Government of Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party‚ÄìDemocratic Left announced that the water charge was going to be replaced by a new system in which motor tax collected in each area would be the source for local council funding.  Second abolition of domestic water charges (1990s)  Domestic water charges in Ireland were thus prohibited under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 shortly before the June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna F√°il under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges.Susan Scott:Abolition of Domestic Water Charges in Ireland, p. 2 Instead, it embarked on consultations which resulted in the 1998 Water Services Pricing Policy. This policy banned cross- subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.Speech by Bernard Allen TD Fine Gael Spokesperson on Environment and Local Government on the Water Services Bill 2004 in D√°il √âireann 05.10.04  Water Services Bill 2003  The Water Services Bill 2003 was presented to the Oireachtas by then Environment Minister, Martin Cullen of Fianna F√°il. The bill was designed to consolidate Ireland's existing body of 15 different enactments into a single act, and to transpose EU water legislation. Cullen called it \\"the first root and branch consolidation and modernisation of water services law for more than 120 years since the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878\\", adding that \\"like the Victorian sewers which we have upgraded or replaced, this Bill replaces Victorian legislation with a new modern legal framework.\\"Environmental Data: Ireland: Water Services Bill 2003 published , 19 December 2003 In September 2004 Cullen's successor, Environment Minister Dick Roche, also of Fianna F√°il, defended the proposed bill in D√°il √âireann. There he was faced with charges that the bill was a \\"Trojan horse to introduce privatisation and domestic water charges\\". The opposition also criticised the lack of a statutory right of access to water in the bill, lack of public participation in the review of proposed strategic plans, calling the bill \\"a thinly disguised attempt to privatise the water supply\\" as well as \\"a formula to get around the 1997 Act and re-introduce water charges by another name.\\" Debate on the Proposed Water Services Bill of 2003 , D√°il √âireann ‚Äì Volume 589 ‚Äì 5 October 2004 Ultimately, the bill was not passed. According to an unattributed opinion piece in the Irish Times, if the Water Services Bill, 2003, had been passed earlier and implemented effectively, people would not have had to boil their drinking water in Galway in 2007 because of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis.  Water Services Act 2007  In May 2007, the Fianna F√°il-Progressive Democrats coalition enacted the Water Services Act 2007. As well as updating and consolidating existing legislation, the Act introduced a system to regulate group water schemes, assigned the EPA with supervisory responsibilities, and placed duties of care on water services users regarding water conservation.  Fianna F√°il-Green Party government policy (2007‚Äì2011)  In 2008, the Minister for the Environment, John Gormley, Green Party leader and former Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1994‚Äì1995 during the water charges conflict, said that domestic water charges would not be introduced during the lifetime of the government. He also said water shortages would be a key issue that Ireland would have to grapple with in the future. The Minister said there were other ways of tackling potential shortages which have already left some larger urban areas ‚Äì particularly Dublin ‚Äì struggling to meet demand during prolonged dry spells. The main focus of government policy would be to reduce the leakages from main water supply pipes.Water charges not on agenda ‚Äì Gormley, The Irish Times, 26 August 2008 In October 2009, however, Fianna F√°il and the Green Party agreed on a Renewed Programme for Government, which pledged to introduce domestic water charges based on a system of a free allowance per household, with charges only on usage in excess of the allowance. In October 2010, the administration's 'National Recovery Plan 2010‚Äì2014' pledged that metering would form part of charges. Metering was to be introduced by 2014. As part of the EC-ECB-IMF Programme of Assistance to Ireland, agreed in November 2010, the Coalition agreed to the introduction of domestic water charges in 2012/2013.  Fine Gael-Labour government policy (2011-2015)  In March 2011, the new Fine Gael-Labour government's Programme for Government (2011‚Äì2016) contained commitments to a water policy similar to the previous government.Government of Ireland, Programme for Government 2011‚Äì2016 In January 2012, the Minister of Environment, Phil Hogan, announced a six-week consultation on a planned fundamental reform of the water sector. Following that, a metered domestic water charges would be introduced and a new public utility, Irish Water, would be established and take over responsibilities for drinking and waste water services from the local authorities. Independent economic regulation, through the Commission for Energy Regulation, would oversee the new utility's running costs, infrastructural investment plans and the design and level of domestic and non- domestic water charges. In July 2013, Irish Water was legally established and began a national metering programme. The company was expected to initially install meters for approximately 1.05 million households. Domestic water charges were scheduled to commence in October 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015, with bills paid for usage in arrears. Irish Water would hence become the national water services authority, assuming all responsibilities for water services from local authorities - except for those relating to certain rural water services and inspections of wastewater treatment systems. Ireland's 34 local authorities were to continue to provide some drinking and waste water services on behalf of Irish Water through a service level agreement. Irish Water (2015-present) From 2015, Irish Water became responsible for providing water and wastewater services, with the intention that the company would be funded through direct billing. The new company was set up as a subsidiary of an existing semi-state corporation, Bord G√°is (Ervia). The newly created company took on the existing local authority employees and water management facilities, pipes and infrastructure. While Irish Water initially issued bills and was funded through payment from residential users, by 2017 the scale of protest and push-back against charges resulted in the suspension and ultimately scrapping of the funding model.

In 1945, Robert Hargreaves became the new Director of the Bands, working with Robert Holmes as Associate Director of Bands. The next year, Hargreaves selected Robert Hamilton as the new director. In 1950, Herbert Fred was designated Director of Bands. Under his direction, the Ball State Marching Band was one of the first bands in the country to perform drill on the field. In addition, the band began accepting women into the organization, which previously had been only accessible to men.Trombone section during a show in 2006 In the late 1950s, Hargreaves appointed Earl Dunn as the new Director of Bands. During the 1960s, band membership grew from 66 to 190, receiving national recognition for outstanding performances. From homecoming parades to playing with outside musicians, the band was on its way to expanding and carving a name for itself.

Namesake The name, \\"Pride of Mid-America,\\" was first introduced in the 1960s by former director Earl Dunn. Some speculations led to the thought that the name came from the prestige and recognition that the marching band started to have at the time. It was perhaps linked to the sudden growth in number of members during Dunn's direction, or to the university's participation in the Mid-American Conference. What inspired the name is not clearly determined. The drumline playing during pregame. Today, the name represents Ball State and its traditions, and it has become the main title of the marching band. It is also used as an encouragement tool for the members, such as the traditional dismissal after every rehearsal or performance, which goes: Leader: Band who are we?! Band: Ball State! Leader: I said band who are we? Band: Ball State! Leader: What do we have?! Band: PRIDE! Leader: I said what do we have?! Band: PRIDE! Leader: Let's go, let's go! Band: Let's go, Ball U! Organization Instruments and Auxiliary groups \\"The Pride\\" consists of a great number of brass and woodwind players, and a limited number of percussion players who are required to audition. As part of the auxiliary, the band currently has a color guard and a feature twirler, but it previously included cardettes and majorettes in past years.

Like another other universities fight songs, it represents and identifies the organization and the university. Members march drill while playing their instruments on the field. The forms vary depending on the theme that is played or the occasion. As of today, the band performs modern drill with a traditional marching style known as relaxed straight leg (walking style), and forms designs from simple geometric shapes and straight lines, to complex curves, words, and figures. \\"The Pride\\" playing Patriotic Medley, as part of a pregame show in 2006.

His name is listed ex officio as supervising architect of hundreds of federal buildings built throughout the United States during the period.A partial list is given at Emporis.com. Early career The son of H. Knox and Mary (Young) Taylor, he was born in Knoxville, Illinois, and attended schools in Minnesota. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was a classmate of William Martin Aiken, who would precede him in the position of Supervisory Architect, and Cass Gilbert. After graduation, he worked in the New York City office of Charles C. Haight and later with Bruce Price.Architects to the Nation: The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office by Antoinette J. Lee ‚Äì Oxford University Press, USA (April 20, 2000) In 1882 he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota where he formed a partnership with Gilbert, as Gilbert & Taylor. They built many homes and churches. Subsequently, they designed the Pioneer and Endicott Buildings. In 1893 he moved to Philadelphia and formed a partnership with Amos J. Boyden. In 1895 he got a job with Aiken, the Supervisory Architect, as a temporary draftsman. In 1897, following a Civil Service Commission examination,\\"James Knox Taylor likely to be appointed over New yorkers\\", The New York Times,17 October 1897. he became the Supervisory Architect, the first architect promoted from within. Tarsney Act In 1893 Missouri Congressman John Charles Tarsney introduced a bill that allowed the Supervisory Architect to hold competitions among private architects for major structures. Competitions under Taylor's supervision included the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, James Farley Post Office, Cleveland Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Baltimore, Maryland) and U.S. Customhouse (San Francisco, California) (which are all now on the National Register of Historic Places) among others. The competitions were met with enthusiasm by the community but were also marred by scandal, as when Taylor picked his ex-partner Cass Gilbert for the New York Customs House commission. In 1913 the act was repealed. Antoinette J. Lee, Architects to the Nation: The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office(Oxford University Press) 2000) In 1912, Taylor returned to MIT for two years as director of the department of architecture, then moved to Yonkers, New York, where for several years he continued practicing. In 1928, he retired to Tampa, Florida, where he died the following year.Cass Gilbert collection, Elmer L. Andersen Library, University of Minnesota Selected works From 1897 through 1912 Taylor is credited as \\"supervising architect\\" for federal buildings constructed during his tenure, a list which includes dozens of post offices, court houses and other structures.

It is an adhesin which enables Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) to adhere to host cells of another organism, and an invasin facilitating its internalisation into these cells. This is true over a range of different cell types. The FnBP alone is capable of providing this invasive property, without the requirement of co-receptors. Even FnBP coated beads have been shown to become internalised into cells S. aureus is able to bind to host cells in the absence of the FnBP, but its adherence and invasive properties are much reduced (up to a 500-fold decrease in number of internalised cells) Structure The FnBP inserts into the cell wall of S. aureus by means of a C-terminal LPXTG anchor. Two fibronectin binding domains have been identified - one is present in the C-terminal D repeat region, and one in the N-terminal A region Mechanism The fibronectin binding protein is able to bind fibronectin present in the extracellular matrix. Similarly, the Œ±5Œ≤1 integrin present on host cells also binds fibronectin to create a link to its actin cytoskeleton, binding via the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif present in fibronectin. Fibronectin is able to act as a ‚Äòbridge‚Äô between S. aureus and the host cell, with both S. aureus and the host cell binding at either end of the molecule, and therefore facilitate adherence. Clinical significance The FnBP is involved in adherence to a wide range of mammalian cells and is hence implicated in various infections. It is implicated in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis, and is the predominant adhesin for adherence to osteoblasts, a cell type present in large quantities within bone. Few S. aureus cells become internalised into osteoblasts in the absence of the FnBP FnBPs are essential in the formation of biofilms by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain LAC. They are specifically involved in primary attachment.

Design and construction The main steel structure arriving by barge, May 2009 Architect Santiago Calatrava was the lead designer of the bridge. He was assisted with the civil and structural aspects of the design by Roughan & O'Donovan consulting engineers. This was the second bridge in the area designed by Calatrava, the first being the James Joyce Bridge, which is further upriver. Constructed by a \\"Graham Hollandia Joint Venture\\", the main span of the Samuel Beckett Bridge is supported by 31 cable stays from a doubly back-stayed single forward arc tubular tapered spar, with decking provided for four traffic and two pedestrian lanes. It is also capable of opening through an angle of 90 degrees allowing ships to pass through. This is achieved through a rotational mechanism housed in the base of the pylon. The shape of the spar and its cables is said to evoke an image of a harp lying on its edge. (The harp being the national symbol for Ireland from as early as the thirteenth century). The steel structure of the bridge was constructed in Rotterdam by Hollandia, a Dutch company also responsible for the steel fabrication of the London Eye. The steel span of the bridge was transferred from the Hollandia wharf in Krimpen aan den IJssel on 3 May 2009, with support from specialist transport company ALE Heavylift. The bridge, which cost ‚Ç¨60 million, is named for Irish writer Samuel Beckett, was officially opened to pedestrians on 10 December 2009 by Dublin Lord Mayor, Emer Costello and to road traffic at 7 am the following day. The bridge won Engineers Ireland‚Äôs 'Engineering Project of the Year' in 2010. Criticism The forward curved pylon with 31 cable stays and two back stays Commentators criticised traffic management restrictions in place around the bridge, saying that with certain turns onto the bridge being blocked, traffic would be diverted into the city centre undermining the bridge's purpose of reducing traffic on the downstream bridges. Unhappiness was also expressed over the fact that these restrictions would force drivers to use the East-Link Toll Bridge. Dublin City Council replied that these restrictions were mandated by An Bord Plean√°la to prevent users of the East-Link bridge (outside the city) from coming into the city. At the time of opening, there was also criticism that no bus services had plans to use the bridge.

It is located north of Clinton on the west bank of the Fraser River opposite the Indian Reserve community of Dog Creek. The ranch, near Alkali Lake, was founded in 1863. For many years the largest ranch in North America, it is now the second- largest in Canada, after the Douglas Lake Ranch. The Churn Creek Protected Area is also nearby. Harper brothers Two American brothers, Thaddeus and Jerome Harper, traveled from Harpers Ferry, Virginia, via California, to British Columbia in the Cariboo Gold Rush. They mined in Yale, and lived in Victoria for a time. At one point, they were accused of supporting the rebel Confederacy and plotting against the nearby North. One account suggests that they were asked to leave the border area of British Columbia. Some miners worked their way up the Fraser River seeking gold and found the remote plateau. Unsuccessful in their search for gold, the Harpers settled on the west bank of the Fraser River in 1863 and installed a gang plow. Thus the Gang Ranch began its long operation. The Harpers made an agreement with the Chilcotin Indian Kalalest whereby the land at the confluence of the Chilcotin and Fraser rivers was divided between the First Nations and the Harpers. The Harpers began to drive cattle from Washington or Oregon, hundreds of miles on the hoof, northwards to feed the hungry gold miners. One drive was made from Utah. The brothers bought and sold stock and land, moving frequently at first. The town of Horsefly was first called \\"Harper's Camp\\" and included a steam sawmill. From their gains with the cattle drives, the brothers expanded the Gang Ranch. The Harpers had misfortune, including a severe winter in 1878 which killed thousands of cattle. Despite this, the brothers persevered. In 1883, they bought of Chilcotin land from the government. The brothers also had rangeland at Hat Creek, Cache Creek and Kamloops, in all about . The business operated as the Canadian Ranching Company but the brothers ran into further financial difficulty and the Canadian Ranching Company was eventually sold, in 1891, to an English partner. Western Canadian Ranching Company The new proprietor was Thomas Galpin (1828-1910), one of the founders of the Cassell publishing house. Recently retired from publishing, Galpin was looking for new ventures and investments. After a few years, the business was restructured as the Western Canadian Ranching Company (WCRC) in 1898.https://search- bcarchives.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/western-canadian-ranching-company-records It continued under this name until 1952. Galpin's local representative was Jim Prentice (1861-1911), who became his son-in-law when he married one of Galpin's nine daughters, Mabel. Prentice added to the standing of the WCRC when he was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly, as the Hon J D Prentice. Considerable work was needed: fencing pastures and building sawmills, bridges, bunkhouses, and roads. At the same time, they had to oversee the feeding, droving, and rounding-up of thousands of head of cattle in rough terrain. With the goodwill and assistance of the Chilcotin people, the ranch grew and prospered. Families such as Gaspard, Paternaude, Farwell and Kalalest settled in the area. The English owners continued with the ranch for decades, into the twentieth century. A combination of absentee landowners, salaried English managers, isolation, and rough BC bush meant that the business was not always profitable. The hardscrabble way of the ranch, combined with the hard work of developing a business in raw territory, was costly. Then the Depression and the market crash took its toll. The English owners eventually sold the ranch, but not before introducing English farming practices to the area, and English housewares and furniture to the \\"Big House\\" on the premises. Alsager Holdings In the late 1970s, the ranch was bought by Alsager Holdings. This was the first time in many years that the ranch had been Canadian owned and television news crews came out several times from Vancouver, to cover the story of the ranch's Canadian ownership and subsequent fall into receivership. Dale Alsager and his wife lived on the ranch in a house they built at the headquarters. Lonnie Jones was then manager and cow boss. He rode and made camp with the cowboy crew. Bob Munsey from Paulina, Oregon was the cow boss before Lonnie Jones took over.

He founded a congregation he called the \\"Church of the Future\\". He also wrote widely on aspects of Scottish culture and ancient Celtic history, sometimes espousing distinctly non-mainstream views. Life Waddell was the son of James Waddell of Balquhatston, and was born at Balquhatston House, Slamannan, Stirlingshire on 19 May 1817. His father soon afterwards disposed of the property and removed to Glasgow, and Waddell was educated in the high school and at the university of Glasgow. He was a student of divinity at the time of the disruption of 1843 of the Church of Scotland, and then cast in his lot with the seceders, who afterwards formed the free church of Scotland. Having been licensed as a preacher, in 1843 he was ordained as minister of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, and in the following year he removed to Girvan, Ayrshire, to the pastorate of a small free-church congregation. His attachment to the free church was loosened when he found that its members intended to retain in the entirety the rigid definitions contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith. He had outgrown his early Calvinistic training, and, finding himself at variance with the church of his adoption, he voluntarily resigned his charge, and founded an independent chapel at Girvan styled ‚Äòthe Church of the Future,‚Äô defining his aims and intentions in a discourse with the same title, published in Glasgow in 1861. Many of his congregation left the free church and joined with him. Waddell remained at Girvan till 1862, when he went to Glasgow, and began preaching in the city hall as an independent minister. He soon gathered a large congregation, and in 1870 a church was erected for him in East Howard Street, Glasgow. Financial difficulties led to the abandonment of this building, and Waddell once more gathered a congregation by preaching in the Trades Hall. In 1888, at the request of friends and adherents, he joined the established church. Advancing years compelled him to retire from the ministry in October 1890, and he then began to make selections from his published works to form a volume. The task was not completed when his death took place at Ashton Terrace, Dowanhill, on 5 May 1891. He graduated D.D. from an American university. Works Waddell was an orator of very exceptional power. His skill as a dialectician was displayed in a series of lectures on Ernest Renan's Life of Jesus, delivered in Glasgow City Hall before large audiences in 1863, and afterwards published. His profound admiration for Robert Burns led to his issuing a new edition of the poems with an elaborate criticism (Glasgow, 1867‚Äì9, 4to). He presided at the meeting held in Burns' cottage on 25 January 1859 in celebration of the poet‚Äôs birth, and then delivered an impassioned eulogy on Burns. His chief historical work was a volume entitled Ossian and the Clyde, in which he sought to confirm the authenticity of the Ossianic poems by the identification of topographical references that could not be known to James Macpherson. He also claimed to have verified another work widely accepted to be a forgery, Roger O'Connor's Chronicles of Eri, which he said was \\"forgotten or treated with contempt as an imposture, but now capable of verification in all substantial respects\\".Waddell, Peter Hately. Ossian and the Clyde: Fingal in Ireland, Oscar in Iceland, or Ossian Historical and Authentic, London: Forgotten Books, 2013, pp. 393-4. (reprint of 1875 edition) He also contributed a remarkable series of letters to a Glasgow journal on Ptolemy‚Äôs map of Egypt, showing that the discoveries of Speke and Grant had been foreshadowed by the old geographer. He took a keen interest in educational matters, and was a member of the first two school boards in Glasgow. His most original contribution to literature was a translation of the Psalms of David from Hebrew into the Scottish language, under the title The Psalms: frae Hebrew intil Scottis, in which he showed his profound linguistic knowledge. This work was followed in 1870 by a similar translation of Isaiah. In the early part of his career he attracted much notice by lectures which he delivered in London and the principal Scottish towns. Between 1882 and 1885 he edited the Waverley novels with notes and an introduction.

Halseth and Alf Scheflo at the same time as they established their own printing office in Trondheim. The publishers meant to create a worker's newspaper, not a socialist paper. When the first issue came out on 20 September, the newspaper was an organ of the Liberal Party of Norway, but the paper quickly became socialist and thus an organ of the labour movement and later the Norwegian Labour Party in Trondheim when the labour movement took over the paper in July 1900. The paper was first released weekly, but from 1902 on it was released daily. The purpose for publishing was to propagandize the publishers' political view. Martin Tranm√¶l was a member of the first editing committee as a 20-year-old, and in 1906 became the editor of the paper. He held the position of editor until 1918, when he became party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party. It was under Tranm√¶l that the newspaper expanded. After Tranm√¶l left as editor, Ny Tid became a radical opposition newspaper. In 1921, the Norwegian Labour Party split, creating a Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway. The social democrats established their own newspaper, Tr√∏ndelag Social-Demokrat, but this had little effect on the circulation of Ny Tid. The second party split, which came in 1923, ended with the communists becoming a large percentage of the party in Trondheim; they thereby retained the party's property, including Ny Tid which became an organ for the Communist Party of Norway. The Labour Party in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag established the year after Arbeider-Avisen. Ny Tid marketed themselves in the 1930s as an opponent of the Nazis and Fascism. After the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ny Tid wrote on their front page \\"Lys fascismen og krigen i bann. Fram til antikrigs og antifascistm√∏te i morgen p√• Reina\\". The circulation of Ny Tid fell along with the communist's lowering support, especially after Johan Nygaardsvolds cabinet came to power in 1935. The Nygaardsvold government created increased support for the Norwegian Labour Party in Nygaardsvold's part of the country; the Arbeider-Avisen profited from this. In March 1939, Ny Tid was shut down while having competition from Arbeider-Avisen. NKP's increased popularity after the Second World War, gave a resurrected circulation to Ny Tid. The newspaper continued circulating until July 1945, but shut down for the second time in eight years in May 1947.

Small Cow Creek flows southwest and discharges into the river downstream from Whitefish Lake. Next, several headwater tributaries beginning in the Whitefish Mountain Resort form Haskill Creek which flows south to the Whitefish River downstream from Whitefish Lake. The third tributary to Whitefish River is Walker Creek which begins in the southern flank of the Whitefish Range and joins the river below the Whitefish Lake outlet. Ecology The Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) determined in 2014 that the Whitefish River was temperature-impaired, meaning that high temperature impairs aquatic life, and that a reduction in water temperature of 0.99 ¬∞F was recommended. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) are considers indicator species of stream health, and are present in the Whitefish River, although in greatly diminished numbers. The primary threat to native cutthroat trout is hybridization with non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A 2001 genetics study of cutthroat trout in the river showed 98.2% rainbow trout and 1.8% westslope cutthroat trout genetics in a sample of 15 fish. Other native fish species include the river's namesake mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), largescale sucker ((Catostomus macrocheilus)), longnose sucker ((Catostomus catostomus)), northern pikeminnow ((Ptychocheilus oregonensis)), peamouth chub (Mylocheilus caurinus,), redside shiner ((Richardsonius balteatus)), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus).

Kingsland upgrade Commuters on the upgraded Kingsland stretch of the Northwestern Cycleway, 2017 In 2009-2010, the NZ Transport Agency constructed a previously-missing section in the Kingsland area, where cyclists to this point were forced to detour through a hilly residential area. The project cost $3.7m for approximately 1.2 km length, including five new access points, noise walls alongside the motorway and landscaping.NZTA closing the gap (NZ Transport Agency press release, Auckland Regional Office, 4 November 2009. Accessed 2009-11-08.) The new path section was opened in April 2010, costing $3.7m (though much of this cost was in fact for new motorway noise walls for local residents) and was very well received by cyclists and the local cycle advocacy groups Cycle Action Auckland (now Bike Auckland). Western & CBD extension NZTA intends to improve and extend the path further northwest (from its current termination in Henderson up to Westgate in the coming years, as part of the planned Waterview Connection motorway upgrades. The works will include improving path widths and reducing occasional flooding of the cycleway on the low-lying causeway.FAQ - #2 - What about cyclists and pedestrians? (from NZ Transport Agency's 'SH16 Northwestern Motorway Improvements: St Lukes to Westgate' project website. Accessed 2009-12-01.) Separate from the Waterview upgrades, as part of the Lincoln Road Interchange works, NZTA has also announced that it will extend the cycleway a further 2 km further west, from its current end at Central Park Drive to Huruhuru Road Overbridge. Together with Auckland Council, NZTA is also extending the path eastwards towards the Auckland CBD, through Spaghetti Junction, a project which was also supported by the Auckland Regional Council / Auckland Regional Transport Authority. A preliminary alignment was assessed for the cycleway to cross Spaghetti Junction and then continue to the university area in the east of the CBD via Grafton Gully. The extension was originally hoped to be in place as early as 2012, with later extensions to the waterfront not ruled out. In May 2012, it was confirmed that construction was expected to start near the end of 2012 for up to $10 million, though it is hoped to be constructed for less. The project's expected benefit-cost-ratio was $4.6 for every $ invested. The extension will reach 2.1 km from the current end of the cycleway at Upper Queen Street to Beach Road, though a further $3 million stage, that included an upgrade of the existing section along Ian McKinnon Drive, was deferred for now. In November 2012, construction on the NZTA section of the cycleway extension began, to be completed 2014, with a Beach Road section, linking the new cycleway extension to Quay Street / Tamaki Drive to be constructed by Auckland Transport for $1.5 million by 2015. The Grafton Gully Cycleway was completed in 2014.  Link to SH20 / Waikaraka Cycleways  In May 2011, the Board of Inquiry hearing the resource consent process for the Waterview Connection decided that NZTA was to set aside $8 million for the construction of an off-road surface cycleway between SH16 and the existing SH20 section in Hillsborough, as part of the tunneling project. This will create a connection between the Northwestern Cycleway and the SH20 and Waikaraka Cycleways.  User growth  Cycle growth as a 12-month-rolling average at the Kingsland counter. Cycle growth as a 12-month-rolling average at the Te Atatu counter. A cyclist count study for the Auckland Regional Transport Authority found that at the Great North Road section of the cycleway, the average daily number of users in 2008 was 532, a gain of 59% compared to the year before.Manual Cycle Monitoring in the Auckland Region - Auckland City (Gravitas Research and Strategy Limited, March 2008) In 2010, this success trend continued, with an increase of 70% over the 2007 levels to over 600 cyclists. In part due to investment into new cycleway infrastructure (both path upgrades as well as cycleways linked to the Northwestern Cycleway like the Grafton Gully Cycleway and the Nelson Street Cycleway, cycle numbers have in recent years (~2015-2016) started to increase at a faster rate, as shown by Auckland Transport automatic cycle counters.

He was also Victoria‚Äôs lieutenant governor between 12 May 1936 and May 1945. Mann was nicknamed the ‚ÄúLittle Gentleman‚Äù because of his height (he was 168 cm tall) and he was unfailingly courteous. He had a reputation of being a careful judge delivering decisions of precision and clarity. In 1935, he became the first Australian born person to become chief justice of Victoria.7 Res Judicatae 33 (1955-1957) ‚ÄúAdministration of Justice in Victoria - The State and Its Lawyers‚Äù, Early years Mann was born at Mount Gambier, South Australia. He was the son of Gilbert Hill Cheke Mann and Sophia Charlotte Mann (nee Wollaston). Mann‚Äôs maternal grandfather was John Ramsden Wollaston, a pioneering Anglican archdeacon in Western Australia. Mann‚Äôs younger brother was to become an icon of early Australian radio broadcasting. Mann began his education at Christ Church Grammar School in Mount Gambier. Later he transferred to the public education system when he transferred to Mount Gambier Public School. After leaving school, he studied privately at home. He left South Australia and moved to Melbourne in 1887 where he obtained work as a tally clerk. He then worked as a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the Victorian Government. Whilst working, he studied at the University of Melbourne and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1894. In 1895 he won the Supreme Court prize at the University of Melbourne. He completed his Bachelor of Laws in 1896 and a Master of Laws in 1898. He was called to the Victorian Bar in 1896 but continued working for the State Government rather than practice in his own right. Military service He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 4th Victorian Battalion of the Australian Imperial Regiment known as the ‚Äú4th Vic.Imperial Bushmen ‚Äú He departed Melbourne on 1 May 1900 in the transport ‚ÄúVictorian‚Äô. He served in the Boer War for sixteen months until he was wounded at Hartbeesfontein on 16 February 1901. He was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal. On his return to Australia in November, he set up chambers in Melbourne as a barrister. As a barrister, he specialized in both common law and Equity cases, and became known for his ‚Äúcareful cross- examination technique‚Äù. On 8 April 1911 he married Adeline Mary Raleigh at All Saints Church of England in East St Kilda. They had five children from the marriage. Judicial career On 22 July 1919, Mann was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. In 1931 he became the Chairman of the Court of Industrial Appeal and held that appointment until 1933. He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours of June 1933, formally receiving his knighthood by Letters Patent on 12 July 1933. Between 1923 and 1934, he acted as Chief Justice of Victoria on many occasions. He was appointed Chief Justice in 1935 in succession to Sir William Irvine. In the same year he became president of the Melbourne Club. In 1936, he denounced Victorian police criminal investigation methods of the time as ‚Äúcrude, untrained and overly reliant upon informers and physical coercion‚Äù.‚ÄùPolice Detectives in History, 1750-1950‚Äù Clive Emsley and Haia Shpayer-Makov.

On 30 March 1936 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Victoria, taking office on 12 May 1936. The Melbourne newspaper ‚ÄúThe Sun‚Äù described him as 'lucid, fearless, cold, crisp, alert, analytical, unostentatious and retiring ‚Ä¶ dignified and decorous'. Mann was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the Coronation Honours of 1937.

It is part of the Columbia River basin, as the Kootenay River is tributary to the Columbia River. The history regarding this river and Whiteman's Pass across the Continental Divide begins with James Sinclair leading a party of Red River immigrants through the pass in 1841. They left Fort Garry (now the city of Winnipeg) in 1841 with 23 families, including a 75-year-old woman, with an aim to settle in the Oregon Country to reinforce British claims to the area. After a brief stop at Fort Edmonton, he was guided by Maskepetoon, the chief of the Wetaskiwin Cree, via Lake Minnewanka to the present site of Banff, Alberta where the Spray River joins with the Bow River and then south up the Spray River valley where the reservoir now lies. They trekked up the Spray River, then along a tributary, White Man's Creek, and across the Great Divide at White Man's Pass. In his book \\"The Place of Bows,\\" E.J. Hart suggests that although the party was made up largely of Metis, the presence of a few men from the Maritimes, \\"seem to account for the name 'Whiteman's' being attached to the pass.\\" The Reverend Robert Terrill Rundle was also in the area in 1841. After camping at the confluence of the Bow and Spray rivers, Rundle explored the Spray Valley where it parallels the mountain that now bears his name (Appleby 1975). In 1845, Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit priest, came east from Windermere Lake via the Kootenay River and one of its tributaries to the summit of White Man's Pass \\"where all was wild sublimity\\". He erected a large cross on the pass. Father De Smet and British Army Lieutenants Henry James Warre and Mervin Vavasour are said to have met near the summit. Few Europeans were travelling in the Canadian Rockies at this time and it was a remarkable coincidence that the two parties met (Esther Fraser, \\"The Canadian Rockies\\" wrote that Warre and Vavasour \\"probably\\" used this pass). Father De Smet built a cross that he referred to as the, \\"Cross of Peace\\" near the summit of the pass, and the river which drains the west side of the pass was henceforth known as the Cross River. From White Man's Pass, de Smet travelled down the Spray River, which was \\"jewelled with enamelled beads\\", and on out to the foothills (Fraser 1969). He wrote, \\"The Christian's standard, the cross has been reared at the sources of these two rivers. May it be a sign of salvation and peace to all the scattered and itinerant tribes east and west of these gigantic an luid mountains.\\" The river's indigenous Nakoda (\\"Stoney\\") name, Tsha-kooap-te-ha-wap-ta, alludes to the cross erected near the river by Pierre-Jean De Smet in 1845.[1] Lts. Warre and Vavasour were travelling eastward, returning from a secret mission to determine if troops could be dispatched through the mountains to defend British interests in the southwestern part of the Columbia District. The trip had been encouraged by Sir George Simpson Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Warre and Vavasour reported that the mountain passes were unsuitable for troop transport. Of this pass and others, they wrote: \\"Without attempting to describe the numerous Defiles through which we passed, or the difficulty of forcing a passage through the burnt Forests, and over the high land, we may venture to assert, that Sir George Simpson's idea of transporting troops. . . with their stores, etc. through such an extent of uncultivated Country and over such impracticable Mountains would appear to Us quite unfeasible.\\" Course The Cross River originates in Kootenay National Park on the west slopes of the Continental Divide near White Man Pass, in British Columbia. It flows generally south and west, picking up the waters of Mitchell River from the north, before emptying into the Kootenay River.

From 1603, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt- Zerbst. Rudolph was the fifth son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt, but third-born son by his second wife Eleonore, daughter of Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg.  Life  In 1586, after the death of his father, Rudolph inherited the principality of Anhalt jointly with his half- and full brothers, but because he was still a minor, his older brother John George I acted as regent. By the accounts of contemporary witnesses, Rudolph was an eager pupil and student. In 1596 the twenty-year-old prince was invited to the coronation of King Christian IV of Denmark in Copenhagen. His Grand Tour began in 1600 when he arrived in Sicily. With his younger brother Louis, Rudolph spent a year in Florence. On 21 November 1601 he was admitted to the University of Siena. A year later, in 1602, the prince left Switzerland (where he had lived for some time) and returned to Dessau. In 1603, a formal division of the principality of Anhalt was agreed upon by Rudolph and his surviving brothers. He received Zerbst, where his main residence was, and supported there the renovation of the Gymnasium Francisceum, beginning with the addition of a library. In 1618, Rudolph joined the Fruitbearing Society. Marriages and issue In Wolfenb√ºttel on 29 December 1605 Rudolph married Dorothea Hedwig (born Wolfenb√ºttel, 3 February 1587 ‚Äì d.

Artisanal cheese refers to cheeses produced by hand using the traditional craftsmanship of skilled cheesemakers. As a result, the cheeses are often more complex in taste and variety. Many are aged and ripened to achieve certain aesthetics. This contrasts with the more mild flavors of mass-produced cheeses produced in large scale operations, often shipped and sold right away. Part of the artisanal cheese making process is aging and ripening of the cheeses to develop flavor and textural characteristics. One type of artisanal cheese is known as farmstead cheese, made traditionally with milk from the producer's own herds of cows, sheep, and goats. Artisan cheeses may be made by mixing milk from multiple farms, whereas the more strict definition of farmstead cheese (or farmhouse cheese) requires that milk come only from one farm. Definition There has been a lot of discussion relating to what truly defines artisanal cheese. The American Cheese Society defines artisan, or artisanal cheese as, ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòartisan‚Äô or ‚Äòartisanal‚Äô implies that a cheese is produced primarily by hand, in small batches, with particular attention paid to the tradition of the cheesemaker‚Äôs art and thus using as little mechanization as possible in production of the cheese. Artisan, or artisanal, cheese may be made from all types of milk and may include various flavorings.‚Äù While it is something that is debated by some, those involved in the industry still share a passion for making hand created products, which may or may not include some manufacturing equipment, that will be enjoyed by many consumers. Process The artisanal cheesemaking process can be quite extensive and resembles modern chemistry in many aspects. Many different factors affect the overall product of a finished artisanal cheese product; this includes, but is not limited to what species of grass consumed by the cattle that provided the milk source, any sudden changes of heat, and any loss of cultivated yeast, or changes in barometric pressure. These factors to an extent are different from large commercial manufacturing cheesemakers, and affect artisanal cheese more heavily. Popularity In the last decade, the American artisanal cheese industry has seen an increase larger than that in the twenty years prior to, in artisan creameries being licensed for commercial business. This translates to approximately 450 different artisan cheese makers existing in the United States today. Three regions have come to lead the way in this category, New England, Wisconsin, and California. This rise in the popularity of artisan cheesemaking has also coincided in a rise in the number of dairy farms, all while traditional cattle ranching has been decreasing in numbers. Legal concerns In January 2014, Monica Metz, Branch Chief of the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition‚Äôs Dairy and Egg Branch, responded to a New York State Department of Agriculture request asking the FDA to clarify if using wooden surfaces to age cheese was acceptable. In her response, Metz said the use of wooden surfaces to ripen cheese does not conform to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices. Metz cited 21 CFR 110.40(a), to support her stance on the issue. This statement caused the concern of those involved in the artisanal cheesemaking process, and consumers who enjoy such cheeses. It was feared this direction as stated by the FDA, would harm local American cheesemakers, but also affect cheeses that follow the same practices that are imported from other nations. Many groups to include the American Cheese Society, a nonprofit trade association which promotes and supports American cheeses, created a letter on June 10, 2014, arguing against the FDA stance on using wooden surfaces to ripen cheese. The American Cheese Society stressed their stance on strict safety standards during the American cheesemaking process. Additionally, they commented on how such a ruling would affect the non-manufactured cheese industry, affecting the U.S. consumer‚Äôs ability to access a multitude of different cheeses, including those created locally or abroad. On June 11, 2014, the FDA sent an update regarding their earlier displayed stance on the issue. In the update, the FDA stressed that they are not requiring the prohibiting or banning of wooden surfaces in the cheesemaking process. Furthermore, they stated there is no Food Safety Modernization Act that specifically mentions the use of wooden surfaces needed in the cheesemaking process. The FDA advised they would reach out to and engage the artisanal cheesemaking community, in coming together to resolve the issue.

The persona of Betty Crocker was invented by the Washburn-Crosby Company (which would later become General Mills) as a feminine \\"face\\" for the company's public relations. Early editions of the cookbook were ostensibly written by the character herself. More than 75 million copies of the book have been sold since it was first published in 1950. Owing to the dominant color of the book's covers over the years, the Betty Crocker Cookbook is familiarly referred to as \\"Big Red\\", a term that General Mills has trademarked. History Early media forays for the Betty Crocker character included Betty Crocker Cooking School of the Air broadcast from Minneapolis radio station WCCO beginning in 1924, and several cooking pamphlets such as \\"Betty Crocker's 101 Delicious Bisquick Creations As Made And Served by Well-Known Gracious Hostesses\\". The character was so successful that in 1945 Fortune magazine named her the second most popular woman in the United States, after Eleanor Roosevelt. The same article exposed Crocker as \\"a fake\\", though to little apparent effect. By the early 1950s, General Mills surveys showed that 99% of American housewives were familiar with the character. First published on September 8, 1950 with an initial print run of 950,000 copies, as Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book, the first edition sold for $2.95, with a $3.95 deluxe edition available. The book's launch was heavily promoted by General Mills, with ample time devoted to it on the Betty Crocker's Magazine of the Air radio program and advertisements in magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal, which emphasized that over $100,000 had been spent developing the book's \\"revolutionary\\" recipes. The 2161 recipes for the book were developed by a team of 50 chefs at the General Mills test kitchens, supervised by the home economist Janette Kelley. The book was an immediate best-seller and contemporary reviews were positive; the Chicago Tribune declared it the best general cookbook ever published, and The New York Times noted that its sales of 18,000 copies a week were several times that of the most recent Ernest Hemingway novel. The original 1950 edition assumed very little knowledge on the part of the reader. The book made extensive use of photography and charts to make its techniques accessible to beginning cooks. It featured an extensive glossary that explained cooking terminology and in addition to recipes it offered instructions for using then-new appliances such as refrigerators and electric ranges. With the Great Depression and food rationing due to the Second World War in the very recent past, the book contains instructions for preparing rabbit, a food that rural Americans resorted to in lean times. In Germany, where food rationing continued for many years after the end of the war, the publication of the cookbook created a popular vision of the United States as a land of inexhaustible resources. The book's advice extends beyond the kitchen as well: the 1961 edition includes an exhortation to comb one's hair and apply make-up before breakfast each day. Recipes for cake using Betty Crocker-brand cake mixes were a staple of early editions of the book. The recipes in the first edition are \\"basic\\" according to a modern review, and many are \\"grossly outdated\\"; there are several recipes for hamloaf and an \\"international\\" recipe for \\"Spaghetti Oriental\\". A recipe for tuna and Jell-o pie from a 1965 cookbook was featured in a Buzzfeed listicle of \\"truly upsetting vintage recipes\\". The 12th edition (subtitled \\"Everything You Need to Know to Cook From Scratch\\") was published in October 2016 and features more contemporary cuisine; there are recipes for beef pho, ropa vieja, and shakshouka. An entire chapter is devoted to vegetarian cuisine. The Betty Crocker Cookbook is now the flagship book of what has become a large collection of books printed under the Betty Crocker name. Editions The Betty Crocker Cookbook is available in binder, trade paperback, and comb-bound formats, as well as several special-interest formats such as bridal, heart health, and a breast cancer fundraising edition. Mobile apps for iOS and Android are available to access the Betty Crocker recipe database on the web. The Betty Crocker cookbook series includes more than 250 different books published since 1950 on subjects such as cooking basics, entertaining, as well as Betty Crocker: Kids Cook, first published in 1957 as Betty Crocker‚Äôs Cook Book for Boys and Girls. In 1980, following broadening American tastes, Betty Crocker cookbooks based around international cuisine started to appear, such as the bilingual English/Spanish Cocina Betty Crocker (a Mexican food guide), Betty Crocker's Chinese Cookbook, Betty Crocker's Indian Home Cooking, and others. The current range of cookbooks features over twenty different books. The original 1950 edition and the Betty Crocker Cooky Book have been reprinted as facsimiles. Social perspectives It is commonly asserted that the primary purpose of the Betty Crocker Cookbook is to sell pre-packaged Betty Crocker-brand ingredients, which are specified in the book's recipes. The culinary historian Laura Shapiro does not dispute this, but suggests that the relative ease of making a partially pre-packaged cake recipe from the cookbook empowered women to experiment and to view cooking as a creative outlet, which in turn helped housewives of the 1950s begin to see homemaking as a respectable profession unto itself.

Originally designed for use by surgeons and other operating room personnel, who would put them on when sterilizing themselves, or \\"scrubbing in\\", before surgery, they are now worn by many hospital personnel. Their use has been extended outside hospitals as well, to work environments where clothing may come into contact with infectious agents (veterinarians, midwives, etc.). Scrubs are designed to be simple (with minimal places for contaminants to hide), easy to launder, and cheap to replace if damaged or stained irreparably. In the United Kingdom, scrubs are sometimes known as theatre blues. The spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has increased the use of scrubs but can give wearers a false sense of security that they are 'clean' when in fact they are as easily contaminated as any other clothing. History of surgical attire In contrast to the uniforms long required of nurses,Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"The Nurse‚Äôs Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion\\", Fashion Theory, Vol.21, No.5. (2015), pp. 523-552. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 surgeons did not wear any kind of specialized garments until well into the 20th century.Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress\\", Fashion Theory, (2015), pp.1-23. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 Surgical procedures were conducted in an operating theater. The surgeon wore his own clothes, with perhaps a butcher's apron to protect his clothing from blood stains, and he operated bare-handed with non-sterile instruments and supplies. (Gut and silk sutures were sold as open strands with reusable hand-threaded needles; packing gauze was made of sweepings from the floors of cotton mills.) In contrast to today's concept of surgery as a profession that emphasizes cleanliness and conscientiousness, up to the early 20th century the mark of a busy and successful surgeon was the profusion of blood and fluids on his clothes. The importance of dress as a badge of one's class in society was paramount and the processes behind the transmission of infection were the subject of controversy within the profession. With the \\"Spanish flu\\" pandemic of 1918 and the growing medical interest in Lister's antiseptic theory, some surgeons began wearing cotton gauze masks in surgery; however, this was not to protect the patient from intra-operative infection, but to protect the surgeon from the patient's diseases. Around the same time, operating theatre staff began wearing heavy rubber gloves to protect their hands from the solutions used to clean the room and equipment, a practice surgeons grudgingly adopted. By the 1940s, advances in surgical antisepsis (now called aseptic technique) and the science of wound infection led to the adoption of antiseptic drapes and gowns for operating room use. Instruments, supplies and dressings were routinely sterilized by exposure to either high-pressure steam or ethylene oxide. Originally, operating room attire was white to emphasize cleanliness. However, the combination of bright operating lights and an all-white environment led to eye strain for the surgeon and staff. By the 1950s and 1960s, most hospitals had abandoned white operating room apparel in favor of various shades of green, which provided a high-contrast environment, reduced eye fatigue, and made bright red blood splashes less conspicuous. By the 1970s, surgical attire had largely reached its modern state‚Äîa short-sleeve V-necked shirt and drawstring pants or a short-sleeve calf-length dress, made of a cotton or cotton/polyester blend. Over this was worn a tie-back or bouffant-style cloth cap, a gauze or synthetic textile mask, a cloth or synthetic surgical gown, latex gloves, and supportive closed-toe shoes. This uniform was originally known as \\"surgical greens\\" because of its color, but came to be called \\"scrubs\\" because it was worn in a \\"scrubbed\\" environment.  Use  American hospital workers in Baltimore, Maryland wearing scrubs in 2001. In many operating rooms, it is forbidden to wear any exposed clothing, such as a t-shirt, beneath scrubs. As scrubs are designed to promote a clean environment, the wearing of outside clothing is thought to introduce unwanted pathogens. Nearly all patient care personnel at hospitals in the United States wear some form of scrubs while on duty, as do some staffers in doctor, dental, and veterinary offices. Doctors in the United States may wear their own clothes with a white coat except for surgery. Support staff such as custodians and unit clerks also wear scrubs in some facilities. When the physician is not performing surgery, the scrub is often worn under a white coat. orange prison scrubs In the UK, all NHS hospital trusts have stringent clothing policies, and many of these specifically forbid wearing the iconic white coat for medical staff, owing to infection control concerns. This has meant that several hospitals around the UK have opted for scrubs for staff, especially in Accident and Emergency departments. Scrubs are also sometimes used as prison uniforms in the U.S and other countries. Outside of hospitals, scrubs are becoming more common in other areas especially in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Non-traditional industries using scrubs include workout facilities, schools,[cite weburl=https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/teachers-can- wear-scrubs-when-schools-reopen-in-some-dallas-county- districts/287-87f69208-7798-479f-a5c0-f6add638d51e title=Teachers can wear scrubs when schools reopen in some Dallas County districts publisher=https://www.wfaa.com/ date= accessdate=2020-09-01}} and restaurants. Health and safety standards are critical to restaurants‚Äô success and legal compliance, and there are many opportunities for bacteria to thrive and spread via menus, tables, and shared condiment shakers. Modern scrubs Today, any medical uniform consisting of a short-sleeve shirt and pants is known as \\"scrubs\\". Scrubs may also include a waist-length long-sleeved jacket with no lapels and stockinette cuffs, known as a \\"warm-up jacket\\". Colors and patterns Scrubs worn in surgery are almost always colored solid light grey, light green, light blue or a light green-blue shade. Non-surgical scrubs come in a wider variety of colors and patterns, ranging from official issue garments to custom made, whether by commercial uniform companies or by home- sewing using commercially available printed patterns. Some hospitals use scrub color to differentiate between patient care departments (i.e. Surgery, Childbirth, Emergency, etc.) or between licensed patient care personnel (nurses, radiologic technologists, respiratory and physical therapists, etc.), unlicensed assistive personnel, and non-patient care support staff (i.e. portering, dietary, unit clerks, etc.). Hospitals may also extend the practice to differentiate non-staff members/visitors. In England and Wales many NHS trusts use different colored scrubs to distinguish between different branches of healthcare professionals, for example anaesthetists may wear maroon. This allows staff and patients to easily spot the workers they are looking for in a high pressure situation. Piping of different colors or pattern are also often used to distinguish seniority. Many hospitals have posters in reception areas explaining this system but it is mainly designed for hospital staff. Custom- made printed scrub tops, featuring cartoon characters and cheerful prints, are common in pediatricians' offices, veterinary offices, dental clinics and children's hospitals, and prints for various holidays can be seen throughout the year. Some acute care facilities or larger hospitals also have relaxed rules regarding the wear of non-regulation scrubs in non-surgical units, and they are no longer just the classic v-neck scrub tops, but are now offered in many styles and patterns. The scrub industry, much like maternity wear, used to have very limited fashion options. Indeed, scrubs were generally box shaped and ill fitted, often with limited design choices. Over the past 10 years, the scrub industry has taken notice of the individual preferences of medical professionals and have begun to design and manufacture fashionable and unique designs.  Cleaning  January 2015 laundry service in a medical facility in Sierra Leone. The scrubs are cleaned in-house to prevent the spread of disease. Surgical scrubs are not generally owned by the wearer. Due to concerns about home laundering and sterility issues, these scrubs are usually hospital-owned or hospital-leased through a commercial linen service. And due to these laundering and sterility limitations, disposable scrub suits were introduced in the market.  Scrub caps  Scrub caps have graduated from being functional to also being a personalized accessory both in the operating room and outside. Before the antiseptic focus of the 1940s, hats were not considered essential to surgery. From the 1940s through the 1950s, as a hygienic focus swept the industry, hats became standard wear to help protect patients from contaminants in hair. Full-face hats were even designed for men with beards. These hats have been and continue to be distributed by group purchasing organizations (GPOs) who supply hospitals with most equipment. In the medical fashion 'revolution' of the seventies, more and more medical professionals began personalizing their scrubs by either sewing their own hats or buying premade hats made of colorful patterned fabric. Several styles were popular, including the 'bouffant' surgical cap, a utilitarian hairnet-like hat which typically comes in light blue, and the 'milkmaid', a bonnet-like wrap around hat. Bouffant surgical caps are perhaps the most widely used scrub hats in hospitals, and their usage is not limited to only nurses and surgeons: hospital patients are required to wear a bouffant cap when having surgery of any kind. In 2016, a controversy emerged in the US around the use of cloth or disposable surgical caps vs mandatory use of bouffant style surgical caps. This controversy ended in state mandates for the use of bouffant caps to comply with Joint Commission standards.

Boyd"},{"id":"19099507","text":"A page from the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, covering There are a number of words and phrases in the Book of Mormon that are anachronistic‚Äîtheir existence in the text of the Book of Mormon is at odds with known linguistic patterns or archaeological findings. Each of the anachronisms is a word, phrase, artifact, or other concept that critics, historians, archaeologists, or linguists believe did not exist in the Americas during the time period in which the Book of Mormon claims to have been written. Mormon scholars and apologists respond to the anachronisms in several ways. The list below summarizes the most prominent anachronisms, as well as perspectives of Mormon scholars and common apologetic rebuttals. Background According to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon was originally engraved on golden plates, which he received in 1827 from an angel named Moroni,. whom Smith identified as a resurrected. former inhabitant of the American continent. Smith claimed to translate the original text of the plates into English; the book says that a portion of the text was written on the plates in \\"reformed Egyptian.\\" The Book of Mormon is said to have taken place somewhere in the Americas from c. 2500 BC to 400 AD, thus placing its events within the pre-Columbian era. Critics assert that the book's origin lies firmly in the 19th century and that Smith created it with the resources available to him, including the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. Unlike the Bible, no manuscripts in the supposed original language of the Book of Mormon are known to exist. No manuscripts or plates containing text similar to Egyptian or Hebrew have ever been excavated in the New World. Outside of Mormon scholars, the consensus is that archaeological findings do not support the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Some Mormon archaeologists and researchers claim various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the Inca, Maya, Olmec, and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record.; see RLDS D&C; 110:20, were advanced by RLDS members: ; ; , and Historical anachronisms Quoting Isaiah Book of Mormon prophets quote chapters 48 through 54 of the Book of Isaiah after having left Jerusalem around 600 BC. Since Isaiah died around 698 BC, under traditional biblical belief, there would be no conflict. The prevailing scholarly opinion is that these chapters were not written by Isaiah, but rather by one or more other people during the Babylonian captivity, sometime between 586 and 538 BC (between 14 and 82 years after it could have been known to the Book of Mormon prophets).John L. McKenzie, Second Isaiah (1969, Yale University Press) Brevard S. Childs, Isaiah (2000, Westminster John Knox Press) Herbert G. May and Bruce M. Metzger, The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha (1977, Oxford) However, there is not complete unanimity, with some conservative Biblical scholars still asserting that Isaiah authored the entire book.Bergsma notes: \\"Ever since the publication of Duhm's influential Isaiah commentary, Isaiah 40‚Äì55 has generally been ascribed to an exilic Second Isaiah, while chapters 56‚Äì66 have been attributed to a post-exilic Third Isaiah. However, there has not been complete unanimity. Some conservative scholars have continued to defend the eighth-century prophet's authorship of the entire book.\\" from ‚Äì Baptism Baptism is mentioned as a ritual that is taught and performed among the Nephite civilization, with its first mention being taught by Nephi between 559 and 545 BC. \\"And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name\\". While some have commented that baptism as a part of conversion was not customary until after the Babylonian captivity, detailed research by Everett Ferguson (2009) has concluded that \\"the date for the origin of proselyte baptism cannot be determined.\\" The Babylonian captivity occurred subsequent to the departure of the Lehites recounted in the Book of Mormon. Both Christian and Rabbinic baptism is rooted in the washings in Leviticus which dates to approximately 1445 B.C. A practice similar to baptism is known to have been practiced by the Jewish Essenes between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD. The Jewish Encyclopedia compares Christian baptism to ancient Jewish purification and initiation rites involving immersion in water, and states that \\"Baptism was practised in ancient (Hasidic or Essene) Judaism\\". Dating of known historical events The Book of Mormon chronology accounts for 600 years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem to the birth of Jesus Christ, which contradicts the timing of known historical events.Hardy, G. (2010). Understanding the Book of Mormon a readers guide. New York: Oxford University Press. Footnote 15 on page 103Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 10:4, 19:8; 2 Nephi 25:19, 3 Nephi 1:1 Lehi is said to have left Jerusalem in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, which occurred in 597 BC.Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 1:4 The date of birth of Jesus was no later than 4 BC, based on the Bible stating that it occurred during the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 BC. A few LDS Church scholars account for this discrepancy by speculating that perhaps the Nephite calendar was a lunar calendar during that time period.Sorenson, John L. Comments on Nephite Chronology Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 2, 2 (1993):207‚Äì211Spackman, Randall P. The Jewish/Nephite Lunar Calendar Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 7, 1 (1998): 48‚Äì59. Flora and fauna anachronisms Horses There are five incidences where horses are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, and are portrayed as being in the forest upon first arrival of the Nephites, \\"raise(d),\\" \\"fed,\\" \\"prepared\\" (in conjunction with chariots), used for food, and being \\"useful unto man\\".1 Nephi 18:25, Enos 1:21, Alma 18:9,10,12, Alma 20:6, 3 Nephi 3:22, 3 Nephi 4:4, and Ether 9:19. There is no evidence that horses existed on the American continent during the timeframe of the Book of Mormon. Horses evolved in North America,R.J.G. Savage & M.R. Long, Mammal evolution, an illustrated guide (1986, Facts on File, p. 202): \\"although the true horses had themselves also by then died out in Europe and Asia, they survived in North America and from there they continued to evolve.\\" but are believed to have become extinct on the American continent at the end of the Pleistocene. Horses did not reappear in the Americas until the Spaniards brought them from Europe.R. Dale Guthrie, New carbon dates link climatic change with human colonization and Pleistocene extinctions, Nature 441 (11 May 2006), 207‚Äì209. They were brought to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and to the American continent by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519. Apologists assert that there is evidence that some New World horses may have survived the Pleistocene‚ÄìHolocene transition,See and references cited therein; see also other references cited in John L. Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1996), 295, n.63. and that such evidence is accepted by some non-Mormon scholars. Others believe that the word \\"horse\\" in the Book of Mormon does not refer to members of the genus Equus but instead to other animals such as deer or tapirs. FARMS apologist Robert R. Bennett stated that as a comparison, the famed horses of the Huns did not leave any archaeological trace yet numbered in the thousands. Archaeological remains of horses have been found at the Hun sites of Boroo Gol, Mankhan as well as at various grave sites directly preceding the Huns. Bennett also draws an analogy by discussing the limited evidence of \\"lions\\" in Palestine: \\"The biblical narrative mentions lions, yet it was not until very recently that the only other evidence for lions in Palestine was pictographic or literary. Before the announcement in a 1988 publication of two bone samples, there was no archaeological evidence to confirm the existence of lions in that region.\\" Elephants Elephants are mentioned in the Book of Ether. Critics maintain that there is no evidence of elephants in the Americas after the end of the Pleistocene. Elephants are mentioned twice in a single verse in the Book of Ether. \\"And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants,\\" and considered at least semi-domesticated as \\"useful unto man.\\" Mastodons and mammoths lived in the New World during the Pleistocene and the very early Holocene with a disappearance of the Mastodon from North America about 10,500 years ago where recent research indicates mammoths survived on the American mainland until 10,000 years ago; however, as with the prehistoric horse, the fossil record indicates that they became extinct along with most of the megafauna towards the end of the last ice age. The source of this extinction, known as the Holocene extinction is speculated to be the result of human predation, a significant climate change, or a combination of both factors.Sharon Levy, \\"Mammoth Mystery, Did Climate Changes Wipe Out North America's Giant Mammals, Or Did Our Stone Age Ancestors Hunt Them To Extinction?\\", Onearth, winter 2006, pp. 15‚Äì19 as part of a mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna that is widely believed to have been a result of human hunting pressure. It is known that a small population of mammoths survived on Saint Paul Island, Alaska, up until 5725 BP (3705 BC), but this date is more than 1000 years before the Jaredite record in the Book of Mormon begins. The main point of contention is how late these animals were present in the Americas before becoming extinct, with Mormon authors asserting that population islands of these animals continued to exist into Jaredite times. Various Mormon authors have cited evidence that North American mound- builder cultures were familiar with the elephant.Wayne N. May (editor), Ancient American, Archaeology of America Before Columbus, LDS Special Edition III The oldest mound-builder societies date to around 2000 BC. The mound builder/elephant controversy did not originate with the Book of Mormon.On the subject of the mound builder / elephant archaeological controversy and the original mound builder setting for the Book of Mormon (19th century mound- builder literary genre): Robert Silverberg, ‚Äúand the mound-builders vanished from the earth‚Äù, American Heritage Magazine, June 1969, Volume 20, Issue 4 http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1969/4/1949_4_60.shtml In The Mound Builders, Their Works and Relics, author Stephen Dennison Peet cites instances of exhumed mastodon remains and arguments given for why the remains were believed to be contemporary with mound builders.Stephen Dennison Peet, The Mound Builders, pp. 38‚Äì44 Elephant effigy pipes, of the characteristic mound builder platform style, were reported as archaeological finds in Iowa,Stephen Dennison Peet, The Mound Builders, pp. 11‚Äì14. see also M.C. Read, Archaeology of Ohio, pp 116‚Äì117 and many have readily identified the animal depicted in the shape of the Wisconsin \\"elephant mound\\", though others question whether this is in fact the animal represented.On Elephant platform pipes and the Elephant Mound of Grand County, Wisconsin, see Charles E. Putnam (President of the Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences), Elephant Pipes and Inscribed Tablets in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Davenport, Iowa, 1885, pp. 19‚Äì20, and U.S. Ethnology Bureau, Vol. 2., 1880‚Äì81, Pg. 153; see also Charles Valentine Riley, The American Naturalist, American Society of Naturalists (Essex Institute), pp. 275‚Äì277 The former Iowa state archaeologist Marshall McKusick discusses the evidence indicating that the elephant platform pipes are frauds in his book on the so-called Davenport Tablets.McKusick, Marshall, The Davenport Conspiracy Revisited. Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1991. The co-existence of man and elephantine animals is congruent with the archaeological record, but does not address the anachronism, since the dates of all elephantine remains in the Americas have been placed well before their mention in the Book of Mormon. There are instances of stories preserved orally by Native Americans which some Mormon scholars believe may describe elephants. One such story is related by the Naskapi Indian Tribe, located in eastern Quebec and the Labrador region of Canada. The story concerns a monster from the Naskapi tradition called \\"Katcheetohuskw\\", which is described as being very large, with large ears, teeth and a long nose.Johnson states that the stories claimed that the monster was \\"very large, had a big head, large ears and teeth, and a long nose with which he hit people.\\" Similar versions of \\"monster\\" legends related by other tribes refer to a monster called \\"Ursida\\", which is described as more of a large, stiff- legged bear rather than a mammoth. The story of the \\"monster bear\\" is considered by some scholars to be purely mythical. Delaware and other native American legends of the mastodon are likewise said to exist.Richard C. Adams, Legends of the Delaware Indians and Picture Writing, pp. 70-71, 1905; also Johanna R. M. Lyback, Indian Legends of Eastern America, pp. 155‚Äì59, 1925 Cattle and cows There are five separate incidences of \\"cows\\" or \\"cattle\\" in the New World in the Book of Mormon, including verbiage that they were \\"raise(d)\\" and were \\"for the use of man\\" or \\"useful for the food of man,\\", , and indicates that \\"cattle\\" and \\"cows\\" were not considered the same animal. Critics argue that there is no evidence that Old World cattle (members of the genus Bos) inhabited the New World prior to European contact in the 16th century AD. Apologists argue that the term \\"cattle\\" may be more generic than suggesting members of the genus Bos, and may have referred to bison, mountain goats, llamas, or other American species.For example, Enos in the Book of Mormon tells that the Nephites raised \\"flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind\\": Enos 1:21, see also 2 Nephi 17:25. According to the Book of Mormon, \\"cattle\\" could be found in ancient America. However, no species of bison is known to have been domesticatedJared Diamond. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1999, Norton, pages 165, 167, 168) and there is no evidence for the domestication of any other large mammal in the pre-Columbian Americas except for the llama and alpaca which, as members of the camel family, would have been unclean and unsuitable for keeping the Law of Moses (Leviticus 11:4). Goats Brocket deer There are four mentions of the existence of goats in the Book of Mormon. The Jaredites noted goats \\"were useful for the food of man\\" (approximately 2300 BC), the Nephites did \\"find\\" \\"the goat and the wild goat\\" upon arrival (approximately 589 B.C.) and later \\"raise(d)\\" \\"goats and wild goats\\" (approximately 500 BC), and the goat was mentioned allegorically (approximately 80 BC)., , , Domesticated goats are not native to the Americas, having been domesticated in pre-historic times on the Eurasian continent. Domesticated goats are believed to have been introduced on the American continent upon the arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century, 1000 years after the conclusion of the Book of Mormon, and nearly 2000 years after they are last mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The mountain goat is indigenous to North America and has been hunted, and the fleece used for clothing. However it has never been domesticated, and is known for being aggressive towards humans. Matthew Roper, a FARMS writer, discussed the topic of goats in his article, \\"Deer as 'Goat' and Pre-Columbian Domesticate\\". He noted that when early Spanish explorers visited the southeastern United States they found Native Americans herding tame deer: > In all these regions they visited, the Spaniards noticed herds of deer > similar to our herds of cattle. These deer bring forth and nourish their > young in the houses of the natives. During the daytime they wander freely > through the woods in search of their food, and in the evening they come back > to their little ones, who have been cared for, allowing themselves to be > shut up in the courtyards and even to be milked, when they have suckled > their fawns. The only milk the natives know is that of the does, from which > they make cheese. Roper based his arguments on anecdotes from early Spanish colonists which called native Mesoamerican brocket deer goats: \\"Friar Diego de Landa noted, 'There are wild goats which the Indians call yuc.'\\" He quoted another friar in the late 16th century, \\"in Yucat√°n 'there are in that province ... great numbers of deer, and small goats'\\".Deer as \\"Goat\\" and Pre-Columbian Domesticate Matthew Roper Yale anthropologist Marion Schwartz noted that in the Americas \\"The white-tailed deer is a good example of an animal whose solitary behavior precludes its domestication even though it prefers to live in areas that people have opened up. Deer have been tamed and herded but not truly domesticated.\\" Swine A collared peccary \\"Swine\\" are referred to twice in the Book of Mormon, and states that the swine were \\"useful for the food of man\\" among the Jaredites. There have not been any remains, references, artwork, tools, or any other evidence suggesting that swine were ever present in the pre-Columbian New World.John J. Mayer and I Lehr Brisbin, Jr. Wild Pigs in the United States: Their History, Comparative Morphology, and Current Status (1991, University of Georgia Press). Apologists note that peccaries (also known as javelinas), which bear a superficial resemblance to pigs and are in the same subfamily Suinae as swine, have been present in South America since prehistoric times. Mormon authors advocating the mound-builder setting for the Book of Mormon have similarly suggested North American peccaries (also called \\"wild pigs\\")S.v. \\"peccary\\", The New Columbia Encyclopedia. as the \\"swine\\" of the Jaredites.Phyllis Carol Olive, Lost Lands of the Book of Mormon, 83 The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World is in Brazil in 1547 and referred to them as \\"wild pigs.\\" Though it has not been documented that peccaries were bred in captivity, it has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucatan, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Columbia at the time of the Conquest. Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact. Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites, which civilization is thought by some Mormon apologists to correlate to the Jaredites. Barley and wheat Barley Grains are mentioned 28 times in the Book of Mormon, including \\"barley\\" and \\"wheat\\". The introduction of domesticated modern barley and wheat to the New World was made by Europeans sometime after 1492, many centuries after the time in which the Book of Mormon is set. FARMS scholar Robert Bennett offered two possible explanations for this anachronism: > Research on this matter supports two possible explanations. First, the terms > barley and wheat, as used in the Book of Mormon, may refer to certain other > New World crop plants that were given Old World designations; and second, > the terms may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat. For > example, the Spanish called the fruit of the prickly pear cactus a \\"fig,\\" > and emigrants from England called maize \\"corn,\\" an English term referring to > grains in general. A similar practice may have been employed when Book of > Mormon people encountered New World plant species for the first time.Barley > and Wheat in the Book Mormon, Robert R. Bennett Provo, Utah: Maxwell > Institute. Bennett also postulates that references to \\"barley\\" could refer to Hordeum pusillum, also known as \\"little barley,\\" a species of grass native to the Americas. The seeds are edible, and this plant was part of the pre-Columbian Eastern Agricultural Complex of cultivated plants used by Native Americans. Hordeum pusillum was unknown in Mesoamerica, where there is no evidence of pre-Columbian barley cultivation. Evidence exists that this plant was domesticated in North America in the Woodland periods contemporary with mound- builder societies (early centuries AD) and has been carbon-dated to 2,500 years ago.Bennett cites, Nancy B. Asch and David L. Asch, \\"Archeobotany,\\" in Deer Track: A Late Woodland Village in the Mississippi Valley, ed. Charles R. McGimsey and Michael D. Conner (Kampsville, Illinois, Center for American Archaeology, 1985), 44, p. 78Robert R. Bennett, \\"Barley and Wheat in the Book Mormon\\", Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute. Barley samples that date to 900 AD were also found in Phoenix, Arizona, and samples from Southern Illinois date between 1 and 900 AD. Technology anachronisms Chariots Inca road in Peru The Book of Mormon mentions the presence of \\"chariots\\" in three instances, in two instances (both around 90 BC at the same location) inferring them as a mode of transportation., , There is no archaeological evidence to support the use of wheeled vehicles in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Many parts of ancient Mesoamerica were not suitable for wheeled transport. Clark Wissler, the Curator of Ethnography at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, noted: \\"we see that the prevailing mode of land transport in the New World was by human carrier. The wheel was unknown in pre-Columbian times.\\"Wissler, Clark. The American Indian. pp. 32‚Äì39 ‚Äì as quoted by B. H. Roberts, Studies of the Book of Mormon, Second Edition, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1992, pg. 99. A broader claim that wheels did not exist in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica is incorrect. Wheels were used in a limited context in Mesoamerica for what were probably ritual objects, \\"small clay animal effigies mounted on wheels.\\" Richard Diehl and Margaret Mandeville have documented the archaeological discovery of wheeled toys in Teotihuacan, Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, and Panuco in Mesoamerica. Some of these wheeled toys were referred to by Smithsonian archealogist William Henry Holmes and archaeologist D√©sir√© Charnay as \\"chariots.\\" While these items establish that the concept of the wheel was known in ancient Mesoamerica, lack of suitable draft animals and a terrain unsuitable for wheeled traffic are the probable reasons that wheeled transport was never developed.\\"\\"Tula, and wheeled animal effigies in Mesoamerica\\" http://www.precolumbianwheels.com/Tula&wheeled;_animal_effigies.pdf Wheeled Toys in Mexico. Gordon F. Ekholm, American Antiquity. Vol. 11, No. 4 (Apr. 1946) A comparison of the South American Inca civilization to Mesoamerican civilizations shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles. Although the Incas used a vast network of paved roads, these roads are so rough, steep, and narrow that they were likely unsuitable for wheeled use. Bridges that the Inca people built, and even continue to use and maintain today in some remote areas, are straw-rope bridges so narrow (about 2‚Äì3 feet wide) that no wheeled vehicle can fit. Inca roads were used mainly by chaski message runners and llama caravans. Mayan paved roads at Yucatan had characteristics which could allow the use of wheeled vehicles, but there is no evidence that those highways were used by other than people on foot and nobles who were borne on litters. One Mormon researcher responds to the lack of evidence with a comparison to biblical archaeology, suggesting that though there are no archaeological evidences that any of the numerous ancient American civilizations used wheeled transportation, few chariot fragments have been found in the Middle East dating to biblical timesSorenson , p. 59. (apart from the disassembled chariots found in Tutankhamun's tomb). Although few fragments of chariots have been found in the Middle East, there are many images of ancient chariots on pottery and frescoes and in many sculptures of Mediterranean origin, thus confirming their existence in those societies. Chariots are absent in pre- Columbian frescoes, pottery and artwork found in the New World. Referencing the discovery of wheeled chariot \\"toys\\" in Mayan funerary settings, Mormon scholar William J. Hamblin has suggested that the \\"chariots\\" mentioned in the Book of Mormon might refer to mythic or cultic wheeled vehicles.See Pre- Columbian Contact with the Americas across the Oceans: An Annotated Bibliography Mormon scholar Brant Gardner has asserted that the Book of Mormon \\"chariot' may be a palanquin or litter vehicle, since the Book of Mormon makes no reference to the specific use of the wheel. Silk A silkworm building its cocoon The Book of Mormon mentions the use of \\"silk\\" in the New World four times.Alma 1:29, Alma 4:6, Ether 9:17, Ether 10:24. Most commercial silk comes from the cocoon of one of several Asian moths, predominantly Bombyx mori; this type of silk was unknown in pre-Columbian America. Mormon scholar John L. Sorenson documents several materials which were used in Mesoamerica to make fine cloth equivalent to silk, some of which the Spanish actually called \\"silk\\" upon their arrival, including the fiber (kapok) from the seed pods of the ceiba tree, the cocoons of wild moths, the fibers of silkgrass (Achmea magdalenae), the leaves of the wild pineapple plant, and the fine hair of the underbelly of rabbits. He alleges that the inhabitants of Mexico used the fiber spun by a wild silkworm to create a fabric. The Aztecs, Mixtecs and Zapotecs used and traded a silk material taken from the large nests made by two indigenous insects, the moth Eucheira socialis and the butterfly Gloveria psidii. The nests were cut and pieced together to make a fabric, rather than extracting and weaving the fiber as in modern silk. Weaving of silk from what are thought to be the same insects has been reported in more recent times, though its use in pre-Columbian times has been debated. Compass The Book of Mormon also states that a \\"compass\\" or \\"Liahona\\" was used by Nephi in the 6th-century BC. The compass is widely recognized to have been invented in China around 1100 AD, and remains of a compass have never been found in America. In the Book of Alma, Alma explains to his son that \\"our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass\\". Apologists counter that Liahona was, according to the narrative, created by God, and not by the Nephites. Also, unlike a normal compass, the Book of Mormon says that there was also writing on the ball that displayed instructions from God, and there was no mention of any part of it pointing to a geographic point. Recent speculation has raised the possibility of the Liahona being a form of astrolabe which are indicated to have existed during Lehi's time frame. Windows The Book of Mormon describes that the Jaredite people were familiar with the concept of \\"windows\\" near the time of the biblical Tower of Babel, and that they specifically avoided crafting windows for lighting in their covered seagoing vessels, because of fears that \\"they would be dashed in pieces\\" during the ocean voyage.Ether 2:22‚Äì23 Transparent window panes are a more recent invention, dating to the 11th century AD in Germany. FairMormon, citing several such uses in the KJV of the Bible, notes that 'the term \\"window\\" originally referred to an opening through which the wind could enter' and which sometimes had doors or shutters (2 Kings 13:17) or lattices (Song of Solomon 2:9) and were not made of glass, so these parts of the window could be what is referred to as being \\"dashed to pieces.\\" It is also suggested that the warning in Ether may have referred to the entire vessel being \\"dashed in pieces\\" if the structure was weakened by additional openings. Uses of metal The Book of Mormon mentions a number of metals, and the use of metal. However, while pre-Columbian tribes used metal, often beaten, there is no accepted evidence of high-temperature melting. The word \\"dross\\" appears twice in the Book of Alma. In addition to meaning a by-product of smelting, it can also mean \\"waste matter; refuse; any worthless matter separated from the better part; impure matter.\\" Thus, use of the word dross does not necessarily imply the melting of metal but may be consistent with low temperature working of metal to eliminate inclusions or surrounding gangue material. The Book of Mosiah also mentions \\"ziff\\" as a metal, but its modern correlate is unknown. =Steel and iron= Three incidences of \\"steel\\" in the New World are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, one early amongst the Jaredites after their arrival around 2400 BC, one immediately after the Lehi party's arrival in the New World discussing Nephi's knowledge of steel at approximately 580 BC, and one of occurrence amongst the Nephites around 400 BC., , , Four incidences of \\"iron\\" in the New World are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, one amongst the Jaredites around 1000 BC, one immediately after the Lehi party's arrival in the New World discussing Nephi's knowledge of iron at approximately 580 BC, and two of occurrence amongst the Nephites, one around 400 BC and the other around 160 BC., , , Between 2004 and 2007, a Purdue University archaeologist, Kevin J. Vaughn, discovered a 2000-year-old iron ore mine near Nazca, Peru; however there is no evidence of smelting, and the hematite was apparently used to make pigments. He noted: > Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals, such as copper, they > never smelted iron like they did in the Old World .... Metals were used for > a variety of tools in the Old World, such as weapons, while in the Americas, > metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite. An Olmec mining colony has been identified in the Cintalapa valley in Mexico. Among items excavated were partially worked blocks of ilmenite (a form of iron oxide) and magnetite (a magnetic iron oxide) and a fragment of an iron mirror, together with tools and San Lorenzo-style ceramics. These remains date to around 950 BC. Among the products produced from this material were Olmec mirrors which were formed from polished iron, beads, and figurines At the Olmec site of Las Bocas in Puebla, Mexico a particularly fine iron mosaic mirror was recovered and dated to around 1000 BC. There were two forms of ancient steeling of iron that did not involve smelting. The first is achieved through quenching and the second through carburizing iron by heating, hammering, and folding the iron in the presence of charcoal. Apologists counter that the word \\"steel\\" may be referring to another alloy of hardened metal such as the hardened copper alloy that is translated with the word \\"steel\\" in the KJV. This alloy is in fact a hardened copper similar to bronze and not hardened iron.Even in biblical verses where iron is paired with \\"steel\\" (Job 20:24, Jeremiah 15:12), \\"steel\\" nevertheless refers to hardened copper alloys. See ◊†÷∞◊ó◊ï÷º◊©÷∏◊Å◊î and ◊†÷∞◊ó÷π◊©÷∂◊Å◊™ in the Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew / Aramaic Lexicon) =Metal swords, which had \\"rusted\\"= Aztec warriors brandishing maquahuitls The Book of Mormon makes numerous references to \\"swords\\" and their use in battle. What the swords are made of is mostly ambiguous except for two instances involving the Jaredites. The first was an early battle (around 2400 BC) involving the king Shule which used \\"steel\\" swords. When the remnants of the Jaredite's abandoned cities were discovered (around 120 BC),Mosiah 8:8 the Book of Mormon narrative states that some swords were brought back \\"the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust,\\" suggesting that these swords had metal blades. Though usually more resistant to oxidation than iron, copper alloys are susceptible to bronze disease in humid conditions and hardened alloys of copper can oxidize. It is therefore not certain that the mention of \\"rust\\"Mosiah 8:11 is a reference to iron oxide. Warriors in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are known to have used wooden clubs with blade-like obsidian flakes;\\"Spaniards who faced native Mesoamerican swords in battle were deeply impressed by their deadly cutting power and razorlike sharpness.\\" as a volcanic glass, obsidian does not rust. Some studies have shown that metallurgy did exist in a primitive state in Mesoamerica during the Preclassic/Formative and Classic periods (which corresponds to the time period in the Book of Mormon).

The closest evidence to a pre-Columbian metal blade on Mesoamerica come from the Maya, but those artifacts were not swords, but small copper axes used as tools. =Cimeters= \\"Cimeters\\" are mentioned in eight instances in the Book of Mormon stretching from approximately 500 BC to 51 BC.Enos 1:20, Mosiah 9:16, Mosiah 10:8, Alma 2:12, Alma 27:29, Alma 43:18, 20, 37, Alma 44:8, Alma 60:2, Helaman 1:14 Critics argue this existed hundreds of years before the term \\"scimitar\\" was coined. The word \\"cimiter\\" is considered an anachronism since the word was never used by the Hebrews (from which the Book of Mormon peoples came) or any other civilization prior to 450 ADB. H. Roberts noted: \\"The word [cimiter] is of oriental and uncertain origin and appears in various forms. How it came to be introduced into the speech and writings of the Nephites, and how not used in the other Hebrew literature at an earlier date, is so far as I know, unaccountable. The earliest use of the word I have found is in Gibbon, where referring to the alleged incident of finding the sword of Mars for Attila, he there calls that sword of Mars 'cimiter'; but that was about 450 A.D.\\" ‚Äì and because metal swords are not found in the Americas in the Book of Mormon timeframe. The word 'cimeterre' is found in the 1661 English dictionary Glossographia and is defined as \\"a crooked sword\\" and was part of the English language at the time that the Book of Mormon was translated. In the 7th century, scimitars generally first appeared among the Turko- Mongol nomads of Central Asia however a notable exception was the sickle sword of ancient Egypt known as the khopesh which was used from 3000 BC and is found on the Rosetta Stone dated to 196 BC. Eannatum, the king of Lagash, is shown on a Sumerian stele from 2500 BC equipped with a sickle sword. Apologists, including Michael R. Ash, and William Hamblin of FAIR, note that the Book of Mormon does not mention the materials that the \\"cimiters\\" were made out of, and postulate that the word was chosen by Joseph Smith as the closest workable English word for the weapon used by the NephitesAsh states: \\"there is enough Mesoamerican artwork and artifacts that display the basic characteristics of a scimitar that the Book of Mormon is vindicated for its usage.\\" See: http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Brochures/Anachronisms3.pdf that was not made of metal, and was short and curved. Mormon scholar Matthew Roper has noted there are a variety of weapons with curved blades found in Mesoamerica. =System of exchange based on measures of grain using precious metals as a standard= The Book of Mormon details a system of measures used by the societies described therein. However, the overall use of metal in ancient America seems to have been extremely limited. A more common exchange medium in Mesoamerica were cacao beans. \\"[W]ell into Colonial times the beans served as a form of money in regional markets.\\" Linguistic anachronisms Knowledge of a modified Hebrew and reformed Egyptian languages Photograph of the document known as the Caractors document, with reformed Egyptian symbols The Book of Mormon account refers to various groups of literate peoples, at least one of which is described as using a language and writing system with roots in Hebrew and Egyptian. Fifteen examples of distinct scripts have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription. Archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest (and hence the forebear from which the others developed) and a significant portion of the documented scripts have not been deciphered. None of the documented Mesoamerican language scripts have any relation to Hebrew or Egyptian. The Book of Mormon describes another literate culture, the Jaredites, but does not identify the language or writing system by name. The text that describes the Jaredites (Book of Ether) refers only to a language used prior to the alleged confounding of languages at the great tower, presumably a reference to the Tower of Babel. Linguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that the initial colonization of the Americas by Homo sapiens occurred over 10,000 years ago.Lyle Campbell, American Indian Languages, The Historical Linguistics of Native America (1997, Oxford) FairMormon apologists argue that the Book of Mormon does not describe all of the original settlers of the Americas, but rather a subset of the larger population, who settled in a limited geographical setting. Thus, their language and writing may have had little to no impact on the culture of the rest of the population. \\"Christ\\" and \\"Messiah\\" The words \\"Christ\\" and \\"Messiah\\" are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon.The word \\"Christ\\" is used 99 times, and the word \\"Messiah\\" is used 13 times. The first instance of the word \\"Christ\\" in the Book of Mormon dates to between 559 and 545 BC.See 2 Nephi 10:3 The first instance of the word \\"Messiah\\" dates to about 600 BC.1 Nephi 1:19. \\"Christ\\" is the English transliteration of the Greek word ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ (transliterated precisely as Christ√≥s); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word rendered \\"Messiah\\" (). Both words have the meaning of \\"anointed,\\" and are used in the Bible to refer to \\"the Anointed One\\". In Greek translations of the Old Testament (including the Septuagint), the word \\"Christ\\" is used for the Hebrew \\"Messiah\\", and in Hebrew translations of the New Testament, the word \\"Messiah\\" is used for the Greek \\"Christ\\". Any usage in the Bible of the word \\"Christ\\" can be alternately translated as \\"Messiah\\" with no change in meaning (e.g. ). The Book of Mormon uses both terms throughout the book. In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it does not matter which word is used: > And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our > Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; > that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in > the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon > you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery > and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure > foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall (). > And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear > record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins > of the world.\\" (). The Book of Mormon occasionally uses the word \\"Christ\\" in a way that is not interchangeable with \\"Messiah\\". For example in , the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob says an angel informed him that the name of the Messiah would be Christ: > Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ‚Äîfor in > the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name‚Äîshould > come among the Jews () The word \\"Messiah\\" is used in the text before this point, but from this point on the word \\"Christ\\" is used almost exclusively. Richard Packham argues that the Greek word \\"Christ\\" in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work since Joseph Smith clearly stated that, \\"There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\\" The Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research states that the word \\"Christ\\" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word \\"Messiah\\" and that Smith simply chose the more familiar Greek word to translate the word that appeared in the language of the plates. Hugh Nibley postulated that the word \\"Messiah\\" could have been derived from Arabic rather than Hebrew,Hugh Nibley, Since Cumorah, pp. 167‚Äì68, discusses the origin, interchangeability, and translated use of the terms \\"Messiah\\" and \\"Christ\\" as they appear in scripture. Nibley points out that the Arabic word al-masih, for instance, could be translated using the Hebrew term \\"Messiah\\" or the New Testament term \\"Christ\\" depending on the context and translator. See also \\"Meshiach\\" (◊û÷∏◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊ó÷∑), \\"anointed\\", Hebrew-Aramaic Lexicon although Arabic is not mentioned as one of the languages in which the golden plates were written. Greek names Joseph Smith stated in a letter to the editor of Times and Seasons, \\"There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\\"Times and Seasons, vol.4, no.13, May 15, 1843, p. 194 The Book of Mormon contains some names which appear to be Greek, some of which are Hellenizations of Hebrew names (e.g. Antipas, Archeantus, Esrom, Ezias, Jonas, Judea, Lachoneus, and Zenos). Other Greek names are non-biblical and their presence in the book is puzzling to both believers and skeptics, since neither Smith nor the Nephites spoke Greek. One explanation has been offered by Stephen D. Ricks. Writing in the LDS magazine Ensign he said that though the language of the Mulekites is not put forward in the Book of Mormon, the party could have included Phoenicians who had regular contact with the Greeks or perhaps some Greek sailor or traders were also in the initial group. In addition, Greek names have occurred as loan names in ancient Hebrew. \\"Church\\" and \\"synagogue\\" The word \\"church\\" first occurs in 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain: > And he [Laban's servant], supposing that I spake of the brethren of the > church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did > follow me (). According to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600 BC. The meaning of the word \\"church\\" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the KJV than modern English. The concept of a church, meaning a convocation of believers, existed among the House of Israel prior to Christianity. For instance, Psalms speaks of praising the Lord \\"in the congregation of the saints\\"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word \\"ecclesia\\" for \\"congregation,\\" which is also translated as \\"church\\" in the New Testament. The Book of Mormon using the word \\"church\\" in the same \\"style\\" as the KJV is seen by some apologists as support for the Book of Mormon. A similar question regards the word \\"synagogue,\\" found in Alma 16:13: > And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their > temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were > built after the manner of the Jews (). Scholars note that synagogues did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the Babylonian captivity. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150 BC.The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered,\\" Monika Tr√ºmper Hesperia, Vol. 73, No. 4 (Oct.‚ÄìDec., 2004), pp. 513‚Äì98 References to synagogues have been found in Egypt as early as the 3rd Century BC. The Name \\"Sam\\" as an anachronism Critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner and Marvin W. Cowan contend that certain linguistic properties of the Book of Mormon provide evidence that the book was fabricated by Joseph Smith. These critics cite as a linguistic anachronism the Americanized name \\"Sam\\" (1 Nephi 2:5,17). Apologists assert that it is potentially a hypocoristicon from Samuel representing the common Semitic vocable ≈°m and would most likely mean ‚Äúthe name,‚Äù ‚ÄúName,‚Äù or even ‚Äúdescendant/offspring\\" among other Near Eastern linguistic possibilities. Gee, Roper and Tvedtnes report that the name \\"Sam\\" is found on a bronze ringmounted seal dated in the 7th century B.C. They also note that the name \\"Samuel\\" in Hebrew is a combination of two words‚ÄîShem and El. In early Hebrew, the same letter was used for \\"s\\" and \\"sh\\" and vowels were not specified. Judges 12:6 demonstrates that the tribe of Joseph pronounced the letter that Shem began with as \\"s\\". \\"Adieu\\" The French word \\"adieu\\" appears once in the Book of Mormon, in Jacob 7:27. Supporters of the Book of Mormon argue that the text is a translation into modern English, so the use of a French word is not amiss. For example, Daniel H. Ludlow contends that it may have been the result of Joseph Smith choosing the best word available to convey the meaning of the original text.Daniel H. Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, p. 163 The word is found in the 1828 Webster's Dictionary so was considered an English word at the time of the Book of Mormon translation. Anachronisms apparently perpetuated from King James's translation A significant portion of the Book of Mormon quotes from the brass plates, which purport to be another source of Old Testament writings mirroring those of the Bible. In many cases, the biblical quotations in the English-language Book of Mormon, are close, or identical to the equivalent sections of the KJV. Critics consider several Book of Mormon anachronisms to originate in the KJV. \\"Satyr\\" In 2 Nephi 23:21, the Book of Mormon quotes Isaiah 13:21, which mentions a \\"satyr\\". Satyrs are creatures from Greek mythology, which are half-man, half-goat. The KJV translates Isaiah 34:14 thus: :The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. (\\"◊ï÷∞◊®÷∏◊ë÷∞◊¶◊ï÷º÷æ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ù ◊¶÷¥◊ô÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù ◊ï÷º◊û÷∏◊ú÷∞◊ê◊ï÷º ◊ë÷∏◊™÷µ÷º◊ô◊î÷∂◊ù ◊ê÷π◊ó÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ï÷∞◊©÷∏◊Å◊õ÷∞◊†◊ï÷º ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ù ◊ë÷∞÷º◊†÷π◊ï◊™ ◊ô÷∑÷Ω◊¢÷≤◊†÷∏◊î ◊ï÷º◊©÷∞◊Ç◊¢÷¥◊ô◊®÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ô÷∞◊®÷∑◊ß÷∞÷º◊ì◊ï÷º÷æ\\") Other English-language versions of the Bible, including the New International Version, translate the word ◊©◊¢◊ô◊® (sa\`iyr) as \\"wild goat\\"; other translations include \\"monkey\\" and \\"dancing devil\\". Doctrinal Anachronisms Anti-Universalist rhetoric Universalism, or the doctrine that all humanity would be saved, was a prominent theology that peaked in popularity in the northeastern United States in the 1820s and 1830s. The Book of Mormon contains a number of sermons and passages that use anti-Universalist religious arguments common to that time and place, not known to have occurred in any ancient American setting.Metcalfe, B. L., & Vogel, D. (1993). New approaches to the Book of Mormon: Exploration in critical methodology. Salt Lake City, UT: Signature Books. chapter 2 online at:http://signaturebookslibrary.org/anti-universalist-rhetoric-in-the-book-of- mormon/ ; presented in lecture form at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm7t7pNUWAM The existence of 19th century anti-Universalist arguments and rhetoric in the Book of Mormon has been pointed out as anachronistic by various scholars, including Fawn M. Brodie and Dan Vogel. LDS Church scholars generally argue that because Book of Mormon prophets were shown by Jesus Christ the modern era, and the audience of the Book of Mormon was people in the modern era, that Book of Mormon prophets would have been intimately familiar with anti-Universalist rhetoric and purposefully used it to convince modern day readers.Givens, T. (2002). By the hand of Mormon: The American scripture that launched a new world religion. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 164-166 Satisfaction theory of atonement The satisfaction theory of atonement was a medieval theological development, created to explain how God could be both merciful and just through an infinite atonement, and not known to have appeared in any ancient American setting.Blake T.

The organization was founded in 1856 and is a constituent organization of the American Medical Association. The CMA is dedicated to serving its member physicians through a comprehensive program of legislative, legal, regulatory, economic and social advocacy. The CMA's goal is to provide members with the necessary support, so that they can surpass the challenges and continue to run successful medical practices.  History  The CMA and its leaders: * Started the state public health department in the 1870s; * Made immunizations compulsory for school children in the 1880s; * Began looking at ways to fund health care for the poor in the 1930s; * Performed some of the first cornea transplants, and set up some of the first organ transplant guidelines in the country; and * Started California's first medical schools, which later became Stanford and University of California.  Organization  On , the Medical Society of the State of California held its first meeting at Pioneer Hall on J Street in what is now Old Town Sacramento. The society's first president, Benjamin Franklin Keene, M.D.‚Äîalso a state senator representing El Dorado County‚Äîled the meeting of 1875. After the 1850 cholera outbreak in Sacramento, the surviving physicians became close colleagues and friends, and began to found county medical societies. The first were founded in Sacramento and San Francisco. Each society kept in contact, and society secretaries Thomas Logan, M.D., (Sacramento) and Elias Cooper, M.D., (San Francisco)‚Äîhistorical figures in their own right‚Äîset up that landmark first meeting in 1856. Dr. Logan, a notable medical scholar, would later reform the CMA after years of strife, reorganizing the society in 1875 and eventually serving as the state's Director of Public Health as well as president of the CMA and then the American Medical Association. Dr. Cooper, an eye surgeon and co-founder of the Illinois Medical Society previously, would found the medical school that became Stanford University School of Medicine. Controversy arose over which physicians were credible, and as a result a credentials committee formed to \\"prevent admissions of improper persons.\\" Dr. Morse became the Medical Society's first Censor, a precursor to the Medical Board of California of today. In the early years, travel was difficult, so that the society's focus remained in Northern California, and its counterpart, the Southern California Medical Society, was not created until 1898. County societies sprouted up throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 1900, CMA membership cost $10 and included malpractice coverage. In 1923, the society renamed itself the California Medical Association to comply with name changes at other state medical associations and the American Medical Association. John Frederick Morse, M.D., a historian and journal editor for the medical society who would form some of the first disciplinary and licensing terms for state physicians, is credited with starting the first journal of the Medical Society, starting with his own funds a short-lived publication called the California State Journal of Medicine. There were several revivals of publications over the years. In 1873, the society published the first Transactions of the Medical Society of California, a volume published annually until Volume 31, issued in April 1901. In that year it was recommended that, because the annual transactions were \\"an extravagant and unnecessary way of perpetuating the proceedings of the society, the more rational one of publishing a monthly journal\\" be adopted. Thus, The California State Journal of Medicine was revived. In 1924 its name was changed to California and Western Medicine, and in 1946 to California Medicine. Philip Mills Jones, M.D., is regarded as that journal's founder. In 1974, the journal became The Western Journal of Medicine, in conjunction with a plan to create a regional medical journal for the West. For more than twenty years, The Western Journal served as the official journal for the state medical associations of Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and six research and specialty societies, in addition to the CMA. In 1998, the Journal was taken over by the British Medical Journal, and has since ceased publication.  Merger with the California Osteopathic Association  In 1961, the CMA merged with the California Osteopathic Association. At the time, the CMA consisted of 40 medical societies, which were organized by county; after the merger, the COA became the 41st medical society. In 1975, full CMA membership was offered to qualified osteopathic physicians (D.O.). In 1999, the CMA passed a resolution to work with the current osteopathic medical association, Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California, on issues that concern both M.D. and D.O. physicians. In 2005, the CMA opposed efforts to consolidate the D.O. and M.D. medical boards.  Medicine  The physicians who founded the Medical Society of the State of California were veterans in the fight against cholera, encephalitis, typhoid and smallpox‚Äîdiseases that became prevalent in the newly minted lands of California after the Gold Rush of 1849. They dedicated their organization to \\"promote the science and art of medicine, protection of public health, and the betterment of the medical profession.\\" A deadly cholera epidemic struck Sacramento in October 1850. Despite their unfamiliarity with these diseases, physicians remained committed to helping their patients. About 5,000 people in Sacramento and the surrounding areas died of cholera, and thousands of others deserted the area in fear of the disease. Dr. Morse noted physicians‚Äô remarkable commitment: \\"Not one educated physician turned his back upon the city in its distress and threatened destruction.\\" The dead in the cholera epidemic included seventeen physicians, a third of the physician population of California. They are memorialized in a plaque at the historic Sacramento City Cemetery, with only one of them buried in a marked grave. The CMA also helped to establish some of the first blood banks and cornea banks in the West and helped create the California Tumor and Tissue Registry in 1947‚Äîwhat is today the second largest tumor and tissue registry in the world.  Politics and activism  During the 20th century and beyond, the CMA has fought against tobacco use and smoking and insisted early on‚Äîin the face of criticism and fear of the newly found disease‚Äîthat HIV and AIDS patients deserve needed health care. The CMA continues to advocate for patients on a broad range of health care issues, including broader immunization against disease and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In 1975, the CMA preserved access to care for many when it forged ahead on a plan to keep medical malpractice rates affordable. Hearing the outcry of CMA physicians who had faced rate increases up to 400 percent, threatening practice viability, Governor Jerry Brown called together a special session of the legislature to discuss the malpractice cost crisis. They passed that year a collection of statutes called the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA), a model for national medical liability reform. At the insistence of CMA physicians, MICRA kept patients whole and ensured compensation for their injuries while setting a cap on non-economic damages, going a long way in keeping malpractice insurance premiums affordable. CMA continued the fight to protect MICRA against a ballot measure funded by trial lawyers, eventually contributing to the loss of Proposition 46 in the November 2014 general election. By the 1960s, it was clear to the CMA that the managed care industry needed oversight and regulation. In the 1970s, the CMA sponsored a key piece of legislation, the Knox-Keene Health Care Services Act. The law instituted financial and quality standards for HMOs, set a basic minimum benefit package, required plans to ensure continuity of patient care, and protected the physician- patient relationship in health care decisions. In 2000, the CMA sponsored AB 1455, which gave the Department of Managed Health Care the authority to levy penalties and fines against health plans that engage in unfair business and payment practices. While the CMA had made some progress in the Legislature, physicians were frustrated that despite three decades of legislative and regulatory efforts, health plans still ran roughshod over physicians and patients often could not get the care they needed. In 2000, in a historic action, the CMA filed a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) lawsuit against for-profit HMOs in California, alleging that they were using fraud and other illegal activities to interfere in the physician-patient relationship. Eventually, more than 800,000 physicians and 19 state and county medical association's joined the CMA as plaintiffs, becoming the largest class action health care lawsuit in U.S. history. Of the 10 defendants, six settled (including the now merged Anthem/Wellpoint/Blue Cross), and three had their cases dismissed by the court. The settling health plans agreed to pay a combined $585 million in monetary damages. But of even greater value were the binding commitments made by the insurers to change the way they do business with physicians. These prospective commitments have been valued far in excess of the monetary relief, at well over $1 billion over four years. The CMA continues to advocate on behalf of physicians and patients to make sure that health plans are complying with the laws and regulations of the State of California. In 2015, the CMA co-sponsored California Senate Bill 277, authored by Senator Dr. Richard Pan, which removes the personal belief exemption from school vaccination requirements. The bill was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on June 30, 2015. The CMA was also a partner in the Save Lives California coalition, which passed California Proposition 56 (2016) to raise tobacco taxes by $2 per pack. CMA, in conjunction with the California Dental Association, has announced it intends to run a sugary drink tax on the 2020 ballot.  Demography  At the medical society's second annual session in 1857, the Committee on Education declared that at the very least German, French‚Äîbut especially Spanish‚Äîshould be part of a medical student's education, stating: \\"In no country in the world is there such a national admixture of languages as this State.\\" CMA began on the principles that all patients of all ethnicities should be treated for their illnesses, and the CMA supplied the nation with some of its first ethnic medical leaders. Just as in 1857, the CMA continues to work toward bridging language and ethnic barriers with patients by placing new physicians in underserved areas of the state through the Stephen M. Thompson Loan Forgiveness Program, and studying the effects of limited English proficiency on patient care. In recent decades, the CMA House of Delegates approved \\"mode-of-practice\\" forums to provide representation for physicians based on the type of practice they are in‚Äîsolo/small group, medium, large and very large group, academic, hospital-based, or government employed. An ethnic physicians' forum also was established. Today, the California Medical Association has more than 48,000 members in all modes of practice and specialties representing the patients of California. Physicians for a Healthy California (formerly CMA Foundation) The CMA Foundation - renamed Physicians for a Healthy California (PHC) in 2018 - primarily began in 1963 as a charitable arm of the California Medical Association, disbursing over $1 million in grants and loans to medical students. The CMA, while supporting the interests of California's physicians, realized that it was important to help along future physicians during their educational years, and so remained as a source of resources for medical students until 1995, when Dr. Rolland C. Lowe, M.D., CMAF Board Chair, recommended that the Foundation expand its role to encompass community health. New projects began in 1996 and 1997, such as ComPACT (tobacco education) and the Physician Leadership Recognition Dinner. These programs established our position in the community as leaders of public health initiatives. The Pharmacy Partnership Project, begun in 1996, gathered pharmacists from across California working in independent pharmacies to remove tobacco products from their stores. We realized a nearly 80% success rate (currently 78% of independent pharmacies in California are tobacco free). In July 2000, the Partnership changed its name to Prescription for Change to encourage chain pharmacies to go tobacco free as well. Overall, the mission of this project is to facilitate public education campaigns, advertisements, and media coverage that focus on increasing consumer awareness about pharmacies selling tobacco. Beginning in 2000, PHC initiated its community involvement by launching the AWARE Project (Alliance Working for Antibiotic Resistance Education), a nationally recognized project. In addition, there are many other health projects, public outreach programs, and physician conferences that point to PHC's commitment to improving the health of California's residents. Institute for Medical Quality In January 1996, the California Medical Association launched a new not-for-profit subsidiary, the Institute for Medical Quality (IMQ), to help improve the quality of care delivered to patients in California. Its programs include ambulatory care facility accreditation, the Consolidated Accreditation and Licensure Survey program, continuing medical education accreditation and certification, correctional health care accreditation and membership, peer review consultations, extensive educational programs and research. Audio-Digest Foundation The Audio- Digest Foundation is a continuing education provider that was an affiliate of the California Medical Association (CMA). In January 2008, Audio-Digest Foundation and Marathon Multimedia became Learners Digest International (LDI). LDI was formed by Housatonic, who acquired and consolidated these two businesses formerly owned by the California Medical Association. In August 2015, LDI was acquired by Wolters Kluwer Health Division for $150 million cash. The organization was established in 1953 and was founded by Jerry Lyle Pettis. It currently employs 70 full-time staff members and is based in Glendale, California. The organization produces continuing medical education/continuing education (CME/CE) audio programs for physicians and health care professionals who subscribe. Programs are published on 15 specialties. These are typically audio tapes of meetings (such as seminars, short courses at universities, conferences and symposia) at which experts present new research. The organization is accredited to provide continuing education to physicians by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, to nurses (by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission of Accreditation), and to physician assistants (by the American Academy of Physician Assistants, which accepts educational activities by ACCME-accredited organizations up to a certain number of credits).

Incident  On 18 August 2008, heavy monsoon rains and poor maintenance caused a breach in the Kosi embankment. Water passed through the breach at an estimated 129,800 cusecs, flooding many villages in Nepal and hundreds of villages in northern Bihar. The flood submerged most of the Kosi alluvial fan area, which is very fertile, with a dense agrarian population.  Background  The Kosi River's upper basin in southern Tibet and eastern Nepal drains some 60,000 km2 of mountainous terrain, a region that tectonic forces are elevating by about 1 cm a year. If erosion keeps pace with geologic uplift, an estimated 600 million cubic meters of sediment would be carried downstream in an average year. However, empirical measurements of the river's sediment load have yielded estimates of 100 million cubic meters annually, indicating that the area is rising. River gradient ranges from more than 10 meters/km for major upper tributaries in the mountains to as little as 6 cm/km as the lower Kosi nears the Ganges.Sharad Jain, Pushpendra Agarwal, Vijay Singh (2007) Hydrology and Water Resources of India. (Netherlands:Springer). As the gradient decreases on the plains, current slows and turbulence that holds sediments in suspension diminishes. Sediments settle out and are deposited on the riverbed. This process eventually raises a channel above the surrounding terrain. The river breaks out, seeking lower terrain, which it again proceeds to elevate by deposition. This creates a cone-shaped alluvial fan. The Kosi alluvial fan is one of the largest in the world, covering some 15,000 km2 and extending 180 km from the outermost foothills of the Himalayas to the Ganges river valley. Flood waters naturally spread out over the surface of this cone. Flows over 25,000 m¬≥/s have been measured where the Kosi exits the Himalayan foothills, enough to create a flow of water 30 km wide. At this rate, in one week enough water would accumulate to cover the entire megafan to a depth of 1.5 meters. Preventative flood control measures include upstream reservoirs that can also serve irrigation needs and produce hydroelectric power. However, in Nepal these are mostly in the planning stages. The flood control measures mainly consist of downstream embankments meant to confine the river to a fixed channel. In theory, the faster flow along this channel would carry high flows away and keep sediments in suspension. Silt deposition near Kosi embankment at Navbhata, Saharsa, Bihar, India On 18 August 2008 one of the man-made embankments failed. The river reverted from the prescribed western channel to an old channel near the centre of its alluvial fan. The river spread out widely and flooded towns, villages, and cultivated fields on the densely populated alluvial fan. Recurrent flooding on the lower Kosi contributes largely to India's history of suffering more flood deaths than any other country except Bangladesh, and has earned the Kosi the epithet \\"The Sorrow of Bihar\\".  Affected areas  India Flooding occurred throughout the Kosi River valley in northern Bihar, in the districts of Supaul, Araria, Saharsa, Madhepura, Bhagalpur, Khagaria and Purnea.SITUATION REPORT BIHAR FLOODS 2008 The flood killed 250 people and forced nearly 3 million people from their homes in Bihar. More than 300,000 houses were destroyed and at least 340,000 hectares (840,000 acres) of crops were damaged. Villagers in Bihar ate raw rice and flour mixed with polluted water. Hunger and disease were widespread. The Supaul district was the worst-hit; surging waters swamped 1,000 square kilometres (247,000 acres) of farmlands, destroying crops. Nepal It also affected six districts in Nepal. Approximately 53,800 Nepalese (11,572 households) were affected by the Koshi floods in Sunsari District, according to the Government of Nepal (GoN). Koshi Wildlife Reserve along the Koshi river was severely impacted by the floods including its wildlife and biodiversity.

The Prime Minister declared a \\"natural calamity\\" on 28 August and earmarked US$230 million in aid for the region.nytimes.com, Floods in India May Displace Millions Rescue operations were carried out by the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and non-government organisations. Indian Air Force helicopters dropped relief supplies in the worst-hit districts. Mumbai Fire Brigade sent a 22-member disaster management team to help in relief work. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar requested a rehabilitation package of Rs 145 billion from the central government for the flood ravaged Kosi region. The Bihar government returned funds from Gujarat for relief work because of purported differences with the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi. On 1 September, describing the floods as a \\"disaster,\\" the Dalai Lama gave 1,000,000 rupees to the Bihar government for relief work. The Government of Bihar initiated Kosi Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Programme covering 30,000 affected families in Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura district based on a pilot project implemented by ODR Collaborative, a network of organisations, supporting the Government and an owner driven reconstruction policy was formulated to support each family with Rs. 55,000 to construct their own house. After signing an agreement with the World Bank in January 2011, this programme has been upscaled to cover 100,000 families for reconstruction of hazard safe houses. The cost per house will be Rs. 55,000 ($1200) with an additional cost of Rs. 2,300 ($50) for a toilet and Rs. 5,000 ($110) for solar powered lighting. In cases where beneficiaries do not own land, the Government of Bihar will provide additional assistance of Rs. 5000 ($110) for the people to buy the land. Towards this project, the World Bank is contributing $220 million. The Government of Bihar has also partnered with ODR Collaborative and UNDP to continue the social and technical facilitation and capacity building for this 'owner driven reconstruction' programme. Technical guidelines have been brought out to enable owners to build houses with various local materials including bamboo. The rehabilitation work has been incredibly slow. Out of a total 100,000 houses to be built by the Government in the Kosi region comprising Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul districts, only 12,500 were built till February 2014.  Administrative lapse  Fax messages sent by engineers at the Kosi dam warning the state government of the impending disaster went unheeded as the official authorised to respond was on leave. Consequently, many residents waiting for evacuation instructions never received warning of the flood. Nitish Mishra, Bihar's disaster management minister, said, \\"There should definitely be some accountability,\\" and that action would be taken. Investigation Bihar Government appointed a one-man inquiry commission, headed by Justice Rajesh Walia, former chief justice of Patna High Court, to probe the cause of the embankment breach. It was asked to examine all aspects related to the efforts to maintain the utility of the Kosi project since its inception in 1953 ‚Äì particularly after a major landslide in 1979 pushed the Kosi towards its eastern bund ‚Äì and a breach in 1991. The Commission submitted its report in March 2014.

History  The Welsh Hound is a native breed to the British Isles, and could possibly be the Segussi breed of rough-coated hound which existed in northern Europe in Roman times. From medieval times through the early part of the 20th century, the bards, who had always held a special place in Welsh society, sang odes to the hounds, often naming individual hounds, and praising their qualities. \\"The ancient laws of Wales codified during the reign of Hywel Dda (942 ‚Äì 948 AD) give the value of the Welsh Hound as 240 pence trained, 120 pence untrained. By comparison a sound pack horse was valued at the same time as 120 pence.\\"  Temperament  The Welsh Hound has been kept as a hunting dog for 2,000 years, living and hunting in packs. It is adapted to hunting in rocky and mountainous terrain in its native Wales. It has been bred to hunt amid the Welsh for its speed, stamina and vocalizations. It is still used for drag hunting today. Welsh Hounds are expected to be immediately responsive to the huntsman's voice, but to learn commands from the responses and cues of the pack. They are known to 'talk' to the huntsman with various howls and barks signalling the progress of the hunt. While gentle, placid and friendly, they also make good house pets. They are hard to train and require consistency and firm guidance but are extremely loyal, gentle and tolerant with small children and other animals.  Breed recognition  The Welsh Hound is registered with The Welsh Hound Association, which has been keeping the breed's stud book since 1922, and maintaining the breed as purebred since 1928. The association was formed \\"for the purpose of preserving and promoting the Welsh Fox Hound as a specific British breed\\". The Welsh Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club on 1 January 2006. Since the outlawing of hunting with dogs in Great Britain, various clubs have been offering registration for the Welsh Hound as a rare breed pet.

Adapted from the 1934 stage musical Anything Goes by Cole Porter, Guy Bolton, and P.G. Wodehouse, the film is about two entertainers scheduled to appear in a Broadway show who travel to Europe, where each discovers the perfect leading lady for the female role. Bing Crosby's character, Bill Benson, goes to England and meets Mitzi Gaynor's character Patsy Blair, and he signs her as the female lead. Meanwhile, Donald O'Connor's character, Ted Adams, travels to France and meets Jeanmaire's character, Gaby Duval, and he signs her to the same role. On the return voyage, with each man having brought his leading lady along, the Atlantic becomes a stormy crossing when each man must tell his discovery that she might not get the role. Paramount had already (1936) released a musical film version that followed the plot of the original stage musical. The book for this 1956 film version, also released by Paramount, was drastically rewritten. Although this version again stars Crosby (whose character was renamed), the film replaces most of the original characters and follows a new plot. It features almost no similarities to the musical stage production, apart from some songs and the title. Premise Showbiz partners Bill Benson and Ted Adams each travel to Paris to sign a dancer to star in their new show. The problem? There is only one role, and the men have unknowingly cast two dancers, Patsy Blair and Gaby Duval. It is up to the men to sort out their mess on the cruise back to the United States. Cast Production Filming took place in April and May 1955. The primary musical numbers (\\"Anything Goes\\", \\"You're the Top\\", \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\", \\"It's De-Lovely\\", and \\"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\\") appear in the film with updated arrangements, while the lesser-known Porter songs were cut completely, and new songs, written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, were substituted. These substitutions ranged from the lively tap number by Donald O'Connor with bouncy children and as many bouncy balls (\\"You Can Bounce Right Back\\") to crazy kitsch (\\"Second-hand Turban\\"). Musical numbers were staged by Nick Castle, with the \\"Anything Goes\\" number staged by Ernie Flatt, and Roland Petit providing the choreography of \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" for his wife Zizi Jeanmaire. Reception The Variety reviewer said: \\"It‚Äôs a bright offering for Easter release, geared to play an engaging tune at the wickets. Male topliners Bing Crosby and Donald O‚ÄôConnor go together as though born to give the zip to what scripter Sidney Sheldon has concocted hereunder the stage title. While there are Cole Porter songs and the legit handle is still carried, that‚Äôs about all that remains of what went on behind the footlights, and there‚Äôs scant resemblance to Paramount's 1936 film version, in which Crosby also starred with Ethel Merman\\". A. H. Weiler, writing for The New York Times, thought that, \\"For all its activity, Anything Goes is, in the main, standard musical comedy. Some of the principals are decidedly decorative and talented. The script, however, is transparent and fragile.\\" Soundtrack The original soundtrack album was released by Decca Records and includes a mix of soundtrack performances and studio re-creations. # \\"Ya Gotta Give the People Hoke\\" (Crosby and O'Connor) ‚Äì This is from the film soundtrack. # \\"Anything Goes\\" (Gaynor) ‚Äì The orchestra track is from the film, but Gaynor overdubs a new and different vocal. # \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" (Jeanmaire) ‚Äì This is from the film soundtrack, although the sound quality fluctuates between the vocals and the dance music. # \\"You're the Top\\" (Crosby and Gaynor) ‚Äì This is a studio recording with an arrangement totally different from that presented in the film. On screen the number is done as a double duet with Crosby and Gaynor rehearsing in one room while O'Connor and Jeanmaire rehearse in an adjoining room. The recorded version is less complete and has some different lyrics. # \\"Dream Ballet\\" (Orchestra) ‚Äì This is taken from the soundtrack with the addition \\"Let's Do It\\" at the very beginning, which was edited out of the final print of the film. # \\"It's De-Lovely\\" (O'Connor and Gaynor) ‚Äì This is from the film soundtrack with dialogue removed. # \\"All Through the Night\\" (Crosby) ‚Äì This is a studio re-recording with Crosby singing at a slightly faster tempo. # \\"A Second Hand Turban and a Crystal Ball\\" (Crosby and O'Connor) ‚Äì This is the full routine (with a few slight dialogue abridgments) taken from the film soundtrack. # \\"You Can Bounce Right Back\\" (O'Connor) ‚Äì This is from the film soundtrack. # \\"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\\" (Full cast) ‚Äì This is from the soundtrack, but remixed to remove the chorus and adding some verses not heard in the finished film. The album stayed in Decca's catalog until 1969 when it was discontinued.Last available listed in Schwann catalogue, June 1969, page 211 In 2004, Decca Broadway re-released the recording on CD with three additional Crosby tracks: \\"Sailor Beware\\", \\"My Heart and I\\", and \\"Moonburn\\".

He specialised in animal drawings. He was apprenticed as a lithographer, but served in the British Army (Wiltshire Regiment) during World War I and then studied at the Westminster School of Art. He fought at Mons, Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia. He was wounded four times, the most serious of which was a shot to the left side of his jaw, and mentioned in despatches. From 1917 to 1919, he served as a captain in the Indian Army. From 1919 to 1922, he studied at the Westminster School of Art under Walter Bayes and Bernard Meninsky and then from 1923 to 1926 he was a part-time lecturer at Central School of Art in Birmingham. His remaining family still reside centrally in the UK and the United States. Webb produced illustrations for the first two books of the Swallows and Amazons series by Arthur Ransome, which were used in some 1930s editions. Because Ransome did not like those produced by Steven Spurrier for the first book, Swallows and Amazons, those were not used in its first edition (1930), apart from the endpaper map and dust jacket. In 1931 the second edition contained Webb's illustrations, as did the first edition of the sequel, Swallowdale. (Ransome himself was the original illustrator of the third story, Peter Duck, and all that followed. Further, in 1938 he produced illustrations for Swallows and Amazons and Swallowdale, replacing Webb's drawings.)

The school is part of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District, with admission based primarily on the locations of students' homes. The school earned widespread media attention in 2008 following former pupil Governor Sarah Palin's nomination as the Republican vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in the 2008 United States presidential election. Academics As of 22 February 2018, there are fifteen AP classes offered. WHS also participates in the University of Alaska Anchorage's Tech Prep program, which allows students to receive college credit for automotive technology classes. Athletics WHS is a 4A member school of the Alaska School Activities Association (ASAA), the governing body for high school athletics in Alaska. The fall sports offered at WHS are cross country running, football, cheerleading (football), swimming and volleyball. The winter sports offered are basketball, hockey, Native Youth Olympics, cross country skiing, cheerleading (basketball) and wrestling. The spring sports offered are baseball, soccer, softball, and track and field. Mascot Wasilla mascot Wasilla High School's mascot is the Warrior, a Native American. Following the killing of George Floyd, a petition to change the mascot was circulated by a former student who called the mascot \\"racially obtuse\\". The administration of Wasilla High announced they would work with the Knik Tribal Council to \\"design a more culturally appropriate WHS Alaskan Native warrior to reflect the indigenous people of our area.\\" Environmental projects In 2000, Wasilla High School received a $5000 environmental education grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The school worked in partnership with local government agencies and businesses to raise awareness of groundwater issues in the school and the community. Then they worked on many projects to tell their community to save the environment. Extracurricular activities Close-Up is a program that takes students to study in Washington D.C. for one week. The Sister School Exchange program is a one-week student exchange program between students in urban and rural Alaska. Graduation rate A Johns Hopkins University study named Wasilla High School as a \\"dropout factory\\". Wasilla's dropout rate was 6.5 percent in 2006, a number that was much higher than most of the schools in the Mat-Su district. The study was conducted by finding the difference between a class with 400 freshman students which ended up with 260 seniors four years later. However, the Johns Hopkins study did not follow specific students. If a student started school at Wasilla High and then graduated from another high school, the study would consider him or her a dropout. Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District has an open enrollment policy and it is fairly common for students to transfer from one school to another if their parents find new jobs in other areas. School Board President Sarah Welton said that the study was flawed and that the false impression made on others in the country would be unfortunate. Only 58 percent of incoming freshmen graduate as seniors. In the spring of 2009, the students of Wasilla High School took a qualifying exam for graduation. The subjects tested were math, writing, and reading. In math, 87 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score. Statewide, 80.2 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score. In writing, 78.1 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score. Statewide, 78.8 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score. In reading, 94.1 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score. Statewide, 90.0 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score. As of the 2008-2009 school year, Wasilla's graduation rate is 77.8 percent, higher than the statewide graduation rate of 67.6 percent.

The book is based on the idea that the theory of general relativity could be discovered by a pre-industrial civilisation.  Plot summary  The novel has two narratives in alternate chapters. The first follows two citizens of the Amalgam, a Milky Way-spanning civilisation, investigating the origin of DNA found on a meteor by the Aloof. The Aloof control the galactic core and, until the novel begins, have rejected all attempts at contact by the Amalgam. The second narrative is set on a small world known as the Splinter, and covers the attempts by its inhabitants to understand the environment within which their home exists. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Splinter orbits a collapsed star within its accretion disk and is subject to various dangers. The two stories come together in a complex twist which involves a kind of past/future first contact role reversal. Much of the narrative explores the effects of orbital dynamics around a high mass object and requires an understanding of Newtonian gravitation and at least a basic familiarity with general relativity and its application to black holes and neutron stars to be compelling. Understanding the story's wider frame of reference and the Splinter's encounter with the Wanderer are tied in with this. The Amalgam is explored in three other short stories, Glory, Riding the Crocodile, and Hot Rock.  Criticism  One review compared Incandescence to \\"a not particularly enthralling lecture on the process of scientific discovery, combined with the physics of a black hole\\". Another reviewer described much of this criticism as \\"trite received opinion\\" and said the book had \\"hints of greatness and pleasing moments\\" but its structure was \\"a failed literary experiment\\" and ultimately rather dull. On June 6, 2008, British writer Adam Roberts released a review criticizing Incandescence for its awkward prose and weak characterization. In response, Egan dissected the review, going so far as to call it \\"probably the first genuine hatchet job I've ever received.\\" In particular, he accuses Adam Roberts of malicious nitpicking and a straw man argument, and suggests that Roberts should have known he would be unfairly biased against the book and refused to review it:  Notes  * The names of the directions on the Splinter are derived from the Arabic for North (shemaal), South (janoob), East (sharq), and West (gharb) and from the Persian for hot (garm) and cold (sard).

Background In August 1901, the Boer leaders determined to send forces south into Natal and the Cape Colony hoping to cause an uprising in the Dutch-majority Cape Colony or at least to gain recruits for their armies. Accordingly, a commando under Botha moved southeast toward Natal while another commando under Jan Smuts raided south into the Cape Colony. British Intelligence detected the plan, but Botha evaded the British intercepting columns. The cold spring rains made the march especially difficult for the Boers' horses. On 14 September, Botha let his 1,000-man commando camp near Utrecht to permit the horses to recover. Meanwhile, Gough's 24th Mounted Infantry (MI) made a move by train from Kroonstad in the Orange Free State to Dundee in Natal. Gough received intelligence that Botha and 700 Boers were nearby.Pakenham, p. 562 Battle Gough led his MI from Dundee to De Jaeger's Drift, a ford on the Buffalo River. Dismissing the intelligence report as exaggerated, he led three companies on a reconnaissance across the river. Through his field glasses, he spotted 300 Boers who dismounted at a farm near Blood River Poort. Leaving his colleague Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. Stewart with 450 MI in the rear, Gough moved forward into a plain in the early afternoon, planning to surprise the Boers at the farm. Unknown to Gough, Botha was moving around his right flank with 700 men.Pakenham, p 563 Botha's mounted attack completely swamped Gough's outnumbered force. Lieutenant Llewellyn Price-Davies of the King's Royal Rifle Corps won the Victoria Cross for valiantly defending the field guns. Gough was captured, escaped, captured again and finally escaped on foot in the darkness. On the British side, four officers and 19 other ranks were killed or mortally wounded, 2 officers and 19 men wounded, and 6 officers and 235 men captured. According to Boer policy, the captured were stripped of their weapons and any useful gear, and most of their clothing, and were allowed to walk to the nearest British post. The Boers seized two field guns, 180 rifles and a large quantity of small arms ammunition. The 200 captured horses turned out to be in poor condition and of little use to the raiders. Boer losses were light. Aftermath Botha was unable to exploit his victory because he found all the crossings of the Buffalo River blocked by the British. The Boers moved to the southeast, hoping to find a place to cross into Natal. On the Zululand border, Botha attacked a British camp named Fort Itala, believing it to be weakly defended. Instead, the Boers received a bloody nose when 56 of their men were killed or wounded. When Botha realized that British forces were approaching in overwhelming strength, he turned back into the Transvaal, his raid a failure.Pakenham, p. 564 Sources Footnotes Battles of the Second Boer War Conflicts in 1901 1901 in the South African Republic September 1901 events ","title":"Battle of Blood River Poort"},{"id":"19099751","text":"Pierre de Milard (often referred to as Chevalier Milard, also spelled Chevalier Millard; 1736‚Äì1778) was a French Navy officer, who became a senior officer and noble in the Royal Burmese Armed Forces. He had a key role in supporting the Burmese military efforts against Siam and Qing China. He was lavishly rewarded for his efforts, and made the governor of Tabe. De Milard was very close to King Hsinbyushin. Suffering from a long illness in his last years, the Burmese king asked de Milard on a few occasions to sleep in the same room in order to guard against possible attempts on his life. Brief In 1756, Pierre de Milard was a member of a French navy force of two or three warships sent to Syriam to provide reinforcements and supplies to the forces of Hanthawaddy in the Konbaung‚ÄìHanthawaddy War.Findlay, p.277 The force was to join the French officer Sieur de Bruno who was helping defend the city of Syriam against a Konbaung attack. The Konbaung leader Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756 however.Coupland, p.82 The two French ships with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya, when Alaungpaya forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed and the sailors forced to join the Burmese armyCoupland, p.82 Chevalier Milard became Captain of the Guard for the Burmese king, and a baron in the Sagaing district. Chevalier Milard was among the soldiers who were forced into the Burmese army.Findlay, p.277 He was only 20 years old when he was captured. The incorporated French troops with their guns and muskets played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They became an elite corps, which was to play a role in the Burmese battles against the Siamese (attacks and capture of Ayutthaya from 1759 to 1767) and the Chinese (battles against the Chinese armies of the Qianlong Emperor from 1766 to 1769).Findlay, p.277Southeast Asia By Keat Gin Ooi, p.611 Ultimately Chevalier Milard was nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty.Findlay, p.277: \\"one of them, the Chevalier Milard, became Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty\\". Milard was involved in the reopening of contacts between the Burmese and the French as Burma was looking for supplies of weapons for its conflicts with the Siamese and the Manchu Chinese. Commercial contacts resumed in 1770 and Milard arranged the visit of the French envoy M. Feraud and the re-establishment of the French shipyard in Rangoon.Southeast Asia By Keat Gin Ooi, p.611 Milard was very close to the Burmese ruler Hsinbyushin and for some time slept in the same room as him in order to protect him against possible attacks linked to a succession dispute.Southeast Asia By Keat Gin Ooi, p.611 Chevalier Milard was also noted for his charitable activities towards schools and churches, thereby promoting Western education in Burma.Governance and Civil Society in Myanmar By Helen James, p.91 He died in 1778. He was buried near the village of Ngayabya in the Sagaing district.

They are predominantly found in the Eastern Province. These reserves were apparently the largest in the world until Venezuela announced they had increased their proven reserves to 297 Gbbl in January 2011.Venezuela: Oil reserves surpasses Saudi Arabia's at english.ahram.org.eg The Saudi reserves are about one-fifth of the world's total conventional oil reserves. A large fraction of these reserves comes from a small number of very large oil fields, and past production amounts to 40% of the stated reserves. In 2000, the US Geological Survey estimated that remaining undiscovered oil reserves in Saudi Arabia had a probability-weighted average of 90 Gbbl.US Geological Survey, Saudi Arabia, 2000. Production Saudi Arabia crude oil production 1950-2012 Saudi Arabia has traditionally been regarded as the world's most important swing producer of oil. When acting as such, the Saudi government would increase or decrease oil production to maintain a more stable price. Saudi Arabia produced (Mbbl/d) in 1980, 10.6 Mbbl/d in 2006, and in the region of 9.2 Mbbl/d in 2008. Saudi Arabia maintains the world's largest crude oil production capacity, estimated to be approx. 11 Mbbl/d at mid-year 2008 and announced plans to increase this capacity to 12.5 Mbbl/d by 2009 Cumulative production through the end of 2009 was 119.4 billion bbl. Using the stated number of 267 Gbbl, past production amounts to 40% of the stated remaining proved reserves. As of 2016, Saudi Arabia cumulative oil production reached 143.97 bbl. After the then U.S. president George W. Bush asked the Saudis to raise production on a visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2008 and they declined, Bush questioned whether they had the ability to raise production any more. In the summer of 2008, Saudi Arabia announced an increase in planned production of 500,000 barrels per day. However, in 2008, some experts believed that Saudi oil production had already peaked or would do so in the near future. In April 2015, the Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said that Saudi Arabia produced 12 million barrels per day in March that year, which was the highest figure based on records since the early 1980s. The previous peak was in August 2013 at 10.2 million barrels per day. Data quality Historically, at least since 1982, Saudi Arabia has maintained reserves data and related technical information as a well-guarded secret. This has made independent verification of the Kingdom's reserves and resources virtually impossible, leaving various commentators and the world at- large to rely upon speculation and indirect indicators. However, a recent (2019) independent evaluation‚Äîto facilitate Saudia Arabia's effort at an initial public offering (IPO) of stock in the national Saudi Aramco oil company‚Äîmay have changed that somewhat. The independent outside auditor reported that it had determined Saudi Arabia's proved oil reserves were at least 270 billion barrels, fairly consistent with Saudi claims.Rapier, Robert, \\"How Much Oil Does Saudi Arabia Really Have?\\" February 14, 2019, Forbes, retrieved May 27, 2020 In a 2004 study, Matthew Simmons analyzed 200 technical papers on Saudi reserves by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and concluded that Saudi Arabia's oil production faced near term decline, and that it would not be able to consistently produce more than 2004 levels, when production of crude oil and lease condensate averaged 9.10 million barrels per day. Simmons also argued that the Saudis may have irretrievably damaged their large oil fields by over-pumping salt water into the fields in an effort to maintain the fields' pressure and boost short-term oil extraction. He concluded (in 2004): \\"In 2-3 years we will have conclusive evidence that Saudi oil is peaking,\\" Since his prediction, Saudi crude oil production has varied from as low as 8.25 million barrels per day (average for 2009) up to 9.83 million barrels per day (average for 2012). Overall, in the nine years since his 2004 prediction (2005-2013), Saudi crude oil and lease condensate production has averaged 9.20 million barrels per day, just slightly higher than 2004 levels.US EIA, Crude Oil + Lease Condensate, International Energy Statistics, Petroleum Production. Diplomatic cables leaked during the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2011 revealed that Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, former vice president of Saudi Arabia's oil monopoly Saudi Aramco, warned the US that the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia might in fact be 40% (300 billion barrels) lower than claimed. These skeptical viewpoints have been countered by events culminating in early 2019. In a press conference in Riyadh Saudi Arabia on January 9, 2019, Saudi Arabia Energy Minister, Khalid Al-Falih, officially announced that DeGolyer and MacNaughton had completed the first ever independent evaluation of proved reserves for the Kingdom. The results of this effort indicate that the proved reserves in the Kingdom are likely proximal to, and even somewhat larger than, previous official estimates. H.E. Khalid Al-Falih outlined the extensive effort in his remarks, stating that the process began in August 2016 and continued for almost 2-1/2 years. DeGolyer and MacNaughton personnel (more than 60 geophysicists, petrophysicists, geologists, simulation engineers, reserves engineering specialists, and economists) built the detailed independent evaluation using the extensive raw database from each of the wells and reservoirs in the evaluated reservoirs, applying their own techniques and methodologies to reach the resulting independent estimate of proved reserves. Reaction in the press to the independent evaluation was notable. For example, Ellen Wald, global energy policy analyst, told CNBC that ‚ÄúWhether they have 260 or 266 billion barrels isn't really the issue,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe point is that they had DeGolyer and MacNaughton, which is a very respected source, do an audit‚Ä¶I think it's designed to put to rest the controversy that's always plagued them since the publication of ‚ÄòTwilight in the Desert‚Äô.‚Äù Comparison to Venezuela ::main topic: Oil reserves in Venezuela While Venezuela has reported \\"proven reserves\\" topping those reported by Saudi Arabia, industry analyst Robert Rapier has suggested that these numbers reflect variables driven by changes in crude oil market prices‚Äîindicating that the percentage of Venezuela's oil that qualifies as Venezuela's \\"proven\\" reserves may be driven up or down by the global market price for crude oil. According to Rapier, Venezuela's oil reserves are largely of \\"extra-heavy crude oil\\" which might \\"not be economical to produce\\" under certain market conditions. Rapier notes that the near-quadrupling of Venezuela's claimed \\"proven\\" reserves, between 2005 and 2014‚Äîfrom 80 Gbbl to 300 Gbbl‚Äîmay have been due to soaring crude oil prices that made Venezuela's normally uneconomical heavier crude suddenly market-viable to produce, and thus elevating it to within Venezuela's \\"proven\\" reserves. Consequently, Rapier contends, periods of lower crude oil market prices may remove those reserves from the \\"proven\\" category‚Äîplacing Venezuela's viable \\"proven reserves\\" well below Saudi Arabia's. By comparison, Rapier contends, the higher-quality crude generally associated with Saudi oil fields is cost-effective to produce under most market-price conditions, and thus is more consistently, and uniformly, part of Saudi Arabia's \\"proven\\" reserves, compared to the more variable usefulness of the Venezuelan oil.

Oil reserves in Canada were estimated at as of the start of 2015 . This figure includes the oil sands reserves that are estimated by government regulators to be economically producible at current prices using current technology. According to this figure, Canada's reserves are third only to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Over 95% of these reserves are in the oil sands deposits in the province of Alberta. Alberta contains nearly all of Canada's oil sands and much of its conventional oil reserves. The balance is concentrated in several other provinces and territories. Saskatchewan and offshore areas of Newfoundland in particular have substantial oil production and reserves. Alberta has 39% of Canada's remaining conventional oil reserves, offshore Newfoundland 28% and Saskatchewan 27%, but if oil sands are included, Alberta's share is over 98%. Status Canadian conventional oil production peaked in 1973, but oil sands production is forecast to increase to at least 2020 Canada has a highly sophisticated energy industry and is both an importer and exporter of oil and refined products. In 2006, in addition to producing , Canada imported , consumed itself, and exported to the U.S. The excess of exports over imports was . Over 99% of Canadian oil exports are sent to the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest supplier of oil. The decision of accounting of the Alberta oil sands deposits as proven reserves was made by the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), now known as the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (AEUB). Although now widely accepted, this addition was controversial at the time because oil sands contain an extremely heavy form of crude oil known as bitumen which will not flow toward a well under reservoir conditions. Instead, it must be mined, heated, or diluted with solvents to allow it to be produced, and must be upgraded to lighter oil to be usable by refineries. Historically known as bituminous sands or sometimes as \\"tar sands\\", the deposits were exposed as major rivers cut through the oil- bearing formations to reveal the bitumen in the river banks. In recent years technological breakthroughs have overcome the economical and technical difficulties of producing the oil sands, and by 2007 64% of Alberta's petroleum production of was from oil sands rather than conventional oil fields. The ERCB estimates that by 2017 oil sands production will make up 88% of Alberta's predicted oil production of . The fivefold increase in oil prices from 1998 to 2007 made Canadian oil sands production profitable. Analysts estimate that a price of $30 to $40 per barrel is required to make new oil sands production profitable. In recent years prices have greatly exceeded those levels and the Alberta government expects $116 billion worth of new oil sands projects to be undertaken between 2008 and 2017. However the biggest constraint on oil sands development is a serious labor and housing shortage in Alberta as a whole and the oil sands centre of Fort McMurray in particular. According to Statistics Canada, by September, 2006 unemployment rates in Alberta had fallen to record low levels and per-capita incomes had risen to double the Canadian average. Another hurdle has been Canada's capacity to rapidly increase its export pipelines. The National Energy Board indicated that exporters faced pipeline apportionment in 2007. However, surging crude oil prices sparked a jump in applications for oil pipelines in 2007, and new pipelines were planned to carry Canadian oil as far south as U.S. refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Up until 2010 Canada was the only major oil producer in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to have an increase in oil production in recent years. Production in the other major OECD producers (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Mexico) at that time have been declining, as was conventional oil production in Canada. Total crude oil production in Canada was projected to increase by an average of 8.6 percent per year from 2008 to 2011 as a result of new non-conventional oil projects.

The sources for this oil is primarily located in the Shiite Muslims-majority and Arab Sunni Muslims- dominated areas on the other hand are comparatively lacking. As a result of military occupation and civil unrest, the official statistics have not been revised since 2001 and are largely based on 2-D seismic data from three decades ago. International geologists and consultants have estimated that unexplored territory may contain vastly larger reserves. The majority of Iraq's proven reserves of oil comes from the following cities: Basra (Being #1), Baghdad (Being #2), Ramadi (Being #3), and finally, Ba'aj (Being the last oil rich city). A measure of the uncertainty about Iraq's oil reserves is indicated by widely differing estimates. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated in 2003 that Iraq had . The United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1995 estimated proven reserves were . Iraq's prewar deputy oil minister said that potential reserves might be . The source of the uncertainty is that due to decades of war and unrest, many of Iraq's oil wells are run down and unkept. Repairs to the wells and oil facilities should make far more oil available economically from the same deposits. Iraq may prove to contain the largest extractable deposits of oil in the entire Middle East once these upgrading and facility improvements have advanced. After more than a decade of sanctions and two Gulf Wars, Iraq's oil infrastructure needs modernization and investment. Despite a large reconstruction effort, the Iraqi oil industry has not been able to meet hydrocarbon production and export targets. The World Bank estimates that an additional $1 billion per year would need to be invested just to maintain current production. Long-term Iraq reconstruction costs could reach $100 billion or higher, of which more than a third will go to the oil, gas and electricity sectors. Another challenge to Iraq's development of the oil sector is that resources are not evenly divided across sectarian lines. Most known resources are in the Shiite areas of the south and the Kurdish areas of the north, with few resources in control of the Sunni population in the center. In 2006, Iraq's oil production averaged , down from around of production prior to the coalition invasion in 2003. Iraq's reserve to production ratio is 158 years. After the end of the invasion the production increased on a high level, even though there is an invasion from the so-called ISIL the production in March 2016 stood at 4.55 million barrels a day. Which seems to well become a new all-time peak year for Iraq if OPEC talks about freezing or reduce production held in April 2016 will not lead to a reduction. The old peak was 1979 with 171.6 million tons of oil compared to 136.9 million tons produced in 2011 and 152.4 million tons in 2012. Oil extraction contracts awarded 2009 On June 30 and December 11, 2009, the Iraqi Ministry of Oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields. The winning oil companies entered joint ventures with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts include extraction of oil for a fixed gain of $1.40 per barrel for the oil companies with the remainder going to Iraq. The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached. Oil fields contracted include the \\"super-giant\\" Majnoon Field, Halfaya Field, West Qurna Field and Rumaila Field. The East Baghdad Field, situated in part under Sadr City, did not receive any bids and the Iraqi oil ministry is considering working the field itself. Oil minister Hussein al-Shahristani told Iraqi public television that the increasing oil production \\"would finance infrastructure projects across Iraq - schools, roads, airports, housing, hospitals\\".

Amaldus Clarin Nielsen (23 May 1838 ‚Äì 10 December 1932) was a Norwegian painter. Early life He was born in Halse as a son of shipmaster and merchant Niels Clemetsen Nielsen (1795‚Äì1845) and his wife Andrea Marie M√∏ller (1802‚Äì1866). He grew up in Mandal in Vest-Agder county, Norway. He lived most of his childhood and adolescence without a father. He received some tuition from a traveling drawing teacher and traveled to Copenhagen to study in 1854. Career After one year of painting studies in Copenhagen, he enrolled at the Academy of Art in 1855. He failed to progress in the academy's system, but with financial support from his brother and business owner Diderik Cappelen (1856‚Äì1935), he studied under Hans Gude at the D√ºsseldorf Academy from 1857 to 1859. He spent the years 1859 to 1863 travelling over Western and Southern Norway, and spent 1863 to 1864 in D√ºsseldorf again. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. He then travelled home due to illness, moved to Christiania where he sealed a deal to make paintings that the Christiania Kunstforening would sell at auctions, securing a steady income. He spent the years 1867 to 1868 in Karlsruhe before finally settling at Majorstuen in 1869. He painted in the naturalist style, and has been called \\"Norway's first naturalist painter\\". Important paintings include Hval√∏rhei (1874), Skovbillede (1896), Morgen ved Ny-Hellesund (1885, one of several from Ny-Hellesund), Ensomt sted (1901), Fra Bankefjorden (1910) and Kveld p√• J√¶ren (1925) Most of his paintings portrayed Western and Southern Norway, but also √òstfold. He participated almost annually in the Autumn Exhibit between 1883 and 1911, and held notable exhibitions in Christiania Kunstforening (1895, 1906, 1924, 1931), at the 1862 International Exhibition, the Exposition Universelle of 1889 and in Munich in 1913. Eleven of his works are owned by the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design. He is also represented in Mandal Kunstforening and Mandal Bymuseum, but is perhaps best known for the collection of about 300 works which was donated to Oslo municipality by Nielsen's heirs in 1933. Since 1994 this collection is on permanent exhibit in the Stenersen Museum. Nielsen was also decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1890. The square Amaldus Nielsens plass, which includes a bust of Nielsen, was named after him. Personal life In October 1868 in Christiania he married Johanne Nicoline Augusta Vangensteen, born 1845 as a daughter of district stipendiary magistrate Ove Bodvar Hussein Vangensteen (1806‚Äì1859). The couple had eleven children. Both his wife and three children died in March 1886 from a diphtheria epidemic. After a period of grief, he married Laura Tandberg (1857‚Äì1928) in February 1888 in Ris√∏r. Nielsen died in December 1932, aged 94, from pneumonia.

It is used for controlling synchrotrons, lasers, physics experiments in over 20 sites. It is being actively developed by a consortium of research institutes. TANGO is a distributed control system. It runs on a single machine as well as hundreds of machines. TANGO uses two network protocols - the omniorb implementation of CORBA and Zeromq. The basic communication model is the client-server model. Communication between clients and servers can be synchronous, asynchronous or event driven. CORBA is used for synchronous and asynchronous communication and Zeromq is used for event-driven communication (since version 8 of TANGO). TANGO is based on the concept of Devices. Devices implement object oriented and service oriented approaches to software architecture. The Device model in TANGO implements commands/methods, attributes / data fields and properties for configuring Devices. In TANGO all control objects are Devices. Device Servers All solutions in TANGO can be reduced to 3 processes TANGO uses hierarchies of devices to manage complexity simply TANGO is a software for building control systems which need to provide network access to hardware. Hardware can range from single bits of digital input/output up to sophisticated detector systems or entire plant control systems (SCADAs). Hardware access is managed in a process called a Device Server. The Device Server contains Devices belonging to different Device Classes which implement the hardware access. At Device Server startup time Devices (instances of Device Classes) are created which then represent logical instances of hardware in the control system. Clients \\"import\\" the Devices via a database and send requests to the devices using TANGO. Devices can store configuration and setup values in a Mysql database permanently. Hundreds of Device Classes have been written by the community. A list of device classes on SourceForge can be found here . Many more exist and can be obtained by contacting the TANGO community via the mailing list. TANGO manages complexity using hierarchies.

Citibank, 517 U.S. 735 (1996), is a U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a regulation of the Comptroller of Currency which included credit card late fees and other penalties within the definition of interest and thus prevented individual states from limiting them when charged by nationally- chartered banks. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a unanimous court that the regulation was reasonable enough under the Court's own Chevron standard for the justices to defer to the Comptroller. The decision, which had begun as a class action in California, was seen as a victory for banks and credit-card issuers, who could mostly charge late fees as they pleased. For that same reason consumer advocates were displeased, warning that late fees could rise to previously unseen levels. They did, and one of the Citibank attorneys has expressed regret for his involvement. The case Background In its 1978 Marquette Bank decision, the court had unanimously held that the National Banking Act of 1863, which created nationally-chartered banks in addition to the state ones that had previously existed, barred states from enforcing their anti-usury laws, which set caps on interest rates, against any national bank based in another state. In 1980, Citibank took advantage of that decision and moved its money-losing credit-card operations to South Dakota, after persuading that state's legislature and governor to repeal its anti-usury law. Other states and banks followed the example, and by 1990 the number of credit cards in circulation had doubled, while the average household's revolving balance increased more than fivefold. At the time late fees were bringing in $2 billion annually to the industry. The increased use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not without creating some backlash. Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to gouge extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus not subject to the laws of those states as long as they were headquartered elsewhere. Litigation and regulation Activist lawyers were challenging this notion in lawsuits across the country, mostly in state courts, with different degrees of success at different levels. In Pennsylvania, Michael Donovan, Michael Malakoff and Ann Miller had filed one of their own, with the intent of taking it to the Supreme Court and forcing a resolution of the issue. Barbara Smiley was a California woman who had filed a class action against Citibank's South Dakota subsidiary in her state's courts in 1992 alleging that the $15 late fee she was charged for her Citibank Classic card violated California law. After reading about the Pennsylvania lawyers in Business Week, she had contacted them to represent her. Citibank responded to Smiley's original filing with a motion to dismiss on the grounds that late fees were interest covered by the National Banking Act. California's Superior Court in Los Angeles County denied the motion, but after Citibank appealed that denial, the Second District of the California Courts of Appeal ordered the lower court to either grant the motion or explain why it wasn't.Smiley v. Citibank, 26 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562 (1994). The Superior Court granted the motion and dismissed the case, a decision upheld on appeal. On March 3, 1995, after the Superior Court had dismissed the complaint, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), the official charged by the National Banking Act with regulating national banks, issued a proposed regulation defining \\"interest\\" under the Act as including \\"any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor ... [for] any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended.\\" It specifically included late fees, among many others that had been criticized as unfair and misleading to consumers.60 Fed. Reg. 11924, 11940. It was formally adopted a year later. Later in 1995, the California Supreme Court agreed to review Smiley's case, and did so. It affirmed the lower courts, but with two justices dissenting.Smiley v. Citibank, 11 Cal. 4th 138, 900 P. 2d 690 (1995) Since New Jersey's Supreme Court had reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case,Sherman v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 143 N. J. 35, 668 A. 2d 1036 (1995). the Supreme Court granted Smiley's certiorari petition. Before the Court Donovan argued Smiley's case before the justices. Late fees, he said, were not interest whatever the Comptroller's regulation said since they were fixed amounts and did not vary based on the money owed or schedule of payments. He also pointed to two previous documents from OCC suggesting that, in the past, it did not consider penalty fees of any kind to be interest. For more than a hundred years, he noted, OCC had not seen fit to define specifically what kind of payments were considered interest. Yet, coincidentally, only when a case turning on that issue appeared headed to the Supreme Court did it see a need to do so. He claimed that it was not entitled to the deference the Court accorded agencies of the executive branch. It was not, he said, a reasonable interpretation of the National Banking Act and thus, per the rule it had established in the 1984 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. case, the Court should review it afresh and rule on whether it was the best interpretation of the statute. Richard Kendall of the Los Angeles firm Shearman & Sterling argued the case for Citibank. He was joined by Irving Gornstein on behalf of the government as amicus curiae. Both argued for the Court to defer to the Comptroller's statutory interpretation. Decision Two months after oral argument, the Court ruled unanimously in Citibank's favor. Antonin Scalia wrote for the Court. The cases from New Jersey and California, he uncharacteristically agreed, made it \\"difficult indeed to contend that the word 'interest' in the National Bank Act is unambiguous with regard to the point at issue here.\\"Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 739, Scalia, J. Nevertheless, he rejected all of Donovan's arguments. The Court did not find the timing of the regulation to be fatal. \\"[N]either antiquity nor contemporaneity with the statute is a condition of validity.\\" It was \\"irrelevant\\" that it was issued in advance of a case to be heard by the Supreme Court.Supra., 740, 741. He also found the regulation to be rational. \\"It seems to us perfectly possible to draw a line, as the regulation does, between [penalties] and ... all other payments.\\"Supra., 741. Nor did he find the prior documents in which representatives of the Comptroller's office had said that they did not consider late fees could be considered as interest payments adequately controlling since they did not fully represent an official agency position. \\"What these statements show, if anything, is that there was good reason for the Comptroller to promulgate the new regulation, in order to eliminate uncertainty and confusion.\\"Supra., 743. After dealing with another issue Donovan raised, that the regulation was not entitled to deference because it pre-empted state laws, by saying two issues had been confused and thus that question was moot, Scalia said \\"[T]he question before us is not whether it represents the best interpretation of the statute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. The answer is obviously yes.\\"Supra. 744, 745. Legal dictionaries of the late 19th century, as well as the Court's own jurisprudence of that era, did not define interest so narrowly, and indeed such flat fees were often intended to evade state anti-usury laws, as state courts of that era had ruled. Finally, he rejected an argument that penalties were inherently separate from interest by suggesting the petitioner had misread the case they were relying on and citing cases he considered more appropriate. The section of the National Banking Act at issue, he noted, did not distinguish between interest and penalties.Supra., 746, 747. Reaction Lawyers and lobbyists for the credit-card industry, who had feared costly litigation and a myriad of state laws if the Court ruled against OCC, praised the decision. \\"It's a big victory for the 97 percent or so of cardholders who pay their bills on time,\\" said a Citibank spokeswoman. \\"There's no reason why those of us who pay on time should subsidize those who do not\\", said Kendall. That's not equity.\\" On the other side, Donovan described the result as \\"an unfortunate interpretation ... that will allow small states to override the longstanding consumer protection laws of more heavily populated ... states.\\" His co-counsel Ann Miller called the decision \\"incorrect and shortsighted ... I don't think that the answer the U.S. Supreme Court came up with is going to be the long-term resolution of the problems posed by old laws trying to deal with new and very changed banking practices.\\" Donovan was especially critical of the role played by the OCC. \\"We got tackled by a player standing on the sideline as we were sprinting toward the goal line\\". However, it did show him that he'd underestimated the role played by a regulatory body that, as Chief Justice Rehnquist had said during oral argument, had never come before the Court with a regulation that wasn't favorable to the banking industry. \\"We should have focused more on the appropriateness of an executive agency defining what Congress meant by a law as opposed to a court defining what Congress meant by a law.\\" Aftermath Duncan McDonald, formerly general counsel for Citibank's credit-card division, said he and others had merely hoped to have the freedom to set the fees at the $15 they had calculated as a fair market rate, but afterwards some cards late fees went as high as $39. \\"I certainly didn't imagine that someday we might've ended up creating Frankenstein,\\" he told PBS's Frontline a decade later. \\"Millions and millions of people are being excessively charged late fees and bad-check fees and over- the-limit fees and then these 25 percent APRs to make the profits for the industry, so that they can keep the rates lower for people who are rate sensitive, who can in fact shop the system.\\" On May 22, 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit CARD Act) was signed into law.

Kazimierz Cichowski Cichowski joined the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania in 1907. In 1907-09 he studied at the University of Liege and in 1910-13 Sorbonne University. During the Russian Revolution, he joined the Bolshevik party and from November 1917 he was the deputy Commissar for Polish affairs of the Central Executive Committee of the Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (LitBel), where he soon advanced to more prominent positions (Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets). Following the Bolshevik Coup, in December 1917 Cichowski became a deputy People's Commissar of Nationalities for Polish affairs within the Russian Sovnarkom. (Note: Commissariat of Nationalities was led by Joseph Stalin.) In September 1918 he became a member of the Central Committee of Communist Party of Lithuania. In 1919 Cichowski was a member of the Lithuanian Provisional Revkom led by Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas. Cichowski also was a chairman of the Vilnius City council and a teacher at the Vilnius Communist School. From 27 February 1919 to 31 July 1920 Cichowski served as a chairman of Central Executive Committee of the Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During that time he also was a member of the Central Committee of Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Lithuania and Belorussia, People's Commissar of Agriculture (May‚ÄìJuly), and member of Defense Council of LitBel.

After the end of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War in 1920 (see, Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty), which saw the dissolution of LitBel, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, operating in the Second Polish Republic. In 1923 Cichowski was imprisoned by the Polish authorities to three years; after early release, in 1925 he joined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Poland, becoming a member of its secretariat and the Political Bureau and in 1927‚Äì29 he was a secretary of communist faction in the Polish Sejm. In 1929 Cichowski was arrested again and in 1930 convicted to 8 years in jail. In 1932 he was exchanged. In September 1932, he returned to the Soviet Union where he began working in the Comintern (ECCI) at its executive committee human resources. During the Spanish Civil War around January‚ÄìJuly 1937, he was in Spain where he was head of the Cadres Department of the International Brigades headquarters. In August 1937, Cichowski was recalled to Moscow, arrested in October or 21 August during the Great Purge, convicted and shot.

Freeman and Pete Wells became close friends and she has said that there is something about his playing that inspires her to this day. They started writing together and were in a few bands together, including Medusa and the Malady. They felt that after playing quite a few local shows in San Diego that it was time to move forward and see what they could do musically on a new level and that is when they embarked on the project that is now Benedictum. With some help from Craig they were introduced to Jeff Pilson and things really started to turn around from there. Freeman got married in 2007.

Venezuela's crude oil is very heavy by international standards, and as a result much of it must be processed by specialized domestic and international refineries.  History  Venezuela's development of its oil reserves has been affected by political unrest. In late 2002, nearly half of the workers at the state oil company PDVSA went on strike, after which the company fired 18,000 of them, draining the company of technical knowledge and expertise.

The energy and oil ministry said it had certified an additional of proven reserves in the country's Faja del Orinoco region. In February 2008, Venezuelan proven oil reserves were . By 2009, Venezuela reported of conventional oil reserves, the largest of any country in South America.OPEC data at opec.org When 2015 ended, Venezuela's confirmed oil reserves were estimated to be around 300.9 billion barrels in total. In 2008, it had net oil exports of to the United States.EIA data at tonto.eia.doe.gov As a result of the lack of transparency in the country's accounting, Venezuela's true level of oil production is difficult to determine, but OPEC analysts estimate that it produced around of oil in 2009, which would give it 234 years of remaining production at current rates. In 2010 Venezuela reportedly produced 3.1 millions barrels of oil daily and exporting 2.4 million of those barrels per day. Such oils exports brought in $61 billion for Venezuela. However, Venezuela only owned about $10.5 billion in foreign reserves, meaning that its debt remained at $7.2 billion when 2015 rang out.

Venezuela's oil exports were \\"expected to net about $2.3 billion\\" by the end of 2020, whereas a decade earlier the country had been \\"the largest producer in Latin America, earning about $90 billion a year\\" from these exports. A New York Times article noted that, in October 2020, \\"for the first time in a century, there are no rigs searching for oil in Venezuela.\\"  Orinoco Belt  Orinoco Belt assessment unit, USGS In addition to conventional oil, Venezuela has oil sands deposits similar in size to those of Canada, and approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. Venezuela's Orinoco tar sands are less viscous than Canada's Athabasca oil sands ‚Äì meaning they can be produced by more conventional means ‚Äì but they are buried too deep to be extracted by surface mining. Estimates of the recoverable reserves of the Orinoco Belt range from to . In 2009, the USGS updated this value to . According to the USGS, the Orinoco Belt alone is estimated to contain 900‚Äì of heavy crude in proven and unproven deposits. Of this, the USGS estimated that 380‚Äì could be technically recoverable, which would make Venezuela's total recoverable reserves (proven and unproven) among the largest in the world.Venezuela oil 'may double Saudi Arabia' BBC The technology needed to recover ultra-heavy crude oil, such as in most of the Orinoco Belt, may be much more complex and expensive than that of Saudi Arabia's light oil industry.Venezuela: Oil reserves surpasses Saudi Arabia's at english.ahram.org.eg The USGS did not make any attempt to determine how much oil in the Orinoco Belt is economically recoverable. Unless the price of crude rises, it is likely that the proven reserves will have to be adjusted downward. History of Venezuela's claimed reserves (red) in comparison to those of Saudi Arabia (blue) Comparison to Saudi Arabia : main topic: Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia In early 2011, then- president Hugo Ch√°vez and the Venezuelan government announced that the nation's oil reserves had surpassed that of the previous long-term world leader, Saudi Arabia. OPEC said that Saudi Arabia's reserves stood at in 2009.Venezuela Says Oil Reserves Surpass Saudi Arabia's Reuters at CNBC. While Venezuela has reported \\"proven reserves\\" topping those reported by Saudi Arabia, industry analyst Robert Rapier has suggested that these numbers reflect variables driven by changes in crude oil market prices‚Äîindicating that the percentage of Venezuela's oil that qualifies as Venezuela's \\"proven\\" reserves may be driven up or down by the global market price for crude oil.Rapier, Robert, \\"How Much Oil Does Saudi Arabia Really Have?\\" February 14, 2019, Forbes, retrieved May 27, 2020 According to Rapier, Venezuela's oil reserves are largely of \\"extra-heavy crude oil\\" which might \\"not be economical to produce\\" under certain market conditions. (Reuters columnst John Kemp reports that Venezuela's \\"very dense crudes... are complicated to process,\\" and are priced at a \\"large discount,\\" when compared to the crudes of other producers.Kemp, John, \\"Column: Venezuela sanctions leave oil market short of heavy crude - Kemp,\\" February 12, 2019, Reuters News Service, retrieved May 27, 2020.) Rapier notes that the near-quadrupling of Venezuela's claimed \\"proven\\" reserves, between 2005 and 2014‚Äîfrom 80 Gbbl to 300 Gbbl‚Äîmay have been due to soaring crude oil prices that made Venezuela's normally uneconomical heavier crude suddenly market-viable to produce, and thus elevating it to within Venezuela's \\"proven\\" reserves. Consequently, Rapier contends, periods of lower crude oil market prices may remove those reserves from the \\"proven\\" category‚Äîplacing Venezuela's viable \\"proven reserves\\" well below Saudi Arabia's. By comparison, Rapier contends, the lighter crude generally associated with Saudi oil fields is cost-effective to produce under most market-price conditions, and thus is more consistently, and uniformly, part of Saudi Arabia's \\"proven\\" reserves, compared to the more variable usefulness of the Venezuelan oil.

As of April 2013, US crude production was at a more than 20-year high, since the shale gas and tight oil boom; production was near 7.2 million barrels per day. Experts think that the USA could pass Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer. Peak production was 10,044 barrels per day in November 1970. A second, but lower peak of 9,627 barrels per day was achieved in April 2015.U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil The reserves-to-production ratio (R/P) equaled 11.26 years in 2007.

Consumption and imports The US consumption of petroleum products peaked in 2005; by 2012, consumption had declined 11% from the peak.US Energy Information Administration, Petroleum consumption. Net imports of oil and products account for nearly half of the US trade deficit. Because of declining production and increasing demand, net US imports of oil and petroleum products increased from in 1970 to in 2007, before declining. Its largest net suppliers of petroleum products in 2007 were Canada and Mexico, which supplied , respectively. As of 2011, the US consumed 18.8 million barrels of petroleum products per day, and imported a net 8.4 million barrels per day; the EIA reported the United States \\"Dependence on Net Petroleum Imports\\" in 2011 as 45%. During 2008-2009 the USA became a net exporter of refined oil products; before the US bought gasoline, diesel and kerosene in Europe, and smaller amounts from other countries. Strategic Petroleum Reserve The United States maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve at four sites on the Gulf of Mexico, with a total capacity of of crude oil. The maximum total withdrawal capability from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve is per day. This is roughly 32% of US oil imports, or 75% of imports from OPEC.

A map of world oil reserves according to U.S. EIA, 2017 Services under the U.S. Department of the Interior estimate the total volume of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in the United States to be roughly . Over 1 million exploratory and developmental crude oil wells have already been drilled in the US since 1949. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil onshore in United States to be The last comprehensive National Assessment was completed in 1995. Since 2000 the USGS has been re-assessing basins of the U.S. that are considered to be priorities for oil and gas resources. Since 2000, the USGS has re-assessed 22 priority basins, and has plans to re-assess 10 more basins. These 32 basins represent about 97% of the discovered and undiscovered oil and gas resources of the United States. The three areas considered to hold the most oil are the coastal plain (1002) area of ANWR, the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, and the Bakken Formation. Offshore The Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) contains between of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil, with a mean estimate of . The Gulf of Mexico OCS ranks first with a mean estimate of , followed by Alaska OCS with . At $80/bbl crude prices, the MMS estimates that are economically recoverable. As of 2008, a total of about of the OCS are off-limits to leasing and development. The moratoria and presidential withdrawal cover about 85 percent of OCS area offshore the lower 48 states. The MMS estimates that the resources in OCS areas currently off limits to leasing and development total (mean estimate). Arctic In 1998, the USGS estimated that the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge contains a total of between 5.7 and of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil, with a mean estimate of , of which falls within the Federal portion of the ANWR 1002 Area. In May 2008 the EIA used this assessment to estimate the potential cumulative production of the 1002 area of ANWR to be a maximum of from 2018 to 2030. This estimate is a best case scenario of technically recoverable oil during the area's primary production years if legislation were passed in 2008 to allow drilling. A 2002 assessment concluded that the National Petroleum Reserve‚ÄìAlaska contains between 6.7 and of oil, with a mean (expected) value of . The quantity of undiscovered oil beneath Federal lands (excluding State and Native areas) is estimated to range between 5.9 and 13.2 BBO, with a mean value of 9.3 BBO. Most oil accumulations are expected to be of moderate size, on the order of 30 to each. Large accumulations like the Prudhoe Bay oil field (whose ultimate recovery is approximately ), are not expected to occur. The volumes of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil estimated for NPRA are similar to the volumes estimated for ANWR. However, because of differences in accumulation sizes (the ANWR study area is estimated to contain more accumulations in larger size classes) and differences in assessment area (the NPRA study area is more than 12 times larger than the ANWR study area), economically recoverable resources are different at low oil prices. But at market prices above $40 per barrel, estimates of economically recoverable oil for NPRA are similar to ANWR. Tight oil In April 2008, the USGS released a report giving a new resource assessment of the Bakken Formation underlying portions of Montana and North Dakota. The USGS believes that with new horizontal drilling technology there is somewhere between of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in this formation that was initially discovered in 1951. If accurate, this reassessment would make it the largest \\"continuous\\" oil accumulation (The USGS uses \\"continuous\\" to describe accumulations requiring extensive artificial fracturing to allow the oil to flow to the borehole) ever discovered in the U.S. The formation is estimated to contain significantly more‚Äîfigures in excess of have been reported‚Äîbut it is yet uncertain how much of this oil is recoverable using current technology. In 2011, Harold Hamm claimed that the recoverable share may reach ; this would mean that Bakken contains more extractable petroleum than all other known oil fields in the country, combined. Unconventional prospective resources Oil shale The United States has the largest known deposits of oil shale in the world, according to the Bureau of Land Management and holds an estimated of potentially recoverable oil. Oil shale does not actually contain oil, but a waxy oil precursor known as kerogen. There is significant commercial production of oil from oil shale in the United States. Oil sands There are significant volumes of heavy oil in the oil sands of northeast Utah. There has yet to be any significant production from these deposits.

The US Energy Information Administration estimated Mexican proved reserves to be as of 2013.US Energy Information Administration, International energy statistics, (proved reserves as of 2013). Production Mexico was the seventh-largest oil producer in the world as of 2006, producing of petroleum products, of which was crude oil. Mexican oil production has started to decline rapidly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration had estimated that Mexican production of petroleum products would decline to in 2007 and in 2008. Mexican crude oil production fell in 2007, and was below by the start of 2008. In mid-2008, Pemex said that it would try to keep crude oil production above for the rest of the year. Mexican authorities expected the decline to continue in future, and were pessimistic that it could be raised back to previous levels even with foreign investment. The constitution of Mexico gives the state oil company, Pemex, exclusive rights over oil production, and the Mexican government treats Pemex as a major source of revenue. As a result, Pemex has insufficient capital to develop new and more expensive resources on its own, and cannot take on foreign partners to supply money and technology it lacks. To address some of these problems, in September 2007, Mexico‚Äôs Congress approved reforms including a reduction in the taxes levied on Pemex. Most of Mexico's production decline involves one enormous oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. From 1979 to 2007, Mexico produced most of its oil from the supergiant Cantarell Field, which used to be the second-biggest oil field in the world by production. Because of falling production, in 1997 Pemex started a massive nitrogen injection project to maintain oil flow, which now consumes half the nitrogen produced in the world. As a result of nitrogen injection, production at Cantarell rose from in 1996 to a peak of in 2004. However, during 2006 Cantarell's output fell 25% from in January to in December, with the decline continuing through 2007. In mid-2008, Pemex announced that it would try to end the year with Cantarell producing at least . However, in January 2008, Pemex said that the oil production rate at Cantarell had fallen to by December 2008, a decline of 36 percent from a year earlier. This resulted in a decline of total Mexican oil production declining by 9.2 percent from in 2007 to in 2008, the lowest rate of oil production since 1995. As for its other fields, 40% of Mexico's remaining reserves are in the Chicontepec Field, which was found in 1926. The field has remained undeveloped because the oil is trapped in impermeable rock, requiring advanced technology and very large numbers of oil wells to extract it. The remainder of Mexico's fields are smaller, more expensive to develop, and contain heavy oil and trades at a significant discount to light and medium oil, which is easier to refine. In 2002 Pemex began developing an oil field called \\"Proyecto Ku-Maloob-Zaap\\", located 105 kilometers from Ciudad del Carmen. It is estimated that by 2011 the field will produce nearly . However, this level of production will be achieved by using a nitrogen injection scheme similar to that of Cantarell. That same year, Pemex decreased its reserve estimate by 53%, from . Later the estimate was increased to . In June 2007, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that declining oil production in Mexico could cause a major fiscal crisis there, and that Mexico needed to increase investment in its energy sector to prevent it. Future resources In February 2009, DeGolyer and MacNaughton estimated that the Chicontepec Field had 139 billion barrels of oil in place, but that there was as yet no technical way to recover it. Some government officials were unhappy with the results at Chicontepec, expressing concern that costs were higher and oil production lower than expected. Mexico had spent $3.4 billion on the field, but it was producing only by June, 2009 and increased only slightly to in the 3rd quarter 2010, causing them to question whether more investment in the field was justified. The 2013 Energy Reform has introduced private investment by international energy companies in exploration efforts in Mexico. Italian company Eni announced in July 2017 that a new well in its Amoca Field exploration project put the field's resources at 1 billion barrels. The company plans to begin production from the field in 2019 at a rate of 30,000 to 50,000 barrels per day. Also in July 2017, Premier Oil, Talos Energy, and Sierra Oil & Gas announced that exploratory drilling in the Zama-1 field, located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, had uncovered a formation with between 1.4 billion and two billion barrels of light crude oil. Because not all oil present is such a formation is technically recovered, it is believed that the formation could yield about 425 million barrels.

Military art includes the study and application of the principles of warfare and laws of war that apply equally to the closely interrelated military strategy, operational art and tactics. Exercise of military art is highly dependent on the economics and logistics supporting the armed forces, their military technology and equipment, and reflects the social influences on the military organisation exercising military art. Often misunderstood due to its 19th-century perception as generally \\"including the entire subject of war\\",p.37, Halleck it is primarily, as the term implies, the expression of creative thinking on the part of the decision-makers in employing their forces,p.140, De La Barre Duparcq with the map of the area of operations as a veritable canvas, and the movement of forces commonly marked on the map with arrows, as brush strokes. Less imaginatively it was defined in France during the 19th century as > The art of war is the art of concentrating and employing, at the opportune > moment, a superior force of troops upon the decisive point.p.7, De La Barre > Duparcq and > The art of divining the intention of the enemy from slight indications is > one which rarely misleads, and is one of the most precious attributes of > military genius.p.294, De La Barre Duparcq It is not well known that many of the greatest military leaders in Europe and Asia, notably Japan, were themselves either accomplished artists, or collectors of art. History In history, schools of thinking about military art can be divided during the ancient and medieval periods by the influence of infantry troops on tactics in Europe, and cavalry on tactics in Asia, and the period commencing with the Early Modern period when firearms and artillery increasingly influenced employment of forces. The need for mobility, opportunity and decisiveness have tended to associate military art with offensive manoeuvre, cavalry, and therefore, before advent of late-19th century firearms, Asia.p.97, De La Barre Duparcq In Europe military art was primarily concerned with time of combat, understanding the best way an occupied position can enhance defensive potential of a small field army largely consisting of relatively low mobility troops, by often using high ground, terrain choke points or field entrenchments. Due to relative lack of economic and logistic support, European military art theorists advocated decisive battles that could bring a military campaign to a quick conclusion, thus reducing the economic cost of war, notably through the shock tactics of the armoured cavalry. In Asia, due to a more developed and widespread horse breeding offering enhanced mobility, military art developed a more offensive- based way of thinking about military tactics, and military art was dominated by considerations of choosing point of attack and military communications. The confrontation between these two forms of military art that took place as a result of the Crusades and the Mongol invasion of Europe, and the contemporaneous introduction of artillery into warfare significantly changed thinking about military art in Europe, leading to wide-ranging experiments in tactical formation of troops, use of combined arms and exercise of maneuver warfare concepts and methods not only in tactics, but on a larger scale, including in use of naval forces. This later led to creation of European colonial empires. Although European military art on land can be argued not to have reached its developed stage until the 19th century in the attempt to defeat linear tactics that led to the First World War,p. 115, Halleck and ultimate sophistication during the Second World War and the Cold War, great increases in the firepower of the European firearms and artillery were usually able to negate greater number and mobility of the Asian field forces, no-where more illustrated than during the French Invasion of Egypt in 1798. The defining application of firepower and manoeuvre in military art became expressed during the conduct of strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II that sought to combine the shock of armoured warfare with mobility, and the traditional reliance on infantry in strengthened positions to first stop the German advances and during counter-attacks to achieve breakthrough of the enemy position, and in conducting deep operations to destroy the logistic support, literally starving German troops of supplies and ammunition, and forcing them to surrender. Military art in naval warfare likewise developed along the considerations of position versus speed, initially through use of galleys and later during the Age of Sail. However, increasingly naval tactics became dominated by the relative firepower of individual vessels, and this was demonstrated during the epic Battle of Trafalgar. The use of naval forces in military art significantly expanded the scale of conflicts to global ranges. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries naval military art became concerned primarily with the firepower and the ability of ships to withstand it through use of increasing their armour until the introduction of naval aviation into consideration of naval battles and naval strategy. Introduction of aircraft into warfare drastically altered the 19th century understanding of military art, and application of its principles. Aerial warfare became the ultimate solution to manoeuvre in delivery of firepower, and drastically increased the tempo of conflicts, making blitzkrieg possible during the Second World War. Aerial warfare also finally negated the advantage of a defensive position which left the defender as an easily detected and attacked target for the bombers. While German industrial centres became just such targets for the Allied strategic bombing during World War II, on the Eastern Front the Soviet Red Army chose to adapt by developing concepts and methods suggested by theorists during the interwar period to a more offensive-based and dynamic conduct of operations coordinating ground and air offensives. The final development in military art came with the increased influence of the electronics and its implications for the ability by infantry to halt the breakthroughs using increasingly powerful infantry support weapons, and the effect on the military communications by a new form of combat, electronic warfare. The potential of losing ability to exercise command and control over forces, particularly strategically significant forces, completely undermined much of the theoretical thinking of the Cold War. Some have argued that this was one of the factors, along with those of economic considerations, that eventually led to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, and Dissolution of the USSR. Since the end of the Cold War in Europe, application of military art has been sought primarily by conventional forces in combat operations against unconventional opponents, and this has many attempts to review military history in the effort to find solutions to successful conduct of operations against these forces.

Career Born in South Australia's second-most-populous city, Mount Gambier, Morris, a left footer, spent most of his time either on the Wing or as a half- forward flanker. He played the game aggressively and was always hard on the ball. As a result he was particularly injury prone and over the course of his career suffered many injuries including broken legs, a broken jaw and broken wrist. In 1983 he was a member of West's premiership side which defeated Sturt in the Grand Final, having to overcome a hamstring injury to be passed fit to play. To do this Morris spent a lot of grand final week at the Morphettville Racecourse stables using machines used on horses in a successful bid to play. Wests coach Neil Kerley showed faith in Morris who didn't let his coach or team mates down and was one of the team's best players on the day. Kerley finally took Morris off the ground midway through the final quarter when The Bloods had the game well in hand. He took part in the 1979 State of Origin Carnival in Perth, the first ever National Carnival held under State of Origin rules, and was selected to the All-Australian team. Early in 1985, prior to the beginning of the season, Morris was involved in a motor boat accident which left him with serious burns. He returned late in the 1985 season and made a handful of appearances off the bench that year and in 1986 but never fully recovered enough to fully resurrect his SANFL career. After leaving West Adelaide, Morris played briefly in the Northern Territory with the Wanderers Football Club. Coaching Geoff Morris served as West Adelaide's head coach in 1994 and 1995, taking the club to 8th and 5th in his two seasons in charge. Following his stint back at Westies Morris became an assistant coach with Port Adelaide in the Australian Football League.

At Oxford, he earned his blue in 1876. The following year he helped the university football team to reach the final of the FA Cup. Three weeks prior to the Cup Final he was one of seven debutants in the England team to play Scotland at the Kennington Oval on 3 March 1877. According to Philip Gibbons, in the 1870s the England side \\"tended to be chosen on availability rather than skill alone\\" The change in the England line-up made little difference to England's performance against the Scots who won the game 3‚Äì1, with England's consolation goal coming from Alfred Lyttelton; the Scots thus inflicted England's first international defeat on home soil in the sixth appearance between the two countries.

Elizabeth was fortunate that Thomas' attainder stipulated that she would not lose her own inheritance. On 3 October 1485, she wrote to John Paston, who was married to her cousin. The letter, which she had written from the Isle of Sheppey, mentioned how she had wished to send her children to Thorpe, pointing out that Paston had pledged to send her horses as a means of transporting them there.

It is located at the northern end of the eastern perimeter of Aitutaki Lagoon to the north and then west of the northernmost true reef island, Akitua, from which is separated by a channel 50 metres wide and less than two metres deep. The southernmost point of the peninsula is called Aumoana. The northernmost point of the peninsula, Teaumera, is also the northernmost point of Aitutaki as a whole. In the northeast is Kopu a Ruatapu, a boat passage through the fringing coral reef. The peninsula is 3.25 km long north-south, and has an area of 1.75 km2. It is 400 metres wide on the average, with a minimum of 250 metres. At its widest, where it joins the main island, it reaches 750 metres in with. By comparison, Tekopua, the largest true reef island of Aitutaki, is 2.25 km long and 0.71 km2 in area. The seaward beach crest on the east side rises 2 to 3 metres above high water, and the surface slopes gently to the lagoon in the east. There are no dunes except at the southern end. The reef sediments of Ootu have been measured to be 13 to 20 metres thick. The Ootu Peninsula is the site of Aitutaki Airport. The longer 1804 meter runway in the southeast intersects a second runway of 1388 meters to the northwest, along the northern shore, which is not in use anymore. The airport was constructed during World War II. Thereby, much of the vegetation had to be cleared. Only along the western shore towards the lagoon, and on the south of the longer runway, original vegetations remains relatively undisturbed, although there have been some holiday resort developments, such as the Popoara Ocean Breeze Villas. Ootu Peninsula is part of Vaitupa District, one of eight districts of Aitutaki. The district consist of two tapere, Taakarere in the northwest and Vaitupa in the southeast. The peninsula is likewise divided between the two tapere, with the narrower southeastern part falling within the tapere of Vaitupa, and the larger northwestern part within the tapere of Taakarere.

He was born in Seoul into the powerful Yeoheung Min clan and committed suicide as an act of resistance against the Eulsa Treaty imposed by Japan on Korea. He was an adoptive nephew of Empress Myeongseong. He is remembered today for his efforts on behalf of Korean independence in the waning days of the Joseon dynasty and a statue to his memory now stands near the gates of Seoul's Changdeok Palace.  Biography  Min's father, Min Gyeom-ho (ÎØºÍ≤∏Ìò∏, ÈñîË¨ôÈé¨) was a minister in the Ministry of Finance (Hojo). Min Young-hwan passed the Gwageo examination in 1878 and thereupon entered into government service as a junior librarian in the Royal Library (Gyujanggak)\\".Michael Finch (translator), Min Y«ínghwan, The Selected Writings of a Late Chos«ín Diplomat. (Berkeley, CA: Institute of East Asian Studies, 2008), 4. Min continued to rise through the ranks of Joseon officialdom, holding a succession of posts including a position in the Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan ÂºòÊñáÈ§®) and tutor to the Crown Prince. In July 1882, Seoul was shaken by the Soldier's Rebellion triggered by the disgruntled royal palace guards who had not received their wages for several months. During this revolt Min's father was killed. As a result, Min resigned his posts and went into mourning. In 1884, Min reentered public service and was appointed an official of the Board of Personnel (Ijo ÂêèÊõπ) and successively held various government posts, such as Vice-mayor of Seoul (Hanseong Uyun Êº¢ÂüéÂè≥Â∞π). In 1895, Min was appointed as the first ambassador to the United States. However, the murder of his aunt, the Empress Myeongseong, by Japanese troops in October 1895, prevented his taking up the post. In April 1896, Min was appointed special ambassador and sent to Russia to attend the coronation of Czar Nicholas IIBella Pak. Russian diplomacy and Korea.1888‚Äì1897. Moscow: Institute of Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences,2004 . 271 p.. After a six month journey Min returned to Korea in late October of the same year. In January 1897, Min was again sent to Europe as Korean envoy to the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. These journeys served to further convince Min of the necessity of modernization. Upon his return to Korea, Min was an active supporter of the Independence Club, and was interviewed by its newspaper The Independent (Dongnip Sinmun Áç®Á´ãÊñ∞ËÅû) . Min Yeong-hwan On November 17, 1905, Japan succeeded in foisting upon Korea the Eulsa Treaty making Korea a Japanese protectorship. It is said that upon hearing of the treaty three days after it had been concluded, Min \\"fainted several times and vomited blood.\\"Michael Finch (translator), Min Y«ínghwan, The Selected Writings of a Late Chos«ín Diplomat, 24. Min and many other officials pleaded with King Gojong to annul the treaty and execute the five Korean officials who had signed it, now widely referred to as the \\"Five Traitors of Eulsa\\" (Eulsa ojeok). But, his remonstrances silenced by Japanese force, Min decided to commit suicide as a final act of resistance and protest by a loyal official. On November 30, 1905 Min cut his own throat. After this death, in his pockets were found five identical messages on the back of his calling cards to the representatives of China, Great Britain, the United States, France, and Germany in which he pleaded with those powers to recognize the true situation within Korea. He also left a final message directed towards the people of Korea (see below), in which he promised to help his fellow countrymen \\"from the nether world\\" if they would strengthen their collective will and spirit and exercise their learning in an all out effort to \\"restore our [Korean] freedom and independence.\\"Michael Finch, Min Y«íng-hwan, A Political Biography (Honolulu, HI: University of Hawaii Press, 2002), 175. Some officials, including Jo Byeongse, Hong Mansik, Yi Sangcheol, and even Min's rickshaw puller, committed suicide following Min's death. Others, perhaps inspired to action by Min's death, joined righteous armies (uibyeong). Min was posthumously conferred with the army's highest rank. In 1962 Min was again posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation.  Blood Bamboo  One year after Min's death, it was widely reported that a bamboo plant appeared where his bloody clothes had been laid. Many people thought the bamboo grew nurtured by Min's blood so that the bamboo was called Hyeoljuk (Ë°ÄÁ´π), or \\"Blood Bamboo\\". Amazingly, the number of its leaves was 45, Min's age at the time of his death. Following its discovery people crowded to witness this bamboo, some taking pictures. The Japanese government thought it was either a natural phenomenon or pure fabrication and sent officials to Min's former home to investigate. Mysteriously, they discovered the bamboo had no roots and was proven not to be fabricated . The Blood Bamboo was preserved and is now housed at the Korea University Museum along with items of Min's clothing and other personal effects. In East Asian tradition bamboo is a symbol of loyalty and uprightedness.  Trivia  Yeong-hwan and his younger brother, Yeong-chan, are cousins with Empress Sunmyeong and Emperor Gojong.

Launched in 2008 and open to the public since January 2009, RMB City is a platform for experimental creative activities, one in which Cao Fei and her collaborators use different mediums to test the boundaries between virtual and physical existence. As a laboratory for investigations in art, design, architecture, literature, cinema, politics, economy, society, and beyond, RMB City is constantly nourished by new and innovative projects, and supported by leading international art institutions and networks. As a model of avant-garde urban planning, it traverses the boundaries between past and future, real and virtual to link China and the cosmopolitan contemporary world. In 2009, RMB City was a lab for both filmmaking and live theater. Cao Fei's first documentary film after building RMB City, The Birth of RMB City, took a dreamy and epic look at the city, showing how it was constructed, but also highlighting it's fragility by depicting an inevitable demise. After this film was completed, she invited different artists to use various mediums to create different live artworks, and those works also became the life of the online city. Based on those creative actions, Cao Fei made two films in the video format: People's Limbo and Live in RMB City, both of which became chronicles of human experience in RMB City. Cao Fei does not only investigate in virtual space however, and in 2009, she traversed boundaries to bring RMB City to the real life space by creating RMB City Opera. This stage performance brought the interaction and tension between real and virtual identities to light in front of an audience, by using both physical and Second Life spaces to set the stage for interaction between actors and avatars. The running of RMB City is extensively documented on its official website.  RMB City in RL (Real-life)  Throughout the \\"construction process\\" and actual operation period of RMB City in 2008, the Serpentine Gallery in London displayed its progress in a dedicated physical space. Since then, RMB City has been exhibited in museums, galleries, and institutions around the world. Virtual institution- and individual collector-\\"managed\\" buildings inside RMB City will hold regularly changing exhibitions and events open to all Second Life users.

Whether you're desperate for answers, or simply want to collect your free gift, join us for a special Prize Ceremony on May 31 at 1 am SLT, in People's Park. Rumor has it that the elusive Wangguowei himself may drop in........ *March 29, 2010, \\"RMB City Code, Season 1: WangGuowei Wasp\\", a Second Life game: In 1927, the poet Wang Guowei threw himself into the murmuring waters of Beijing's Kunming Lake, never to be seen again in the first world. Now, almost a century later, a rumor is afoot: was that Wang Guo Wei's avatar that was recently spotted in Second Life? Yes, \\"Wangguowei Wasp\\" was seen in RMB City, only to swiftly vanish once again, leaving a trail of clues in his wake. Beginning on March 29, 2010, and for one month thereafter, you can become a Second Life detective and help to solve the mystery of his latest disappearance. This compelling mission will involve exploring the most secluded back alleys of the island and interacting with the most mysterious characters in all of RMB City. A curious eye and open-minded heart will help you to unearth Wuang Guowei's secret. At the end of the game, the most intrepid explorers will be awarded with an unexpected prize. If your mission has not been completed yet, you may find some answers here...Listen carefully: the city is showing you the right path.. # RMB City REWARD. Come to RMB City, to look for a missing poet. His name is Wangguowei Wasp. They say it's the famous poet, Wang Guo Wei, reborn as a Second Life avatar. You may vaguely remember that you have read this poet's work, that some of the phrases in his poetry could make your heart jump. Because you want to take the responsibility to find this missing life, you have decided to accept this mission. To search for him, please continue in RMB City to find the clues. # RMB City REWARD: All of the little hotels have grand names. The China Hotel is no exception. # RMB City REWARD: When the hotel owner looks at you with na√Øve and innocent eyes, you will know that you have found the right place. Usually, in these types of places in the city ‚Äì a place that people might see in the daylight as decrepit or filthy ‚Äì usually is a very valuable clue. According to our friend M, the missing poet lived for a long time in these slums. # JEROME: I have never met him, but there is good wine here, so maybe he has drunk here. # RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you have gotten the right code. Please continue to search in RMB City for the next clue. We heard Master Q is an eager helper and very trustworthy, she lives nearby. It is not strange that in Chinese folklore, the Feng Shui Master always appears on the horizon in desperate times. # Master Q: My eyes change from red to blue; my eyes are fire. Water and fire harmonize each other, and in the Second Life, I can see that all sectors of life become broken pieces when passed down generation by generation. These vague and unclear matters repeat themselves; they spread in RMB City like toys, or as if they are lining up to wait for the magical gates to open. # RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you have cracked the code accurately. Please continue in RMB City to look for the next clue. Master Q has indirectly shown you the way, the direction of the water. Go to the abundant water network of RMB City to look for it, if you're lucky, you will find the \\"Yu Gong\\". # RMB City REWARD: Congratulations, you have cracked the code accurately. Please continue in RMB City to look for the next clue. This painting scroll is \\"Gazing at the Mountain on the Riverbank\\", by Ni Zan, 1363. It depicts Ni Zan's feelings as he says goodbye to his friends, taking his boat onto the river and gazing back at the mountain. The saying goes, that in the most difficult times, Ni Zan decided to sell everything he had, take the boat, and sail out onto Tai Lake, initiating his floating hermit life. Being a hermit was Wang Guo Wei's dream in the first life, could it also be that he's become a hermit in RMB City? # RMB City Reward: Sorry, your search took a wrong turn. Time in RMB City is ‚Äòcondensed‚Äô, therefore you have to grab at the cracks in time, so that you may encounter people from different lifetimes. All of these people have a possible connection to the poet. # RMB YuGong ‚Äì Congratulations, you have found the LANDMARK, continue to follow the stream to look for the next clue. # China Tracy: Sorry, I can't tell you more, because this Second Life has no memory. This city continues to stretch, there is no end. Everything flows far, far away.... # RMB Depression Bottle: No water here, only the image of the water. # RMB Happy Bottle: RMB City is created with transparency and imagination. It is very possible it doesn't exist, and even though it exists now, it might not exist in the future. It ends after our visit ends, it starts again upon our return. Repeatedly it goes in and out of life, in the end, we all share the whole world. # RMB City Reward: Congratulations, you've gained the \\"People‚Äôs Card of Health\\". Please continue to look for the next clue, as the massage beauty has left a word for you: In this city, people come and go, and it's hard to find the ideal husband! # RMB City: Perhapa WangguoweiWasp comes to this ‚Äòpleasure parlor‚Äô just to feel the sadness of happiness in a swift exchange. # RMB City Reward: This poem, titled \\"Water Dragon Song\\", was composed in Wang Guo Wei's first life, around 1907. # RMB City REWARD: To compose poetry on the wall is a form of expression that Chinese literati will never tire of. # RMB City REWARD: In this poem, on one hand, the poetry's emphasis is on the \\"imagery of the water\\", the misty rain on the pond, spring stream and the tears of the departing people. On the other hand, in this phrase, he also hinted at the \\"earth\\" and its relationship with water, (alike they drift, but its preferable to be stable earth, rather than to be loose, flowing, moving water) ‚Äì starting with the body of water, extending to its opposition to the earth, all while hinting that we will ultimately turn toward dust. # RMB City REWARD: Sorry, your mission has misidentified the matter, please continue to search in RMB City. # RMB City REWARD: Sorry, you have misidentified the matter, There is a poem that will give you direction. # RMB City REWARD: Congratulations, you have received LM, this city is full of the life of Avatars, because people gather air gradually, then maybe as this city gradually gathers more temperature, it will have more of a human atmosphere. # RMB City REWARD: Is it that the poet sits by the only dining table, facing the empty chair and the beautiful dishes, but with no one to toast? # Marx: I found real happiness in Second Life, the realization of the happiness of personal value and labor.

The low singing of the poet floats through the ears: \\"Standing by the rail, mountain and river do not end, it is easy to depart, but harder to reunite. Running water, dropping flower petals, spring has gone, heaven is on earth. Blossom without shows to other, then how would wither after rain. Long peaceful calm day, stood a slight while in the corridor, rise blurred lingering affection. Gentle rain falls into the pool, setting sun shining on the compound, with heavily door shuttered. All about to stop, where the cloth slide over, just there, all for the wind. Story of flowers are waning to you, even more unnecessary to pursue, all branches all been covered by whitish snow. Mention about people only for harmonious, sadness and happiness in the world are all fall into pieces. As to fly away, rather to gather into dust, not flow away by the river. With fear of such limpid warmly Spring River, are stored the tears from whom already leave. *July 14, 2008, RMB City Groundbreaking *September 2008, \\"Play with Your Triennale\\" *November 2008, \\"NO LAB in RMB City\\" *November 2008, \\"Love Letters To Avatars\\" by Mian Mian (SL: MianMian Sorbet) *December 2008, \\"Dream Umbrellas\\" by Man Michinaga (RL: Patrick Lichty), Gazira Babeli and Second Front *January 2009, Institution Opening: UCCA in RMB City *January 9 (SL time)-January 10, 2009, RMB City Grand Opening *January 2009, \\"Master Q's Guide to Virtual Feng Shui\\" by Huang He (SL: queenshoe Voom) *January 11, 2009, China Tracy on Treet.tv's \\"Tonight Live\\" *January 2009, RMB City's First Mayor Ulli Sigg (SL: UliSigg Cisse) *March 20, 2009, Interview Marathon at Serpentine Gallery *April 2009, RMB City's Second Mayor Alan Lau (SL: AlanLau Nirvana) *May 2009, \\"People's Limbo in RMB City\\" *August 2009, RMB City's Third Mayor Jerome Sans (SL: SuperConcierge Cristole) *August 2009, \\"Yak Horn: RMB City Guggenheim by Cao Fei (SL: China Tracy) *August 2009, \\"Master Q's Medium Office\\" by Huang He (SL: queenshoe Voom) *August 2009, \\"Wang Kuo-wei\\" by Hu Fang (SL: HuFang Scribe) *August 25, 2009, \\"Never Real Sound\\" by Yan Jun (SL: Vacation Mint) *August 28, 2009, \\"Revolutionary Pleasure Area\\" by Cao Fei (SL: China Tracy) *August 28, 2009, \\"Second Life Tremors\\" by Neville Mars (SL: MARS01 Sheryffe) *September 2009, \\"Fake Mountain\\" by jiang Jun (SL: JiangJun aboma) *September 13, 2009, \\"New World Gala\\" by James Au (SL: Hamlet Au) + \\"Montage RMB City\\" by Trace Sanderson (SL: Lainy Voom) *January 10, 2010, RMB City's Fourth Mayor Erica Dubach (SL: E3A Digital) *January 10, 2010, RMB City's One Year's Anniversary Virtual institution- and individual collector-\\"managed\\" buildings inside RMB City will hold regularly changing exhibitions and events open to all Second Life users.

The vehicles were lightly armoured, armed with a 20, 50 or 75 mm main gun, and powered by a Tatra V12 diesel engine.Fletcher, David. Hup, Two - Three - Four. Classic Military Vehicle, 2001, Volume 1 Issue 4 p. 48-51. The Sd.Kfz. 234 broadly resembles the appearance of Sd.Kfz. 231 (8 rad).  Development  Armoured wheeled vehicles were developed early in Germany after the end of World War I, since they were not subject to the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty. The Sd.Kfz. 234 belonged to the ARK series (type designation of the chassis) and was the successor to the earlier Sd.Kfz. 231/232/233 (8-Rad), which belonged to the GS series. The combat experience of fast-moving, hard- hitting wheeled reconnaissance vehicles during the Wehrmacht's early invasions of Poland and France impressed German military officials, but indicated some deficiencies in existing designs. A new armoured car project was thus undertaken in August 1940, incorporating several lessons from the Wehrmacht's own external operations.Green, Michael. Anderson, Thomas. Schulz, Frank. German Tanks of World War II. Zenith Imprint, 2000. The latest B√ºssing-NAG Sd.Kfz. 232 variant, the Sd.Kfz. 234 was designed later that year.Hogg and Weeks, p.185, \\"Sd.Kfz. 232, 233, and 234 (8 rad) Armoured Cars\\". It was to have a monocoque chassis with eight wheels, and an air-cooled engine for use in North Africa. Chassis were built by B√ºssing-NAG in Leipzig-Wahren, while armoured bodies were provided by Deutsche Edelstahlwerke of Krefeld and turrets by Daimler Benz in Berlin-Marienfelde and Schichau of Elbing, with engines from Ringhoffer-Tatra-Werke AG of Nesselsdorf. Panzermuseum Munster, Germany The first trials with the prototype started around July, 1942. Due to problems with the excessive noise of the first engine, a second model was developed, the Tatra 103. The vehicle had eight-wheel steering and was able to quickly change direction thanks to a second, rear-facing, driver's seat; the transmission had six forward and reverse gears, with traction over the eight wheels. Power was provided by an air-cooled Tatra 103 diesel engine. The Sd.Kfz. 234 was the first and only German armoured vehicle to use an air cooled diesel engine. This was originally intended as a temporary solution until the engine could be redesigned to function better in harsher tropical climates, however, this never eventuated and thus the Tatra 103 was used until the end of production. The first and possibly best known version was the Sd.Kfz. 234/2; it had a turret armed with a 5 cm L/60 gun, which was originally intended for the VK 1602 Leopard light tank. It was produced from late 1943 to mid 1944. This variant was replaced in production by the second version, the Sd.Kfz. 234/1, which had a simpler open turret (H√§ngelafette 38)panzernot.net, Sd.Kfz. 234/2 - The Sd.Kfz. 234 armed with a 2 cm KwK 38 gun; it was manufactured from mid 1944 to early 1945. 5 cm KwK 39/1 used in a Sd.Kfz. 234/2, Panzermuseum Munster The Sd.Kfz. 234/3, produced simultaneously with the 234/1, served as a support vehicle for the reconnaissance vehicles. It had an open-topped superstructure, in which a short-barreled 7.5 cm K51 L/24 gun was installed. This gun was intended for use against \\"soft\\" targets; however, when using a hollow charge shell, the penetration power exceeded that of the 5 cm L/60 gun. This variant was produced from mid 1944 to the end of 1944, before switching production to the 234/4. The final variant produced was the Sd.Kfz. 234/4, which replaced the L/24 gun with the 7.5 cm L/46 PaK 40. This was yet another attempt to increase the mobility of this anti-tank gun; however, the 234 chassis was stretched to its limits. This variant was manufactured from the end of 1944 to the end of hostilities in 1945. Service history Protracted engine development meant that the desert campaign was over before the 234 arrived, but it nevertheless proved useful on the Eastern and Western Fronts. It was quite formidable, but not many were built before it was replaced by the simpler 234/1, with a 20mm gun, in 1944.Hogg, p.221, \\"Sd.Kfz. 234/2\\" & \\"Sd.Kfz. 234/1\\". The Sd.Kfz. 234 was commonly used in pairs, one equipped with a long-range radio communications kit while the other possessed only a short-range radio. The long-range unit was identifiable by the large \\"star\\" antenna on the left side of the vehicle. Some sources suggest that the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 was used by the following combat units:Jentz, cited in \\"panzernot.net\\" website * Panzer Lehr Division - 25 vehicles * 2nd Panzer Division - 25 vehicles * 1st SS Panzer Division - 16 vehicles * 20th Panzer Division - 16 vehicles * 7th Panzer Division - unconfirmed * 13th Panzer Division - unconfirmed * Brandenburg Panzer Grenadier Division - 2 issued January 1945 Variants Wartime view of a Sd.Kfz. 234/1 Sd.Kfz. 234/3 , Bovington Tank Museum, UK Sd.Kfz. 234/4 Pakwagen, Munster Panzermuseum, Germany There were four main variants: * 234/1 - 1 x 2 cm KwK 38 L/55 autocannon, 1 x 7.92mm MG 42 machine gun.

The gun mantlet was rounded and was thick. 101 built between September 1943 and September 1944. * 234/3 - 1 x 7.5 cm K51 L/24 gun in open- topped superstructure replacing the turret. 88 built between June and December 1944. * 234/4 - 1 x 7.5 cm PaK 40 L/46 gun in open-topped superstructure replacing the turret. 89 built between December 1944 and March 1945.

Operating overnight along the Mildura line, it included motorail and sleeping car facilities. History Sleeping facilities A trial daylight service, the Mildura Sunlight was introduced by the Victorian Railways between Melbourne and Mildura on 3 September 1957. Air-conditioned Z type carriage stock was used, running thrice weekly. Night trains replaced this from 1967, and a motorail service was added in 1968. The Vinelander first ran on 9 August 1972 after intense local lobbying for an upgrade of the existing overnight train.\\"In Brief\\" Railway Gazette International September 1972 page 326 The name was the product of a naming competition held by the Victorian Railways, with steel sleeping cars formerly used on The Overland being used, along with older wooded stock. A buffet car and bar was added to the train from 18 July 1977, but drunken behaviour became an issue, with offending passengers being removed from the train at intermediate stations. The typical timetable of the 1970s had a Melbourne departure at 21:20 and an arrival into Mildura at 08:05. The train was promoted as one of the Victorian Railways' premier trains, in 1974 Victorian Railways sponsored a race meeting of the Mildura Racing Club, with the winner receiving the Vinelander Plate. In 1984 a parallel road coach commenced operations. A day train named The Sunraysia commenced in 1987 but was withdrawn in 1990. By November 1986, The Vinelander was only operating two nights per week, with The Sunraysia daylight service running as a replacement on some other days. The price of the sleeping car service also rose; from $17 per berth in 1985, it had risen to $30 per berth by July 1986. Staff levels were also reduced, with one conductor to manage two carriages (prior to this it was a one-to-one ratio). This was seen by some as an attempt by V/Line management to cut back the service.\\"Investment saves long distance train\\" Railway Gazette International May 1986 page 327 The last Vinelander ran on 12 September 1993 after the cutbacks of the Kennett Government. A service review was announced by the Bracks Government in 2000, in part due to the independent politician Russell Savage enabling the formation of a minority Labor government after the 1999 Victorian state election. The service never returned. Withdrawal The withdrawal of The Vinelander service in 1993 occurred under controversial circumstances. Two days before the service was scheduled to be axed, intending passengers were on the platform at Spencer Street station, ready to board the train to Mildura, when it was announced that it had been cancelled due to a landslide along the track. Despite the very short notice of the cancellation, buses were conveniently available as an alternative. Suspicions about the supposed landslide story were aroused when it was noted that it hadn't blocked the Melbourne-bound Vinelander that same evening. A leaked document from the train controllers working that evening also aroused suspicion and an investigation revealed that the story about the landslide was a hoax. V/Line management failed to give any clear explanation for their actions and it is widely believed that the sudden cancellation of the final Vinelander service was done to avoid any protests, such as the one that had taken place earlier at Bairnsdale, when the withdrawal of the service occurred as planned a couple of days later.

He has worked as a solo artist, and also in collaboration with others in his bands Jack and Jacques. Jack In 1993, Reynolds moved to London where he formed the group Jack, on lead vocals, signing a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music as well as a record deal with independent label Too Pure. Jack released three full-length albums, the first two of which ‚Äì Pioneer Soundtracks (1996) and The Jazz Age (1998) ‚Äì garnered excellent reviews and were placed highly in critics' end-of-year polls. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reaction and extensive UK and European touring, sales for both records although respectable were ultimately disappointing, and no Jack record would ever make the UK Top 40 single or albums charts. The third album, The End of the Way It's Always Been, was released on the Les Disques du Cr√©puscule label. The record featured collaborations with writer/musician Kirk Lake and the American poet and novelist/screenwriter Dan Fante (son of John Fante). An extensive European tour promoted the record. The critical reaction in the UK to the album was markedly less positive than for the first two Jack albums, but the album was markedly successful in France. Jack also recorded a five-track EP 'La belle et la Discoth√®que' with ex-Cocteau Twins bassist Simon Raymonde, son of arranger Ivor Raymonde. Jacques During Jack's existence, Reynolds (occasionally with Jack co-writer/lead guitarist Matthew Scott) also recorded two albums and a handful of singles and EPs in his side project Jacques. Both albums were released by Setanta Records. The first Jacques album, How To Make Love, Vol. 1 (1997) was produced by Momus, featuring a more sparse, experimental sound than Reynolds' work with Jack. Compared to the critical garlands bestowed upon Pioneer Soundtracks, the hastily recorded album (completed in seven days) received mixed reviews. The second album, To Stars (2000), had more in common with the expansive, orchestral Jack sound and was generally more well-received than its predecessor. Sales were modest for both Jacques albums, and a planned third album was cancelled midway through recording, when Jacques were dropped by Setanta in 2001. Other work Reynolds has released two solo full-length albums ‚Äì Neu York (2004), credited to \\"anthony\\", and British Ballads (2007), released under his own name. A footnote to Neu York ‚Äì (I was born) in prehistoric Spain ‚Äì was released in 2005 on the Spanish Moonpalace label. Reynolds has stated that he considers British Ballads to be his \\"proper\\" debut solo record. It featured cameos from English writer Colin Wilson, the singer- songwriter and pianist John Howard, ex-Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde, Dot Allison and English folk artist Vashti Bunyan. The album received some of the best reviews of Reynolds' career, but yet again, with no real radio play and without funds to tour, the sales were disappointing. From the off, Reynolds considered this his \\"final debut\\", stating on his Myspace blog that, since the majority of the musicians appearing on British Ballads were session musicians, it was financially impractical to consider recording a new album on the same scale. Reynolds attended a Simon Raymonde recording session where Vashti Bunyan was recording her version of a Reynolds song. This would eventually surface six years later, on the Bees dream of flowers and your meadows summer breath EP. Reynolds also joined a Spanish band, La Muneca de Sal, on lead vocals, contributing some of his own songs. The band performs original material as well as songs from Reynolds' previous projects. He has collaborated with many European musicians, both as a co-composer and producer, including the Italian groups Hollowblue and Marti and the Spanish group Migala. In 2000, he sang with the Moscow Philharmonic on an album by the French film composer Franck Roussel. In 2016 he composed soundtracks to two feature-length films: Open my Eyes and an adaptation of the Colin Wilson novel, Adrift in Soho. Reynolds has also written four full-length biographies. The first, on the 1960s group The Walker Brothers, was released in the UK and US by Jawbone press in August 2009. The second, a commission by Plexus books, on the singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, was published again in both countries in July. In 2011, Leonard Cohen ‚Äì a remarkable life, Reynolds' biography on Leonard Cohen, was published by Omnibus press. It has since gone on to be published in eight languages. In 2015 his biography of the band Japan: A foreign place was released via Burning shed. He also occasionally acts in short films. Personal life Reynolds was born in Cardiff, Wales, in 1971. Reynolds has lived in London, Paris, Shropshire, Spain and Cardiff. He currently lives in Wales. Since 1992, Reynolds has also worked as a journalist, writing essays and critiques for various magazines in the UK and the US, most notably Stop Smiling magazine. In 2002, Les Disques du Cr√©puscule published a collection of his lyrics, poetry and prose entitled \\"These Roses taste like ashes\\". This was followed by another collection of poetry in 2007 : 'Calling all demons'.

Established in 1839, Provident Bank emphasizes personal service and customer convenience in attending to the financial needs of businesses, individuals and families in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. The bank offers a broad array of deposit, loan, and investment products as well as trust, fiduciary and wealth management services through its wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company. It is the oldest community bank in New Jersey. Corporate history The Provident Institution for Savings was originally chartered by the State of New Jersey in 1839, becoming the first mutual savings bank in the history of the state. The first President was John F. Ellis from 1839 to 1841. Co-founder Dudley S. Gregory became President in 1841 and held the job until his retirement in 1874. Due to the general public mistrust of banks resulting from the Panic of 1837, it did not accept its first deposit of $227 until October 16, 1843. The Provident was run out of a room in Jersey City's Temperance Hall until moving to the office of Treasurer Peter Bentley in 1846. By 1875, Provident had assets of $3.5 million. A run on the bank occurred on May 12, 1882 following the attempted suicide of Edmund W. Kingsland, the bank's Treasurer, in his office. The run on the bank ceased when an independent audit proved all accounts were in order. Kingsland survived the suicide attempt. In 1989, The Provident Savings Bank celebrated its 150th anniversary. Acquisition of The First National Bank of Dunellen In 1978, Provident acquired the First National Bank of Dunellen. This was a pioneering move. No one had ever heard of a savings bank buying out a commercial bank. When the deal was complete, however, Provident had increased its assets by $20 million and added two new branch offices ‚Äì Dunellen and Green Brook. Merger with Bloomfield Savings Bank Controlled growth solidified Provident‚Äôs status as a stalwart financial institution. A landmark event in the history of both Provident and its neighboring competitor Bloomfield Savings Institution was marked in 1983 when they announced a merger that would create a billion-dollar plus bank.

Development  Late in 2006, ROMARM completed the first prototype of a new multi-role amphibious armoured infantry fighting vehicle called Saur. In the past this has been referred to as the Zimbru 2006. The Saur 1 was first unveiled at Expomil 2007. Saur 1 was developed to meet the requirements of the Romanian Army but as of late 2007 no production orders had been placed for the Saur. To meet an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR), the Romanian Ministry of National Defense has placed a contract with MOWAG of Switzerland for a total of 31 Piranha III (8√ó8) armoured vehicles with deliveries to run from 2007 through to 2008.  Description  The hull of the Saur 1 is of all-welded steel which provides the occupants with protection from small arms fire and shell splinters with the highest protection being given over the frontal arc. According to ROMARM, the vehicle has Level 1 anti-mine and ballistic protection. The SAUR 1 can be fitted with an add-on armour kit, raising the protection to Level 2. Layout of the new Saur AIV is in line with more recent 8√ó8 developments in other countries with the driver's position towards the front on the left and the power pack to the right which makes the chassis easier to adopt for a wide range of battlefield missions. The troop compartment extends to the rear of the hull with the roof hatch arrangement depending on the mission. In a typical AIV role the commander would be seated to the rear of the driver and also be provided with a single-piece hatch cover. Both the driver's and commander's hatch covers open to the rear and to the immediate front are three periscopes for forward observation. The middle one can be replaced by a passive periscope for driving at night. The weapon station would be in the center of the roof with two hatches over the rear troop compartment which open outwards and can be locked in the vertical position. The troops would typically be seated on individual seats down either side facing inwards. The Saur 1 is capable of speeds in excess of 100 km/h.  Variants  A new improved version, the Saur 2 was unveiled at the Black Sea Defence & Aerospace (BSDA 2008) exhibition held in Bucharest in 2008.

Urwin held the post of Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, an important inter-governmental regional organisation from 2004 until 2 May 2008. Urwin had been the longest serving Australian diplomat in the Pacific at the time of his death in 2008. Urwin was also the first non-Pacific Islander to become Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum. During his tenure as a diplomat and Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Urwin was considered to be instrumental in the rebuilding of failed states and promotion of political stability in the region - especially with the RAMSI mission in the Solomon Islands. Biography  Early life  Greg Urwin was born in Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia, to parents Frank and Verna Urwin. The family relocated to the Wollongong area and then to Oak Flats when Urwin was ten years old. Urwin initially attended elementary school at Fairy Meadow Public School. Urwin then attended Wollongong High School where he became school captain. Urwin completed undergraduate studies in history with honours at the University of Sydney where he was also senior student at Wesley College.  Diplomat  Urwin entered the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, or DFAT, in 1971 following his graduation from the University of Sydney. His first diplomatic posting for DFAT was 1971‚Äì1974 to the Australian embassy in Ottawa, the capital of Canada. Urwin's work as a Pacific region specialist began in 1977 when he was posted to Apia, Samoa from Canberra, to open Australia's first diplomatic mission in the Polynesian nation. Urwin was seconded to Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Samoa in 1979. In this capacity, Urwin assisted Samoa in developing its international foreign policy. Urwin's later Pacific diplomatic assignments included serving as Australian High Commissioner in Fiji and Vanuatu and the deputy head of the Australian mission in New Zealand. Through his diplomatic postings in large nations, Urwin was often accredited to smaller Pacific island states as well. Urwin's first marriage to Louise Dauth ended while he was Apia. He married his second wife, Penny Clark, a Samoan widow with three sons. Urwin often returned to Canberra, Australia, between diplomatic postings, where he often served as a special envoy for the government or as an international election observer. Despite his overseas positions, Urwin remained active and in tune to Australian domestic politics. Urwin was part of the Australian delegation to the 2000 Pacific Islands Forum summit in Kiribati. Urwin was considered to be a very important drafter of the Biketawa Declaration, which was signed at the Kiribati summit. The Biketawa Declaration, named after the island of Biketawa where negotiations took place, provided a firm political framework for regional cooperation on Pacific island security for the first time. The Declaration established a mechanism by which Forum countries could come to the assistance of its members. The Biketawa Declaration came against a backdrop of increased political instability throughout Melanesia at the time. George Speight had recently staged the 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat during the same year and the Solomon Islands were nearly brought to civil war due to ethnic tensions on the island of Guadalcanal. Urwin was considered to be an instrumental voice in the application of the Biketawa Declaration to the Solomons Island Crisis. Urwin applied the declaration to the crisis and gathered regional support for the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or RAMSI, which was sent to the Solomon Islands in 2003 to help quell the ethnic violence and remains to this day. RAMSI stabilised the nation and allowed the government of the Solomon Islands to rebuild its administration and the economy.  Pacific Islands Forum  Pacific Islands Forum Urwin's skill as a diplomat and his handling of the Solomon Islands tension earned him a reputation of having an awareness of the sensibilities of Pacific Island leaders and local culture. In 2004, Australian Prime Minister John Howard backed Urwin as a candidate for Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum. Leaders of some neighbouring island states, notably Papua New Guinea, opposed Urwin's nomination, not because they disliked Urwin, but because they feared perceived Australian political domination of the Forum and the region at large, especially by Howard, whom they viewed as heavy-handed. Some Pacific Island nations said that they would prefer someone of Pacific Islander descent. Ultimately though Urwin won the nomination. Urwin competed against three other candidates, all Pacific Islanders, whose nominations were also put forth for Secretary General ‚Äì lawyer Tuala Donald Kerslake of Samoa; Vinci Clodumar of Nauru, the country's permanent representative to the United Nations; and Langi Kavaliku a doctor from Tonga. Ultimately, despite some opposition, Urwin prevailed and became the first Australian Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum in 2004. As Secretary General, Urwin played a central role in the adoption of the Pacific Plan at the Pacific Islands Forum summit in Port Moresby in October 2005. The Pacific Plan is a \\"co-operation scheme\\" which is based on four \\"pillars\\" to promote regional cooperation and integration in Pacific Island nations: economic growth, sustainable development, good governance and security. Urwin also worked to promote dialogue between the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional activists and organisations. In 2007, the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum voted to give non-governmental organisations, or NGOs, a \\"consultative relationship\\" with their annual summits and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. Urwin was unanimously reappointed to a second three-year term as Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum in October 2006. Unlike his first nomination, Urwin ran unopposed. Greg Urwin resigned as Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum in 2008 due to cancer. Tongan Prime Minister Feleti Sevele, who was serving as Chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum at the time, announced that he received Urwin's letter of resignation on 2 May 2008 saying, \\"We all wish him well and a speedy recovery.\\" Deputy Secretary General Feleti Teo of Tuvalu became acting Secretary General following Urwin's resignation. Ultimately, Tuiloma Neroni Slade of Samoa, a former justice at the International Criminal Court, was chosen to permanently succeed Urwin at the 39th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders conference in Alofi, Niue, in August 2008.  Awards  In 2001, Urwin was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal for \\"Outstanding Contribution to the Development of Australia's Relationship with the Pacific.\\" He was awarded the Centenary Medal for \\"outstanding public service\\" in advancing Australia's position in the Pacific. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Derek Sikua posthumously awarded Urwin the Cross of Solomon Islands \\"in recognition of his outstanding contribution to RAMSI.\\" The Cross of Solomon Islands is the highest civilian award given in the Solomon Islands and the country's second highest award overall. Sikua will present the award to Urwin's widow in a future ceremony.  Death  Urwin returned from Suva, Fiji, to his home in Apia just two weeks before his death. He died of cancer in Apia, Samoa, on 9 August 2008, at the age of 61. He had been suffering from cancer and heart problems for the previous eight months. Urwin was survived by his second wife, Penny and their three sons, Wylie, Geoff and Daryl; his parents, Frank and Verna, of Queanbeyan, Australia; and his brother, Neil, of Murrumbateman. Urwin was buried at the Keil Family grounds in Lotopa, Samoa, on 14 August 2008. Memorial services were held in Apia, Samoa; Suva, Fiji and Canberra, Australia at which many leaders from the region were in attendance. Tuiloma Neroni Slade, who ascended to Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum in August 2008, promised to continue the work of Urwin following his death. =Reactions = Reactions to Urwin's death poured in from across the Pacific region where he had worked as a diplomat for more than 30 years. Pacific Islands Forum Pacific Islands Forum ‚Äì Acting Secretary General Feleti Teo, who succeeded Urwin in May 2008, praised Urwin as the \\"architect of the Pacific Plan.\\" Teo described Urwin as \\"a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the Pacific Islands Forum family.\\" French Polynesia ‚Äì President Gaston Tong Sang called Urwin's death an \\"immense loss\\" and praised him for granting French Polynesia and New Caledonia associate member status during his time as Secretary General. Sang said, \\"French Polynesia does not forget either that it is also under Greg Urwin's mandate and under his determining impetus, that the Forum has opened up to the French Pacific entities by granting them the associate member status (for New Caledonia and French Polynesia) and the observer status for Wallis and Futuna.\\" ‚Äì Prime Minister Helen Clark said of Urwin, \\"The South Pacific was where Greg made his home. His enthusiasm and love of our region was very evident in the way he went about his work. Greg was a strong advocate for the Pacific and his passing is a great loss.\\" ‚Äì Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare sent condolences to Urwin's wife, Penny Urwin. Somare called Urwin \\"A man of the Pacific, from the Pacific and for the Pacific,\\" who legacy of strengthened Pacific cooperation. ‚Äì Prime Minister Derek Sikua called Urwin's death a great loss to the region and the Pacific Islands Forum. He commended Urwin for his work on the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands and his understanding of the Pacific Islands region. ‚Äì Prime Minister Feleti Sevele called Urwin a \\"real son of the Pacific\\" and praised his work on the Pacific Plan.

The competition was run on a regional basis, with 18 regional associations holding separate qualification rounds.

In all, 104 teams took part in the competition, 33 from the South Island and 71 from the North Island. Note: Different sources record different numbers for the rounds of this competition, with some confusion caused by differing numbers of rounds in regional qualification.

The 1965 Final The final was played in a stiff Wellington southerly, which St. Kilda captain Alex Caldwell opted to use in the first half. Despite this advantage, the Otago side found themselves on the back foot against a far stronger Auckland team. Suburbs rebuffed St. Kilda's attacks in the first twenty minutes before moving the ball forward themselves. Centre-forward Trefor Pugh scored first for the Auckland side, though Brian Slinn levelled the scores before the break. In the second half, playing with the aid of the wind, Suburbs' class proved too much for the southerners. John Legg added a second for Suburbs 12 minutes into the second spell, and a mistimed clearance from St. Kilda keeper Malcolm Barnes found Pugh, who hit a volley into the St. Kilda goal.

In his latter years, Speight was briefly a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Biography Speight was born in Selby, Yorkshire, England. He was brought up from boyhood in the service of the Midland Railway Company until he attained a responsible position on the management. Speight accepted the new post of railway commissioner of the Railways Department of Victoria, in 1883. He was tasked with implementing the Railway Construction Act 1884, along with fellow commissioners Alfred John Agg and R. Ford. The Act called for the construction of fifty-nine new lines and additional works. Conservative by nature, Speight preferred to invest in quality infrastructure in order to reduce operational and maintenance costs. However, this policy was in opposition to political leaders including Thomas Bent and John Woods; and it was considered that Speight had over‚Äìextended the State. Amidst allegations of corruption and mismanagement and within the setting depressed economic conditions, Speight and the other commissioners eventually resigned in 1892 following the enactment of the Railways Act, 1892 that relieved the commissioners of railway construction and reduced much of their power. Almost immediately, he sued David Syme, then the editor of The Age, for ¬£25,000, alleging libel. Speight lost nine of the ten cases, and was awarded one farthing in damages for the case won. He relocated to Western Australia, gradually moving to the private sector as director of Jarrahdale Jarrah Forests and Railways. At the 1901 state election, Speight won the seat of North Perth as an independent candidate. He died on 19 September 1901, survived by eight children.

Though he personally refused to accept the title, he is honored as ‚Äúthe father of Chinese Hydrogen Bomb‚Äù.  Life  He was born in Tianjin in August 1926. He was famous for his excellent performances in Yaohua High School. Later he was admitted by Department of Electronics of Peking University, however, out of the passion for the physical theories, he transferred into Department of Physics to work on theory. From 1949, Yu started his postgraduate research in the Department of Physics of Peking University, and also served as a teaching assistant. In 1951, he became an assistant researcher and associate researcher at Modern Physics Institute of CAS, and began to study nuclear physics theory under the supervision of Peng Huanwu. From the end of 1960, Yu was involved in the theoretical research of nuclear weapons. His major contributions included the solutions to a series of fundamental and critical theoretical problems of nuclear weapons, which led to breakthrough of hydrogen bomb. He won the reputation and became the academician of Chinese Academy of Science for his design of H-bomb.

The practice is rooted in the Bible: in the asceticism of the Old and New Testament saints, and in its theology, such as the remark by Saint Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, where he states: \\"If you live a life of nature, you are marked out for death; if you mortify the ways of nature through the power of the Spirit, you will have life.\\" (Romans 8:13, DRC). It is intimately connected with Christ's complete sacrifice of himself on the Cross: \\"those who belong to Christ have crucified nature, with all its passions, all its impulses\\" (Gal 5:24, DRC). Christ himself enjoined his disciples to mortify themselves when he said: \\"If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me\\" (Matt 16:24, DRC). According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \\"[t]he way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes: ‚ÄòHe who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning, through beginnings that have no end. He never stops desiring what he already knows.‚Äô\\". The purpose of mortification is to train \\"the soul to virtuous and holy living\\" (The Catholic Encyclopedia, article on Mortification). It achieves this through conforming one's passions to reason and faith. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, internal mortification, such as the struggle against pride and self-love, is essential, but external mortification, such as fasting can also be good if they conform with a spirit of internal mortification. Mortification in Catholic history Throughout the Old Testament, persons fast and wear sackcloth to appease God. Furthermore, the nazirites were persons who took special vows to, among other things, abstain from alcohol. In the New Testament, Saint John the Baptist is the most clear example of a person practising corporal mortification. According to Mark 1:6, \\"John was clothed with a garment of camel‚Äôs hair, and had a leather girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey\\" (DRC). The rule of St. Augustine of Hippo says: \\"Subdue your flesh by fasting from meat and drink, so far as your health permits. But if anyone is not able to fast, at least let him take no food out of meal time, unless he is sick.\\" (Citation?) St. Dominic Loricatus (995‚Äì1060) is said to have performed \\"One Hundred Years Penance\\" by chanting 20 psalters accompanied by 300,000 lashes over six days. St. Francis: he asked pardon from his Brother Ass (the way he referred to his body), for his severe penances. Later, Saint Francis of Assisi, who is said to have received the stigmata, painful wounds like those of Jesus Christ, is said to have asked pardon to his body, whom he called Brother Ass, for the severe self-afflicted penances he has done: vigils, fasts, frequent flagellations and the use of a hairshirt. A Doctor of the Church, St. Catherine of Siena (died 1380), was a tertiary Dominican who lived at home rather than in a convent, and who practiced austerities which a prioress would probably not have permitted. She is notable for fasting and subsisting for long periods of time on nothing but the Blessed Sacrament. St. Catherine of Siena wore sackcloth and scourged herself three times daily in imitation of St. Dominic. In the sixteenth century, Saint Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor of England, wore a hairshirt, deliberately mortifying his body. He also used the 'discipline.' Saint Ignatius of Loyola while in Manresa in 1522 is known to have practiced severe mortifications. In the Litany prayers to Saint Ignatius he is praised as being ‚Äúconstant in the practice of corporal penance.‚Äù He was in the habit of wearing a cord tied below the knee.See his Autobiography, first chapter, for mention of the cord tied below the knee. St. Teresa of √Åvila, a Doctor of the Church, undertook severe mortification once it was suggested by friends that her supernatural ecstasies were of diabolical origin. She continued until Francis Borgia reassured her. She believed she was goaded by angels and had a passion to conform her life to the sufferings of Jesus, with a motto associated with her: \\"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\\" St. Teresa of √Åvila: her motto was \\"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\\" St. Marguerite Marie Alacoque (22 July 1647 October-17 October 1690), the promoter of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, practised in secret severe corporal mortification after her First Communion at the age of nine, until becoming paralyzed, which confined her to bed for four years. Having been cured of her paralysis by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, she changed her name to Marie (French: Mary) and vowed to devote her life to the service of Mary. St. Jun√≠pero Serra (November 24, 1713 ‚Äì August 28, 1784) was a Franciscan friar who founded the mission chain in Alta California. A statue of Fr. Junipero Serra rests in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building, representing the state of California. He was known for his love for mortification, self-denial and absolute trust in God. A notable saint in the nineteenth century was St. Jean Vianney who converted hundreds of people in laicist France. Pope John XXIII said of him: \\"You cannot begin to speak of St. John Mary Vianney without automatically calling to mind the picture of a priest who was outstanding in a unique way in voluntary affliction of his body; his only motives were the love of God and the desire for the salvation of the souls of his neighbors, and this led him to abstain almost completely from food and from sleep, to carry out the harshest kinds of penances, and to deny himself with great strength of soul...[T]his way of life is particularly successful in bringing many men who have been drawn away by the allurement of error and vice back to the path of good living.\\" During the later part of the nineteenth century, Saint Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus, another Doctor of the Church, at three years of age was described by her mother: \\"Even Th√©r√®se is anxious to practice mortification.‚Äù Th√©r√®se later wrote: \\"My God, I will not be a saint by halves. I am not afraid of suffering for Thee.‚Äù The \\"Little Flower\\", famous for her \\"little way\\" and love of God, fasted and used the \\"discipline\\" vigorously, \\"scourging herself with all the strength and speed of which she was capable, smiling at the crucifix through the tears which bedewed her eyelashes\\", according to one of her biographers. In the early twentieth century, the child seers of Fatima said they had initially seen an angel, who said: \\"In every way you can offer sacrifice to God in reparation for the sins by which He is offended, and in supplication for sinners. In this way you will bring peace to our country, for I am its guardian angel, the Angel of Portugal. Above all, bear and accept with patience the sufferings God will send you.\\" Lucia Santos later reported that the idea of making sacrifices was repeated several times by the Virgin Mary and that she had shown them a vision of hell which prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lucia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Lucia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances. St. Ignatius: he is praised in his litany for being \\"constant in the practice of corporal penance\\" At the latter half of the twentieth century, Saint Josemar√≠a Escriv√° practiced self- flagellation and used the cilice, a modern-day version of the hairshirt. Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, a saint who received the stigmata wrote in one of his letters: \\"Let us now consider what we must do to ensure that the Holy Spirit may dwell in our souls. It can all be summed up in mortification of the flesh with its vices and concupiscences, and in guarding against a selfish spirit... The mortification must be constant and steady, not intermittent, and it must last for one's whole life. Moreover, the perfect Christian must not be satisfied with a kind of mortification which merely appears to be severe. He must make sure that it hurts.\\" Like St. Josemaria, Padre Pio and Mother Teresa of Calcutta used the cilice and discipline regularly as means of doing penance.\\"Spirituality of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Its Transforming Influence on the Apostolate of the Missionaries of Charity for the Poorest of the Poor\\", p. 103, a doctoral thesis submitted at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas (the Angelicum) by A.C. Savarimuthu, 1999. The document cites \\"Mother's Instructions,\\" Vol. 3, Supplement 2, pp. 41. Some branches of Christianity have also institutionalized the practice of self-inflicted penance and corporal mortification through their mandate on fasting and abstinence for specific days of the year. Christian communities in some parts of the world still practice processions of public flagellation during Lent and Holy Week. 20th-century Catholic documents Recent theology affirms the practice of mortification. The catechism of the Catholic Church states: ‚ÄúThe way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation and spiritual battle. Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes‚Äù (n. 2015). \\"Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, \\"sackcloth and ashes,\\" fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, interior conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance.\\" (CCC 1430)CCC 1430 Pope John XXIII, who convened the Second Vatican Council, taught in Paenitentiam Agere, an encyclical he wrote on July 1, 1962: :But the faithful must also be encouraged to do outward acts of penance, both to keep their bodies under the strict control of reason and faith, and to make amends for their own and other people's sins... St. Augustine issued the same insistent warning: \\"It is not enough for a man to change his ways for the better and to give up the practice of evil, unless by painful penance, sorrowing humility, the sacrifice of a contrite heart and the giving of alms he makes amends to God for all that he has done wrong.\\" ...But besides bearing in a Christian spirit the inescapable annoyances and sufferings of this life, the faithful ought also take the initiative in doing voluntary acts of penance and offering them to God.... Since, therefore, Christ has suffered in the flesh,\\" it is only fitting that we be \\"armed with the same intent.\\" It is right, too, to seek example and inspiration from the great saints of the Church. Pure as they were, they inflicted such mortifications upon themselves as to leave us almost aghast with admiration. And as we contemplate their saintly heroism, shall not we be moved by God's grace to impose on ourselves some voluntary sufferings and deprivations, we whose consciences are perhaps weighed down by so heavy a burden of guilt? Pope Paul VI also stated: :‚ÄúThe necessity of mortification of the flesh stands clearly revealed if we consider the fragility of our nature, in which, since Adam‚Äôs sin, flesh and spirit have contrasting desires. This exercise of bodily mortification‚Äîfar removed from any form of stoicism‚Äîdoes not imply a condemnation of the flesh which the Son of God deigned to assume. On the contrary, mortification aims at the 'liberation' of man.‚Äù Pain, human nature, and Christ Theologians also state that the Son, the second person of the Trinity, united himself, as a person (through the hypostatic union), to everything human (except sin), including pain. Venerable Matt Talbot (May 2, 1856 June-7 June 1925) was an Irish worker whose life would have gone unnoticed were it not for the cords and chains discovered on his body when he died. Catholics believe that God, who in their view by his divine nature cannot change, has united with changing human nature, and therefore with human pain. The \\"I\\" of the Second Person suffers and feels pain. He is one with pain through Jesus Christ. Thus Christ's experience of pain (like all the human acts of Christ like sleeping, crying, speaking) whose subject is the divine Person is an infinite act. This is based on the classic dictum that the acts belong to the Person (actiones sunt suppositorum). It is the Person who acts: It is God who walks, God who talks, God who is killed, and God who is in pain. Thus a Christian who is united to Jesus Christ through pain is one with his infinite act of saving the world. This also goes together with another dictum in theology: whatever is not united (to the Divine Person) is not saved. Thus, his intellect, his will, his feelings, are all united with the Person, and are all sanctified and redeemed, including pain. Pain is therefore a sanctified and redeeming human experience. The salvific meaning of suffering John Paul II, who according to a recently released book on his sainthood cause practiced self-flagellation and fasting before important events, wrote an entire apostolic letter on the topic of suffering, specifically the salvific meaning of suffering: Salvifici Doloris. It is considered a major contribution to the theology of pain and suffering.https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp- ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html He wrote this after suffering from a bullet wound due to the assassination attempt of Ali Agca. Six weeks after meeting his attacker, he wrote about suffering in Christianity. Pope John Paul II: \\"Suffering, more than anything else, makes present in the history of humanity the powers of the Redemption.\\" > \\"Christ did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering. He said > very clearly: \\"If any man would come after me... let him take up his cross > daily, and before his disciples he placed demands of a moral nature that can > only be fulfilled on condition that they should \\"deny themselves\\". The way > that leads to the Kingdom of heaven is \\"hard and narrow\\", and Christ > contrasts it to the \\"wide and easy\\" way that \\"leads to destruction.\\" Christ > does not explain in the abstract the reasons for suffering, but he states: > \\"Follow me!\\". Come! Take part through your suffering in this work of saving > the world, a salvation achieved through my suffering! Through my Cross. > Gradually, as the individual takes up his cross, spiritually uniting himself > to the Cross of Christ, the salvific meaning of suffering is revealed before > him. ...It is then that man finds in his suffering interior peace and even > spiritual joy.\\" Joy in suffering Saint Paul speaks of joy in suffering in Colossians: \\"I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake\\". He had found a source of joy in overcoming the sense of the uselessness of suffering. He states that it is suffering, more than anything else, which clears the way for the grace which transforms human souls. Suffering, more than anything else, makes present in the history of humanity the powers of the Redemption. St. Louis de Montfort's prayer to the Virgin Mary includes, in his request to become more like Mary, the clauses \\"to suffer joyfully without human consolation; to die continually to myself without respite\\". Louis de Montfort was a strong advocate of finding joy and holiness in suffering. Those who have completed his 33-day Total Consecration to Jesus to Mary often wear a metal chain around their wrist or ankle. While this is not necessarily mortification, it represents a constant reminder of one's voluntary spiritual enslavement to Jesus through Mary, and the desire to accept suffering as a gift and offer it to God. The need for prudence The Desert Fathers emphasize that mortification is a means, not an end. They generally recommended prudence when practising mortification, with severe mortifications done only under the guidance of an experienced spiritual director. Consequently, practising mortification for physical pleasure is seen as a sin. Likewise, mortification for reasons of scrupulosity (which is similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder) is considered very harmful: a contemporary example is fasting due to anorexia nervosa. Catholic moral theologians recommend that the scrupulous not practice mortification, avoid persons and materials of an ascetical nature, and receive frequent spiritual direction and psychological help.1 Not all forms of self-mortification are approved of by the Catholic Church. Practices such as the nonlethal crucifixions performed on Good Friday in the Philippines are generally frowned upon by Catholic officials. Participants imitate various parts of the Passion of Christ, including his crucifixion. The spectacle draws a large amount of tourism every year.https://web.archive.org/web/20071205192939/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37299 Describing Catholic guilt and scrupulosity as a possible outcome of Catholic belief and practice, Martin Luther stated:Luther's Church postils, Twenty- Fourth Sunday After Trinity, published in The Precious and Sacred Writings of Martin Luther, Volume 14, edited by John Nicholas Lenker, 1905 See also *Mortification (theology) *Mortification of the flesh * Criticism of the Catholic Church ¬ß Associated psychology References External links * Catholic penitential practices Asceticism ","title":"Mortification in Catholic theology"},{"id":"19101195","text":"Canady may refer to: * Alexa Canady, a medical doctor. * Charles T.

The other main gas terminals are at St Fergus, Aberdeenshire; Bacton, Norfolk; Teesside; Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire and Rampside gas terminal, Barrow, Cumbria. The whole site consists of four plants: two run by Perenco, one by Centrica and one by Gassco. The Easington Gas Terminals are protected by Ministry of Defence Police officers and are provided with resources by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. History BP Easington Terminal opened in March 1967. This was the first time that North Sea Gas had been brought ashore in the UK from the West Sole field. In 1980 British Gas purchased the field Rough and in 1983 began conversion to a storage field. BP Dimlington opened in October 1988. BP's Ravenspurn North field was added in 1990 and the Johnston field was added in 1994. The Easington Catchment Area was added in 2000, and the Juno development in 2003. Discovery of gas in the North Sea Britain's first oil rig, the Sea Gem, first discovered gas in the North Sea on 20 August 1965. It was not a large enough field, but at the time it was not even known that there was a large amount of gas under the North Sea. Unfortunately the rig sank in December later that year, when it capsized. The Forties and Brent oilfields were discovered later in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Langeled pipeline Since October 2006, gas has been brought into the UK direct from the Norwegian Sleipner gas field via the Langeled pipeline, the world's longest subsea pipeline before the completion of the Nord Stream pipeline, owned by Gassco which itself is owned by the Kingdom of Norway. Operation The sites are run by and gas is produced by Perenco (after BP sold its operations to them in 2012), Gassco and Centrica Storage Ltd. Gas can be transferred to and from the Centrica Storage plant at Easington dependent on grid demand. The control of the Perenco sites takes place at the Dimlington site, and conditioning of the gas also takes place there. The function that is at the Perenco Easington site is the connection to the National Transmission System. Gas flows from the Easington terminal via a 24-inch diameter, pipeline known as Feeder No 1 across the Humber to Totley near Sheffield. Perenco Easington used to compress gas as well, but from 2007‚Äì9, the construction of the ¬£125 million Onshore Compression and Terminal Integration Project (OCTIP) situated all compression and processing from the gas fields at the Dimlington site. As part of the facility, two RB211-GT61 gas turbines, built by Rolls Royce Energy Systems in Mount Vernon, Ohio, were installed in a ¬£12.7 million contract. The Langeled pipeline collects gas - around 20% of the UK's needs - from the Nyhamna Gas Plant, and the Ormen Lange gas field; from 2006-11, the Langeled pipeline was the longest undersea pipeline in the world Centrica Rough Terminal The Rough (facility) is a partially depleted offshore gas field that was converted for storage by British Gas. It is currently operated by Centrica Storage Ltd (a subsidiary of Centrica). The Rough Terminal also processes gas for the newly developed York field. The Rough Terminal used to receive gas from the Amethyst gasfield which was until 1988 owned by Britoil but this is now processed by Perenco. Since 2013 The Rough Terminal has also processed gas from the York field on behalf of Centrica Energy. Langeled Receiving Facilities The Langeled pipeline, which is controlled at the UK end by Gassco (Centrica Storage Ltd before 2011), can transfer up to 2,500 m cubic feet of gas per day from Nyhamna in Norway. Perenco Easington The gas is collected from the Hyde, Hoton, Newsham and West Sole natural gas fields. It can process up to 300 m cubic feet of gas per day. A gas turbine power generator is used to compress the gas. Perenco Dimlington Dimlington is the larger site of the four. The natural gas condensate is transferred to the Dimlington terminal. Dimlington also processes dry gas from the (former) Cleeton, Ravenspurn South, Ravenspurn North, Johnston, the Easington Catchment Area (Neptune and Mercury), and the Juno development (Whittle, Wollaston, Minerva and Apollo) gas fields. The Dimlington site has the control room for all of Perenco's gas fields that ship gas to the Easington site. Dimlington can handle up to 950m cubic feet of gas per day. Fire risk All four sites are a considerable fire hazard, so both have large water reservoirs for fire fighting containing about one million and three million litres of water each. View from the north in November 2008 Dimlington gas fields Cleeton Cleeton and Ravenspurn South form part of the Villages Complex. Both were discovered in 1976. Gas production began in April 1987. Production stopped in 1999. Now used as a hub for the Easington Catchment Area. Named after the scientist, Claud E. Cleeton. Ravenspurn South Discovered in April 1983, off the East Riding of Yorkshire coast. Gas production began in October 1989. Gas via Cleeton to Dimlington. Named after Ravenspurn, the former coastal town. Owned and operated by Perenco. Ravenspurn North Discovered in October 1984 and developed in April 1988 by Hamilton Brothers. First gas produced in October 1989, and BP took over the operatorship of the field from BHP on 12 January 1998. Gas via Cleeton to Dimlington. Operated by Perenco and owned mostly by them, with smaller parts owned by Centrica Resources Ltd and E.ON Ruhrgas UK EU Ltd. Johnston Operated by E.ON Ruhrgas, and previously to them, Caledonia EU, and also by Consort EU Ltd. Discovered in April 1990. Gas first produced in October 1994. Pipeline to Dimlington via Ravenspurn North and Cleeton. Owned 50% by Dana Petroleum (E&P;) Ltd and E.ON Ruhrgas UK EU Ltd.

Easington Catchment Area Consists of Neptune and Mercury fields. Operated by BG Group. Transported to Dimlington via BP's Cleeton. Mercury discovered in February 1983 and production started in November 1999. Named after the planet Mercury. 73% owned by BG Group. Neptune discovered in November 1985 and production started in November 1999. Named after the planet Neptune. 79% owned by BG Group. Juno development These are the most recent of the Dimlington gas fields. Named after Juno, the Roman goddess. BG Group operates the Minerva, Apollo and Artemis fields, and owns 65% of these fields. Production started in 2003. Artemis was discovered in August 1974, and named after Artemis the Greek hunter goddess. Apollo was discovered in July 1987, named after Apollo the Greek sungod, brother of Artemis. Minerva was discovered in January 1969, named after the Roman goddess Minerva. BP operates the Whittle and Wollaston fields. They are 30% owned by BG Group. Production started in 2002. Wollaston was discovered in April 1989, and named after William Hyde Wollaston, the Norfolk chemist. Whittle was discovered in July 1990, and named after Frank Whittle. Easington gas fields These fields are around off the East Riding of Yorkshire coast. These fields are connected to the national grid by BP and Rough Terminals. West Sole Discovered in December 1965, east of the Humber. It is a faulted dome whose maximum dimensions are about wide, lying at a depth of . The reservoir comprises about of Permian Rotliegendes sandstone, and the gas has a high methane content and low nitrogen (1.3%). Gas first produced in March 1967. It had initial recoverable reserves of 61 billion m3. Owned and operated by BP until 2012. Acquired by Perenco 2012 Hyde Discovered in May 1982. Gas first produced in August 1993. Was owned 55% by BP and 45% by Statoil. BP took control in January 1997, in exchange for its Jupiter gas field. Newsham Discovered in October 1989. Production began March 1996. Enters the West Sole pipeline. Owned and operated by BP. Hoton Discovered in February 1977. Gas first produced in December 2001. Owned and operated by BP. Named after Hoton, one of the East Riding of Yorkshire lost villages that fell into the sea due to coastal erosion. Amethyst East and West Amethyst East discovered in October 1972 and Amethyst West in April 1970. Owned 59.5% by BP, 24% by BG Group, 9% by Centrica, and 7.5% by Murphy. Amethyst East began in October 1990 and Amethyst West in July 1992. Control of the platform is entirely from Dimlington and therefore operated by BP. Comprises the Amethyst gasfield. Acquired by Perenco 2012 Rough Discovered in May 1968. It had initial recoverable reserves of 14 billion m3. Gas production began in 1975, and it was bought by British Gas in 1980. In 1983, they decided to convert it into gas storage. The gas storage started February 1985. As a depleted gas field, it is used as a storage facility, for essentially the whole of the UK, giving four days worth of gas. Originally owned by BG Storage Ltd (BGSL), who were bought by Dynegy Europe Ltd in November 2001 for ¬£421 million. BGSL became known as Dynegy Storage Ltd, based in Solihull. This company was bought by Centrica on 14 November 2002 for ¬£304 million. Centrica was essentially buying the Easington plant. To operate the field Centrica has to comply with a set of undertakings laid down by DECC and Ofgem due to its unique position in the UK gas market. York Owned and operated by Centrica. Gas back to Centrica Rough Terminal via new pipeline. Helvellyn Discovered in February 1985 with the first gas coming on stream in 2004. Operated by ATP Oil and Gas.

It differs substantially from the mining laws of other common law countries, the most important differences arising from the policy decision that the Crown should own all minerals.  History of mining law  The first Australian mining laws were enacted in 1851. A proclamation by Charles Fitzroy, Governor of New South Wales, on 22 May 1851 asserted the Crown's right to all gold discovered in New South Wales. The Victorian Governor issued a similar proclamation on 16 August 1851. In January 1852, Victoria enacted the Mining Act 1852 (repealed) supplemented by the Mining Act 1853 (repealed). Before that, ownership of minerals and petroleum passed to those who were granted title to land by the colonial governors according to common law concepts, except the right to \\"Royal Mines\\" (the precious metals of gold and silver) which remained vested in the Crown by virtue of Royal prerogative. From 1855, colonial parliaments legislated for ownership of minerals to be retained by the Crown in future grants of freehold title. Thus, the situation developed where throughout Australia, the crown in right of the State owns nearly all the minerals.  Legislation  In relation to minerals situated within state boundaries, first sight, the power to legislate for minerals remains with the states. However, despite the fact that the Constitution of Australia does not list minerals as an area over which the Federal Parliament has jurisdiction, a number of the Commonwealth Parliament's powers encompass matters relevant to mining operations and any legislation of the Commonwealth based upon these powers will override any inconsistent State legislation. As to Commonwealth jurisdiction over the Territories, the constitutional limitations regarding mining operations conducted within the States have no application in the Northern Territory, or other Australian territories. Each of the States and Territories has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and production of onshore minerals.ACT: Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991; Northern Territory: Mining Act 1980; NSW: Mining Act 1992; Queensland: Mineral Resources Act 1989; South Australia: Mining Act 1971; Tasmania: Mineral Resources Development Act 1995; Victoria: Mineral Resources Development Act 1990; Western Australia: Mining Act 1978. The Commonwealth has no onshore mining legislation which is applicable in the States or Territories. As to offshore minerals, the Commonwealth has sovereignty in respect of the territorial sea, and sovereign rights in respect of both the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone for the purpose of exploitation of their natural resources. Thus, the sovereignty over minerals of the States and the Northern Territory extends only to the low- water mark and it is the Commonwealth which is entitled under international law to exercise sovereignty over minerals under the territorial sea, within the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf. However, following an agreement negotiated between the Commonwealth Government and the States in 1979, the Commonwealth conferred power on the States and the Northern Territory to make laws for matters including mining operations in respect of the coastal waters and granted them proprietary rights to the seabed. In addition, the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules contain special provisions governing the conduct and reporting requirements of mining companies.  Ownership of minerals  According to the maxim \\"to whomsoever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths\\", there is a presumption that a land owner also owns all minerals on or beneath the surface of that land.The original maxim is Latin: cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et usque ad inferos. It was applied in a mining context in Commonwealth v New South Wales (1923) 33 CLR 1 at 23. The presumption is subject to the exception of the Royal metals. As early as the sixteenth century, the common law has held that all gold and silver, whether situated on public or private land, has been owned by the Crown.Case of Mines (1567) 1 Plowd 310; 75 ER 472. This Royal prerogative has also been applied in Australia, by both common lawWoolley v A-G (Vic) (1877) LR 2 App Cas 163 at 167‚Äì8 and legislation.(New South Wales) Mining Act 1992 s 379 (gold and silver mines); (Queensland) Mineral Resources Act 1989 s 8 (all minerals); (South Australia) Mining Act 1971 s 16 (all minerals); (Tasmania) Mineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4) (gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances); (Victoria) Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9 (most minerals); (Western Australia) Mining Act 1978 s 9 (all precious metal, and all other minerals not alienated from the Crown before 1 January 1899). However, the principle of the owner of land owning the minerals within it has been virtually abolished by statute in Australia . The general rule is that the Crown (in right of the State) owns all minerals. This has been implemented by statute; initially by enacting that all future grants of land must contain a reservation to the Crown of all minerals. Now, all new grants of freehold titles in Australia have provided that all minerals were reserved to the Crown. In respect of titles granted prior to the legislation, the owner of the land retained ownership of the minerals (except the Royal metals of gold and silver). That owner may grant a profit √† prendre to enter and take minerals. Crown ownership of minerals has been made universal in VictoriaMineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9. and South AustraliaMining Act 1971 s 16. by legislative expropriation of all minerals. In TasmaniaMineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4). and New South Wales,Coal Acquisition Act 1981. this approach of legislative expropriation has been applied on a selective basis (in Tasmania, for gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances, and, in New South Wales, for coal). The Crown, pursuant to statute, may grant various leases or licences to enter onto land and take minerals. State ownership of minerals has had the important result that governments, rather than private landholders, determine the legal regimes governing mineral exploration and production.  Ratified agreements  Large mining operations are likely to be regulated by a ratified agreement, sometimes also called a \\"state agreement\\", an \\"agreement act\\", a \\"franchise agreement\\", a \\"government agreement\\" or a \\"special agreement act\\". The basis of such an agreement is that the State contracts with the miner in the form of a written agreement which is ratified by a statute of that State or Territory Parliament. This ratification ensures that the provisions of the negotiated agreement have legislative effect and override any inconsistent provisions under the general mining legislation or any other statutes of that State or Territory. Ratified agreements have been used throughout Australia to establish large, export-oriented mining projects since the 1950s. They have been most extensively used in West Australia, where a high proportion of large mining projects continue to operate under such arrangements.See Anne M Fitzgerald, \\"Mining Agreements: Negotiated frameworks in the Australian minerals sector\\" (2001), at http://eprints.qut.edu.au/34063/ See also * Energy law References Further reading *Michael W.

The ultimate objective of placing medium-range missiles under the ice ‚Äî close enough to strike targets within the Soviet Union ‚Äî was kept secret from the Government of Denmark. To study the feasibility of working under the ice, a highly publicized \\"cover\\" project, known as Camp Century, was launched in 1960. Unstable ice conditions within the ice sheet caused the project to be canceled in 1966.  Political background  Portable nuclear power plant Camp Century Layout in color Layout plan of Camp Century Details of the missile base project were secret for decades, but first came to light in January 1995 during an enquiry by the Danish Foreign Policy Institute (DUPI) into the history of the use and storage of nuclear weapons in Greenland. The enquiry was ordered by the Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark following the release of previously classified information about the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash that contradicted previous assertions by the Government of Denmark.  Description  To test the feasibility of construction techniques a project site called \\"Camp Century\\" was started by the United States military, located at an elevation of in Northwestern Greenland, from the American Thule Air Base. The radar and air base at Thule had already been in active use since 1951. Camp Century was described at the time as a demonstration of affordable ice-cap military outposts. The secret Project Iceworm was to be a system of tunnels in length, used to deploy up to 600 nuclear missiles, that would be able to reach the Soviet Union in case of nuclear war. The missile locations would be under the cover of Greenland's ice sheet and were supposed to be periodically changed. While Project Iceworm was secret, plans for Camp Century were discussed with and approved by the Kingdom of Denmark; the facility, including its nuclear power plant, was profiled in The Saturday Evening Post magazine in 1960. The \\"official purpose\\" of Camp Century, as explained by the United States Department of Defense to Danish officials in 1960, was to test various construction techniques under Arctic conditions, explore practical problems with a semi-mobile nuclear reactor, as well as supporting scientific experiments on the icecap.; official purpose and size and length of Camp Century tunnels given on p.78. A total of 21 trenches were cut and covered with arched roofs within which prefabricated buildings were erected. With a total length of , these tunnels also contained a hospital, a shop, a theater and a church. The total number of inhabitants was around 200. From 1960 until 1963, the electricity supply was provided by means of the world's first mobile/portable nuclear reactor, designated PM-2A and designed by Alco for the U.S. Army.The U.S. Army's Top Secret Arctic City Under the Ice! \\"Camp Century\\" Restored Classified Film Water was supplied by melting glaciers and tested to determine whether germs such as the plague were present. Within three years after it was excavated, ice core samples taken by geologists working at Camp Century demonstrated that the glacier was moving much faster than anticipated and would destroy the tunnels and planned launch stations in about two years. The facility was evacuated in 1965, and the nuclear generator removed. Project Iceworm was canceled, and Camp Century closed in 1966. The project generated valuable scientific information and provided scientists with some of the first ice cores, still being used by climatologists today.  Size of proposed missile complex  According to the documents published by the Kingdom of Denmark in 1997, the U.S. Army's \\"Iceworm\\" missile network was outlined in a 1960 Army report titled \\"Strategic Value of the Greenland Icecap\\". If fully implemented, the project would cover an area of , roughly three times the size of Denmark. The launch complex floors would be below the surface, with the missile launchers even deeper, and clusters of missile launch centers would be spaced apart. New tunnels were to be dug every year, so that after five years there would be thousands of firing positions, among which the several hundred missiles could be rotated. The Army intended to deploy a shortened, two-stage version of the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman missile, a variant the Army proposed calling the Iceman.  Sheet ice elasticity  Although the Greenland icecap appears, on its surface, to be hard and immobile, snow and ice are viscoelastic materials, which slowly deform over time, depending on temperature and density. Despite its seeming stability, the icecap is in constant, slow movement, spreading outward from the center. This spreading movement, over the course of a year, causes tunnels and trenches to narrow, as their walls deform and bulge, eventually leading to a collapse of the ceiling. By mid-1962 the ceiling of the reactor room within Camp Century had dropped and had to be lifted . During a planned reactor shutdown for maintenance in late July 1963, the Army decided to operate Camp Century as a summer-only camp and did not reactivate the PM-2A reactor. The camp resumed operations in 1964 using its standby diesel power plant, the portable reactor was removed that summer, and the camp was abandoned altogether in 1966.  Ecological impact  When the camp was decommissioned in 1967, its infrastructure and waste were abandoned under the assumption they would be entombed forever by perpetual snowfall. A 2016 study found that the portion of the ice sheet covering Camp Century will start to melt by 2100, if current trends continue. When the ice melts, the camp‚Äôs infrastructure, as well as remaining biological, chemical and radioactive waste, will re-enter the environment and potentially disrupt nearby ecosystems. This includes 200,000 liters of diesel, PCBs and radioactive waste.

The 1 percent rule states that a 1% per annum risk (See also Risk management) of medical incapacitation is the threshold between acceptable and unacceptable. In other words: This 1 percent rule began in the late 1980s and early 1990s in a series of British and then European aviation cardiology workshops. The application of this \\"1 percent rule\\" has subsequently spread beyond the domain of aviation cardiology to all potential causes of medical incapacitation. The reasoning that was used in the development of the original aviation medical 1 percent rule is well described in Flight Safety and Medical Incapacitation Risk of Airline Pilots (see references). In this article the authors argue that changes in the underlying assumptions, that were the basis of the 1 percent rule, have been such that a 2 percent rule may be an appropriate modern analogue. The application of this one percent rule is controversial. The civil aviation regulatory authorities of some nations employ such numerical risk thresholds while others do not. Of those that use numerical risk criteria there are differences in the levels of measured / calculated risk that are applied (1% per annum, 2% per annum etc.). There is also debate concerning the application of population statistics to an individual pilot and the utility and validity of the risk screening tools that are used by the civil aviation regulatory authorities (e.g. data from the Framingham Heart Study).

It was adapted by Clive Exton from the book Ten Rillington Place by Ludovic Kennedy (who also acted as technical advisor to the production). The film dramatises the case of British serial killer John Christie, who committed many of his crimes in the titular London terraced house, and the miscarriage of justice involving his neighbour Timothy Evans. Hurt received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Evans. Plot The film begins in 1944 with John Christie murdering an acquaintance called Muriel Eady; he lures her to his flat in 10 Rillington Place by promising to cure her bronchitis with a \\"special mixture\\", then incapacitates her with Town Gas, strangles her with a piece of rope, and has (implied) sex with her corpse. He buries her in his flat block's communal garden, where a dog uncovers one of his previous victims. In 1949, Tim and Beryl Evans move into 10 Rillington Place, west London, with their infant daughter Geraldine. Beryl is pregnant again and attempts an abortion by taking some pills. When she informs Tim, they have a violent argument, which Christie breaks up. Soon after, Christie offers to help Beryl terminate the pregnancy. He pretends to read a medical textbook one day in an effort to convince Tim of his expertise. Tim is essentially illiterate and cannot tell that Christie is lying. The Evanses agree to let Christie perform the procedure. Christie occupies his wife, Ethel, by sending her to his place of work with some paperwork. He grabs his killing tools, makes a cup of tea, and heads upstairs to Beryl. He is interrupted by a couple of builders who arrive to renovate the outbuilding. He lets them in, and when he sees they are well-occupied, he pours a new cup of tea and heads back upstairs. Beryl has a violent reaction to the gas, and Christie punches her in the face to knock her out. He then strangles and sexually assaults her. When Tim returns, Christie tells him that Beryl died of complications from the procedure. Tim wants to go to the police, but Christie convinces him that he will be seen as an accessory before the fact. Christie suggests that Tim leave town that night, while Christie disposes of Beryl's body. He promises that he will place the baby in the care of a childless couple from East Acton. Tim reluctantly agrees, and leaves the house in the middle of the night. Christie then strangles Geraldine with a tie. Tim hides out with his aunt and uncle in Merthyr Tydfil, pretending that he is in town on business. He claims that Beryl and the baby are visiting her family in Brighton. Tim's relatives send a letter to Beryl's father, who sends a telegram in response to say that he has not seen Beryl in months. When confronted by his relatives, Tim pretends Beryl had run away with a rich man and then visits the local police station. He confesses to disposing of Beryl's body in the sewer after the botched abortion. Three London police officers lift the manhole, but do not find Beryl's body. A search of 10 Rillington Place eventually uncovers the bodies of Beryl and the baby in the washroom, where Christie hid them. When Tim is brought back to London, he is charged with the murders of his wife and daughter. In shock, and despondent over the news, he confesses to both crimes, though he is guilty of neither. During his trial, Christie is a key witness. Tim's defence shreds Christie's credibility by revealing that he has a history of theft and violence. Nevertheless, Tim is found guilty and hanged. Two years after the trial, Ethel begins to fear her husband, and informs Christie she will move out to stay with relatives. When he begs her not to leave him, Ethel implies that he should be in prison. Christie murders her that night and hides her body under the floorboards in their front room. Later, he meets a woman suffering from a migraine in a caf√©. He pretends to be an ex-doctor and promises her a cure. He is next seen putting fresh wallpaper on a wall in his kitchen; it is implied that he has hidden the woman's body in the space behind the wall. In 1953, Christie is living in a dosshouse. Meanwhile, new tenants are moving into the Christies‚Äô flat. They complain about the awful smell and one of them peels off the wallpaper to find a space behind the wall, where he finds three of Christie's victims. Soon afterwards, Christie is noticed by a police officer in Putney and arrested. The film ends with an intertitle explaining that Christie was hanged and Tim was posthumously pardoned and reinterred in consecrated ground. Cast Production The film was adapted by Clive Exton from the book Ten Rillington Place by Ludovic Kennedy.Variety film review; 10 February 1971. The film relies on the same argument advanced by Kennedy that Evans was innocent of the murders and was framed by Christie. That argument was accepted by the Crown and Evans was officially pardoned by Home Secretary Roy Jenkins in 1966. The case is one of the first major miscarriages of justice known to have occurred in the immediate postwar period. Most of the script, narrative and character development of it was drawn up in the 1960s. In 1954, the year after Christie's execution, Rillington Place in Notting Hill, west London, was renamed Ruston Close, but number 10 continued to be occupied. In the 2016 documentary 'Being Beryl' on the UK Blu-ray, the actress Judy Geeson revealed that the family living at number 10 in 1970 were too afraid to move out temporarily in fear of not being allowed back, so exterior scenes and window shots were filmed at the nearby number 7, however in some shots the family clearly agreed Richard Attenborough some access to number 10, certainly in one scene you can see Richard Attenborough standing looking out of the bay window of number 10 (filmed outside from the street) and in other scenes going in and coming out the front door of number 10, (again all filmed from the street), the interior sets were used at Shepperton Studios in London. The house and street were demolished shortly after the film was completed and the area redeveloped beyond all recognition. A small communal garden occupies a spot directly in front of the former number 10 location, whilst apartments built in the late 1970‚Äôs cover its exact location. None of the roadways today follow what was Rillington Place. Filming also took place in the village of Merthyr Vale, the real life hometown of Timothy Evans. The pub scenes were filmed at the Victoria Hotel on Burdett Road in east London. The pub was subsequently demolished as part of the redevelopment of the area in 1972‚Äì73. Richard Attenborough, who played Christie in the film, spoke of his reluctance to accept the role: \\"I do not like playing the part, but I accepted it at once without seeing the script. I have never felt so totally involved in any part as this. It is a most devastating statement on capital punishment.\\" The film was produced by Leslie Linder and Martin Ransohoff. Hangman Albert Pierrepoint, who had hanged both Evans and Christie, served as an uncredited technical advisor on the film to ensure the authenticity of the hanging scene. Reception At the time of the film's release, reviews were mixed. Variety's critic wrote \\"Richard Fleischer has turned out an authenticated documentary- feature which is an absorbing and disturbing picture. But the film has the serious flaw of not even attempting to probe the reasons that turned a man into a monstrous pervert.\\" Praise went to John Hurt for his \\"remarkably subtle and fascinating performance as the bewildered young man who plays into the hands of both the murderer and the police.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times described 10 Rillington Place as \\"a solemn, earnest polemic of a movie, one with very little vulgar suspense ... The problem with the film is very much the problem with the actual case, which involved small, unimaginative people.\\" The film has since risen in stature with critics. In a 2009 review, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote, \\"More highly regarded these days than when it was released in 1971, Richard Fleischer's 10 Rillington Place is a grimly efficient treatment of a once-notorious case\\". The same year, Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film a 5-star review and described it as an \\"underseen gem\\". In an interview with Robert K. Elder in his book The Best Film You've Never Seen, director Sean Durkin states that 10 Rillington Place \\"depicts this story the way that a piece of journalism might, as opposed to worrying about preconceived notions of what a film should achieve.\\" Tom Hardy of the British Film Institute has noted Attenborough's ability at \\"getting into the flesh of the paranoid and the distressed\\", describing the film as a \\"detailed account of life under the shadow of World War II [which] is powerful and compelling\\". John Hurt received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Whether powered by sail, kite or rotor, these vehicles share a common trait: As the vehicle increases in speed, the advancing airfoil encounters an increasing apparent wind at an angle of attack that is increasingly smaller. At the same time, such vehicles are subject to relatively low forward resistance, compared with traditional sailing craft. As a result, such vehicles are often capable of speeds exceeding that of the wind. Rotor-powered examples have demonstrated ground speeds that exceed that of the wind, both directly into the wind and directly downwind by transferring power through a drive train between the rotor and the wheels. The wind-powered speed record is by a vehicle with a sail on it, Greenbird, with a recorded top speed of . Other wind-powered conveyances include sailing vessels that travel on water, and balloons and sailplanes that travel in the air, all of which are beyond the scope of this article. Sail-powered Sail-powered vehicles travel over land or ice at apparent wind speeds that are higher than the true wind speed, close-hauled on most points of sail. Both land yachts and ice boats have low forward resistance to speed and high lateral resistance to sideways motion. Theory broad reach. Aerodynamic forces on sails depend on wind speed and direction and the speed and direction of the craft ( VB ). The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface ‚Äì VT ) is called the point of sail. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( VA )‚Äîthe wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag‚Äîthe force component in the direction of the apparent wind‚Äîand lift‚Äîthe force component normal (90¬∞) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force‚Äîresisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)‚Äîand a lateral force, resisted by the wheels or ice runners of the vehicle. Because wind-powered vehicles typically sail at apparent wind angles aligned with the leading edge of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. Low forward resistance to motion, high speeds over the surface, and high lateral resistance help create high apparent wind speeds‚Äîwith closer alignment of the apparent wind to the course traveled for most points of sail‚Äîand allow wind-powered vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft. Land yacht Land sailing has evolved from a novelty, since the 1950s, primarily into a sport. The vehicles used in sailing are known as land or sand yachts. They typically have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing is best suited for windy flat areas; races often take place on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Greenbird, a sail-powered vehicle sponsored by Ecotricity, broke the land speed world record for a wind-powered vehicle in 2009 with a recorded top speed of , beating the previous record of at , set by Schumacher from the United States, riding Iron Duck in March 1999. Ice boat International DN iceboat Iceboats designs are generally supported by three skate blades called \\"runners\\" supporting a triangular or cross-shaped frame with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails. Once the lateral force has been effectively countered by the runner edge, the remaining force of \\"sail-lift\\" vacuums the boat forward with significant power. That power increases as the speed of the boat increases, allowing the boat to go much faster than the wind. Limitations to iceboat speed are windage, friction, the camber of the sail shape, strength of construction, and quality of the ice surface. Iceboats can sail as close as 7 degrees off the apparent wind. Ice boats can achieve speeds as high as ten times the wind speed in good conditions. International DN iceboats often achieve speeds of while racing, and speeds as high as have been recorded. Kite-powered Snow kiters travel over snow or ice. Kite-powered vehicles include buggies that one can ride in and boards that one can stand on as it slides over snow and ice or rolls on wheels over land. Theory A kite is a tethered air foil that creates both lift and drag, in this case anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides the face of the kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle. Kite buggy A kite buggy is a light, purpose-built vehicle powered by a power kite. It is single-seated and has one steerable front wheel and two fixed rear wheels. The driver sits in the seat located in the middle of the vehicle and accelerates and slows down by applying steering manoeuvres in coordination with flying manoeuvres of the kite. Kite buggies can reach . Kite board Kite boards of different description are used on dry land or on snow. Kite landboarding involves the use of a mountain board or land board‚Äîa skateboard with large pneumatic wheels and foot-straps. Snow kiting is an outdoor winter sport where people use kite power to glide on a board (or skis) over snow or ice. Rotor-powered The rotor-powered InVentus Ventomobile racing at the Aeolus Race 2008 Rotor-powered vehicles are wind- powered vehicles that use rotors‚Äîinstead of sails‚Äîwhich may have a shroud around them (ducted fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a vertical axis wind turbine with airfoils that rotate around a vertical axis. Theory Gaunaa, et al. describe the physics of rotor-powered vehicles. They describe two cases, one from the vantage point of the earth and the other from the vantage point of the air stream and come to the same conclusions from both frames of reference. They conclude that (apart from forces that resist forward motion): *There is no theoretical upper limit to how fast a rotor-driven craft can go directly upwind. *Likewise, there is no theoretical upper limit to how fast a rotor-driven craft can go directly downwind. These conclusions hold both for land and water craft. Required for wind-powered vehicle (or water craft) motion are: *Two masses moving with respect to each other, e.g. the air (as wind) and the earth (land or water). *The ability to change the velocity of either mass with a propellor or a wheel. In the case of a rotor-powered vehicle, there is a drive linkage between the rotor and the wheels. Depending on one's frame of reference‚Äîthe earth's surface or moving with the air mass‚Äîthe description of how available kinetic energy powers the vehicle differs: *As seen from the vantage point of the earth (e.g. by a spectator), the rotor (acting like a wind turbine) decelerates the air and drives the wheels against the earth, which it accelerates imperceptibly. *As seen from the vantage point of the air stream (e.g. by a balloonist), the wheels impede the vehicle‚Äîdecelerating the earth imperceptibly‚Äîand drive the rotor (acting like a propellor), which accelerates the air and propels the vehicle. The connection between the wheels and the rotor causes the rotor to rotate faster with increasing vehicle speed, thereby allowing the rotor blades to continue to obtain forward lift from the wind (as seen from the ground) or to propel the vehicle (as seen from the air stream). In 2009, Mark Drela‚Äîan MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics‚Äîproduced the first equations, demonstrating the feasibility of \\"Dead-Downwind Faster Than The Wind (DDWFTTW)\\". Other authors have come to the same conclusion. Fixed-course vehicles Competition rotor-powered vehicles: Ventomobile and winD TUrbine set for a drag race Several competitions have been held for rotor-powered vehicles. Notable among them is Racing Aeolus, an event held annually in the Netherlands. Participating universities build entries to determine the best and fastest wind-powered vehicle. The rules are that the vehicles ride on wheels, with one driver, propelled by a rotor, coupled to the wheels. Temporary storage of energy is allowed, if empty at the beginning of the race. Charging the storage device is counted as race time. Racing takes place towards the wind. Vehicles are judged by their fastest run, innovation, and the results of a series of drag races. In 2008, entrants were from: Stuttgart University, the Flensburg University of Applied Sciences, the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands, the Technical University of Denmark, the University of Applied Sciences of Kiel and the Christian Albrechts University of Kiel. Two top performers have been the \\"Ventomobile\\" and Spirit of Amsterdam (1 and 2). = Ventomobile = The Ventomobile was a wind-powered lightweight three-wheeler designed by University of Stuttgart students. It had a carbon- fiber rotor support that was directed into the wind and variably pitched rotor blades that adjust for wind speed. Power transmission between the rotor and the driving wheels was via two bicycle gearboxes and a bicycle chain. It won the first prize at the Racing Aeolus held at Den Helder, Netherlands, in August 2008. = Spirit of Amsterdam = The wind-powered land vehicles Spirit of Amsterdam and Spirit of Amsterdam 2 were built by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (University of Applied Science Amsterdam). In 2009 and 2010 the Spirit of Amsterdam team won first prize at the Racing Aeolus held in Denmark. The Spirit of Amsterdam 2 was the second vehicle built by the Hogeschool van, Amsterdam. It used a wind turbine to capture the wind velocity and used mechanical power to propel the vehicle against the wind. This vehicle was capable of driving with a wind. An onboard computer automatically shifted gears to achieve optimum performance. Straight-line vehicles Land yacht, Blackbird, straight-line rotor-powered vehicle, was designed to go faster than the wind, dead downwind. Some wind-powered vehicles are built solely to demonstrate a limited principle, e.g. the ability to go upwind or downwind faster than the prevailing windspeed. In 1969, Mark Bauer‚Äîa wind tunnel engineer for the Douglas Aircraft Company‚Äîbuilt and demonstrated a vehicle to go directly downwind faster than the windspeed, which was recorded in a video. He published the concept in the same year., Picture of Bauer with his cart In 2010, Rick Cavallaro‚Äîan aerospace engineer and computer technologist‚Äîbuilt and tested a wind-rotor-powered vehicle, Blackbird, with cooperation with the San Jose State University aviation department in a project sponsored by Google, to demonstrate the feasibility of going directly downwind faster than the wind. He achieved two validated milestones, going both directly downwind and upwind faster than the speed of the prevailing wind. *Downwind‚ÄîIn 2010, Blackbird set the world's first certified record for going directly downwind faster than the wind, using only wind power. The vehicle achieved a dead downwind speed of about 2.8 times the speed of the wind. In 2011 a streamlined Blackbird reached close to 3 times the speed of wind. *Upwind‚ÄîIn 2012, Blackbird set the world's first certified record for going directly upwind faster than the wind, using only wind power. The vehicle achieved a dead upwind speed of about 2.1 times the speed of the wind.

August 22, 2008.\\"They forgot me in Cairo\\" Yediot Achronot printed edition, weekend supplement. August 22, 2008. Illegal border crossings by the Bedouin residents of Israel and Egypt are not a rarity; Israel also occasionally arrests Egyptian crossers, who are returned over the border after a short interrogation. Ouda had previously crossed into Egypt; after his return to Israel, he was tried in absentia on charges of spying for Israel by an Egyptian military court. The stated basis of the prosecution was testimony given by Ouda's Egyptian cousin, Eid Suleiman, who was arrested for similar charges in 1999. The trial was conducted under Egypt's 1981 emergency law, granting police sweeping powers of arrest. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. When Ouda was arrested after again crossing into Egypt in 2000, he was informed of his trial and sentence, and that his father had been similarly sentenced in absentia to 25 years for espionage. Ouda, therefore, had no chance of defending himself in person. According to his family, he had done nothing wrong other than cross into Egypt without the proper documentation. Tarabin was incarcerated in a Cairo prison, in the same cell which Azzam Azzam was once held in. Druze MK Ayoob Kara met with Tarabin's family to work to secure his release. In May 2012, it was reported that Israeli officials were conducting secret negotiations with Egypt, and were discussing the possibility of releasing all 83 Egyptians incarcerated in Israeli prisons in exchange for Tarabin. In 2013, Tarabin went on hunger strike in protest of his imprisonment. In December 2015, Tarabin was released from prison.

He was the Governor of Zambales since 2019, previously held this position from 2010 until 2016. He was also the Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways from 2005 to February 2007 and again from July 2007 to 2009. He was a member of the Philippine Military Academy class of 1970, and has a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) from the Map√∫a Institute of Technology. Career Ebdane was the 10th Chief of the Philippine National Police serving from July 2002 to 23 August 2004. After the escape from jail of Islamic militant Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi on 14 July 2003, Ebdane stated he would be satisfied with any recovery, including \\"even if he is dead and torn to pieces\\". He went to view the body after Al-Ghozi was shot dead by police on 13 October 2003, saying the militant was killed in a brief gunfight after opening fire at a military checkpoint. One of the demands of the Oakwood mutiny on 27 July 2003 was the resignation of Ebdane as national police chief, but the mutiny was unsuccessful and short-lived. He was chief of the PNP during the Hello Garci scandal, and admitted providing a vehicle to Virgilio Garcillano, but only when Garcillano was still with the Commission on Elections. He said violence for the May 2004 election was lower than previous years. After serving as the chief of the PNP, Ebdane was named National Security Adviser, a post he held from August 2004 to February 2005. In February 2005, he was appointed to a cabinet position as Secretary of Public Works and Highways, which he returned to in July 2007, after serving as Secretary of National Defense from February 2007.

It is managed by Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust. History In 1887, to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, a public fund was started with the aim of building a hospital, and the site for Southend's first hospital was bought for ¬£350 (in Warrior Square, near to Southend High Street). Built at a cost of ¬£1,287 4s 6d, Southend Victoria Hospital was opened in May 1888. By Christmas, with eight beds and two cots, it had treated 61 patients at an average weekly cost of 4s 6d (22.5p). In order to allow expansion a new site was identified at Westcliff-on-Sea: building work on the new hospital, which was designed by Henry Percy Adams, began in 1930 and the new building was officially opened by the Rt. Hon Earl of Iveagh in 1932. In 1948, when the hospital joined the National Health Service, there were 24 consultants and 11 resident medical staff. The Tower Block was officially opened by Princess Anne in 1971. In December 2013, chief executive Jacqueline Totterdell announced that the Trust was considering merging some functions with other local hospitals. The trust was the only one in England not to follow the Agenda for Change conditions of service for its staff, but in January 2019 it decided to revert to the national contract.  Teaching  The hospital serves as a teaching hospital for medical students from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. Transport Local bus routes 7 and 8 operated by Arriva and 20, 21 and 25 operated by First, serve the hospital.

The perpetrators were shown to have killed mostly elderly patients using the muscle relaxant pancuronium (brand name Pavulon).This is one of the drugs administered during a lethal injection in the United States.

Also the founder and current promoter for NCW, he and longtime tag team partner The Hungarian Barbarian, became the promotion's tag team champions in 2007. As well, they won numerous regional tag team titles on the independent circuit. He and The Hungarian Barbarian were part of The Pack, a heel stable which dominated Hardway Wrestling and several other Northeastern independent promotions during the 1990s, before their break up and subsequent feud with The Bad Crew. He was frequently billed as the 6-time undisputed world \\"welterweight\\" champion as well as a former NWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion.\\"NCW announces HUGE 3-Way Dance Tag Team Match for April 22.\\" _DeclarationofIndependents.net._ Apr. 2006. 30 Aug. 2008 . A former star high school baseball player, Wyse is also a semi-professional bowler and has competed in numerous local, regional and national tournaments. Career Early life and career Born in York, Pennsylvania, Wyse was a fan of the World Wide Wrestling Federation as a child. He attended his first live event at the Harrisburg Zembo Temple where Dean Ho & Tony Garea took on Bobby Duncum & Killer Kowalski in the main event. Dean Ho would remain a fan of his for much of his childhood. Wyse made his professional debut on July 3, 1987, appearing as the manager of King Kahlua in his match against WWF veteran Jimmy Londos at a National Wrestling Federation show at the Reading Phillies Municipal Stadium in Reading, Pennsylvania. Other wrestlers who appeared at the event included The Fantastics (Tommy Rogers & Bobby Fulton), Chief Jules Strongbow, Damien Kane and Abdullah the Butcher. Wyse played baseball during high school and, although he was seen by several scouts, various injuries would keep him out of professional baseball. He eventually trained with Damien Kane at the Mason-Dixon Wrestling Alliance, attending with Guido Falcone, until the school closed. He later trained at Larry Sharpe's Monster Factory and worked for his promotion during his early career. During this time, he also became close friends with Chris Candido and future NWA President Dennis Coraluzzo. At a show for Larry Sharpe at the Cherry Hill Race Track in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, he was noticed by Jerry Lawler and brought into the United States Wrestling Association where he faced Lawler, Bill Dundee, Jeff Jarrett and Billy Joe Travis. While in the USWA, he was one of several wrestlers to appear in the Dallas, Texas based World Class Championship Wrestling for Fritz Von Erich. He also became friends with Missy Hyatt, then managing John Tatum, and helped her during her early career on the independent circuit prior to joining World Championship Wrestling. He was also a founding member the Heart Throb Four with Flex Lavender, Johnny Gunn and Chris Candido in Joe Savoldi's New York/ New England based International World Class Championship Wrestling during the mid-1990s. Although they only appeared for a few matches, they frequently appeared on IWCCW television for years afterwards. National Championship Wrestling Wanting to wrestle in his hometown, Wyse held a wrestling event at his old junior high school around 1992. Although he had originally held the show so as to put some of his booking ideas to work, the show was so successful that he ran a second show several months later. He began holding fundraising events for the local recreation commission and eventually decided to run regular events in the York-Red Lion area under the National Championship Wrestling banner and opened a training center in York. He also became involved in WPW and Dan Kowal's Women's Extreme Wrestling. In 1999, he made an appearance on The Howard Stern Show promoting an upcoming NCW show featuring a member of Stern's \\"Wack Pack\\", Fred the Elephant Boy. Wyse also brought his wife, who appeared in his promotion as a ring card girl, as well another ring card girl as his alleged mistress. The premise was that the two knew about each other and that Howard Stern would \\"rate\\" them for Wyse. Both were rated as 10's by the gang. His appearance on the Howard Stern became one of the highest rated episodes in the show's history and was broadcast several times while in syndication on E!. He and his wife have since divorced. Wyse also worked in various independent promotions as a color commentator with announcer Chad \\"R.C.\\" Gerber, most notably, for Hardway Wrestling & Combat Zone Wrestling's Cage of Death III at the ECW Arena in December 2001. Although there were plans to bring in Wyse for a series of matches against Eddie Valentine, a dispute between him and independent wrestler Rockin' Rebel as well as scheduling conflicts caused the angle to be dropped. On March 9, 2002, Wyse also appeared on the second show for Iron Man Championship Wrestling at the Olivets Youth Center in downtown Reading, Pennsylvania. Recent years A longtime mainstay of Hardway Wrestling, an Allentown-based promotion owned by the tag team the Bad Crew, Wyse held the HW Hardcore Championship after defeating D-Man Davidson at Summer Spectacular in Northampton, Pennsylvania on July 11, 2003. He held the title for nearly a year before losing the title back to Davidson on June 30, 2004. Wyse and The Hungarian Barbarian began teaming together and won the tag team titles from the Bad Crew at the Farmerama Arena in Allentown on September 5. They had previously faced each other in a 12-man Barbed Wire Steel Cage match at Cage Terror I between Bad Crew, Tiny, Pinky, and George Anthony vs. Adam Flash, L.A. Smooth, Danny Rose, Jay Love and Running Bear. This match was later released by the promotion as Best of EWF, Vol. 1 on DVD. _Best of EWF, Vol. 1._ Perf.

He and Wyse were also featured in the NCW Hottie's & Bodies calendar which included Adam Flash, Mike Quackenbush, Greg Matthews, Tom Brandi, Danny Rose and King Kong Bundy. On April 22, 2006, he and The Hungarian Barbarian faced longtime rivals Bad Crew in a 3-way Dance with Romeo Valentino & Cotton The Bad Butcher in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania. This was one of Cotton The Bad Butcher's first matches in over two years since his injury by The Hungarian Barbarian. On November 3, 2007 in York, Pennsylvania, with manager Missy Hyatt, he and Wyse defeated the Bad Crew in a three-way match with Team VD to win the NCW Tag Team Championship. This was the first championship title ever won by Wyse, in his own NCW federation, as well as The Hungarian Barbarian, having previously won the NCW Heavyweight and Hardcore titles, becoming the promotion's first ever triple crown champion.

Polaroid art is a type of alternative photography which consists of modifying an instant picture, usually while it is being developed. The most common types of Polaroid art are the emulsion lift, the Polaroid transfer and SX-70 manipulation. Emulsion lift An emulsion lift, or emulsion transfer, is a process used to remove the photographic emulsion from an instant print by introducing it in warm water. The emulsion can then be transferred to another material, such as glass, wood or paper. It can also be folded, ripped or otherwise customized as desired. This technique can be performed on peel-apart film and Polaroid Originals integral film, but not on Fujifilm Instax film. The procedure to do an emulsion lift involves, for integral type film, cutting off the picture's border, separating the negative layer from the positive layer and submerging the positive layer in warm water. The emulsion will start to become free from the plastic layer and it will float on the water. While it is still wet, it can be placed in another material and shaped. When done with Fujifilm FP-100C, the picture is placed in water near the boiling point and then submerged in cold water. This will release the emulsion, which resembles cellophane and is harder to manipulate than Polaroid emulsions. Polaroid transfer A Polaroid transfer, sometimes known as an image transfer, is a technique used to develop a peel-apart film picture on to a different material, like drawing paper. In a Polaroid transfer, the image is peeled apart prematurely and the negative is placed down on a desired material. A roller is sometimes used to ensure the negative is laying down flat on the material. After a certain amount of time, the negative is peeled back. SX-70 manipulation An SX-70 manipulation. SX-70 manipulation is used to modify SX-70 type integral film pictures while they're being developed. The technique is only possible with the original SX-70 Time Zero film, which was discontinued in 2005, and not with the currently manufactured Polaroid Originals film. When the picture starts development, modifications are performed by applying pressure to it with various tools. By placing the picture above a textured surface, pressure can be used to transfer the texture to the image. As development finishes, the emulsion hardens and it must be softened again by warming it up to continue the manipulation. The technique was used to make the cover of Peter Gabriel's third self-titled album.

The game had not been released in any other territory aside from Japan/Asia. It takes place in the 2050s where a United Nations-created special forces unit called Shadow Sword is deployed to protect the Earth-Mars travel route from anti-UN terrorists called Neo Kleit, conducting terrorist attacks to remove the UN's control of the space program. A special public security surveillance network is unveiled for the first time called Project Surveillance, which is used to assist Shadow Sword operatives in their work in apprehending and hunting down the terrorists. Japanese critics praised the game's animation and use of the gameplay mechanics in telling the story, although it is criticized for little to no involvement of the players themselves. Gameplay Gameplay for Surveillance Kanshisha consists of a main screen with six small ones at the bottom, designated as sub monitors in which players will cycle through them to change the main screen feed. At the right side of the screen is a map used to indicate the camera position in the chapter level. On the bottom left is a character screen in which Tim Lawper will communicate with Yusuke Sasaki. In the first chapter as shown, Lawper is teaching Sasaki how to cycle through the sub monitors to change main screen camera feed.Players will learn how to use the Project Surveillance public security surveillance network in Chapter 1 - 2053: Shadow Sword. Players play the game by assuming the role of Shadow Sword team leader Yusuke Sasaki, who the player use in monitoring cameras of Project Surveillance at a Shadow Sword surveillance truck in the game's six chapters. There are six sub monitor screens with the main screen above them as players would use the latter to observe and analyze to obtain information for the level to progress, especially for Shadow Sword operators to move around and complete their objectives, by using target cursors to mark the main screen for The Surveillance to examine with a map on the right side of the screen for locating subjects of interest and where cameras connected to Project Surveillance are located. Proper use of the cameras and using correct judgement in locating clues and items would determine the fate of the Shadow Sword tactical teams in terms of progressing in Surveillance. At the start of a chapter, there will be one or two sub monitors that will function, allowing players to use them. But as the chapters progress, some of the sub monitors will not function (e.g. due to terrorists discovering and destroying the cameras) while others will be online after the player is informed that a sub monitor is functioning. During a session on the announcement of Surveillance at the 15th Anniversary Production I.G World Tour in Ginza, Production I.G commentators have noted that the gameplay challenges players to use the main monitor and the other six submonitors in order to accomplish a scenario. At the end of each chapter, a chapter report would be presented to show players how well or bad they have done for the particular scenario. According to an interview with the Production I.G staff involved in making Surveillance, they had mentioned that the chapter report would give players the opportunity to check their progress and see what things do they either have to do or to avoid doing in the future. Plot The game takes place in the year 2053 when space travel between Earth and Mars is made possible thanks to the UN's goal to conduct space travel. But with the presence of a mysterious terrorist group called Neo Kleit preparing to oppose to the UN's attempt to expand on space travel, a UN-established counter-terrorist unit called Shadow Sword is called in by the International Cosmic Security System or I-COSS to eliminate the group and protect the space development program and civilians with the help of a high-tech computer surveillance system called Project Surveillance. As Shadow Sword continues to protect civilians in their space travel and hunt down terrorist members of Neo Kleit, the unit gets tangled in a black ops project that involves genetically enhanced creatures with some Shadow Sword operatives killed while trying to find out who was responsible for the project's existence.

The game's cutscenes, which were in MPEG-2 format, made the team decide to move the platform from the PlayStation to the PlayStation 2 due to issues of the former's loading capabilities as the cutscenes are at least 5 hours and 30 minutes long according to Yamamoto. In addition, they had used real photos of Mars and Phobos as part of the cutscenes. News IGN had first broke news of the possibility of the game based on the Yarudora series. On August 31, 2001, Sony Computer Entertainment made an official announcement that Surveillance Kanshisha would be created for the PlayStation 2 with Production I.G working on the animation for the game. In the 15th Anniversary Production I.G World Tour 2002 in Ginza on April 20 and April 21 of 2002, Surveillance had been unveiled by Production I.G with guests including Mamoru Oshii when the game was announced for a 2002 release. Promotion Official promotional Surveillance Kanshisha poster. A movie clip was shown on the internet for free from April 25 to May 14 of 2002 to promote the game to the public from the website of Morrich Club, now a part of Sony Music Online Japan. A Surveillance commercial had aired on SKY PerfecTV! on April 29, 2002 and on TV Tokyo on August 29, 2002. Media A Surveillance Guidebook was released out to the public on May 10, 2002 and was published under Kadokawa Shoten and sold for ¬•1,575. The book included information ranging from the story of the game to the production of the game, including pictures of CG graphics used by Production I.G. Reception A review of the game on Dengeki Online had praised the game for the story and the cutscenes that were done by Production I.G, though it criticizes it for having little to no involvement of the players when they play the game. Another pointed out that the game was good for, particularly, the use of the cameras and the animation except that the scenario used for the game's plot was more than sufficient for players not to understand the story. An article published by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan commented that if the game was animated, the DVDs would have been bought. Furthermore, it also comments on the game's creation was to showcase the capabilities of the PlayStation 2's graphics. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥2 - „Çµ„Éº„É¥„Ç£„É©„É≥„Çπ Áõ£Ë¶ñËÄÖ. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.76. 30 June 2006.

It is a herb rich, site situated near Gunnislake, in East Cornwall, England. History During World War II a US military camp was situated in Sylvia's Meadow which housed only white American armed forces personnel. Black American airmen were billeted in an adjacent field. Since then the land has been left unploughed and unimproved. In this respect Sylvia's Meadow is virtually unique to Cornwall. The meadow was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1992. The reserve is named after a previous owner's daughter. Flora and fauna Sylvia's Meadow is an example of unimproved herb-rich pasture land containing some rare plant species. It is famed for the orchids that grow there, which include the lesser butterfly orchid and heath spotted orchid. Other species found here include: autumn ladies'-tresses, sneezewort, yellow rattle and bird's foot trefoil. Butterflies that may be seen include wall, orange tip, dingy skipper and the common blue. Reptile sightings include the common lizard and the slow worm.

The spacecraft is operated by DigitalGlobe. With a maximum resolution of , WorldView-4 provides similar imagery as WorldView-3, the highest resolution commercially available at the time of its launch. The spacecraft suffered a failure in one of its control moment gyroscopes in January 2019, and operations were unable to be recovered.  History  Work on GeoEye-2 began in October 2007 when commercial imagery company GeoEye selected ITT Corporation to begin work on long lead-time items for the satellite camera system. In March 2010, an initial contract for construction of the spacecraft was awarded to Lockheed Martin Space Systems, which previously built the Ikonos imaging satellite. At the time, GeoEye-2 was planned for launch in late 2012. The spacecraft's preliminary design review was completed in November 2010, while its critical design review was completed in June 2011. Lockheed Martin issued a contract to ITT Corporation in August 2010 to continue work on the camera system, and the company announced the completion of the system's critical design review on 1 March 2011. The system was delivered to Lockheed Martin in April 2012, and was mated to the spacecraft bus the following month. DigitalGlobe agreed to purchase GeoEye in July 2012, and finalized the merger in January 2013. At the time, each company had a satellite being prepared for launch: WorldView-3 and GeoEye-2. Because WorldView-3 offered multiple short- wavelength infrared channels in addition to the standard panchromatic and multiwavelength channels, the company chose to proceed with its launch and to place GeoEye-2 into storage. In July 2014, DigitalGlobe announced that GeoEye-2 had been renamed to WorldView-4 to better match the company's branding, and that, due to a projected increase in product demand, the spacecraft's launch had been scheduled for mid-2016. The total cost of the spacecraft, including insurance and launch, is estimated at . The first public image from WorldView-4 was taken on 26 November 2016 and released on 2 December. In January 2019, WorldView-4 was announced to have suffered a failure in one of its control moment gyroscopes, and is considered no longer usable. WorldView-4 was insured against satellite failure, and in spring 2019 the company owning the satellite, Maxar, which had acquired DigitalGlobe in 2017, announced that they had received the full insurance payment.  Launch  WorldView-4 launches aboard an Atlas V rocket WorldView-4 was launched on 11 November 2016 at 18:30:33 UTC from Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3E aboard an Atlas V rocket. The rocket launched in the 401 configuration with serial number AV-062, and was provided and administered by United Launch Alliance. This is the same rocket that had been scheduled to launch the InSight Mars lander, which was delayed until 2018. The rocket had been erected at the Vandenberg launch pad on 16 December 2015 for the InSight mission; after the WorldView-4 mission took the place of InSight, the rocket was allowed to remain vertical at the pad protected by its mobile service tower. The WorldView-4 payload was fixed atop the rocket during the second week of September 2016. Originally scheduled for launch on 29 June 2016, the flight was rescheduled to 15 September and then to 16 September. During countdown on 16 September, the launch was scrubbed due to a liquid hydrogen leak in the ground support equipment resulting in an ice ball forming on an umbilical cable. The launch was rescheduled for 18 September to allow for the replacement of a fill-and-drain valve, determined to be the cause of the leak. The Canyon Fire, a wildfire that burned over on the southern section of Vandenberg, resulted in a further launch delay so that the base could \\"concentrate resources on the situation at hand.\\" As a result of scheduling availability on the Western Range, the flight was rescheduled for 26 September. Continued efforts in fighting the Canyon Fire caused an indeterminate delay of the launch to no earlier than October 2016. Four additional fires of varying sizes broke out between 22 and 27 September; while all were contained by the end of the 27th, base commander John Moss stated that until all facilities and instrumentation could be surveyed, no preliminary launch date could be determined. Repairs were made to the base's infrastructure affected by the wildfire, including power and communications, and the launch date was reset to 6 November. The date was later pushed back to 11 November as ULA worked to fix \\"minor Atlas V booster issues\\" found during preparations.  Instrument  The spacecraft's telescope is called the GeoEye Imaging System-2, also known as SpaceView 110, which was designed and built by ITT Corporation (later ITT Exelis and Harris). The telescope mirror is in diameter. It provides panchromatic images at a highest resolution of between 450 and 800 nanometers, and multispectral images at in blue, green, red and near-infrared channels (450-510 nm, 510-580 nm, 655-690 nm and 780-920 nm, respectively).
